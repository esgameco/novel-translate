        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 344 An Otherworldly Place (5000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Is this the feeling of completely mastering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will soared high, overlooking the entire secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether the indigenous lifeforms or the ninth-rank xenobeings, with just a thought, he could unleash the power of the secret realm to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>Within the secret realm, even tenth or eleventh-rank lifeforms could not resist Lin Yuan's killing intent. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the Xuanhuang Secret Realm only allowed the invincible eighth-rank and ninth-rank lifeforms to enter, so there was no threat from tenth or eleventh-rank lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Now, if I wish, I can leave the secret realm at any time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm had an entrance but no exit. To leave, one had to wait until the secret realm opened again after a hundred years and be in the outer area when it was about to close. At a specific time, one would then be expelled from the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>But now that Lin Yuan was the master of the secret realm, he was naturally not bound by such rules. He could leave or enter as he wished.</p><p></p><p>"I might as well leave the secret realm together with the main force," Lin Yuan was in no hurry.</p><p></p><p>He did not know if there were any supreme experts paying attention outside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm at the moment. Even if he left the secret realm stealthily, it was still better to be cautious when facing supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was carefully observing every corner of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, a six-armed figure appeared beside him and bowed slightly, "Master."</p><p></p><p>He was the "consciousness" of this secret realm. Since Lin Yuan had refined the secret realm, he had become his master.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current authority, he could completely erase the six-armed figure and then operate the secret realm to give birth to a new realm consciousness. However, there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>"Master, cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Body' requires a large amount of Xuanhuang crystals," the six-armed figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan had completely refined the core of the secret realm, he still had control over it and knew how many Xuanhuang crystals Lin Yuan had used.</p><p></p><p>"There are many Xuanhuang beasts raised within the secret realm. They are condensed from the power of the entire secret realm. If Master needs Xuanhuang crystals, harvest those Xuanhuang beasts, but do not harvest too many at once," the six-armed figure said cautiously after a moment's hesitation.</p><p></p><p>If it were not to replenish the source of the secret realm, how could the Xuanhuang crystals accumulated over countless millions of years in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm be only the size of a small hill? At least it should be millions or tens of millions times larger than that small hill.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that most of the Xuanhuang crystals had dissipated on their own, returning to the source of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Xuanhuang beasts were the indigenous lifeforms within the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>He understood the six-armed figure's concern very well. With his current control over the secret realm, killing those Xuanhuang beasts and taking their Xuanhuang crystals was even simpler than eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>Even if he killed all the indigenous lifeforms in the entire secret realm, it would not take him much time.</p><p></p><p>However, doing so would inevitably cause the secret realm to weaken and even begin to collapse within a million years.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the secret realm would not cause any irreversible loss for Lin Yuan as the master.</p><p></p><p>But for the six-armed figure, it would be a complete and utter death.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Lin Yuan would not do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>The sustainable development of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was far more important than draining the pond to catch all the fish.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would become Lin Yuan's lifesaving method second only to the Dimensional Gate.</p><p></p><p>Even if an extreme situation arose in the future where Lin Yuan was hunted by a group of supreme experts, and all other escape methods failed, he could still hide in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Over the countless years, those supreme experts in the main cosmos had watched the Xuanhuang Secret Realm open so many times, proving that they could not do anything to the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan hid inside, it would be absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the "physical traversal" across dimensions and realms through the Dimensional Gate, entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm did not require the expenditure of any dimensional power. Lin Yuan could enter with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the "physical traversal" of the Dimensional Gate had too many hidden dangers. Displaying that power of breaking through dimensions and realms in front of a supreme expert would probably drive them crazy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could isolate the inner and outer karmic forces.</p><p></p><p>As long as one was inside the secret realm, the supreme experts outside could not sense the related karmic forces. Only powerful beings within the secret realm could sense them.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened, the strongest being of the Tianyu race, Hunxi, pursued Lin Yuan and asked the Maduoxinger to sense Lin Yuan's karmic forces and lock onto his location.</p><p></p><p>This was because Maduoxinger was also inside the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan left a clone behind, or more precisely, a drop of his blood essence inside the secret realm, under the isolation of karmic forces, any killing curses would not be able to completely kill Lin Yuan, even supreme experts could not do it.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, the value of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm far exceeded those Xuanhuang crystals.</p><p></p><p>Especially for a force, it was an absolutely safe "nest."</p><p></p><p>"Now, if I wish, I can establish a force," a thought flickered in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He had so many bloodline evolution elixirs in his possession. After this secret realm closed, he could harvest another large batch. Combined with the right to establish a "human" family prefix after advancing to eighth-rank citizen, as well as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm as a backyard garden, Lin Yuan had all the prerequisites to establish a terrifying force with profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was the lack of trusted subordinates, because Lin Yuan had not spent enough time in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had no interest in procreating offspring, which was why the Lin family still had so few members.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow," Lin Yuan's thoughts retracted. He had no interest in establishing a force, but as he grew stronger, it would become a necessity.</p><p></p><p>For example, as the Galactic Lord now, Lin Yuan had quite a few followers, which could be considered the embryonic form of a force.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should you try to cross into the tenth rank next?" the six-armed figure tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had now reached the pinnacle of the ninth rank in all aspects, exceeding the peak defined by the myriad races of the main cosmos by an unknown amount.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to make another significant improvement in his strength, he would have to cross into the tenth rank.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now that this period of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had come to an end, crossing into the tenth rank was indeed Lin Yuan's main goal going forward.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty once said that to become the ultimate, one needs to integrate as many rules as possible during the tenth and eleventh ranks. If one can comprehend the Chaos Rules before attempting to become the ultimate, it would be of great benefit," the six-armed figure thought for a moment before cautiously saying.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Rules?" Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Chaos Rules referred to the fusion of all rules, returning to the origin, which was chaos.</p><p></p><p>In the era of the Xuanhuang Sovereign, there was no spread of personal evolution paths, so to cross into the realm of supreme experts, one could only rely on oneself and utilize all available means.</p><p></p><p>Normally, integrating the rules of time and space was the threshold for crossing into the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Even in the era of the Xuanhuang Sovereign, it was just a legend. No lifeform had been heard of accomplishing it; it was only a theoretical method.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it was comprehending the Chaos Rules or spreading one's personal evolution path, both would aid in attempting to become the ultimate. Even without these, it was still possible to attempt to become the ultimate, just with a lower success rate.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanhuang Sovereign crossed into the ultimate realm and became a supreme expert, he had exhausted all means and was also quite fortunate.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just because other lifeforms could not do it did not mean Lin Yuan could not. With his extraordinary comprehension, even comprehending the Chaos Rules was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>At least, this was the only method Lin Yuan had heard of that would greatly benefit his attempt to become the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that even spreading one's personal evolution path would only be beneficial, not greatly beneficial, for the leap to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the difficulty of the two was not on the same level. Spreading one's personal evolution path was clearly a bit easier.</p><p></p><p>"However, spreading one's personal evolution path not only helps in the attempt to become the ultimate but also aids in cultivation after crossing into the twelfth rank, stabilizing one's existential imprint," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he would not give up spreading the Dao. Not only would he spread his personal evolution path in the main cosmos, but also in other dimensions and realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a vague feeling that propagating his "Way" throughout the myriad heavens and realms would bring him boundless benefits in the future.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, the wedding of Lin Yi and Xia Qiran had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>With the influence of the human Xia family and the Galactic Lord, this wedding had caused quite a stir in human civilization. Countless "internet celebrities" and "live streamers" in the virtual worlds had come to...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It cost a great deal to be able to participate in the wedding ceremony. </p><p></p><p>New69bookbars.com</p><p></p><p>After the wedding ceremony ended, Lin Yuan held a separate gathering with some of the tenth-stage evolved beings who had attended the wedding.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I've long heard of the great reputation of the Galactic Star Lord, and today I finally get to meet you," a one-armed man laughed heartily. </p><p></p><p>His left sleeve fluttered empty, with only his right arm remaining. With human civilization's technology, not to mention just losing a hand, even if only a brain remained, it would be easy to replicate a complete body.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the one-armed man was a tenth-stage evolved being - regrowing his left arm would be extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>However, the one-armed man's left hand had been cut off by a powerful enemy from the insect race. </p><p></p><p>Since then, the one-armed man had not allowed his lost arm to regrow, using it as a reminder to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the tenth stage level, what was being compared was the collision between fused rules. Whether one had an arm or not made no difference.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard of the Black Star Lord's reputation," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The one-armed man was named the Black Star Lord, of course just a codename, just like Lin Yuan's Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord was an extremely terrifying tenth-stage powerful being who had long been on the "Grade A" threat list.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Black Star Lord hailed from the Black Source Spire, one of the nine evolution spires.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord, it's a pleasure to meet you for the first time," a green-haired woman smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Star Lord, when you were peerless in our human civilization for an era, I hadn't even been born yet," Lin Yuan sighed. "In the past, I used to look up to the Jade Star Lord as my goal."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Star Lord was likewise a peerless genius of a certain era of human civilization, possessing a rare special physique, with her bloodline power being extraordinarily potent. Due to various factors, the Jade Star Lord stood out from the first stage all the way to the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>The number of spatial layers the Jade Star Lord had opened at the ninth stage approached six hundred million layers, making her the strongest ninth-stage being among the myriad races of the universe at that time.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the tenth stage, in less than a hundred million years, the Jade Star Lord had reached the "Grade A" level.</p><p></p><p>"Taking me as your goal?" The Jade Star Lord sighed. "The Galactic Star Lord really does like to joke around."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the number of spatial layers the Galactic Star Lord has opened is several times that of Jade's, if you say that, Jade won't be able to stand properly," an emaciated, skeletal old man chuckled.</p><p></p><p>He too was a "Grade A" tenth-stage being who had shone in an era of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the dozens of tenth-stage beings present at the gathering. The weakest among them were "Grade B" tenth-stage beings, all great figures of human civilization who had the hope of crossing into the eleventh stage in the future.</p><p></p><p>Among everyone present, Lin Yuan's strength was undoubtedly the lowest, only at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>But not a single tenth-stage being dared to look down on Lin Yuan. Given the prowess the Galactic Star Lord had displayed in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm, crossing into the tenth stage was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>He would rapidly advance into the "Grade A" realm, becoming the strongest existence below eleventh-stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the many tenth-stage evolved beings present treated Lin Yuan very amicably.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord's talents and innate abilities are truly enviable," the skeletal old man said with a hint of wistfulness in his tone.</p><p></p><p>For prodigies like the Jade Star Lord with special physiques, powerful bloodlines, and even the offspring of supremely powerful beings, he did not envy them as much. But the Galactic Star Lord? Up until now, the Galactic Star Lord had not displayed any signs of a powerful bloodline or special physique.</p><p></p><p>Even his teacher was just the invincible eighth-stage Crimson Leviathan Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>For the Galactic Star Lord to have come this far relied solely on his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>"Talents and innate abilities are only temporary. To strive for the ultimate, no matter how strong one's talents are, they are useless," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The many tenth-stage lifeforms present all had the hope of crossing into the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>Since they were all eleventh-stage beings, they naturally yearned to pursue becoming the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of eleventh-stage lifeforms could not even attempt to reach the ultimate realm, let alone become the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>To cross into that realm was simply too difficult. No matter how profound one's foundations were, without the key element of luck, one would still fail in the attempt.</p><p></p><p>If an eleventh-stage lifeform failed in their attempt to reach the ultimate realm, that would be a complete and utter death, from which even supremely powerful beings could not revive them.</p><p></p><p>After the many tenth-stage evolved beings chatted idly for a while, the Black Star Lord looked towards Lin Yuan and smiled, "After crossing into the tenth stage, the Galactic Star Lord will consider entering the 'Realm Beyond Worlds', right?"</p><p></p><p>"The Realm Beyond Worlds..." Lin Yuan's expression turned somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Beyond Worlds did not exist in the main universe; it was one of the most important foundations of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>How was the human civilization, which had only been around for a little over two hundred million years, able to produce so many tenth-stage and even eleventh-stage powerful beings?</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind that not only tenth and eleventh stage beings, but even eighth-stage lifeforms could easily live for two to three hundred million years. The confirmed maximum lifespan for eighth-stage beings in the Magic Jade Tower was even five hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "maximum lifespan" here referred to a lifespan that could be widely achieved. Some special lifeforms within the universe, such as the "Children of the Tree Realm", had far longer lifespans.</p><p></p><p>Even so, eighth-stage evolved beings could live for two to three hundred million years, not to mention ninth and tenth stage beings. After eleventh-stage powerful beings comprehended the complete time rules, they could even achieve a form of "alternative" immortality.</p><p></p><p>So how was the human civilization, with only a little over two hundred million years of history, able to produce so many powerful beings?</p><p></p><p>One of the reasons was the "Realm Beyond Worlds".</p><p></p><p>The flow of time in the "Realm Beyond Worlds" was far slower than in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>While a year passed in the main universe, it could be tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years passing in the "Realm Beyond Worlds".</p><p></p><p>Although this vast difference in the flow of time would cause the perception of the great dao rules to become blurred, the nine supreme beings of human civilization used another ultimate foundation - the Illusory Realm - to reconstruct the great dao rules of the "Realm Beyond Worlds".</p><p></p><p>Although still far from being as perfect as the infinite rules of the main universe, this at least alleviated the drawback of the blurred perception of the great dao rules to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the blurred perception of the great dao rules was that the flow of time was too fast, making it impossible to clearly sense the great dao rules of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But by reconstructing the great dao rules in the Realm Beyond Worlds, this problem could be resolved to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only to a certain degree. The great dao rules of the Realm Beyond Worlds could never match those of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the rules comprehended in the Realm Beyond Worlds would "shrink" by about two-thirds after returning to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the fact that human civilization possessed so many tenth-stage and eleventh-stage evolved beings was closely tied to the "Realm Beyond Worlds".</p><p></p><p>"I'll think about it when the time comes," Lin Yuan said, showing some interest in the Realm Beyond Worlds.</p><p></p><p>For example, after comprehending the rules of life and death, he could then proceed to fuse them without needing to sense the great dao of the rules during that period.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why human civilization stipulated that only tenth-stage evolved beings could enter the Realm Beyond Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Compared to eighth and ninth stage beings, tenth-stage evolved beings depended far less on perfectly comprehending the great dao of rules.</p><p></p><p>And most crucially, Lin Yuan actually had a way to resolve the shortcomings of the Realm Beyond Worlds.</p><p></p><p>That was through the "Chaos Crystal" from the Magic Jade Space and the "Miniature Universe".</p><p></p><p>Within the Chaos Crystal were myriad fused and divided rules, while the Miniature Universe had a comprehensive balance of rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only needed to bring those two into the Realm Beyond Worlds. By comprehending the essence of the rules within, although there would still be a gap compared to the outside, it would not be a large one.</p><p></p><p>From the gathering with the many tenth-stage evolved beings, Lin Yuan obtained a lot of secret information.</p><p></p><p>This information came from the personal experiences of the tenth-stage evolved beings and was not recorded in detail by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the gathering ended.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world and sat on the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"These tenth-stage evolved beings are all very friendly," Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He also knew that the amiability shown by those "Grade B" and "Grade A" tenth-stage beings was directed at the infinitely promising Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>If it were just an ordinary person, these tenth-stage evolved beings would never be so approachable.</p><p></p><p>Almost all ordinary citizens of human civilization would never have the chance to see a tenth-stage evolved being in their entire lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Within his inner world, the vast world was slowly expanding.</p><p></p><p>It eventually stopped at 1.998 billion square miles in size.</p><p></p><p>"The blue liquid has finally been completely absorbed," Lin Yuan breathed a light sigh of relief. The sixth colored liquid from the mysterious gourd had been exceptionally difficult to absorb.</p><p></p><p>But this was also normal. As his inner world exceeded one billion square miles, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the pressure coming from the universe.</p><p></p><p>An inner world of one billion square miles had already surpassed the limit allowed by the universe. Even for those unique, special lifeforms, their inner worlds would not exceed a billion square miles.</p><p></p><p>"Onward."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and the grayish-blue gourd appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inverted the gourd, with the mouth facing downward.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, a drop of deep, profound purple liquid condensed. Just looking at it, Lin Yuan could sense a kind of awe-inspiring perfection contained within the purple liquid.</p>

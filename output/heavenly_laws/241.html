            <p>Chapter 241: I'm So Scared (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Virtual Mustard Seed?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Du's expression turned ugly. The scene they witnessed was that the man standing in the starry sky had turned into a giant as tall as the sky.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the man's body size did not change. It was them and the planet under their feet that began to shrink rapidly under the compression of spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>Such a technique could only be mastered by experts with extremely high comprehension of spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>According to the definition of spatial rules by human civilization, one must at least have insight into 1,800 core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, experts who have insight into so many core spatial models are probably at the peak of the 8th level. Ao Du knew all the peak 8th level experts in the Milky Way Star Domain and surrounding star domains. </p><p></p><p>However, that man in green armor was not among them.</p><p></p><p>Ao Du was puzzled, feeling the spatial power pressing from all directions, his scalp tingling a little.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh nearby immediately recognized him.</p><p></p><p>It knew a lot of information about the Milky Way Star Lord, including relevant images. The "giant" standing outside the sky at the moment had a face very similar to the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party just said, "Tell me, if the Milky Way Star Lord dares to come, what do you plan to do?"</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh could almost be certain that the other party was the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Du was a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and looked at the huge mound of flesh with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that the Milky Way Star Lord had just entered the 8th level? How could he turn a planet of nearly ten million miles into a meson with a wave of his hand?</p><p></p><p>Such spatial comprehension, even peak 8th level experts might not be able to achieve, yet the Milky Way Star Lord who had just entered the 8th level did it?</p><p></p><p>"Star Alliance, Shang Shan, greetings to the Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh said with a hint of respect, without paying attention to Ao Du's disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Although it was also difficult for it to understand why the Milky Way Star Lord would have such powerful strength, now was not the time to dwell on these matters.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was to ease the atmosphere between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>"Star Alliance, Ao Du, greetings to the Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ao Du immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>"You special lifeforms, relying on your noble bloodline, are lawless one by one. Now this star domain is the territory of human civilization, yet you wantonly devour planets..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said in an indifferent tone, "Do you really think we humans are the same as the Shadow Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Clan was very tolerant of these special lifeforms. One reason was that they were unwilling to offend the forces behind these special lifeforms, and the other was that these special lifeforms themselves were not easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>So under normal circumstances, the Shadow Clan's experts would turn a blind eye. For example, Ao Du liked to devour planets, as long as it wasn't too excessive, they wouldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>The expression of the huge mound of flesh changed slightly. Through these words, it could hear that this Milky Way Star Lord was somewhat displeased with their actions.</p><p></p><p>"From this day on, we will obediently leave and absolutely will not appear in front of the Milky Way Star Lord again."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh "Shang Shan" immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Milky Way Star Lord was really just at the initial 8th level, after learning his attitude, the best choice for the two special lifeforms was to leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the lord of the star domain, the Milky Way Star Lord had many ways to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Call friends for help? </p><p></p><p>Ask the teacher to intervene?</p><p></p><p>Those were all options.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strength displayed by the Milky Way Star Lord now was not inferior to the peak of the 8th level. His malice was not something the two special lifeforms could bear.</p><p></p><p>"After devouring so many of my planets, you want to leave so easily?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, and with a thought, the huge power pressed down on the planet in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power swept across the surface of the planet. Lin Yuan still held back, otherwise this planet would have collapsed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh suddenly expanded in size, struggling to resist the crushing power from all directions. However, "Shang Shan" had a premonition that it couldn't hold on for long.</p><p></p><p>"This Milky Way Star Lord, how can he be so abnormal? This is called just entering the 8th level? This is called under a hundred years old?"</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh "Shang Shan" felt bitter inside.</p><p></p><p>It glanced at Ao Du not far away. The other party was also forced to reveal its true form.</p><p></p><p>However, under the Milky Way Star Lord's Virtual Mustard Seed technique, the true form that Ao Du transformed into was only the size of a little finger, without any of the majesty of a special lifeform, but rather a bit cute.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>After persisting for more than ten breaths, the huge mound of flesh "Shang Shan" spoke again, "I am willing to pay 20,000 cubic universe crystals to make up for the Star Lord's losses."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh felt bitter in its heart. </p><p></p><p>The planets it devoured were basically done when the Shadow Clan ruled this star domain. But there was no choice, now the Milky Way Star Lord had the final say.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also willing."</p><p></p><p>It also couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p></p><p>"20,000 cubic universe crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the two special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Normal 8th level experts probably possessed several thousand to 10,000 universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>Human 8th level Transformers were a bit more affluent, but not by much, at most just over 10,000.</p><p></p><p>But these two special lifeforms directly offered to take out 20,000 cubic universe crystals in one breath, obviously both quite extravagant.</p><p></p><p>This was normal too. Special lifeforms had long lifespans and many innate abilities and means. Accumulating over a long time, naturally each was extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>"How about it, Milky Way Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"20,000 cubic universe crystals is enough to compensate you."</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh "Shang Shan" felt its heart bleeding. It had cultivated the art of avatar, with its true body in a distant other star domain. But now this avatar that it had condensed for many years, its combat power was already close to the true body.</p><p></p><p>If it perished, who knew how many years it would take to condense an avatar of this level again.</p><p></p><p>"As long as this avatar can be preserved, paying some universe crystals is acceptable." The huge mound of flesh secretly thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, how much had it invested in this avatar? Far more than 20,000 cubic universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not stop, driving the huge world power to continue pressing down.</p><p></p><p>If I kill you, how many universe crystals will still be mine?</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, do you really intend to leave no way out?"</p><p></p><p>The huge mound of flesh "Shang Shan"'s face greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>It was already willing to pay 20,000 cubic universe crystals, yet the Milky Way Star Lord still planned to kill them all?</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, do you know we are members of the Star Alliance? If you want to kill us, have you asked the Star Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Du finally couldn't help but speak.</p><p></p><p>If not as a last resort, it really didn't want to bring up the Star Alliance, as this meant completely tearing off the facade with the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Star Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression did not change. The Star Alliance was formed by many special lifeforms to resist humans, insects...</p><p></p><p>The excerpt appears to be about a powerful alliance called the "Star Space Alliance" formed by various peak races, including the "Ao Du" and "Shang Shan" races.</p><p></p><p>The "Ying" race tolerates the Ao Du and Shang Shan largely because of the Star Space Alliance backing them. However, while the Ying race is wary of the Star Space Alliance, the human civilization is not.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization has many evolved beings who extract the essence of countless special lifeforms to create popular "bloodline potions."</p><p></p><p>When confronted by the protagonist, a "Galaxy Star Lord" named Lin Yuan, the Shang Shan, a massive fleshy mountain lifeform, tries to invoke the name of the Star Space Alliance for protection. However, Lin Yuan laughs it off and attacks.</p><p></p><p>Ao Du is instantly killed, its essence and spatial equipment taken by Lin Yuan. Shang Shan, being more cautious than Ao Du, manages to escape using a costly spatial displacement technique that can instantly move it several light-years away.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's powerful abilities, including a "World Phantom" and "Isolated Space" that far exceed what an 8th-stage peak evolution realm cultivator should possess, allow him to intercept Shang Shan. Begging for mercy, Shang Shan is still killed, but Lin Yuan senses that its true self is still alive somewhere due to karmic connections.</p><p></p><p>It's revealed that the Shang Shan Lin Yuan killed was just a clone that the real Shang Shan, hidden in a distant cosmic secret realm, spent hundreds of thousands of years and countless resources to refine. Lamenting the loss of its clone, treasures, and cosmic crystals, Shang Shan regrets not fleeing with the Ying race earlier. It realizes the new human Galaxy Star Lord is too terrifying to oppose and revenge is unthinkable. The only thing it can do is try to preserve its life.</p>

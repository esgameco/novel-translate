        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 311: The Goddess of Desire (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The area within a radius of 60 million li around Longshan Ridge was almost entirely uninhabited wilderness. </p><p></p><p>At the peak of a mountain thousands of zhang tall, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged alone. The space around him subtly twisted, and a terrifying aura was suppressed within a radius of dozens of zhang.  </p><p></p><p>If he released the suppression, it was estimated that it could instantly sweep an area of hundreds of millions of li in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Among the many bloodlines of the Longshan clan, the 'Mountain Dragon' bloodline is the most obvious and easiest to sense."</p><p></p><p>"So the members of the Longshan clan basically focus on excavating the 'Mountain Dragon' bloodline."  </p><p></p><p>"Over two thousand years ago, the first Viscount of Longshan excavated the Mountain Dragon bloodline to the fifth level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded as he continued to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"But being the easiest to sense does not mean it is the strongest. Over these years, I have almost completely analyzed my own bloodline and discovered that there is still an extremely faint bloodline hidden within."</p><p></p><p>"This bloodline is at least at the ninth level, or even a ninth level peak bloodline approaching the tenth level."</p><p></p><p>For a hundred years, besides recovering his strength, Lin Yuan has also been studying this world's cultivation system.  </p><p></p><p>The so-called knight cultivation method is essentially excavating the latent power deep within one's own bloodline, ultimately achieving "return to the ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Under the restrictions of the laws of heaven and earth, even a sixth-level legendary knight can hardly live past a thousand years. The slow cultivation method of the main universe is clearly no longer suitable for this realm.</p><p></p><p>Excavating one's own bloodline, following the path walked by predecessors, and rapidly breaking through is what conforms to the great trend of this realm.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization of the main world, becoming a fourth or fifth stage cultivator below the age of one hundred is a rare talent unseen on an entire planet or even an entire star domain.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, becoming a fourth or fifth level knight below the age of one hundred? Although not common, it is far from rare.  </p><p></p><p>As long as one has not reached the limit of their bloodline, there are almost no restrictions on excavating its latent power. The only issue is how much latent power of the bloodline can be excavated.</p><p></p><p>"If I want to spread my martial path evolution in this world, I must inevitably make changes. With the original cultivation method, how can it compare to the local knight cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The martial path evolution requires comprehending the rules of the external world, but in this world, the essence of the corresponding rules is already hidden deep within the bloodlines of life.</p><p></p><p>Why bother comprehending the external rules when comprehending the innate rules within the bloodline is faster?</p><p></p><p>Additionally, under the greatly compressed lifespan limit, Lin Yuan has also begun researching bloodlines, localizing the martial path evolution accordingly.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline approaching the tenth level hidden within my body, although faint, over these years of constant refinement, I have roughly figured out where it comes from."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a seven-colored radiant light appeared, faintly emanating a terrifying pressure.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Dragon Race.</p><p></p><p>The strongest life form in this world, born at the inception of this world.</p><p></p><p>It is said that among the twenty-four chief gods residing in the Ocean of Light, one of them is the Seven-Colored Dragon God, the ultimate faith of the dragon bloodlines in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is the Rock Dragon, Mountain Dragon, or Lesser Dragon, the source of their bloodlines is the Seven-Colored Dragon Race.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing the various knight cultivation methods of this realm, even the closely guarded cultivation methods of the imperial royal family, combined with my ninth-level intuition for deduction, while maintaining the core of the martial path evolution system unchanged, I have made it focus primarily on excavating the innate bloodline within the body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The reformed martial path evolution cultivation method can prioritize excavating the most powerful and suitable bloodline within one's body, rather than being limited to a specific knight cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>For example, the Longshan clan's Longshan Cultivation Method can only uncover the "Mountain Dragon" bloodline, while other bloodlines cannot be excavated through it.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's "localized" martial path cultivation method has no such limitation. Perhaps it may not surpass the various knight cultivation methods in specific areas, but it is suitable for every knight or prospective knight.</p><p></p><p>Just this one point alone would allow the martial path cultivation method to rapidly spread in this world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "localized" martial path cultivation method is only suitable for spreading in this world. As for the main universe, if it were not for the laws of heaven and earth greatly limiting one's lifespan...</p><p></p><p>It would naturally be better to comprehend the external rules. Just look at the powerful beings of this world - after becoming demigods, they need to rely on the faith of living beings to uphold their divine realms, which shows this point.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary trailblazers of human civilization in the main universe rely on opening up worlds within their own bodies, without relying on external forces. This allows them to go further and have fewer hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that after excavating this Seven-Colored Dragon bloodline, it has indeed made my physical body sixty percent stronger. The path of bloodline cultivation also has its merits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin. Here, the sixty percent refers to the base strength of his physical body, without any amplifications. It is equivalent to the enhancement from bathing once in the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan could sense that his excavation of the Seven-Colored Dragon bloodline had not yet reached its limit. The deeper he excavated, the greater the enhancement to his physical body would be.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past hundred years, I have also re-opened the world within my body, crossing into the eighth stage. I only need to accumulate to the eighth stage peak, and I can naturally cross into the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan restrained his aura and stood up from the mountain peak.  </p><p></p><p>According to the comparison of realms between this world and the main world, the eighth stage is equivalent to an uplifted divine spirit.</p><p></p><p>And once a divine spirit uplifts their divine realm, they will inevitably enter the Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss.  </p><p></p><p>Under the covenant of the twenty-four chief gods, divine spirits' true forms are not allowed to linger in the mortal realm, as that would affect living beings - something the gods, whose foundations are the faith of living beings, cannot afford.</p><p></p><p>In other words, with Lin Yuan's current strength, he can already be considered invincible in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's still not enough. Although the gods will not appear in the mortal realm, it does not mean they cannot descend upon it. They are simply restricted by the twenty-four most powerful chief gods. I still need to cultivate discreetly. Once I return to the ninth stage, I will fear nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.  </p><p></p><p>This time returning to the eighth stage held no suspense for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The only surprise was the physical body divine ability he awakened this time.</p><p></p><p>The Element Body.</p><p></p><p>Able to be immune to ninety percent of all elemental attacks from the same realm.  </p><p></p><p>The so-called elements are the interpretations of this world. In the main universe, they would be rules.</p><p></p><p>Elemental attacks.</p><p></p><p>Attacks of rules.</p><p></p><p>The same strike, with a power of ten.</p><p></p><p>But if amplified by rules, the power could reach one thousand or even one million.</p><p></p><p>Being immune to ninety percent of rule attacks directly puts Lin Yuan in an almost undefeatable position among ninth stage evolutionaries.  </p><p></p><p>Unless aided by external forces, which ninth stage evolutionary could kill Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention killing, even just injuring Lin Yuan would be extremely difficult, let alone Lin Yuan having the Blood Rebirth divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Acquiring divine abilities, any injuries would recover instantly. </p><p></p><p>The elemental body was immune to conventional attacks, and this did not overlap with the defenses provided by treasured artifacts, meaning the two could stack completely.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this divine ability could grow along with Lin Yuan's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan reached the 9th level, he could be immune to 90% of the power of all conventional attacks at the 9th level.  </p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan reached the 10th level, naturally he could also be immune to 90% of the power of all conventional attacks at the 10th level.</p><p></p><p>"Monstrous, truly monstrous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly, with this divine ability combined with the blood rebirth technique, it was practically the ultimate defensive ability combination.</p><p></p><p>He ended his cultivation for the day. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to Dragon Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Dragon Mountain clan, powerful knights stood guard on patrol.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader." Upon seeing Lin Yuan appear, a knight immediately respectfully saluted him.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred years, the former Baron of Dragon Mountain had long since passed the baronial title and position of Clan Leader to Lin Yuan. Although Lin Yuan continued to conceal his strength, he had publicly announced breaking through to the 4th level over eighty years ago, becoming the true top fighting force in Dragon Mountain Ridge as well as several nearby baronial territories.</p><p></p><p>The transition of clan power went very smoothly, mainly because Lin Yuan's strength was powerful enough. Many of the previous Barons and Clan Leaders of the Dragon Mountain clan did not have 4th level strength before taking over.  </p><p></p><p>It was only after becoming Clan Leader that they painstakingly broke through to the 4th level by relying on the vast cultivation resources of the clan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan already had definite 4th level strength and the potential to become a 5th level Great Knight before inheriting the position of Clan Leader, making all the clansmen of Dragon Mountain very convinced.</p><p></p><p>"Aling, have you had the clansmen cultivate that practice method?" Sitting on the baronial throne, Lin Yuan asked softly.</p><p></p><p>The "Aling" he referred to was named Dragon Mountain Ling. She had once fervently pursued Lin Yuan, but eventually realized there was no hope and instead devoted her efforts to the trifling matters of the Dragon Mountain clan, earning Lin Yuan's trust.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, that practice method is quite effective. It seems to have no specific bloodline restriction. The squires of our Dragon Mountain clan have cultivated it and even discovered bloodline powers other than the 'Mountain Dragon' bloodline," Dragon Mountain Ling said with a hint of excitement in her tone. </p><p></p><p>She understood too well what such a practice method meant. The method Lin Yuan gave her would automatically discover the most suitable bloodline, not necessarily the 'Mountain Dragon' bloodline.</p><p></p><p>If this practice method spread, it meant the number of knights in the Dragon Mountain clan would explode. The more knights, the stronger the Dragon Mountain clan would become. The stronger they were, the more resources they could obtain to cultivate even more knights - forming a virtuous cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, go ahead and spread it," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts practice method he gave to Dragon Mountain Ling was the "localized" path of martial arts evolution.</p><p></p><p>On this otherworldly journey, besides striving to become stronger, Lin Yuan naturally did not forget to "spread the teachings."</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the pinnacle of power, he needed to make the ultimate leap. The more lives cultivating the path of martial arts evolution, the greater the benefit to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The living beings of this world were the source of faith for the deities. Lin Yuan also wanted a share of that.</p><p></p><p>In any case, there was no strict conflict between the two. Lin Yuan did not need the faith of living beings, he only needed them to cultivate the path of martial arts evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Spread it," Dragon Mountain Ling's heart trembled. She was all too aware of the preciousness of the practice method Lin Yuan entrusted to her.</p><p></p><p>Although spreading it would maximize the strength of the Dragon Mountain clan, it also meant this practice method would inevitably leak out.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the knights of other territories would also obtain this method, diminishing the Dragon Mountain clan's advantage or even putting them on equal footing.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, just do as I say and there won't be any problems," Lin Yuan glanced at Dragon Mountain Ling and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in localizing the path of martial arts evolution was to spread it as much as possible in this world - first fully disseminating it among the Dragon Mountain clan, then letting it spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this would cause the Dragon Mountain clan to become unremarkable among others? With Lin Yuan, the Baron of Dragon Mountain, the future glory of the Dragon Mountain clan would far exceed Dragon Mountain Ling's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Also, are there still people from the 'Desire' Church in Dragon Mountain City?" Lin Yuan asked about a second matter.</p><p></p><p>The 'Desire' Church was one of the half-divine churches severely suppressed by the empire. Over a hundred years ago, it had fled to the vicinity of Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>The original Dragon Mountain Yuan had suffered severe depletion of his primal essence and energy due to his entanglement with the 'Desire' Church.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, Lin Yuan had basically figured out the purpose of the 'Desire' Church - to secretly control the Dragon Mountain clan in order to covertly gather faith for the 'Desire' Mother Goddess behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan obtained, the 'Desire' Mother Goddess was an extremely powerful half-divine being who had escaped the encirclement of the main Order Church several times.</p><p></p><p>Although the deities could not directly interfere in the mortal realm, powerful supreme deities like the Order God could descend divine incarnations capable of wielding power approaching that of true gods.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, the 'Desire' Church had set its sights on Dragon Mountain Yuan, but Lin Yuan's consciousness had descended, directly returning to Dragon Mountain City with no intention of ever going back to Anpu City, causing the 'Desire' Church's plot to fail.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, the 'Desire' Church could only send people to infiltrate Dragon Mountain City to try to get close to Dragon Mountain Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the bewitching vixen who infiltrated Dragon Mountain City ended up waiting fruitlessly for fifty years until she grew old and faded, never managing to get close to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, that bewitching vixen had come close to Lin Yuan several times, but Lin Yuan couldn't be bothered to pay her any attention.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years later, the vixen left dejectedly, but the 'Desire' Church still did not give up on Dragon Mountain Ridge, instead sending a young woman.</p><p></p><p>This time, the 'Desire' Church's goal was not Lin Yuan, but rather the current heirs in line to inherit leadership of the Dragon Mountain clan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw through the 'Desire' Church's intentions with one glance.</p><p></p><p>For an organization like the 'Desire' Church that was wanted by the empire, unless absolutely necessary, they would never take action, lest any trace draw the attention of the Order Church.</p><p></p><p>After realizing they could not get to Lin Yuan, the 'Desire' Church was willing to spend more time, intending to simply wait for Lin Yuan's demise before making their move.</p><p></p><p>"They want to wait me out?" A strange look appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules limiting this world, even 4th or 5th level knights could hardly live past two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, the 'Desire' Church's plot did not have any major flaws, at least when it came to ordinary 4th or 5th level knights.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan? Not to mention his true lifespan, just his sojourn time was one thousand one hundred and ten years. Even if the 'Desire' Church could wait that long, what could they possibly do against Lin Yuan at the peak of his power, capable of slaughtering true gods?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

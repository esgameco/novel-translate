        <h1>Chapter 599</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The barren void between the Yiyun Void Domain and the Anbo Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes, who rarely stopped fighting, carefully observed the glimpse of the cosmic aura that was revealed.</p><p></p><p>The hatred between her and the Great Saint of the Shadow Demon was indeed irreconcilable.</p><p></p><p>But the corner of the universe they had discovered now involved a certain Peerless Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes could not afford to ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Although the Peerless Great Saint was also at the Chaos Realm Perfection level, with the same realm as the Chaos Great Saints, their combat power was far superior to the latter.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, each Peerless Great Saint had explored and gained much understanding of breaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Great Saints had scoured the Chaos Void, searching for the traces of the Thirteenth Realm time life, and had gained some harvests, to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>These harvests were undoubtedly crucial for the Chaos Great Saints, and could even increase the possibility of their breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Both the Chaos Great Saints and the Peerless Great Saints could breach the Thirteenth Realm, but the latter had made far more preparations, so their chances of success were definitely higher.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, shortly after I just advanced to the Great Saint realm, I discovered a universe opened up by a Peerless Great Saint. This is a great opportunity, a huge opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Shadow Demon was deeply moved. At the Chaos Realm Perfection level, there were not many things that could attract his interest.</p><p></p><p>Resources? The Chaos Great Saints were not lacking in resources, as they had already reached the pinnacle in all aspects, and more resources would not significantly improve them.</p><p></p><p>The combat power of the Peerless Great Saints was stronger than the Chaos Great Saints, but it was not due to resources, but the Chaos Dao they had evolved.</p><p></p><p>Weapons and artifacts? In fact, the Chaos Great Saints were not lacking either, unless they were Thirteenth Realm level weapons and artifacts, otherwise the Chaos Great Saints would not be very interested.</p><p></p><p>For any Chaos Great Saint, the most attractive thing was only one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Breaching the Thirteenth Realm was the goal of every Chaos Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Many Chaos Great Saints had lived through the long history of the universe, and their relatives and friends had basically all died, leaving only the obsession of breaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This universe has already shown signs of collapse, otherwise it would not have been blasted out, even if I had not struck it, after hundreds or thousands of universe cycles, this corner would still have been exposed."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes was also constantly observing.</p><p></p><p>She could clearly perceive that this post-heaven-created universe had an extremely ancient existence, originating from millions of universe cycles ago.</p><p></p><p>"After so many universe cycles, many of the time-spaces within this universe are close to collapse, and it has not been repaired. The one who opened it probably never returned."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes drew many conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Not returning to his own created universe for such a long time? Allowing its internal time-spaces to collapse, there could only be a few possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One is that this Peerless Great Saint is dead.</p><p></p><p>The second is that this Peerless Great Saint has been trying to breach the Thirteenth Realm, but has not succeeded and is trapped in a time loop.</p><p></p><p>The third is that this Peerless Great Saint has reincarnated.</p><p></p><p>Of the three possibilities, the Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes believed the second was closest to the truth.</p><p></p><p>But whichever it is, it means that this Peerless Great Saint will be very difficult to return to the world.</p><p></p><p>Even if it is the third possibility of reincarnation, after such a long time without recovering all his memories and returning to his peak, the chance of him returning to this universe is probably not high.</p><p></p><p>The reincarnation methods of Chaos Realm experts, the hope of recovering in the first life is the greatest, if the first life cannot be recovered, the memories awakened in the second life will be greatly reduced, and the third life, the fourth life will be even more so.</p><p></p><p>Even for a Peerless Great Saint, if he fails to return to his peak in the third life, he will basically not be able to come back, as his memories will be gradually eroded through repeated reincarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenixes, you should also know the importance of this universe. Our grudges can be temporarily set aside, and we can explore this universe together."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Shadow Demon looked at the Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a Peerless Great Saint would leave behind everything before attempting to breach the Thirteenth Realm - their weapons, treasures, insights, and explorations of the Thirteenth Realm, etc.</p><p></p><p>After all, breaching the Thirteenth Realm basically has only two possibilities: success or being trapped in a time loop.</p><p></p><p>If successful, becoming a Thirteenth Realm time life, what they had left behind would be irrelevant, even if others knew about it.</p><p></p><p>If they failed and were trapped in a time loop forever, the weapons, treasures, and insights they left behind would be even more meaningless. In fact, if they could help create a Thirteenth Realm time life, it could even save them from the time loop.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a Thirteenth Realm life can intervene in the time loops of the Perfected Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for a Thirteenth Realm time life, forcibly breaking a certain time loop would require a great price, but it would still be a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>And those Perfected Twelfth Realm experts who are rescued by external forces would be equivalent to losing the opportunity to breach the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Explore together?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenicks looked at the Great Saint of the Shadow Demon.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, even if you kill me, you cannot revive your deceased close relatives. But as long as you reach the Thirteenth Realm, you can revive them by reversing the timeline."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Shadow Demon spoke.</p><p></p><p>Reviving past deceased beings at the Twelfth Realm is based on the time river and the life imprint as the anchor point.</p><p></p><p>So after one's life transcends the Twelfth Realm, and the life imprint breaks free from the time river, they lose the ability to revive the dead.</p><p></p><p>But a Thirteenth Realm time life? They can see the future and past timelines, and the revival methods they can achieve are to reverse the timeline.</p><p></p><p>This revival ability does not require any dependence. As long as something has existed before, it can be revived.</p><p></p><p>"Reach the Thirteenth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes fell silent. The reason she had stopped the fight with the Great Saint of the Shadow Demon was precisely because of this consideration.</p><p></p><p>The post-heaven universe opened up by this Peerless Great Saint most likely contained the Peerless Great Saint's explorations and understandings of breaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as she could obtain it, her hope of breaching the Thirteenth Realm in the future might increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>As for why this Peerless Great Saint had not returned until now, and had probably lost the chance to reach the Thirteenth Realm? Each Chaos Realm Perfected Great Saint was extremely confident, and their paths were all different.</p><p></p><p>Just because this Peerless Great Saint failed in breaching the Thirteenth Realm does not mean she would also fail.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes weighed the pros and cons and finally made a decision in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Any grudges were insignificant compared to the pursuit of breaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Great Saint of the Shadow Demon inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that the Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes would continue to go berserk and ignore this post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>"Then now we'll join forces to shatter this corner of the universe, and then enter."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Shadow Demon spoke. What they were seeing now was only a part of this post-heaven universe, and the entire post-heaven universe was still intact.</p><p></p><p>To enter, they either needed to master the entry method, or forcibly shatter their way in.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes nodded.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>The two Chaos Great Saints unleashed their full power in a joint attack, which was far stronger than the previous strike by the Great Saint of the Nine Phoenixes.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Chaos evolutionary power tore through the space-time, heading towards the exposed corner of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Buzz, buzz, buzz.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>This universe suddenly emanated boundless mysterious energy. The Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes and the Great Saint of Shadows joined forces in a single strike, and were quickly diluted under the protection of the mysterious energy. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>A thick spatial-temporal fluctuation spread in all directions. The strike of the two great saints was like a thunderous blow on an ancient bell, with terrifying sound waves spreading to the endless space-time around.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad."</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint of Shadows and the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes changed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Their joint strike had not even managed to shake this corner of the universe, let alone shatter it.</p><p></p><p>A post-heaven universe that had been established tens of millions of universes ago, its foundation was so terrifying that even the space-time within was on the verge of collapse, easily blocking the strike of these two great saints.</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of power did the supreme great saint who originally established this post-heaven universe possess? But the Great Saint of Shadows and the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes no longer had time to ponder this. The consequences of their joint strike on that corner of the universe had already triggered a terrible spatial-temporal fluctuation ripple.</p><p></p><p>This spatial-temporal fluctuation ripple spread towards the surrounding void domains.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"This kind of spatial-temporal fluctuation?"</p><p></p><p>In various void domains, the Chaos Venerable Ones vaguely sensed it and looked towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"This fluctuating aura? The aura of a universe's fluctuation? A post-heaven universe? The post-heaven universe opened by a supreme great saint?"</p><p></p><p>"A post-heaven universe opened by a supreme great saint must contain many precious treasures and divine weapons left behind by that great saint, even insights that can impact the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity, a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerable Ones had burning gazes. Impacting the Thirteenth Realm was not only the goal of the Chaos Great Saints, even the Venerable Ones who had just entered the Chaos Realm had this desire.</p><p></p><p>And all of this could be found in the post-heaven universe opened by the supreme great saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't obtain the insights for impacting the Thirteenth Realm, the precious treasures and divine weapons left behind by a supreme great saint would still benefit the Chaos Venerable Ones immensely.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>"Let's head there right now."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, some Chaos Venerable Ones couldn't restrain themselves and headed towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this spatial-temporal fluctuation originating from the post-heaven universe also contained the fluctuation of great saint-level power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there should be a Chaos Great Saint beside that post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>But what of it? Normally, Chaos Venerable Ones would not want to offend a great saint.</p><p></p><p>But in the face of an irresistible opportunity, what is a Chaos Great Saint? "A post-heaven universe opened by a supreme great saint"</p><p></p><p>The thick spatial-temporal fluctuation continued to spread, also alarming some Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void, each void domain would have a few Chaos Venerable Ones, but as for Chaos Great Saints? There might not be one even in dozens or hundreds of void domains.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the aura of Shadow Demon and Nine Phoenixes? Those two fellows are indeed lucky, recklessly striking and actually discovering an undiscovered post-heaven universe?"</p><p></p><p>Some Chaos Great Saints had deep gazes, immediately deducing the cause and effect of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The enmity between the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes and the Great Saint of Shadows was no secret at the Chaos Great Saint level.</p><p></p><p>The fights between the two great saints were just watched by other great saints, as long as it didn't affect them, they were too lazy to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Chaos Continent, Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn as he looked at the floating beast hide in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This beast hide was obtained by Lin Yuan from the golden box imprinted with the mark of the Mysterious Yellow lineage.</p><p></p><p>According to the description of the Mysterious Yellow Spiritual Realm's Six-Armed Figure, that golden box was very likely to have passed through the hands of the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The treasures contained within were the precious relics of the Mysterious Yellow lineage.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a map?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan discovered that the source of the change in the beast hide was the map on its surface.</p><p></p><p>"Has the location marked on the map appeared?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, the map on the beast hide was of a mausoleum, and according to the explanation of the Mysterious Yellow Spiritual Realm's Six-Armed Figure, this mausoleum was the mausoleum of the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, the map only covered the area of the mausoleum interior, as for the specific coordinates of this mausoleum, Lin Yuan did not know.</p><p></p><p>Only when this mausoleum appeared, its aura resonating with this map, would he know the location.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan had not placed much hope on this map, after all, who knew when the Mysterious Emperor's mausoleum would appear? It had been silent for millions of universes, and it would probably remain so for millions more.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The change in the map on the beast hide made Lin Yuan infer that this mausoleum of the Mysterious Emperor was likely to have appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Specific spatial-temporal coordinates."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused a thread of his consciousness into the map on the beast hide, vaguely resonating with the mausoleum it corresponded to.</p><p></p><p>"It's over there?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards a direction, his brow furrowing. "It's too far."</p><p></p><p>Even with just a rough resonance, Lin Yuan could sense how incredibly far this mausoleum was from his current location. Even with his current spatial-temporal perception and traveling at full speed through the void, it would still take him at least hundreds of years to reach it.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River."</p><p></p><p>A message came from the Chaos Venerable One, Ancient Ming.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked across, the figure of the Chaos Venerable One, Ancient Ming, coalescing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, only the avatar of Ancient Ming was coalescing, and it was done with Lin Yuan's consent.</p><p></p><p>"A major event has occurred."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming's expression was solemn as he quickly conveyed the information he had just obtained: "Between the Yingyun Void Domain and the Anbo Void Domain, in the desolate void, a post-heaven universe has appeared."</p><p></p><p>How important a post-heaven universe was, it could drive the great saints to frenzy. Once this news spread, it would proliferate with terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>As an experienced Chaos Realm cultivator, Ancient Ming was acquainted with many Venerable Ones and naturally obtained this information.</p><p></p><p>"A post-heaven universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression did not change, but ripples were stirring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The location Ancient Ming mentioned was precisely the spatial-temporal coordinates that Lin Yuan had sensed through the map on the beast hide.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the sudden appearance of the post-heaven universe, Lin Yuan was almost certain that this post-heaven universe was related to the Mysterious Emperor, and might even be the one opened by the Mysterious Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>The mausoleum represented by the map on the beast hide was likely located within this post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>"Now, many Venerable Ones are rushing towards it, including some at the peak of the Chaos Realm, and there may even be Great Saints. If it weren't for that post-heaven universe being so far away from here, I would have wanted to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's very far." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, reaching the desolate void between the Yingyun Void Domain and the Anbo Void Domain would require traveling through the void at full speed for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>For Ancient Ming, it would probably take thousands or even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's too far away. Even if I rush over, the competition would probably be over by then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a while and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the so-called exploration of the Thirteenth Realm by a supreme great saint, it was not something he absolutely had to obtain.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

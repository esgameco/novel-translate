        <h1>Chapter 660</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the gradually dissipating Chaos Fire, his thoughts rippling.</p><p></p><p>To get a Chaos Sage to actively extinguish and disappear was too difficult. To cultivate to the perfect Chaos Realm, how steadfast must one's Dao heart be? Such powerful experts could be killed, could be suppressed, but for them to actively and completely vanish and extinguish themselves was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>When the Mysterious Emperor perished, it was due to the backlash from forcibly breaking free of the time loop, but the Ninth Phoenix Sage? </p><p></p><p>He had willingly walked towards annihilation and destruction right before Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was due to Lin Yuan's strength, but even if they were not opponents, no Chaos Sage would willingly walk towards their own annihilation and destruction.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yuan, even if faced with the lofty Time Life, if he truly had no retreat, he would not surrender meekly, but would definitely resist and struggle.</p><p></p><p>In the time line images seen by the Heavenly Void Cauldron, after Lin Yuan completely destroyed that special place, he actively extinguished his physical body and soul, because he still had the refuge of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>It was not true death.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan could clearly feel that the burning of the Ninth Phoenix Sage was a complete and utter burning, leaving behind not a single item related to his own cause and effect to preserve his life.</p><p></p><p>As for "reincarnation"? Lin Yuan did not sense even the slightest ripple of his spiritual will merging into the Chaos Void Dao rules to undergo reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Ninth Phoenix Sage was heading towards complete death and extinction.</p><p></p><p>"The cause and effect has been resolved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the rapidly dissipating Chaos Fire, feeling that there was not a trace of cause and effect left of the two Chaos Sages.</p><p></p><p>From the premature great destruction of his hometown universe, to the arduous integration of human civilization into the Chaos Void, it was all due to these two Chaos Sages.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had completely perished, the enmity and cause and effect between them had been resolved.</p><p></p><p>Phew~ The Chaos Fire dissipated.</p><p></p><p>A crystal-clear, fiery red crystal appeared there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at it, and his right hand reached out to take the fiery red crystalline stone.</p><p></p><p>The stone contained threads of Chaos Fire within it, though not much, but it was extremely pure.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Dao fruit cultivated by the Ninth Phoenix Sage's entire life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the stone. No matter what being, be it below the Twelfth Rank or Dao Sovereign Mastering Chaos, as long as they fused with this stone, they could quickly embark on the evolutionary path of the Chaos power that the Ninth Phoenix Sage had walked.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, this stone could rapidly create a Chaos Sage.</p><p></p><p>Such a treasure, even Lin Yuan had only heard of, but had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Even the Mysterious Emperor, the Peerless Sage of the Demon Jade Tower, had never seen it.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>It required the peak state of the perfect Chaos Realm, willingly abandoning everything, giving up on breaking through to the Thirteenth Rank, giving up on reincarnation, and so on, in order to have a chance of condensing it.</p><p></p><p>And the most crucial point was that even if a Chaos Sage was willing to do so, in the end, they might not be able to condense such a Dao fruit.</p><p></p><p>"If my Dao can continue, it would not be considered a complete demise."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the fiery red crystal stone in his hand, storing it within his personal universe, and then turned to return to the Milky Way Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Source World.</p><p>Within the Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>The true body and master of the Chaos Void had entered the Chaos Realm, and the true body within this Source World had naturally also entered the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, feeling the surging power within him.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Chaos Realm, the essence of life had undergone a metamorphosis and leap.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again felt that the suppression of the space-time of the Treasure Land on him had become almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>"The Source World's Origin Site"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound, vaguely seeing through the space-time of this Treasure Land, looking deeper into the space-time.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the Treasure Land was that it had broken off from the Source World. If one were to compare the Source World to a towering tree, then the Treasure Land would be the fruit growing on the tree.</p><p></p><p>The fallen fruit, having already severed its connection with the towering tree, were places like the Black Jade's Nest and other Treasure Lands.</p><p></p><p>And this Treasure Land here had just emerged, its relationship with the Source World being both severed and not severed.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's current cultivation, he could perceive the essence of the Source World itself, this towering tree, through this half-severed connection.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ At this moment, a manifestation of the Venerable Yin of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom descended.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial, how have you decided?" The Venerable Yin was somewhat impatient.</p><p></p><p>Ever since six hundred years ago, when he planned to occupy the core celestial pillar of his ancient kingdom and trade with the Silver River Celestial to gain a large amount of benefits.</p><p></p><p>This Silver River Celestial had been constantly considering, saying that such a big matter, he could not decide.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Venerable Yin was still quite understanding, after all, the request he had proposed was indeed excessive, completely worthy of being called a "lion's mouth opening".</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Yin knew that he was opening his lion's mouth, and the Silver River Celestial and the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom also knew that he was opening his lion's mouth, but now, in the situation within the Treasure Land, even if the Silver River Celestial and the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom were unwilling, as long as they wanted to obtain this Treasure Land, they could only let him open his lion's mouth.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Six hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The Silver River Celestial had been saying he was considering it.</p><p></p><p>Originally a simple transaction, but it had been dragged on by the Silver River Celestial for six hundred years?</p><p></p><p>This had completely eroded the Venerable Yin's patience.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the fact that he had proposed conditions to the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom that were far superior to the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom, from the perspective of benefits, the trade with the Silver River Celestial would have gained him more.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Yin would have long since turned to the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom to complete the transaction.</p><p></p><p>"What is there to consider?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Suyin Celestial Sovereign. "What are you considering?"</p><p></p><p>The Suyin Celestial Sovereign was somewhat surprised. "It's been six hundred years, and the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign is actually asking what I'm considering? Could it be that these six hundred years have been in vain for me?" "Milky Way Celestial Sovereign, my patience is limited."</p><p></p><p>The Suyin Celestial Sovereign suppressed the anger in his heart. Although the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign was the strongest Celestial Sovereign, he represented not himself, but the Xuanyin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Celestial Sovereign's frivolous response made the Suyin Celestial Sovereign extremely angry, feeling that he had been deceived.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you have such an attitude towards me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Suyin Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Lin Yuan waved his hand, and a spatial disturbance swept over the Suyin Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Suyin Celestial Sovereign's incarnation was directly shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Celestial Sovereign, you...?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Suyin Celestial Sovereign condensed again, and with his strength, it was simple to condense an incarnation.</p><p></p><p>However, the Suyin Celestial Sovereign who had just condensed looked at Lin Yuan with shocked and angry eyes, somewhat disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>If it were outside the treasure land, he would indeed be punished for speaking to the strongest Celestial Sovereign in this way.</p><p></p><p>But this was within the treasure land, and the Liyang Ancient Country had a request for the Xuanyin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>In this case, why did the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign dare to act so recklessly against his incarnation?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had really given up the fight for this treasure land?</p><p></p><p>But this should not be the case.</p><p></p><p>The Suyin Celestial Sovereign was very clear that although his demands were excessive, from a long-term perspective, they were still beneficial to the Liyang Ancient Country, much better than the Dafu Ancient Country obtaining this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"What I want, I don't need to obtain through a trade." Lin Yuan glanced at the Suyin Celestial Sovereign and said impatiently, "Now hurry and get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Suyin Celestial Sovereign's incarnation exploded again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Suyin Celestial Sovereign did not condense again.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, okay." On the Xuanyin Ancient Country side, the Suyin Celestial Sovereign's gaze was gloomy. The Milky Way Celestial Sovereign's actions and words made him realize that the trade between the two sides was basically impossible.</p><p></p><p>Although the Suyin Celestial Sovereign did not know why the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign was doing this, the most important thing now was to quickly complete the trade with the Dafu Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>If he dragged it on, and the Dafu Ancient Country learned about the situation here, and judged that the Liyang Ancient Country might have given up the fight for this treasure land, the conditions he had proposed would probably be cut by more than half.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Celestial Sovereign, Liyang Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>The Suyin Celestial Sovereign took a deep breath and immediately sent a consciousness to the giant core pillar occupied by the Dafu Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Soon after driving away the Suyin Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Sovereign of the Daliang Ancient Country also descended.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Celestial Sovereign, how have you considered it?" The Lingyu Celestial Sovereign had also come to urge the trade matter. Now that the fight for the treasure land was nearing the later stage, he must want to complete the trade as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"No need to consider it anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Lingyu Celestial Sovereign and said directly, "You can go and trade with the Dafu directly."</p><p></p><p>"You...?" The Lingyu Celestial Sovereign was confused, not knowing why the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign was saying this.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that if the Daliang Ancient Country and the Dafu Ancient Country completed the trade, the number of core pillars refined by the Dafu Ancient Country would form a crushing advantage.</p><p></p><p>The Liyang Ancient Country would have no hope left.</p><p></p><p>In this case, as long as the Milky Way Celestial Sovereign had a little rationality, he would try his best to reach a trade agreement with the Daliang Ancient Country, wouldn't he? "Get lost."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the Lingyu Celestial Sovereign's incarnation immediately disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiran Celestial Sovereign came out, and he was still puzzled why Lin Yuan had to disperse the incarnations of the Suyin Celestial Sovereign and the Lingyu Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>This made the Chiran Celestial Sovereign a little unable to react.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to trade with them anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Chiran Celestial Sovereign and shook his head, saying, "These ancient country Celestial Sovereigns only know how to make demands."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other demands, the complete occupation of 80% to 90% of the output of this treasure land for the next hundred billion years was something Lin Yuan could not accept.</p><p></p><p>"The demands are indeed excessive."</p><p></p><p>The Chiran Celestial Sovereign was silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyin Ancient Country and the Daliang Ancient Country had made outrageous demands, and he could also see that the other Celestial Sovereigns of the Liyang Ancient Country had also seen it, but now, in order to seize the treasure land, they could only agree.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiran Celestial Sovereign wanted to say something else, but suddenly his expression changed. "The Dafu Ancient Country has already completed the trade with the Xuanyin Ancient Country and the Daliang Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>"This is the end now."</p><p></p><p>The Chiran Celestial Sovereign sighed.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the three major ancient countries had completed the trade was not a secret at all, and even the Fuxu Celestial Sovereign had actively spread the news.</p><p></p><p>"These three ancient countries have occupied and refined nearly 180 core pillars, more than half of the total number of core pillars, and with the core pillars of the Leiting Ancient Country..."</p><p></p><p>The Chiran Celestial Sovereign was full of worry, even with a sense of despair: "How can my Liyang Ancient Country compete with the Dafu Ancient Country for this treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>So far, the Chiran Celestial Sovereign could not see any hope, even if the Manhuang Ancient Country and the Liyang Ancient Country joined forces, the number of core pillars they occupied and refined would still be far less than the Dafu.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Chiran Celestial Sovereign and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Just push them over."</p>

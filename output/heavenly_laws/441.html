            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 441: Dominance (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen's confidence came from a supremely powerful weapon that the Insect Race had temporarily lent him.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen was at the fifth level of the eleventh rank, having comprehended the quintuple spatial-temporal boundary insights, possessing the initial ability to refine supremely powerful weapons.  </p><p></p><p>In order to enhance their reserves on the super-large battlefield, the Insect Race began lending out the supremely powerful weapons collected in their treasury as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>It was merely a loan, and they would need to return it afterwards.</p><p></p><p>This supremely powerful weapon was also Tuo Ba Gu Shen's greatest source of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Within the time chamber opened by the Insect Race, Tuo Ba Gu Shen spent thousands of years successfully preliminarily refining that supremely powerful weapon.</p><p></p><p>With the supremely powerful weapon in hand, Tuo Ba Gu Shen dared to mobilize his true original body and accept the Insect Race's invitation.</p><p></p><p>After all, wielding a supremely powerful weapon, Tuo Ba Gu Shen considered himself absolutely safe. As long as the twelfth ranks did not appear, who could kill him while he held a supremely powerful weapon?</p><p></p><p>Even those legendary life forms of the eleventh rank who also wielded supremely powerful weapons could at most suppress and drive him away with the power of the supremely powerful weapons.</p><p></p><p>As for utterly killing him?</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe countless billions of years ago, it had never happened that an eleventh rank wielding a supremely powerful weapon died at the hands of another eleventh rank.</p><p></p><p>"You're sure about this?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient god who reminded Tuo Ba Gu Shen fell silent for a moment. "The supremely powerful weapon is indeed formidable, but the avatar you had in the two-dimensional world also wielded a supremely powerful weapon, yet it still died in the end."</p><p></p><p>"The two-dimensional world is different from the cosmic battlefield," Tuo Ba Gu Shen frowned. "In the two-dimensional world, the might of the supremely powerful weapon could not be unleashed, otherwise that human Blood Rain would never have been able to kill me."</p><p></p><p>Upon saying this, the ancient god who reminded Tuo Ba Gu Shen no longer spoke.</p><p></p><p>He had only advised Tuo Ba Gu Shen, but whether Tuo Ba Gu Shen listened or not was no longer his concern.</p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful weapon was indeed formidable, its life-preserving ability reaching the extreme, but nothing was absolute. For the true original body to enter the super-large battlefield and such places was indeed somewhat risky.</p><p></p><p>Watching this ancient god leave, Tuo Ba Gu Shen continued sensing the supremely powerful weapon within his body.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I assist the Insect Race in gaining an advantage on the super-large battlefield, I can obtain the treasure I desire, which can not only make up for the fundamental damage to my spiritual will, but also hopefully allow me to progress further and reach the perfected eleventh rank."</p><p></p><p>A trace of longing surfaced in Tuo Ba Gu Shen's heart.</p><p></p><p>Not every eleventh rank could reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>Although the fifth level of the eleventh rank could also assault the ultimate, the hope was slim, and it was definitely better to reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>If not for the opening of the super-large battlefield this time, the Insect Race would not have released that treasure. Tuo Ba Gu Shen was clear in his heart that this opportunity might only come once for him.</p><p></p><p>Hence, Tuo Ba Gu Shen dared to mobilize his true original body and accept the Insect Race's invitation, despite the risk.</p><p></p><p>"With the Insect Race's strength, even without my assistance, they still have a chance of gaining an advantage on the battlefield," Tuo Ba Gu Shen thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As one of the pinnacle races of the cosmos, the Insect Race's reserves need no further explanation. Previously in the two-dimensional world, all transcendent powers were suppressed, causing the Insect Race's ability to nurture Insect warriors to be unprecedentedly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the Insect Race's presence was not prominent in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But on the cosmic battlefield? That was the Insect Race's main battlefield, where they could freely nurture powerful Insect warriors.</p><p></p><p>They could even nurture billions upon billions of Insect warriors in advance, and then bring them in.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen even felt that he only needed to go through the motions on the battlefield, and the</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>She could finally obtain the treasure she had longed for.</p><p></p><p>"This time on the battlefield, if I encounter that human 'Blood Rain' again, I'll retreat directly." Tuoba Gushen had no intention of taking revenge. </p><p></p><p>In his view, the human Blood Rain was most likely a fully evolved eleventh-stage being of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This time on the super large alien battlefield, the human Blood Rain would certainly wield the strongest weapons. Even though he had the ability to survive, there was no need for him to contend with the other party.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Galactic Sovereign has also reached the eleventh stage."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the human Blood Rain, Tuoba Gushen associated it with the Galactic Sovereign. After all, his current situation was largely due to the Galactic Sovereign's doing.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Sovereign had not cultivated so quickly, causing Tuoba Gushen to feel threatened, he would not have agreed to join the large alien battlefield with the insect race, and would not have been absorbed into the two-dimensional world by that white paper.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the eleventh stage in such a short time." Tuoba Gushen could not help but feel envious. As a special life nurtured by the vast cosmos, Tuoba Gushen's talents were unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Galactic Sovereign, he was undoubtedly overshadowed. It took the Galactic Sovereign hundreds of years to reach the tenth stage, while it took Tuoba Gushen millions or even billions of years to reach the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"With such a rapid cultivation speed, his foundation must be unstable, and he has little hope of breaking through to the ultimate realm." Tuoba Gushen's eyes narrowed slightly. "If I encounter him on the super large battlefield this time, I can teach him a profound lesson."</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Sovereign reaching the eleventh stage was not entirely a bad thing. At least Tuoba Gushen felt that the other party was likely to join the super large alien battlefield as well.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Sovereign was only at the tenth stage, under the protection of human civilization, Tuoba Gushen would have no chance to interact with him.</p><p></p><p>But now, Tuoba Gushen had an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Yu clan's domain.</p><p></p><p>At the highest level, the majestic Tian Yu feathered ancestors looked down.</p><p></p><p>Rows of eleventh-stage Tian Yu clan Celestial Lords stood, as the Tian Yu clan also wanted to seize the dominance of the super large battlefield, which represented immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Lord with twenty pairs of wings appeared. She was a woman of perfect appearance, with a sacred aura and a holy crown on her head.</p><p></p><p>"In this super large battlefield, my Tian Yu clan will definitely not disappoint the ancestors."</p><p></p><p>The woman of perfect appearance was named "Tian Yu Meng." To be able to use the words "Tian Yu" as a surname in the clan meant possessing the noblest bloodline, flowing with the blood of the first ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Be wary of the Cosmos race," the first ancestor spoke with a thunderous voice from the highest level.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng nodded. She was the Tian Yu clan's most promising candidate to break through to the ultimate realm. Her bloodline originated from the first ancestor, and this time, she carried the Tian Yu clan's ancestral weaponâ€”</p><p></p><p>The Angel Holy Crown.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng had already planned to make a grand display on the super large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Angel Holy Crown, even among the strongest weapons, was considered top-tier. It was a treasure forged shortly after the birth of the Tian Yu clan's first ancestor, falling from outside the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>To refine this strongest weapon, even a fully evolved eleventh-stage being could not accomplish it. Only someone like Tian Yu Meng, whose veins carried the blood of the first Tian Yu ancestor, could achieve it.</p><p></p><p>This also resulted in the Angel Holy Crown's immense power, surpassing ordinary strongest weapons. The might Tian Yu Meng could unleash was also greater than other fully evolved eleventh-stage beings wielding strongest weapons.</p><p></p><p>The insect race, the Tian Yu clan, for the sake of this super large...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The battlefield had undergone many deployments and schemes. </p><p></p><p>Peak forces like the Yu Clan and the Stellar Alliance were no exception. The victory on the gigantic battlefield would determine the division of resources and secret realms in the universe for the next few hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>Any clan or force attached utmost importance to it.</p><p></p><p>Xia You's Evolution Spire. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Solar Celestial Soul hurried over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, quite a few eleventh-stage evolutionaries had already gathered here, all subordinates under the supreme experts pledged to Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>The nine major evolution spires of human civilization each commanded a portion of evolutionaries, barely constituting factions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, within human civilization, due to the constraints of the three Goddesses and the guidance of the nine supreme experts, there was basically no major conflict. </p><p></p><p>All contradictions and conflicts were resolved in the bud.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord has come too."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan entered Xia You's Evolution Spire, he drew the attention of many eleventh-stage evolutionaries, most of whom had seen him at the recent gathering.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Spire Master Nalan flew over and greeted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Are there many eleventh-stage evolutionaries you don't recognize?" Deputy Spire Master Nalan pulled Lin Yuan to a corner and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded. To become an eleventh-stage evolutionary, one basically had to be an existence of high status and authority in human civilization, having held an eleventh-stage celebration.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan had never participated, he had at least heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"These eleventh-stage evolutionaries were all secretly cultivated by the supreme experts," Deputy Spire Master Nalan said. He had just learned about this not long ago.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. His gaze swept over the many eleventh-stage evolutionaries, and he could vaguely sense the aura of supreme weapons surging within some of them.</p><p></p><p>As long as one reached the fifth level of the eleventh stage, human civilization would basically equip them with a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a loan. When they withdrew from the gigantic battlefield, they would have to return it to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Expert Xia Qin had asked Lin Yuan if he needed a supreme weapon, but Lin Yuan had refused.</p><p></p><p>As for so-called supreme weapons, Lin Yuan already had many. Refining a few more would not improve him much.</p><p></p><p>Rather than wasting them on Lin Yuan, it would be better to let another eleventh-stage fifth-level evolutionary be equipped with one.</p><p></p><p>Next, more and more eleventh-stage evolutionaries came up and greeted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They were all evolutionaries of Xia You's Evolution Spire, so it was normal for them to be close to each other.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another month went by.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A majestic figure condensed, emanating the oppressive might of a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme expert."</p><p></p><p>All the eleventh-stage evolutionaries present stood up and looked towards the manifested Supreme Expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time," Xia Qin said, surveying his surroundings. "I don't need to emphasize the importance of the gigantic battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"Now, let me assign roles."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin paused for a moment before continuing, "This time, all the eleventh-stage evolutionaries of my Xia You Evolution Spire will follow the command of one person on the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>When it came to warfare between clans, unless one was as powerful as the twelfth stage, one still needed to follow orders and commands in order to unleash the greatest strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's tone was calm as his gaze fell on Lin Yuan in the corner.</p><p></p><p>Upon these words, the many eleventh-stage evolutionaries present were stunned, looking towards the Galactic Star Lord who had just broken through to the eleventh stage.</p>

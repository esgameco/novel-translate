"This kind of celestial phenomenon fluctuation is the strongest I've ever seen. The treasures inside are at least comparable to ten-star cosmic rarities, or even reaching the level of ten-star top-grade items."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan had experienced entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm many times and had seen quite a few opportunity lands emerge, so she was quite knowledgeable about this. The moment she sensed the celestial phenomenon fluctuation, she judged its value to be roughly correct. ‚ï∞‚òÜ‚òÜ ‚ùª‚ûàùïäùêáùêÆ‚ìß.ùì¨ÔΩèÁà™ ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚ïÆ</p><p></p><p>"Ten-star or even ten-star top-grade cosmic rarities?" Lin Yuan was also somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>The World Tree was only an eleven-star top-grade item. Now, the treasures in the distant opportunity land might reach the level of ten-star top-grade?</p><p></p><p>Treasures of this level were extremely rare even in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, and they might not even be born every time the secret realm opened.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan and Xi Lan were observing from within layers of space,</p><p></p><p>Two powerful auras instantly penetrated countless layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!!!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, this opportunity land is mine." Accompanied by a terrifying laughter, a tall figure in a black robe appeared above the opportunity land.</p><p></p><p>He lightly reached out his right hand and took out a treasure emitting a hazy gray aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Yuan and Xi Lan's hearts trembled. The aura fluctuations released by this tall figure in a black robe far exceeded the 9th stage millions layer realm. The spatial layers he had opened were at least over 20 million.</p><p></p><p>"That treasure, I seem to see a starry river gestating within it," Xi Lan murmured to herself.</p><p></p><p>The main universe did not have similar treasures to this one. However, for it to attract such a powerful figure who had opened spatial layers reaching 20 million to personally take action, its value must be immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's resistance to treasures was much stronger than Xi Lan's.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the treasure had been taken, he immediately prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this time, that powerful figure's attention should still be on the treasure. Leaving now shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Right."</p><p></p><p>"We need to hurry."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan also reacted.</p><p></p><p>Although she was unsure of the identity of that black-robed powerful figure, Xi Lan was certain he was not a human evolver.</p><p></p><p>If he were a human evolver, he would have long triggered a reaction from the black disc.</p><p></p><p>This was a treasure given by human civilization to every human evolver to mutually confirm each other's identities and locations in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since he was not a human evolver, if he discovered Lin Yuan and Xi Lan nearby, he probably wouldn't mind gaining some extra income.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan tried her best to calm the fluctuations between the spatial layers and quickly led Lin Yuan away in another direction.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment,</p><p></p><p>Another aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, another figure bathed in a milky white aura appeared, looking somewhat dissatisfied at the black-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>"Still one step too late."</p><p></p><p>The figure bathed in milky white aura frowned, not making a move to snatch the treasure.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure's strength was not inferior to his. Even if he took action, he wouldn't be able to snatch it. At most, it would just be venting frustration, utterly meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Hun Yi, I'll be leaving first. The most valuable treasure in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time should be mine."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure laughed heartily as his figure disappeared again,</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind only 'Hun Yi' standing in his original spot, his entire body bathed in a milky white aura, with twelve pairs of wings behind his back.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest 9th stage expert of the Celestial Wing Race, the paramount race of the universe, in this generation, Hun Yi's gains in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time were not great.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Lord he most wanted to find was hiding like a rat, who knows where.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi's perception spread out in all directions, penetrating layers of space, planning to randomly catch a few ants to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi's expression changed slightly as he looked in a direction.</p><p></p><p>This direction was precisely the direction Xi Lan and Lin Yuan were fleeing in.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of humans... Galaxy Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi's spirit lifted. The twelve pairs of pure white wings behind his back lightly spread and his figure vanished from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry."</p><p></p><p>"The powerful figure that came from behind is likely 'Hun Yi' of the Celestial Wing Race."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's expression was solemn. She didn't recognize the figure in the black robe, but the figure that appeared later, shrouded in a milky white aura, very likely came from the Celestial Wing Race.</p><p></p><p>And among the many powerful experts of the Celestial Wing Race who entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time, the one with such strength was most probably 'Hun Yi'.</p><p></p><p>"Hun Yi?"</p><p></p><p>He had long learned from Monk Mado that Hun Yi was searching everywhere for his whereabouts to avenge the humiliation on the alien battlefield back then.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was so vast. Coupled with Lin Yuan's lack of interest in those opportunity lands, for Hun Yi to lock onto his location was like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected his luck to be so bad. On the main road to the core area, he just happened to encounter an opportunity land opening.</p><p></p><p>And the celestial phenomenon caused by the opening of this opportunity land attracted Hun Yi over.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan felt this coincidence was a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Was he too unlucky?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, you think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a voice resounded in the ears of the two. At the same time, a vast and holy aura began rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Hun Yi is chasing after us?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's mind trembled. She had actually held a bit of hope earlier that Hun Yi hadn't discovered them.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, she and Lin Yuan had been hiding deep within layers of space. As long as Hun Yi didn't actively extend his perception into the spatial layers, he wouldn't discover their lingering auras.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths of time, as the auras dissipated, even someone as powerful as Hun Yi wouldn't know where they fled to.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Hun Yi didn't do as she had hoped.</p><p></p><p>"He caught up?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced back.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he was confident in withstanding experts with spatial layers numbering in the hundreds of millions. But Hun Yi had opened over 30 million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>He was not only the strongest 9th stage life form of the Celestial Wing Race in the current generation, even in the entire universe, there weren't many who could suppress Hun Yi at the 9th stage.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan was confident, he didn't believe he could block Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>At least for the next 50 years, Lin Yuan had no assurance of defeating Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although he was just a primordial spirit now, even if he died, it wouldn't be a big loss to his true self. He could re-condense in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that time would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm only opened for a hundred years. To ensure he had enough time for a round trip, Lin Yuan had to enter the core area within 50 years.</p><p></p><p>Then use another 50 years to return to the outer area and wait for the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to close before being expelled outside the secret realm to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Before the secret realm closed, any life forms not in the outer area would be left inside the secret realm and perish.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had been open for over 20 years, if Lin Yuan's primordial spirit died at Hun Yi's hands, it could basically be declared a failure in exploring the 'calling sensation' from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan had no intention of returning from the core area at all.</p><p></p><p>But if he obtained some precious treasure from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm through the calling sensation and didn't return to the main</p><p></p><p>The Universe, can it only wait until the next secret realm begins?</p><p></p><p>According to the opening frequency of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it opens once every 200,000 years. After 200,000 years, with Lin Yuan's growth rate, even the strongest weapons will basically be of little use.</p><p></p><p>Behind.</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi was in an extremely cheerful mood. </p><p></p><p>After wearing out iron shoes in vain, it was obtained without any effort.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he was still troubled by the treasures of the opportunity place being taken away by the black-robed figure, but in a blink of an eye, he discovered the whereabouts of the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Star Lord!</p><p></p><p>This is the absolute shadow in the hearts of the Tianyu Clan's Eighth Stage lives.</p><p></p><p>Everything that happened on the alien battlefield, where the invincible Eighth Stage lives of the Tianyu Clan were killed by the Galaxy Star Lord like chickens, simply caused the mental state of some Eighth Stage lives to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Dying at the hands of a Ninth Stage powerhouse or some "external forces" is not a strange thing.</p><p></p><p>But dying at the hands of the Galaxy Star Lord, who is also an Eighth Stage life, and in that manner of death, even the morale of the Tianyu Clan began to decline to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>So in this Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Hun Yi put aside even the search for opportunity places for the time being, and made killing the Galaxy Star Lord his top priority.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, if you obediently stop now, I can give you a quick death."</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi said telepathically while closing the distance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the stronger one is, the greater the restrictions they face.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the main universe, with Hun Yi's strength, he only needs a few teleportations to catch up with Xi Lan Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, teleportation cannot be used, and the speed limit is restricted to the boundary of "light speed".</p><p></p><p>This led to the fact that if Hun Yi wanted to catch up with Xi Lan Lin Yuan, he could only maintain the distance between the two and slowly approach by relying on his occupation of the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>But Hun Yi didn't mind, because even so, he was confident in catching up with Xi Lan Lin Yuan, it would just take a little more time.</p><p></p><p>"Obediently stop?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't give up. He raised his right hand, operated the power of the world and many spatial layers, and blasted a strike towards Hun Yi behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, even if I stand still and let you attack me..."</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi grinned, not minding at all.</p><p></p><p>As a Ninth Stage powerhouse who has opened up more than 30 million layers of space, Hun Yi was extremely confident in his own life thickness.</p><p></p><p>Any attack would be dispersed and offset by the more than 30 million layers of space, so how much power would eventually fall on his body?</p><p></p><p>However--</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's attack landed on Hun Yi, the latter's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"At least a full-power strike equivalent to 2 million layers of space?" Hun Yi found it hard to believe, not that he suffered any injuries.</p><p></p><p>But the power of Lin Yuan's full-force strike was actually so great. How long had he crossed into the Ninth Stage? Other newly advanced Ninth Stage lives were still in the stage of mastering multiple spatial layers at the Ninth Stage, yet Lin Yuan could already unleash a strike of such power?</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi was full of disbelief, and at the same time, his killing intent towards Lin Yuan grew heavier.</p><p></p><p>Such a monstrous genius, who knows how much damage he will cause to the Tianyu Clan in the future. Now he must kill this avatar of his to slow down his growth rate.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan discovered that his full-power strike had no effect on Hun Yi, and immediately realized in his heart that he couldn't stop the other party with his current self alone.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?" Xi Lan was also a bit anxious. </p><p></p><p>He was carrying many treasures on him.</p><p></p><p>"Should we split up? Hun Yi's target is me." Lin Yuan suggested.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, what do you mean by that?" Xi Lan immediately frowned. "It's just an avatar after all. Could it be that I, Xi Lan, can't afford to lose it?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Even if they split up, Xi Lan couldn't escape.</p><p></p><p>Being personally seen and pursued by a powerhouse like Hun Yi, his aura had long been locked onto. As long as he was still in this secret realm, there was no escape.</p><p></p><p>"I have already contacted many friends. Among the human evolvers who entered the secret realm this time, there are two who can stall Hun Yi."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Tianyu Clan had a special Ninth Stage like Hun Yi who had opened up more than 30 million layers, the human civilization naturally also had Ninth Stage powerhouses of the same level.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the distance was too far. In the situation where teleportation methods couldn't be used in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it would take too much time for them to rush over.</p><p></p><p>Twenty to thirty years?</p><p></p><p>The avatar would probably be almost condensed by then.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xi Lan, if relying on you alone, how long can you last under Hun Yi's pursuit?" Lin Yuan suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"How long can I last?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, facing the pursuit of a terrifying powerhouse like Hun Yi, a Ninth Stage below a million layers lasting for several days would be considered rare.</p><p></p><p>But Xi Lan was different. His escape techniques were very advanced, and he was good at jumping between layers of space. Xi Lan was confident he could last even longer.</p><p></p><p>But what was the point of that?</p><p></p><p>No matter how long he lasted, it was impossible to exceed twenty to thirty years.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he would still die at Hun Yi's hands.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better to actively expose himself and re-condense the avatar to come back in.</p><p></p><p>"I have an elder who only needs three years, three years to rush over and save us." Lin Yuan thought for a moment and casually made up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>"Elder?"</p><p></p><p>"Three years?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He didn't doubt the truthfulness of what Lin Yuan said. As the strongest genius in human civilization's history, having a powerful elder wasn't anything strange.</p><p></p><p>"In three years, if I burn everything of this avatar, as well as my mental will, I'm confident I can last that long."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan pondered for a moment and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>This was determined by the special environment of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and the strengths of his own evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>If it were outside, let alone three years, he wouldn't even last three seconds.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure your elder will arrive within three years?"</p><p></p><p>Burning the avatar wasn't a big deal for him, but burning mental will was a huge price that would affect even the true body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the power increase obtained from it was also terrifying, enough for Xi Lan to last three years under Hun Yi's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was confident he could hold on, but he was afraid that Lin Yuan's elder wouldn't be able to make it in three years.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if he had burned his mental will and lost the treasures carried by the avatar, wouldn't he suffer a huge loss?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>"Three years is more than enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued, "Take me into your inner world, and I will contact my elder."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in a corner.</p><p></p><p>"Three years..."</p><p></p><p>"With the time flow rate of this crossing, at most two and a half years will pass in the main world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>What he told Xi Lan about "an elder coming to the rescue within three years" was naturally not true.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan planned to use these three years to make the ninth crossing.</p><p></p><p>In the newly obtained world imprint coordinates, Lin Yuan had obtained some information in advance, such as the time flow rate between the two worlds and the duration of his stay after making the crossing descent.</p><p></p><p>With a simple calculation, he could figure out how much time the main world would pass during the entire ninth crossing.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xi Lan..."</p><p></p><p>"You hold on for now..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly closed his eyes, and the Myriad Worlds Gate in his mind began to radiate light.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

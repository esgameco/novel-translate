        <h1>Chapter 505</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"At the time, I felt that the Galactic Overlord was hiding his true strength," said the Jie Clan's Ultimate outside the wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>That was why they had withdrawn from the encirclement and assassination of the Galactic Overlord, and had secretly sent their clansmen to convey information to the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, after so many cosmic eras, your intuition has always been very accurate," the Jie Clan's Ultimate inside the wooden hut immediately said.</p><p></p><p>In a situation where the encirclement and assassination were ineffective, any Twelfth Realm cultivator who participated would inevitably face reckoning when the Galactic Overlord advanced to the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the Jie Clan's strength, they were certainly not afraid of the reckoning from ordinary Parting the Dao Realm experts, but it would still be a nuisance, at least they would have to bow their heads and behave in the long years to come.</p><p></p><p>Across the universe, many Eleventh Realm beings also sensed the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the fluctuation of a battle between Twelfth Realm existences?"</p><p></p><p>"Which Twelfth Realm existences are fighting?"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, the Twelfth Realm Ultimates, how long has it been since they truly took action?"</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Realm beings were horrified. They could not see the specific scene, but just from the aftershocks and the spatial-temporal waves that erupted, they could judge that the two combatants had reached the Twelfth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Although the majority of the Eleventh Realm beings were shocked in their hearts, since their own clan also had an Ultimate guarding them, they did not feel fear.</p><p></p><p>However, the Eleventh Realm beings of the powerful clans were all trembling and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The slightest aftershock from a Twelfth Realm battle could destroy vast star domain sanctuaries.</p><p></p><p>If their clan was unlucky, they might even be annihilated because of it.</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe, how few were the clans that had perished due to Twelfth Realm battles? That endless rain of treasures from beyond the universe had caused the Twelfth Realm Ultimates to unleash their true powers, resulting in a massive extinction of life across the universe.</p><p></p><p>It was only after that, that human civilization had the opportunity to rise.</p><p></p><p>And now, the sudden appearance of a Twelfth Realm battle made many Eleventh Realm beings feel terrified.</p><p></p><p>In front of the spatial-temporal black hole, the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan had a grim expression.</p><p></p><p>Being pushed back by a single punch from the Galactic Overlord had certainly left the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates extremely shocked, requiring them to redefine the Galactic Overlord's strength.</p><p></p><p>But for this Tian Yu Clan Ancestor, it was extremely embarrassing and shameful.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Galactic Overlord possessed the offensive capabilities of the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, he was still an Eleventh Realm being.</p><p></p><p>As a mighty Twelfth Realm Ultimate, he was actually pushed back by the Galactic Overlord?</p><p></p><p>After today, the Tian Yu Clan Ancestor would be hung on the pillar of shame, and any conversation mentioning the Galactic Overlord would involve him as a foil.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord, you have thoroughly angered me."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yu Clan Ultimate's aura rapidly surged, and his mental will began to contract.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mental will attack method was certainly bizarre, but if he was on guard, its threat would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>At least his mind would not be completely constrained.</p><p></p><p>Through the brief exchange just now, the Tian Yu Clan Ancestor had also confirmed one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was, the Galactic Overlord's frontal offensive methods had indeed reached the Twelfth Realm, but only at the threshold.</p><p></p><p>While he had transcended the Twelfth Realm for over a billion years, long since stabilizing at this level, once he went all-out, the Galactic Overlord would likely find it difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>Although their group of Twelfth Realm Ultimates' plan had completely failed, the Tian Yu Clan Ancestor at least wanted to restore his own reputation.</p><p></p><p>Killing this incarnation of the Galactic Overlord could slightly wash away his humiliation.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he would completely offend the Galactic Overlord? They had already taken the initiative to encircle and assassinate him, so they were already on the opposing side.</p><p></p><p>No matter what they did now, the Galactic Overlord would eventually come to settle the score.</p><p></p><p>So the Tian Yu Clan Ultimate no longer cared about that.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yu Chen is truly enraged."</p><p></p><p>"Well, if it were me, being pushed back by the Galactic Overlord like that, I would be angry too."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Twelfth Realm Ultimates were not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>Whoever was in the Tian Yu Clan Ancestor's position would be furious.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the humiliation is truly unbearable."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this incarnation of the Galactic Overlord must die."</p><p></p><p>"Let Tian Yu Chen take action, the nine Strongest of Human Civilization are about to arrive, we will hold them back."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm Ultimates communicated with each other, and at this moment, their goal had shifted from completely killing the Galactic Overlord, to at the very least affecting the Galactic Overlord's advancement to the Ultimate Realm, by leaving this incarnation of his.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the nine Strongest of Human Civilization arrived.</p><p></p><p>"XuanYuan, your Human Civilization is indeed lucky to have given birth to a monster like the Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>"We will definitely kill this incarnation of the Galactic Overlord, it's best you just go back."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's just an incarnation."</p><p></p><p>The many alien Twelfth Realm beings blocked the nine Strongest of Human Civilization, facing off against each other.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The XuanYuan Strongest didn't bother with words, directly taking action.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, dozens of Twelfth Realm experts were engaged in fierce combat, the area within tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years around the spatial-temporal black hole was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord, die for me."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yu Clan Ancestor, Tian Yu Chen, had a surging aura. Now, he no longer underestimated Lin Yuan at all, and in his attack, he relied on his massive life essence and absolute power advantage to overwhelm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily evaded, and struck out with a punch again, finding that Tian Yu Chen did not retreat in the slightest. Even when he deployed the secret technique of the Abyss Eyes, it could only constrain a portion of the Tian Yu Clan Ancestor's mental will.</p><p></p><p>Allowing Tian Yu Chen, this Twelfth Realm Ultimate, to only display a part of his strength.</p><p></p><p>Such a secret technique, if Lin Yuan had advanced to the Twelfth Realm, Tian Yu Chen would probably not dare to resist at all, and would simply turn and run. But Lin Yuan was not a Twelfth Realm being.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on his Eleventh Realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Despite the fact that Tian Yucheng was unable to unleash his full strength, Lin Yuan could not do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a soul projection, still too weak." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. At this moment, he surpassed Tian Yucheng, who was at the 12th level, in both his understanding of the rules and his mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>However, the fundamental difference in their life essences was what made it so difficult for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's difficulty was that his attacks could not affect Tian Yucheng at all. </p><p></p><p>As for whether Tian Yucheng could attack him? The answer was naturally no.</p><p></p><p>The seven-layer spatial comprehension allowed Lin Yuan to stand undefeated, even if it was just a soul projection incarnation.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan, despite knowing the plotting of the ultimate 12th level alien races against him, still sent out many incarnations to roam the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I can't even touch the Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after many attempts, Tian Yucheng came to a conclusion. That was, his attacks couldn't even land on the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Although the Galactic Overlord's attacks couldn't break through his defenses either, continuing this stalemate was not a solution.</p><p></p><p>He was a 12th level expert, yet he couldn't defeat an 11th level life form, or even an incarnation of an 11th level life form, after such a long time? Tian Yucheng himself felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not fighting anymore."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng took a deep breath. If he continued the stalemate, he would only become more and more embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng planned to turn and leave.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care about the 12th level ultimate beings who were fighting the nine strongest human civilizations.</p><p></p><p>"You want to leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed Tian Yucheng's intention.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a figure appeared in another direction.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan's Yin soul projection.</p><p></p><p>The Yin soul projection took a step forward, coming to the side of the Yang soul projection.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Yin and Yang merged into one.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji soul projection, which was originally one, had split into two due to the special evolution system of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji soul projection, after the fusion of Yin and Yang, had its strength greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The inner world rapidly expanded, reaching a radius of five light-years.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the combat power of the Taiji soul projection was comparable to the main body.</p><p></p><p>But the main body had absorbed too many benefits, especially the two times of infusion from the Chaos Void Origin.</p><p></p><p>This caused the main body's inner world to reach the astonishing size of eleven light-years in radius.</p><p></p><p>"Slay."</p><p></p><p>The arriving Yin soul projection, not only merged with the Yang soul projection to become the Taiji soul projection, but also carried several 12th level weapons.</p><p></p><p>With all these combinations, the combat power of the Taiji soul projection reached an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>The silver-white battle sword tore through time and space, striking Tian Yucheng.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng's expression changed drastically. This strike, penetrating his protective battle armor, caused a tiny crack in his physical body, soul, and inner world.</p><p></p><p>Although this tiny crack healed in an instant, the next moment, Lin Yuan's second strike also fell.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, hundreds of strikes landed on Tian Yucheng.</p><p></p><p>The tiny crack was repeatedly torn open and then healed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng vaguely sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of strikes didn't have much effect on him, but what about thousands? Or tens of thousands? If it was a fight against other 12th level beings, Tian Yucheng would naturally have no fear, at most it would be a matter of exchanging injuries.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng couldn't even touch Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That meant...</p><p></p><p>Right now, Tian Yucheng was simply being beaten.</p><p></p><p>Exchanging injuries? </p><p></p><p>That was out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng let out a light sigh, took one last deep look at Lin Yuan, and his figure gradually became illusory and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the vast river of time, on the shore, Tian Yucheng's majestic figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Compared to 11th level life forms, the biggest characteristic of 12th level life forms is that they can break free from the constraints of the river of time and remain stationed on the shore.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the simplest way to withstand the Galactic Overlord's attacks is to enter the space of the river of time and stand firm on the shore. </p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Galactic Overlord's attacks are, as long as they don't exceed the 12th level, they won't pose a threat to the shore, just like the life forms in a painting cannot touch the world outside the painting.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng said each word slowly, forcing a mere 11th level life form to retreat into the space of the river of time, which was an unprecedented humiliation.</p><p></p><p>"A full-scale war, I must start a full-scale war, I absolutely cannot let the Galactic Overlord smoothly advance to the ultimate level."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yucheng looked down at the calm river of time, having made a decision.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord's advance to the ultimate level could not be stopped, but he could use the method of starting a full-scale war with human civilization to affect the Galactic Overlord's state of mind during the advancement.</p><p></p><p>Since the hatred between the two sides could not be resolved, Tian Yucheng no longer cared about the consequences of the full-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Tian Yucheng was about to use the space of the river of time to 'transfer' and return to the Tian Yu clan domain to discuss with the other 12th level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Tian Yucheng also planned to contact other peak clan forces to jointly attack human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, the originally calm river of time began to ripple.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a long and powerful right hand silently emerged from the river of time.</p><p></p><p>It then grabbed Tian Yucheng's ankle.</p><p></p><p>And then, in Tian Yucheng's horrified expression, it pulled him down.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

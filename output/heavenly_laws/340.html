        <h1>Chapter 340</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 340: Even if the Galactic Star Lords are Powerful, Can They Really Kill Us All? (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The three great protective secret laws of the Xuanhuang lineage -</p><p></p><p>Encompassing attack, defense, and escape, they seem impregnable at first glance. </p><p></p><p>However, the prerequisite is being able to cultivate them successfully. ‚ò∫üêØ‚ûÖÔºô‡∏£ùêáùïåùï©.ùìíùì∏–ºüí≤üêâ</p><p></p><p>But to successfully cultivate them - is it really that easy?</p><p></p><p>All things in the world maintain a subtle balance,</p><p>Special lifeforms have terrifying talents, yet low reproductive abilities.</p><p>Those unique, one-of-a-kind special lifeforms have no ability to reproduce at all.</p><p></p><p>The countless citizens of human civilization have average qualities that rank at the bottom among the peak races,</p><p>Yet their reproductive ability could be called heaven-defying. </p><p>This is a kind of balance.</p><p>Or perhaps it should be called a "restriction."</p><p></p><p>The secret laws are no different - the three great protective secret laws of the Xuanhuang lineage are each unimaginable.</p><p>However, to cultivate them successfully, or even just to take the first step, is far more difficult than one can imagine.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was an 11th stage life form who had comprehended the complete rules of space and time, grasping these secret laws so quickly could be explained, albeit barely.</p><p>After all, the higher the realm, the faster one can learn anything.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is only at the 9th stage. For a 9th stage life form to cultivate the first stage of the 'Xuanhuang Strike' in just a few years?</p><p></p><p>"This kid, the aura of his true experienced years shouldn't exceed four thousand years. Yet he has opened up so many layers of space, and now this?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Based on Lin Yuan's current cultivation speed, at most five thousand years and he could cultivate the 'Xuanhuang Strike' to the third stage.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan's casual strikes would unleash four times his limit in power,</p><p>And he could maintain this state "permanently."</p><p></p><p>"In my Xuanhuang lineage, when our Sovereign was still present, the fastest anyone cultivated the 'Xuanhuang Strike' to the third stage was seven thousand three hundred and ninety-four years - and that person was an 11th stage life form."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure thought to himself, a 9th stage life form cultivating the secret law faster than an 11th stage? This was something he could never have imagined.</p><p></p><p>A 9th stage and 11th stage life form were almost different species altogether. </p><p>The gap between them was like a vast chasm - the fundamental principles an 11th stage could see through at a glance might take a 9th stage ten thousand years to perceive.</p><p></p><p>"But then again, maybe not."</p><p>"Smoothly cultivating the first stage doesn't guarantee the second and third stages will go as smoothly."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure let out a light sigh of relief, suddenly laughing, "What am I worried about? As the descendant of our Sovereign, the more outrageous Lin Yuan's talents and qualities, the better. If they're not outrageous, how can he keep up with our Sovereign's pace?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the innumerable layers of space surrounding the Xuanhuang Secret Realm suddenly began to ripple.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"Those 12th stage life forms are trying to lock onto the secret realm's location again?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure glanced over and sneered, "Even if our Sovereign has been gone for dozens of universe cycles, you 12th stage beings who have never experienced the complete annihilation of a universe want to break through our Sovereign's methods? That's a dreamer's talk."</p><p></p><p>Deep in the vast layers of space,</p><p>Several enormously large powerful beings stood towering.</p><p>Their mere presence caused many space layers to retreat, forming a domain that belonged solely to them. Within this domain, space and time were playthings to be freely manipulated.</p><p></p><p>"Just where is this Xuanhuang Secret Realm? I'm getting more and more curious about its former master, that 'Sovereign.'"</p><p>An existence with twenty-four pairs of wings behind its back spoke in a resounding voice laced with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now? We still haven't locked onto the secret realm's location." Another being, its body spanning millions of miles, opened its mouth. Its voice traveled through space-time, disrupting it in this region.</p><p></p><p>"What can we do? We came from somewhere, so we'll just go back!" The third towering figure turned and took a step, disappearing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The second towering figure's expression was calm. Every time the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened, supreme beings would come and try to lock onto its coordinates, but failed without exception.</p><p></p><p>At the level of supreme beings, most treasures, weapons and secret laws in this world were of little use to them. But this Xuanhuang Secret Realm was different.  </p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just the concealment method alone made many supreme beings feel alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, all the supreme beings shared a common thought - that the secret realm must contain great secrets or treasures.  </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why go to such lengths to hide the Xuanhuang Secret Realm? What was the point?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the few supreme beings present disappeared, and this region of space-time returned to stability.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm,</p><p>Lin Yuan circulated the 'Xuanhuang Strike' and found that the speed of refining the secret realm's core had greatly increased, making his heart rejoice.</p><p></p><p>Among the three great protective secret laws of the Xuanhuang lineage, the 'Xuanhuang Strike' is listed as an offensive secret law, but that's not quite accurate. It's more like a "passive" secret law that can be applied to anything.</p><p></p><p>For example, now Lin Yuan was using the 'Xuanhuang Strike' to accelerate the refinement of the secret realm's core, which had nothing to do with attack.  </p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's progress in refining the secret realm's core increased, so did his control over the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan could clearly sense every little thing happening in the outer region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm - the 9th stage xenoraces hiding in various corners, their communications with each other, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Nothing could escape Lin Yuan's perception.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "outer region" here referred to the area surrounding the continent where these outsiders had descended.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two continents, they would be completely under Lin Yuan's control as he continued refining the secret realm's core.</p><p></p><p>"These 9th stage xenoraces...if I wanted to kill them now, I could do it anytime." Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, any outsider would be suppressed, unable to teleport being just one aspect. Their perception would also be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>So normally, as long as a 9th stage xenorace didn't make too much noise and just hid obediently in some corner, there wouldn't be any danger.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I should probably keep a low profile." Lin Yuan gave up on this tempting idea.</p><p></p><p>His taking over as the new master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm must not leave any traces behind.</p><p></p><p>Precisely tracking the location of every 9th stage xenorace and hunting them down? This was no longer just a matter of strength.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure had already told Lin Yuan that whenever the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened, it would attract the attention of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, it was better to keep a low profile. If Lin Yuan could become a supreme being in the future, then he could openly declare himself the secret realm's master - so what?</p><p></p><p>"At my current refinement speed, it will take about five more years to completely refine it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued gazing at the secret realm's core before him. Without the 'Xuanhuang Strike', refining it would take at least twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Using the 'Xuanhuang Strike' greatly reduced the time required.</p><p></p><p>Actually, how long it took to refine the core didn't really matter to Lin Yuan.  </p><p></p><p>By becoming the "Sovereign" Xuanhuang's descendant and starting to refine the core, Lin Yuan had gained the "permission" to enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm anytime.</p><p></p><p>He no longer had to wait for the secret realm to open.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan willed it, he could enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm using the Xuanhuang imprint.</p><p></p><p>"However, I can't take the initiative against those 9th stage xenoraces, but from now on, the 9th stage evolved humans from human civilization inside the secret realm will clear out and expel all hostile 9th stage xenoraces. At that time, it won't be a problem for me to take action."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.  </p><p></p><p>With human civilization providing cover, as long as he was careful, he shouldn't expose anything.</p><p></p><p>As for displaying some power beyond normal - compared to the entire Xuanhuang Secret Realm, what did that amount to?</p><p></p><p>To the xenorace supreme beings, as long as Lin Yuan didn't cross into the 12th stage, in the long river of time he would just be a "pitiful creature" eventually facing the limit of his longevity and impending death from old age.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Main Star,</p><p>Lin Yuan was wholeheartedly comprehending the 'Xuanhuang Strike'.</p><p></p><p>Of the three great protective secret laws, the 'Xuanhuang Body' required a large amount of Xuanhuang crystals, so he couldn't cultivate it for now.  </p><p></p><p>The 'Space-Time Step' was an escape secret law, but currently Lin Yuan was under no pressure. His true body was stationed on the Galactic Main Star, absolutely safe within human civilization's domain under the watchful eyes of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>His Yin Yuan spirit was on Battlefield #B0001, absorbing the leaking primal forces from the permanent space rift. No one knew the true identity of Lin Yuan's Yin Yuan spirit.</p><p></p><p>And with the Yin Yuan spirit's strength, hiding on a mid-sized xenorace battlefield was as stable as could be.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yang Yuan spirit, it had already become the semi-master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. To a certain extent, not even supreme beings could do anything to it.  </p><p></p><p>For now, there was no urgent need for Lin Yuan to cultivate the 'Space-Time Step' secret law.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Path of Emptiness has no particular requirements.</p><p></p><p>New69book.com‚Üí69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"As expected from one of the three great protective secret techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage. At my current level of comprehension, it's estimated I would need dozens of years to fully master it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was one of admiration. Of course, he didn't know that even for an eleventh-level life form, it would take over 7,000 years to reach the third stage of this secret technique. </p><p></p><p>As for fully mastering the fourth stage? It would be impossible without tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"However, if I can cross into the tenth level within ten years, perhaps it won't take too long to reach full mastery?" Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heavenly comprehension ability was entirely dependent on his current level. The heavenly comprehension at the ninth level was completely different from that at the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>At the ninth level, Lin Yuan needed to spend dozens or even hundreds of years to fully master the 'Xuanhuang Strike'. But once he reached the tenth level, it would likely only take a few years or even months.</p><p></p><p>If he made it to the eleventh level, would mastering the 'Xuanhuang Strike' to perfection be measured in days?</p><p></p><p>"Slowly but surely."</p><p>"I still have plenty of time."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the intricacies of the 'Xuanhuang Strike' in his mind, Lin Yuan continued immersing himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Four years went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>On another continent in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan's figure appeared out of thin air. The countless native lifeforms below had no perception of him.</p><p></p><p>"At most one more year, and I can completely refine the core of the secret realm," Lin Yuan smiled. Although there was no time limit for him in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the sooner he refined the core, the better.</p><p></p><p>"Over these four years, I've almost mastered the second stage of the 'Xuanhuang Strike'," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, somewhat unsatisfied.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this cultivation speed was already exceptionally astonishing, even terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that in the entire history of the Xuanhuang lineage, no inheritor had mastered this secret technique to the second stage in less than ten years.</p><p></p><p>Did they really think reaching a force three times one's limit with a casual strike was as easy as plucking a roadside radish?</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, it was still a bit slow for just one secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The ninth-level evolved humans have begun sealing off the outer region?" Lin Yuan looked up, his gaze piercing through layer after layer of void, falling upon another continent.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan demonstrated his absolute strength by slaying the strongest ninth-level Hunxi of the Tian Yu Tribe, the ninth-level evolved humans led by Duo Ke had been plotting a plan to eliminate the other hostile ninth-level xenoraces.</p><p></p><p>After all, such an opportunity was rare. While in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, higher-level forces could not intervene, and the human civilization now had a freak like Lin Yuan on their side.</p><p></p><p>They had to seize this chance.</p><p></p><p>"Those ninth-level xenoraces probably won't surrender easily," Lin Yuan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The elimination plan of the ninth-level evolved humans was naturally aimed at completely resolving those hostile xenoraces, or at the very least, driving them into the inner region before the secret realm closed.</p><p></p><p>Any ninth-level xenorace not in the outer region when the secret realm closed would be "annihilated" by the realm itself.</p><p></p><p>Those life forms in the outer region would simply be expelled from the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>So for those hostile ninth-level xenoraces, even if they didn't want to face Lin Yuan, they would definitely fight back desperately, since the end result was death either way.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if they'll invest more forces," Lin Yuan estimated.</p><p></p><p>Those ninth-level xenoraces must have noticed the human civilization's plot.</p><p></p><p>And since they noticed, they would definitely respond.</p><p></p><p>Those ninth-level experts who entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could only leave after a hundred years when the realm closed.</p><p></p><p>But during this period, outside experts could still enter by communicating with the ninth-level experts inside the realm, and send in special treasures.</p><p></p><p>Or they could even request assistance from powerful special ninth-level experts.</p><p></p><p>Each time the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened, it would attract many ninth-level lifeforms, but not every ninth-level expert would participate.</p><p></p><p>In a personal space, dozens of ninth-level evolved humans at the quintillion-territory realm gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord." The dozens of ninth-level quintillion-territory evolved humans all stood up, looking towards the young man who appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>On this field, each of the ninth-level experts was a dominant force in their own right. Even on major xenorace battlefields, they were no weaklings. Some special ninth-levels even had great hope of advancing to the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>But now, even if they combined all their strength, or gathered all the ninth-level evolved humans of this era, before the Galactic Star Lord, they would pale in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord," Duo Ke greeted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan, he was the strongest ninth-level of this era in human civilization, having opened nearly four quintillion-territory realms.  </p><p></p><p>But now, the strongest ninth-level of human civilization naturally fell upon the Galactic Star Lord. If it were anyone else, Duo Ke might have felt some resentment.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Star Lord?</p><p></p><p>After watching the "video footage" of the Galactic Star Lord slaying the Hunxi, Duo Ke didn't dare harbor any disobedient thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Please, have a seat." Lin Yuan smiled faintly and sat casually in the main seat.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord, the sealing formation in the outer region of the secret realm is almost complete. Next, we may face retaliation from those ninth-level xenoraces," Duo Ke said immediately. "At that time, I ask the Galactic Star Lord to take action. Otherwise, we won't be able to withstand those ninth-level xenoraces."</p><p></p><p>The ninth-level evolved humans of human civilization had set up a sealing formation in the outer region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Those ninth-level xenoraces didn't dare retaliate.</p><p></p><p>For what reason?</p><p></p><p>It was because they feared the potential appearance of the Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>So those ninth-level xenoraces could only flee and hide, over and over again.</p><p></p><p>However, the outer region was the smallest area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. No matter how much those xenoraces fled, they would eventually be driven to a dead end.</p><p></p><p>At that point, all the ninth-level xenoraces would rise up in retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Among those xenoraces were ninth-levels from the Insect Tribe Alliance, the Tian Yu Tribe Alliance, and so on. If not for their fear of the Galactic Star Lord, they would have long since shattered the sealing formation set up by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Slaying those ninth-level xenoraces was originally his idea. Moreover, in this encirclement and annihilation, he could obtain ninety percent of the gains.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll have to trouble the Galactic Star Lord at that time," Duo Ke said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know which region the Galactic Star Lord is in currently?" Duo Ke seemed to think of something and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in the outer region, able to take action at any time," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was still in the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. But with Lin Yuan's current control over the secret realm, he could appear in any part of it with a thought.</p><p></p><p>So when he said "able to take action at any time", it wasn't a boast.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p>"With the Galactic Star Lord here, those xenoraces can obediently await death."</p><p>"Hahaha, I've never felt so relieved. Thank you, Galactic Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the ninth-level evolved humans felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>In the past when the secret realm opened, the ninth-level evolved humans of human civilization would try their best to avoid those ninth-level xenoraces. After all, fighting within the secret realm served no purpose - bringing gains out was the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>But now, the ninth-level evolved humans of human civilization were actively encircling and eliminating those ninth-level xenoraces.</p><p></p><p>Although these ninth-level xenoraces didn't represent their entire races, merely being offshoots, it was a morale booster.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in a gloomy space, hundreds of wills descended. </p><p></p><p>The human civilization had a virtual world for all evolved beings to communicate in real-time.</p><p></p><p>Although other xenoraces couldn't construct a virtual world like humans, they had opened some temporary spaces to exchange information.</p><p></p><p>And in this space, the hundreds of wills that had descended were the ninth-level xenoraces in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>These xenoraces came from various major races, mostly hostile forces against human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As for those ninth-level xenoraces without major conflicts with human civilization, as well as some wandering special lifeforms at the ninth level, they were not included in human civilization's encirclement and elimination this time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the laughter and joy on the human side, the atmosphere here was rather gloomy and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>All the ninth-level xenoraces were filled with dread. They had all seen the "video footage" of the Galactic Star Lord slaying the Hunxi. Against the Galactic Star Lord, they didn't think they had any chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all worried about?"</p><p>"Even if that Galactic Star Lord is powerful, does that mean he can kill all of us?"</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, the leading expert furrowed his brow and looked around, saying...</p>

            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 294: Stepping into the Ninth Stage (End of Volume, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The "Illusory Reality" inheritance technique can transform the essence of life. üê∏‚òÜ‚ûÖ‚ûà≈üƒ§ÔΩï‚ìß.ùí∏·ªñùì∂‚ô¢üç¨</p><p></p><p>It seems to not greatly enhance combat power. </p><p></p><p>But it should be known that Lin Yuan has two avatar spirits.</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening various flesh and blood divine powers, he has been continuously absorbing the liquid from the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>The strength gap between Lin Yuan's true self and his two great avatar spirits, the Solar Avatar and the Lunar Avatar, has been growing larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>The true self can almost crush the avatar spirits.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the flesh and blood divine powers, just the internal world of over 100 million li is enough to leave the two great avatars several levels behind.</p><p></p><p>And the reason for all this is that the avatars have no flesh and blood, and cannot enjoy the enhancements brought by several flesh and blood divine powers, as well as the benefits of the mysterious gourd's liquid.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that this gap will only grow larger in the future.</p><p></p><p>Because as the number of traversals increases, Lin Yuan will only possess more flesh and blood divine powers, and the final two kinds of liquid in the mysterious gourd that bless the flesh and the internal world.</p><p></p><p>But what if the two great avatars transform from spiritual bodies into bodies of flesh and blood?</p><p></p><p>As long as the two great avatars transform into bodies of flesh and blood, they can share Lin Yuan's true self's divine power of "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", and then absorb the mysterious liquid in the gourd to empower themselves.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, if any of Lin Yuan's great avatar spirits transforms into a body of flesh and blood, in terms of pure combat power, it will not be weaker than the true self.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this refers to pure combat power. The true self possesses many treasured weapons, which gives it quite an advantage over the two great avatars in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Before becoming a core member of the Magic Jade Tower, Lin Yuan had also considered this issue, wanting to enhance the combat power of his avatar spirits.</p><p></p><p>But there was basically no effect.</p><p></p><p>Many evolved beings of human civilization have the innate talent to mutually convert flesh and energy.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the Canglang Star Arena competition, the top ten contestant "Thunder God" had the means to briefly transform his own flesh into lightning.</p><p></p><p>But this is the transformation of flesh into energy, because the evolved beings of human civilization already possess bodies of flesh and blood, and will only consider energizing the flesh.</p><p></p><p>Rather than materializing energy into flesh.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the energization of flesh has many hidden dangers. The duration is too short, and the stronger the flesh, the more difficult it is to energize.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan wants is the materialization of energy into flesh, which is even more difficult and involves more fundamental aspects.</p><p></p><p>Even with a heaven-defying comprehension ability, if he wanted to start from scratch and derive a method for materializing energy into flesh, it would likely consume a huge amount of time. This is simply not something a life at Lin Yuan's level can engage in.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>This "Illusory Reality" inheritance technique left by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower perfectly meets Lin Yuan's inner requirements.</p><p></p><p>This technique allows the flesh to freely transform between the illusory and the real without any restrictions, and without any energy loss.</p><p></p><p>This is simply...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan cannot even imagine how the owner of the Magic Jade Tower managed to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>From the real to the illusory, those are completely different life essences. To convert between the two without producing energy consumption? And to freely transform without any limits?</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji confirmed Lin Yuan's choice and did not persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>In his view, even if Lin Yuan chose wrong, the problem would not be very big. With his talent and aptitude there, even if he lacked an inheritance technique left by the owner, so what?</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji raised his hand, pointing his index finger at Lin Yuan's glabella.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan felt his consciousness falling, arriving in a boundless space.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of the space stood an incomparably great figure.</p><p></p><p>He wore black robes, his eyes indifferent, as if containing the laws of the great dao. As Lin Yuan watched, his figure began to vaguely become illusory, and then vaguely become real.</p><p></p><p>Real and illusory.</p><p></p><p>Illusory and real.</p><p></p><p>Various details poured into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Your heaven-defying comprehension ability accepts the mysterious information, deepening your understanding of the real-illusory transformation.]</p><p></p><p>[Your heaven-defying comprehension ability accepts the mysterious information, deepening your understanding of the real-illusory transformation.]</p><p></p><p>[Your heaven-defying comprehension ability accepts the mysterious information, deepening your understanding of the real-illusory transformation.]</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>"To think of using this method to perform the real-illusory transformation?"</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, the owner of the Magic Jade Tower is truly incredible."</p><p></p><p>On the main planet of the galaxy, Lin Yuan's true self opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>The "Illusory Reality" inheritance technique is not like "Interpretation of the Void", recorded in text and then allowing later generations to comprehend and learn.</p><p></p><p>It is directly imparted into Lin Yuan's mind, almost equivalent to the owner of the Magic Jade Tower personally teaching and guiding him.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder becoming a core member of the Magic Jade Tower only allows obtaining one inheritance technique. This kind of inheritance method requires too great a price to be paid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This kind of imparting method requires splitting off a portion of one's own soul essence to record this inheritance technique. Only in this way can the effect of feeling as if experiencing it personally be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the recorded inheritance technique has a limit on the number of times it can be imparted. Lin Yuan even suspects that after that "Illusory Reality" is imparted to him, will it disappear?</p><p></p><p>The inheritance techniques with the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji will change from seven to six from now on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If "Interpretation of the Void" was also imparted through this method, Lin Yuan estimates he would also be able to comprehend the complete spatial laws on the spot, rather than comprehending for several years and finally understanding it.</p><p></p><p>"For now, don't transform the avatars. First comprehend the last bit of fusion laws."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged as he began to continue comprehending the fusion laws.</p><p></p><p>Even with the help of the "Illusory Reality" inheritance technique, transforming the avatars from spiritual to physical bodies will take several days. And Lin Yuan is not sure if the transformation of the avatars into physical bodies will affect his breakthrough to the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>So to be safe, it's better to step into the ninth stage first.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, after reaching the ninth stage, there will be plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>"Law fusion..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, earnestly and repeatedly attempting.</p><p></p><p>He had long progressed the fusion laws to 99%. The last bit was just a hop away.</p><p></p><p>The complete spatial laws are vast and endless. Even if what Lin Yuan controls is only one aspect of the true spatial laws, encompassing the fusion of the Taiji Laws, dozens of cosmic forces, and even including a fundamental cosmic force, it is more than enough.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan concentrated his mind and remained calm, constantly attempting the law fusion.</p><p></p><p>Law fusion cannot succeed in one go. It requires repeated failures before finally summarizing the correct fusion method.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had experienced too many attempts before, coupled with his heaven-defying comprehension, he quickly and smoothly fused the last bit when facing it.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The power that emerged after the complete spatial laws, Taiji Laws, and dozens of cosmic forces were fully fused appeared before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This power is far beyond the semi-fused power from before. It is incomparably stable, exuding a heart-trembling aura and fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"All fused?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart was overjoyed. He immediately began to sense the various changes in himself after the law fusion.</p><p></p><p>Thoroughly fusing the laws is not the ninth stage, but the prerequisite for stepping into the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Only by relying on the brand-new power after the law fusion can one transform the flesh, transform the soul, transform the mind and will, and transform the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Going from the eighth stage to the ninth stage is completely a gradual process. As long as the prerequisites are met, there is basically no risk.</p><p></p><p>"What about me now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed himself. The power after the law fusion rapidly spread through his body, merging into every inch of flesh and blood, soul, mind and will...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and his conscious incarnation descended into his body.</p><p></p><p>Inner World.</p><p></p><p>The world's power, vast like an ocean, was surging.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the vast world spanning over a hundred million miles, his eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before merging with the rules, the size and area of his inner world at this moment had hardly changed at all.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan clearly sensed that his inner world was undergoing some kind of sublimation.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial layers, my inner world has given birth to layers upon layers of spatial layers!" Lin Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The main world's universe and starry sky possessed nearly endless spatial layers, and within the countless spatial layers, a large number of secret realms and similar worlds were also nurtured.</p><p></p><p>Spatial layers were the true foundation of a world. The more spatial layers there were, the more abundant the world's foundation, like a complex maze.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan's inner world only had the main space. No matter how vast it was, it still seemed exceptionally "thin".</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, this "thinness" was being filled.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that I've already started stepping into the ninth rank."</p><p></p><p>As layers upon layers of spatial layers opened up in his inner world, Lin Yuan's perception began to rise.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, after peak eighth rank evolvers fully merge with rules, it takes several months to several years. The time depends on the strength of the brand new power after merging with rules."</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the new power, the faster the transformation and the quicker one steps into the ninth rank."</p><p></p><p>"I just merged with rules not long ago, and have already begun stepping into the ninth rank. Is it because my power after merging with rules is too strong?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly, not slowing down or suppressing his breakthrough, but naturally accelerating his transformation.</p><p></p><p>"I can't break through on the planet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the Galaxy's main star.</p><p></p><p>During the process of entering the ninth rank, the inner world would open up layers upon layers of spatial layers, pulling on the outer universe. If Lin Yuan was still on the main star, it was very likely to affect the main star itself.</p><p></p><p>The B-grade modifications on the main star could not block the aftermath of a ninth rank evolver's breakthrough, let alone the fact that Lin Yuan was not normally advancing from eighth to ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the inner world's foundation, the commotion caused by Lin Yuan's ninth rank breakthrough would be dozens or even hundreds of times that of a normal evolver breaking through to the ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>In a desolate area of the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he completely released the suppression on his aura, and an aura as vast as a giant celestial body spread out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Within a radius of tens of millions of miles, hundreds of millions of miles, and even several light years, everything was affected.</p><p></p><p>Several hours later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's surging aura gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Have I already stepped into the ninth rank?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the starry sky, feeling himself with some amazement.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is far greater than before the breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again split off a thread of will to descend into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Those ninth rank evolvers recorded in human civilization who initially opened up tens of thousands of spatial layers, only opened seven or eight spatial layers at first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Let's not mention the size of the inner world for now.</p><p></p><p>Just comparing the number of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>A world with tens of thousands of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>A world with only a few spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The latter would inevitably be crushed by the former.</p><p></p><p>No, it's not crushing anymore.</p><p></p><p>The two are not worlds of the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>The difference in foundation thickness is too great.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, whether it's the incomparably "thin" inner world opened up at the eighth rank, or the inner world with layers upon layers of spatial layers opened up at the ninth or even tenth rank, they all rely on the main universe because they lack the support of an independent "time" rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Only by comprehending the time rule and integrating it into the inner world can such a world become independent and control the speed of time flow within the world.</p><p></p><p>Inner worlds without the time rule integrated all rely on the main universe, with the same time flow speed as the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Human Civilization, Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>On a vast planet, the No. 3600 branch of the Observatory was located here.</p><p></p><p>The Human Observatory undertook the task of observing all abnormal energy fluctuations within human territory, which was of great significance.</p><p></p><p>You should know that the vast majority of the universe is desolate starry space, making it difficult to specifically monitor. The Observatory could deduce what happened in an area by observing the overall energy fluctuations, in order to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>"No abnormal fluctuations in Star Domain No. 201376."</p><p></p><p>"No abnormal fluctuations in Star Domain No. 309123."</p><p></p><p>"No abnormal fluctuations in Star Domain No. 402371."</p><p></p><p>"No abnormal fluctuations in Star Domain No. 812344."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Observatory, the staff were intently receiving information from various star domains.</p><p></p><p>Team Leader Wang Xin was also observing the virtual screen in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Ten more minutes until getting off work."</p><p></p><p>Team Leader Wang Xin glanced at the time, his spirit relaxing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>On the virtual screen.</p><p></p><p>Red warning text abruptly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Detected A-grade energy fluctuations in Star Domain No. 723142."</p><p></p><p>"Detected A-grade energy fluctuations in Star Domain No. 723142."</p><p></p><p>As the warning sounded.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere inside the Observatory instantly turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The staff's expressions became grave as they began to intensify their observations, trying to find the source of the energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>A-grade energy fluctuations were no joke. They could very likely bring about serious disastrous consequences.</p><p></p><p>"Star Domain No. 723142 is the Galaxy Star Domain."</p><p></p><p>The information about this star domain immediately surfaced in Team Leader Wang Xin's mind.</p><p></p><p>A-grade energy fluctuations had an impact range of over ten light years.</p><p></p><p>If it was a natural phenomenon, then it would be the collision of over a hundred super-large celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't a natural phenomenon, then it was the commotion produced by at least several dozen ninth rank alien races descending to invade.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the higher-ups immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Enter first-degree alert."</p><p></p><p>Team Leader Wang Xin's expression was serious.</p><p></p><p>The collision of super-large celestial bodies wasn't too bad. Even if it affected some life-bearing planets, it could be appeased and properly handled afterwards.</p><p></p><p>But if it was an invasion by several dozen ninth rank alien races...</p><p></p><p>With the strength of ninth rank alien races, if several dozen of them acted together, they could absolutely bring devastating disaster to dozens of star domains or even a star alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble."</p><p></p><p>Just as Team Leader Wang Xin was about to contact the Observatory's higher-ups, planning to send out high rank evolvers to support that star domain.</p><p></p><p>A solemn and cold voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Citizen Wang Xin, there is no need for alert."</p><p></p><p>"No need for alert?" Team Leader Wang Xin was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>It was already an A-grade energy fluctuation, yet there was no need for alert?</p><p></p><p>Even if it wasn't an alien invasion, it would still be the collision of hundreds of super-large celestial bodies, requiring alert all the same and checking the losses within the affected range as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"The energy fluctuation originated from the commotion produced by one of our human evolvers breaking through to the ninth rank. Currently, no substantial losses have occurred, so there is no need for alert."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom's voice rang out again, providing an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Team Leader Wang Xin was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Eighth rank breaking through to ninth rank?</p><p></p><p>As the team leader of a branch of the Central Star Domain Observatory, although Wang Xin's evolution strength wasn't high, his perspective was quite broad. An eighth rank evolver breaking through to the ninth rank would at most cause fluctuations equivalent to a few stars.</p><p></p><p>Now the Goddess of Wisdom was telling him‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The violent collision of hundreds of super-large celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>Or the energy fluctuations caused by the descent of several dozen ninth rank alien races.</p><p></p><p>Was merely the commotion produced from breaking through to the ninth rank?</p><p></p><p>The hell kind of ninth rank breakthrough was this?</p>

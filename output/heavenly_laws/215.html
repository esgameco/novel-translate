            <p>Chapter 215 Shocking Rankings (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In a daze. ‡πë€û‡πë,¬∏¬∏,√∏¬§¬∫¬∞`¬∞‡πë€© ‚ûÖ‚ùæùìà–ΩœÖ◊ê.cùëú·µê ‡πë€© ,¬∏¬∏,√∏¬§¬∫¬∞`¬∞‡πë€û‡πë</p><p></p><p>On the main planet of the Vermilion Roc, within the Thirteen Mountain Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Deep inside the grand hall, Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Six hundred years have passed in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze rippled as scenes from his experiences in the Tianqing World flashed through his mind, eventually returning to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Six hundred years, for an old monster like the Vermilion Roc Star Lord who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years, might have just been a nap.</p><p></p><p>Even in the eyes of his obviously much younger senior brothers, it might have just been the time to close up once, to cultivate a secret technique?</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, it could already be considered a long time. Even adding the previous few times of traversing, the six hundred years definitely accounted for a significant portion of the total time.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around.</p><p></p><p>"The world has changed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were calm.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending over a thousand core spatial models,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could now see, wherever his gaze reached, the countless "ripples" caused by the fluctuations of spatial power.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianqing World was a small pond,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could trace the source and see the end of every "ripple",</p><p></p><p>Everything was under his control.</p><p></p><p>Then the universe and starry sky of the main world was like a vast ocean in comparison,</p><p></p><p>Any spatial "ripple" could spread and affect extremely distant places,</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan tried his best to observe, he could only see a small segment of the fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Different world scales lead to different perceptions and feelings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>He clearly felt that after returning to the main world,</p><p></p><p>The bottlenecks and shackles faced in comprehending core spatial models,</p><p></p><p>Were now, if not completely swept away, at least mostly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Let's put those aside for now."</p><p></p><p>"Let's check the connection between the Myriad Worlds Gate and the Tianqing World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and immersed his mind, looking towards that majestic and grand Myriad Worlds Gate.</p><p></p><p>In the last two hundred years in the Tianqing World, Lin Yuan gave up everything and devoted all his energy to establishing a method to replace the world consciousness.</p><p></p><p>If it was just about controlling the Tianqing World, Lin Yuan didn't need to go through so much trouble. With the strength of the Primordial Demon Tree back then, wherever its will reached, who dared to disobey?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true goal was to transform the Tianqing World into his backyard, and then have some ideas about the boundless void outside the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the area below the Myriad Worlds Gate.</p><p></p><p>He saw that after the previous six world coordinate imprints, there was a faint seventh world coordinate imprint taking shape.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the world coordinates of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the Tianqing World coordinates as bits of information began to pour into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>"Now, choosing to descend to the Tianqing World only consumes one-third of a strand of world-breaking power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>For precisely descending to a certain world using world coordinates like this, the consumption of world-breaking power was ten strands.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was only one-third of a strand, clearly the Tianqing World no longer resisted Lin Yuan's consciousness and even actively accepted it, greatly saving the consumption of world-breaking power.</p><p></p><p>"One-third of a strand of world-breaking power is equivalent to just over ninety days in the main world."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The time consumed for the Myriad Worlds Gate to normally accumulate one strand of world-breaking power was three hundred and thirty-three days.</p><p></p><p>With the boost from the permanent spatial rift, one strand only required two hundred and ninety days.</p><p></p><p>"Also, through the world coordinates on the Myriad Worlds Gate, I seem to be able to receive a lot of information from the Primordial Demon Tree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly noticed something.</p><p></p><p>The current Primordial Demon Tree had become the new world consciousness of the Tianqing World, that is, the "Heavenly Dao".</p><p></p><p>And the Primordial Demon Tree was just Lin Yuan's vessel, similar to an avatar. In principle, the two should share the same consciousness and memories.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Due to the vast distance between the main world and the Tianqing World in the boundless void,</p><p></p><p>They were not even in the same dimension or the same space-time, and there was a huge difference in the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>That's why the perceptual connection between Lin Yuan and the Primordial Demon Tree was completely severed.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Myriad Worlds Gate to have this use as well."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Through this faint connection, Lin Yuan had a general understanding of the situation in the Tianqing World, so the timing of choosing to descend would also be more precise.</p><p></p><p>Even though the cost of descending to the Tianqing World now was only one-third of a strand of world-breaking power, even one-tenth of a strand was still world-breaking power and could not be consumed casually.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the connection with the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned his attention to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the inner world."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Before the sixth traversal, Lin Yuan's inner world was only ten miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's consciousness descended.</p><p></p><p>Many insights into the laws of space merged in.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The inner world directly underwent a huge change.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the world, countless spatial powers gathered, space trembled, and the world's limit rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>This led to.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again fell into a kind of crazy hunger.</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into the seventh stage and opened up his inner world, Lin Yuan had this feeling.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, he had prepared ample Scarlet Spirit Liquid, so the opening of the inner world was exceptionally smooth.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan hurriedly suppressed the expansion of his inner world. With his current comprehension of the laws of space, the final limit of his inner world was at least over ten thousand miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Ten miles in diameter versus over ten thousand miles in diameter, it was definitely not as simple as a thousand-fold or tens of thousands-fold increase. The energy requirement was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan didn't suppress it, he would probably be sucked dry.</p><p></p><p>"Actively suppressing the expansion of my inner world, this kind of behavior of mine can be considered rare in the history of human civilization, right?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the expansion of an eighth-stage evolutioner's inner world was gradual. It mainly depended on the comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>And naturally, comprehending the laws of space, especially the core spatial models, would not see a sudden leap in a short period of time, but a slow improvement.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the expansion of the inner world could be achieved by naturally inhaling and exhaling external energy.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's current situation, instantly comprehending over a thousand core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Such a span, such a magnitude, if spoken out loud, probably not many eighth-stage evolutioners would believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Requesting Scarlet Spirit Liquid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately connected his consciousness to the virtual network and began to request Scarlet Spirit Liquid in large quantities.</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take a few days."</p><p></p><p>After completing the request, Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a normal quota of Scarlet Spirit Liquid, if Lin Yuan requested it now, it would probably be delivered within half an hour.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was currently on the main planet of the Vermilion Roc.</p><p></p><p>But the amount of Scarlet Spirit Liquid Lin Yuan requested was simply too huge, tens of thousands of times the amount he requested when he broke through to the seventh stage back then.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Evolution Path, Seventh Stage Chapter."</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the Scarlet Spirit Liquid,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>During the period of spiritual liquid, Lin Yuan began to review the Seventh Stage Treatise.</p><p></p><p>After six iterations of traversing hundreds of years and continuous improvements, the Seventh Stage Treatise of the martial arts evolution path was now basically formed.</p><p></p><p>All that was left for Lin Yuan to do was to make slight adjustments based on the physiques of the many evolved humans of human civilization, on top of the already formed foundation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even felt that such adjustments were unnecessary, as the considerations had already been made back in the Tianqing world.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan packaged the organized Seventh Stage Treatise and uploaded it to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 6 Citizen Lin Yuan, the Seventh Stage Treatise you uploaded is being assessed. Please wait a moment," came the solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>On a mysterious planet incredibly far from the Chikun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Detected that the 'Seventh Stage Treatise' involves multiple paths, and its subsequent popularity will increase. Detected that a few paths in the 'Seventh Stage Treatise' have the possibility of opening up inner worlds. The evaluation of the martial arts evolution path has begun to be reassessed."</p><p></p><p>"Discovered that the 'Seventh Stage Treatise' greatly enhances adaptability to various extreme environments, with the probability of traversing the Soulless Wastelands. The overall evaluation of the martial arts evolution path has increased."</p><p></p><p>"After assessment, the possibility of the martial arts evolution path being promoted to an Eighth Stage evolution path has reached 70%, and the possibility of being promoted to a Ninth Stage evolution path has reached 30%."</p><p></p><p>"Triggered the core plan of human civilization, contacting the Goddess of Freedom and the Goddess of Justice."</p><p></p><p>"After repeated confirmations by the three Goddesses, the assessment of the Seventh Stage Treatise of the martial arts evolution path remains unchanged."</p><p></p><p>"Beginning to assess the value of the Seventh Stage Treatise."</p><p></p><p>"After assessment, the value of the Seventh Stage Treatise of the martial arts evolution path is 3 million merit points, and the level of protection for the founder of this evolution path will be increased."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan patiently waited for the evaluation from the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"It's taking so long to come out?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised. In the previous few uploads, the longest waiting time was when he completely changed the martial arts path, making it no longer limited to yin-yang and tai chi.</p><p></p><p>But this time, after uploading the Seventh Stage Treatise, the waiting time had already far exceeded that instance.</p><p></p><p>"Wait patiently."</p><p></p><p>"The longer the wait, the higher the value."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't concerned. Time was what he had the most of now.</p><p></p><p>"With my current realm, as long as I recover all my strength, I will be at the peak of Seventh Stage King level."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my goal will be to break through to the Eighth Stage," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult step in breaking through to the Eighth Stage, opening up an inner world, had long been completed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan needed to focus on next was improving his willpower and mind, in order to face the Demon Heart Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no specific way to pass the Demon Heart Tribulation. The current common method used by the Human Alliance to pass it was simply to live long enough.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of long years, even if one was a pig, as long as it didn't die, its mental willpower wouldn't be too weak.</p><p></p><p>"In the next traversal, I could try to pass the Demon Heart Tribulation. If it doesn't work, I'll actively end the traversal and return to the main world," Lin Yuan thought silently. This was also the "cheating method" he had come up with.</p><p></p><p>By borrowing the traversal ability of the Myriad Realms Gate, the "Demon Heart" would lose its target.</p><p></p><p>Was it from the outside world?</p><p></p><p>Or from within oneself?</p><p></p><p>If it came from within, then this kind of "cheating" method probably wouldn't be of much use.</p><p></p><p>"I'll talk about it when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I haven't lived for a short time. Including the time spent traversing worlds, it's been over a thousand years," Lin Yuan was thinking.</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 6 Citizen Lin Yuan, the assessment of the Seventh Stage Treatise of the martial arts evolution path you uploaded has been completed."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? How many merit points is it worth?" Lin Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Based on the waiting time this time, Lin Yuan judged that the value of the Seventh Stage Treatise was very high.</p><p></p><p>But exactly how high could only be determined by the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 6 Citizen Lin Yuan, the Seventh Stage Treatise of the martial arts you uploaded is worth 3 million merit points," the Goddess of Wisdom replied.</p><p></p><p>"3 million merit points!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked in his heart. He had originally thought that at most it would be 1 million merit points, or close to 2 million merit points would be enough.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect it to actually be 3 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>3 million merit points, on the Alien Battlefield, that would be the lives of three Eighth Stage aliens, and the kind whose true bodies were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>On the Alien Battlefield, Eighth Stage aliens were extremely difficult to kill. The Eighth Stage aliens devoured by the Chikun Star Lord were basically all avatars, and as for their true bodies, they had long fled to who knows how far.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Eighth Stage aliens were equivalent to Eighth Stage evolved humans on the human civilization side, beings of high status and authority who could apply to the three Goddesses to rule a star domain, becoming kings and patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. The Goddess of Wisdom's high evaluation of the Seventh Stage Treatise indicated its potential without saying, which was undoubtedly also an acknowledgment of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the specific information of the martial arts evolution path now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his personal panel and found the martial arts evolution path column. This was an option that could only be seen by the founder of a certain evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts evolution path, currently a Seventh Stage evolution path, with a 70% possibility of being promoted to an Eighth Stage evolution path."</p><p></p><p>The 70% possibility of being promoted to an Eighth Stage evolution path meant that as long as Lin Yuan didn't die, he was basically a future Evolution Grand Scholar.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Alliance's condition for becoming an Evolution Grand Scholar was to create a complete, stable, and brand-new Eighth Stage evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just one evolution path, the many evolution theories involved in it were vast like smoke on the sea. A Grand Scholar who could create an Eighth Stage evolution path undoubtedly had an extremely profound understanding of many things in the field of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an Eighth Stage evolved human might involve some luck, such as obtaining a rare treasure that could assist in opening up an inner world.</p><p></p><p>But becoming an Evolution Grand Scholar had no luck at all, it was purely one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>Since the opening of the Chikun Star Domain, in over a million years, only three Evolution Grand Scholars had been born.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the number of Eighth Stage evolved humans was hundreds to thousands of times more.</p><p></p><p>"The possibility of being promoted to a Ninth Stage evolution path has reached 30%?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression slightly condensed. This was the first time he had seen this evaluation. Previously, the upper limit of the martial arts evolution path was the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Stage evolution path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts surged. So far, Lin Yuan had no idea about the Ninth Stage Treatise of the martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>However, since the three Goddesses had determined that the current martial arts evolution path had the possibility of being promoted to a Ninth Stage evolution path,</p><p></p><p>it meant that the path Lin Yuan was currently on was the right direction. Otherwise, it would only go against the Ninth Stage evolution path.</p><p></p><p>There would be no possibility of being promoted to a Ninth Stage evolution path at all.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right."</p><p></p><p>"What rank is the martial arts evolution path on the Chikun Evolution Ranking now?"</p><p></p><p>As if thinking of something, Lin Yuan immediately clicked on the "Ranking" column.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts evolution path ranks first on the Canglan Evolution Ranking and on the Chikun Evolution Ranking."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression slightly changed, revealing a surprised look.</p>

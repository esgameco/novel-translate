        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 356: Time Comprehension (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan's 11th rank celebration lasted a full half month. üëåüê≤‚ûÖ‚ùæùî∞ÂçÑ√π–ñ.ÂåöùïÜÁà™üò≥‚òØ</p><p></p><p>The birth of a new 11th rank evolved being is a major event for human civilization, so it naturally had to be celebrated grandly. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, since the venue was in the virtual world, there was no extravagance or waste, just that the duration was a bit long.</p><p></p><p>But for the current evolved beings of human civilization, being able to take this opportunity during the celebration to see so many high-ranking evolved beings was an absolute windfall.</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan only made an appearance on the first day of the celebration, and did not show up again for the remaining half month.</p><p></p><p>With comprehension of the time laws imminent, Lingyuan naturally had to seize every moment to contemplate it.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Stellar Master," Vice Tower Master Nalan immediately sought out Lingyuan after the celebration ended.</p><p></p><p>"I was really too busy before," Vice Tower Master Nalan said apologetically. </p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the 11th rank, most of his energy went into familiarizing himself with the explosive increase in power.</p><p></p><p>What little attention he had left also went to dealing with the many changes in status that came with entering the 11th rank.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for these constraints, Vice Tower Master Nalan estimated he would have sought out Lingyuan first thing to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Still, congratulations to Vice Tower Master Nalan on crossing into the 11th rank," Lingyuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The 11th rank? For you, Galactic Stellar Master, it's only a matter of time," Vice Tower Master Nalan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>There were some things he couldn't say in front of others, as the Paramount Nalan had specifically instructed him to keep it confidential.</p><p></p><p>But here in his personal space, Vice Tower Master Nalan could say whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>As a newly promoted 11th rank powerhouse, Vice Tower Master Nalan felt a bit of pride when dealing with other evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing 10th rank alpha-levels he was once on par with, he now adopted a looking-down attitude when interacting with them.</p><p></p><p>But the one person he could not feel pride in front of was the Galactic Stellar Master.</p><p></p><p>What was there to be proud of?</p><p></p><p>Be proud that the Galactic Stellar Master had nearly comprehended the time laws when he was still at the 9th rank?</p><p></p><p>Be proud that the Galactic Stellar Master's comprehension of the time laws surpassed that of many 11th rank evolved beings?</p><p></p><p>In fact, in front of the Galactic Stellar Master, Vice Tower Master Nalan felt pressure.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of being surpassed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"But at least within ten thousand years, the Galactic Stellar Master probably won't reach the 11th rank," Vice Tower Master Nalan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"One can only hope," Lingyuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>For him, the 11th rank was indeed not difficult to attain, just by following the proper progression.</p><p></p><p>The true difficulty lay in becoming a Paramount, the 12th rank, the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed not easy," Lingyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After advancing to become an Evolution Scholar and an 8th rank citizen, many secrets of human civilization were also revealed to him.</p><p></p><p>Even before becoming an evolved being, Lingyuan knew that human civilization had only spent two hundred million years rising from their ancestral star, sweeping through all other alien races, and becoming one of the paramount races dominating the starry cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Lingyuan did not find anything strange about this.</p><p></p><p>After all, to him at that time, two hundred million years already seemed like an extremely long period.</p><p></p><p>But as his realm and strength continued increasing, he began to understand the implications behind it.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred million years was indeed a very long time for ordinary humans, or 2nd or 3rd rank evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>But for high-ranking evolved beings, it was not an insurmountable length of time.</p><p></p><p>8th rank evolved beings could live for two to three hundred million years, long enough to cover the current history of human civilization in the stars.</p><p></p><p>As for 9th rank evolved beings, they would live even longer.</p><p></p><p>10th rank? 11th rank evolved beings?</p><p></p><p>Especially the latter, after comprehending the time laws, they could easily live for hundreds of billions, trillions, or even quadrillions of years.</p><p></p><p>Those "ancient gods" in the depths of the cosmos, many were born at the beginning of the universe and have passed through an incomparably long period, yet are still stuck at the 11th rank.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a small number of powerful "ancient gods" were not stuck at the 11th rank because they could not break through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Rather, they dared not attempt to break through.</p><p></p><p>If they failed in their attempt to break through to the ultimate realm, it would mean complete downfall.</p><p></p><p>Not even a Paramount could reverse time to revive them.</p><p></p><p>One of the steps to attempt to break through to the ultimate realm is to leap out of the river of time itself.</p><p></p><p>And by "leap out", it means leaping out completely, including the life imprint etched into the cosmic origin.</p><p></p><p>If the breakthrough attempt fails at this stage, everything will be utterly annihilated, including that strand of life imprint.</p><p></p><p>For a Paramount to revive a life that has died, they need to rely on the life imprint to serve as a "guidepost".</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why lives below the 6th rank cannot be revived - their life imprints are too weak to form a "guidepost".</p><p></p><p>For an 11th rank life attempting to break through to the ultimate realm, the first step is to erase their own guidepost. Only then can they make the ultimate leap in an attempt to enter the Paramount realm.</p><p></p><p>This made Lingyuan feel more and more that for human civilization to become a paramount race and give birth to nine Paramounts in just over two hundred million years was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Take the other paramount races in the cosmos, like the Insectoids or Featherfolk - each had existed for countless millions of years.</p><p></p><p>But human civilization only had a history of a little over two hundred million years?</p><p></p><p>According to the explanations within human civilization, in the extremely distant past on the ancestral star, there was an unprecedented opportunity.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity allowed the life forms on the ancestral star - the embryonic form of the future human civilization - to undergo an immense metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the year 1 of the Stellar Calendar that the first Paramount was born, and human civilization began its outward expansion.</p><p></p><p>That's right, before the birth of its first Paramount, human civilization did not dare make contact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Because that opportunity was so immense that if even the slightest bit leaked out, it would invite the pursuit and extermination of every life form in the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Year 1 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its first Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Year 1,300 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its second Paramount.  </p><p></p><p>Year 5,700 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its third Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Year 11,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its fourth Paramount.  </p><p></p><p>Year 18,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its fifth Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Year 20,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its sixth Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Year 25,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its seventh Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Year 38,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its eighth Paramount.  </p><p></p><p>Year 120,000 of the Stellar Calendar, human civilization gave birth to its ninth Paramount.</p><p></p><p>Because of that unprecedented opportunity, human civilization explosively produced nine Paramounts in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the most brilliant period for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But before year 1 of the Stellar Calendar, there was a period of dormancy lasting far more than two hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>The two hundred million plus years of the Stellar Calendar does not represent the total history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"During those dormant years, the powerhouses of my human civilization could only secretly leave the ancestral star, disguising themselves as wandering loners in the cosmos or selling their services to other races in exchange for cultivation resources. Even if they died, they could not reveal their origins."</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Vice Tower Master Nalan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In that era, the talents of human civilization had to keep an extremely low profile, desperately concealing their gifts. Otherwise they risked being captured and enslaved by other powerful races.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, with the endless talents of human civilization vying to emerge, other races may occasionally attempt assassinations, but successful kills are still few and far between.</p><p></p><p>And as long as they reach the 6th rank and imprint their life imprint, there is hope of being revived.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what kind of grand spectacle it was when those countless treasures fell into the cosmos, or what exactly was the opportunity it brought to human civilization," Vice Tower Master Nalan said wistfully.</p><p></p><p>"Countless treasures fell into the cosmos?" Lingyuan's mind stirred, recalling the results after asking the Wisdom Goddess to investigate the black planet.</p><p></p><p>"You also understand this matter, Galactic Stellar Master?" Vice Tower Master Nalan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He only learned of these secrets after crossing into the 11th rank and his status and strength reached the threshold.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Galactic Stellar Master to also be aware of it.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of how much importance Paramount Nalan placed on the Galactic Stellar Master, it made sense to Vice Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Lingyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The unprecedented opportunity my human civilization received before its dormant period should be from that event when countless treasures fell."</p><p></p><p>Vice Tower Master Nalan said, though he was only speculating based on the information he currently had.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly understood in his heart. No wonder the Goddess of Wisdom was able to quickly find out the origins of the black planet and directly offer an acquisition price of 500 million merit points - it was because she had some understanding of the black planet. </p><p></p><p>"My gourd..." Lin Yuan suddenly remembered the gourd he obtained from sweeping the Milky Way domain. </p><p></p><p>Because up until now, Lin Yuan had not been able to find any information about the mysterious gourd, as if it was not a product of this universe at all.</p><p></p><p>After the Vice Pagoda Master Nalan left, ripples arose in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, most human citizens only paid attention to the formidable war achievements of human civilization sweeping through the alien races over the past 200 million years of the Stellar Era. </p><p></p><p>But in reality, the even longer hibernation period before the Stellar Era was equally great.</p><p></p><p>No matter how fortuitous the unprecedented opportunity obtained, what could it amount to? Without the difficult hibernation period, even the most precious encounters would be usurped and occupied by the powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I must cherish the current cultivation environment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes and immersed himself in cultivation once more.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another three years passed.</p><p></p><p>In his comprehension of the laws of time, Lin Yuan had comprehended 2,040 new models of the time laws.</p><p></p><p>He was only 10 models away from his expected full comprehension of the time laws.</p><p></p><p>"The 2,041st model of the time laws...is it a well? The well of time?" Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly as he tried to construct this model of the time laws, but failed.</p><p></p><p>"The well of time..." Lin Yuan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go to the 5th floor of the Black Pagoda again." Lin Yuan's consciousness descended directly into the magic bead space following the magic bead imprint.</p><p></p><p>The 5th floor of the Black Pagoda required comprehending the time laws to pass through. In other words, the various time traps on the 5th floor were specifically tailored to the different stages of comprehending the time laws.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could often gain great insights by reasoning backwards from the effects and combining it with the microcosmic universe, the panorama of the river of time, and more.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived before the 9-story Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was chatting leisurely with a burly man.</p><p></p><p>The burly man was named Yuan Jin, the second challenger to enter the magic bead space. He had supplemented a certain demonic evolutionary path and joined the Magic Bead Pagoda as an ordinary member.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan, who had comprehended 3,333 demonic evolutionary paths, he was naturally far inferior.</p><p></p><p>But even in the chaos void, supplementing demonic evolutionary paths was the main way for the Magic Bead Pagoda to recruit members.</p><p></p><p>"You're here?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji smiled at Lin Yuan, ignoring the burly man Yuan Jin beside him.</p><p></p><p>The burly man Yuan Jin did not dare object either. In his eyes, the Lin Yuan before him was an unfathomable 11th stage life form, the highest he could see here.</p><p></p><p>If they were in the outside world, not to mention him, even the Yuan Family behind him would find it extremely difficult to meet an 11th stage evolver.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the number of publicly known 11th stage evolvers in human civilization did not exceed 1,000.</p><p></p><p>One thousand sounded like a lot, but considering the vast domains of human civilization, it was scattered so thinly that who knows how many star territories would have just one.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, most of the 11th stage evolvers of human civilization were concentrated on major battlefields against alien races, with the remaining mostly in the central star domains.</p><p></p><p>In the surrounding four major star regions, 11th stage evolvers were mainly from the nine great evolutionary pagodas.</p><p></p><p>"I want to challenge the 5th floor again," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>He was now familiar with the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, so he could speak directly about such matters.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Go on in."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji nodded, and the entrance to the 9-story Black Pagoda behind him opened.</p><p></p><p>Under the wary observation of the burly man Yuan Jin, Lin Yuan entered the Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji watched the scenes unfolding on the 5th floor of the Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The burly man Yuan Jin stood by the side, without the authority to observe what was happening on the 5th floor. He could only stand obediently, looking up at the faint glow emanating from the 5th floor of the Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji shook his head with some regret, "Just a bit short."</p><p></p><p>"A bit short?" The burly man Yuan Jin's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Just a bit short of passing the 5th floor?</p><p></p><p>According to the information about the 9-story Black Pagoda, to pass the 5th floor, one must comprehend the time laws.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending the time laws was considered the mark of a powerful cultivator, even among 11th stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>Just now, that great person was only a bit short of fully comprehending the time laws.</p><p></p><p>He had just managed to supplement a demonic evolutionary path, so his natural talents were not lacking. But it was only after crossing into the 9th stage that he barely managed to pass the 1st floor of the Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's figure reappeared outside the Black Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>"It should be almost there after some more time," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>If it were other 11th stage life forms, he definitely would not say such a thing. After all, the final bottleneck of the time laws had stumped countless powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan...</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji had no doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan glanced at the burly man Yuan Jin standing respectfully by the side.</p><p></p><p>Although Yuan Jin had entered the magic bead space for so long, Lin Yuan had not said much to him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, and since Yuan Jin was ultimately a fellow human evolver, and the only other challenger in the magic bead space, he should at least greet him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was aware that Yuan Jin was human and from human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But Yuan Jin did not know anything about Lin Yuan, not even whether he came from the same universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, as long as one condensed the magic bead imprint, one's consciousness could descend into this magic bead space, regardless of which universe one was from, as long as it was on the same plane.</p><p></p><p>"Great one..." The burly man Yuan Jin was extremely respectful. How could he deserve to have such a lofty 11th stage powerful cultivator personally speak to him?</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so formal," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. "You and I are both at the 9th stage, so we can interact normally in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, great one." The burly man Yuan Jin was about to respond respectfully, but his mind went completely blank.</p><p></p><p>What did the great one just say?</p><p></p><p>You don't need to be so formal?</p><p></p><p>No, not that line.</p><p></p><p>You and I are both at the 9th stage?</p><p></p><p>You and I are both at the 9th stage?</p><p></p><p>You and I are both at the 9th stage?</p><p></p><p>The burly man Yuan Jin was dazed for a long while before reacting.</p><p></p><p>The 9th stage?</p><p></p><p>Just a bit short of passing the 5th floor of the Black Pagoda?</p><p></p><p>Almost comprehending the time laws?</p><p></p><p>The burly man Yuan Jin plucked up his courage to voice his doubts.</p><p></p><p>But he found that Lin Yuan had already left, with only the smiling humanoid stone statue Shen Ji remaining by the side.</p><p></p><p>"Was I just trapped in an illusion?" The burly man Yuan Jin couldn't help asking the humanoid stone statue.</p><p></p><p>As a 9th stage evolver, even at the 9th stage, he had gained a relatively strong grasp over his soul, mind and will.</p><p></p><p>But what he just heard was too inconceivable, to the point where he wondered if he had fallen into an illusion without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>"No need to doubt," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji smiled slightly. "The one just now is indeed a 9th stage life form, but he is the strongest 9th stage life form I have ever seen."</p><p></p><p>"The strongest 9th stage life form?" The burly man Yuan Jin muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>So what he heard was true?</p><p></p><p>Yuan Jin was utterly shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A 9th stage about to comprehend the time laws?</p><p></p><p>What kind of freak was that?</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called greatest genius in the history of human civilization, the Galactic Sovereign, was far from achieving that, right?</p><p></p><p>It was simply on a completely different level.</p><p></p><p>The former was infinitely more difficult than the latter, by an unimaginable degree.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Sovereign Planet, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>After revisiting the 5th floor of the Black Pagoda, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time laws rapidly accelerated once more.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have comprehended the 2,041st new model of the time laws.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have comprehended the 2,043rd new model of the time laws.] </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have comprehended the 2,045th new model of the time laws.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have comprehended the 2,048th new model of the time laws.]  </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have comprehended the 2,050th new model of the time laws.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, you have fully comprehended the time laws!]</p><p></p><p>In a daze, the world before Lin Yuan's eyes changed.</p>

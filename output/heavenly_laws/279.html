            <p>Chapter 279: The Nine-Layered Black Tower, Master of the Magic Jade Tower (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade Tower is a mysterious force from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>According to the will of the supreme being Xia Qin, the master of the Magic Jade Tower suddenly disappeared in the distant past.</p><p></p><p>Many members of the Magic Jade Tower also vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The corpse of the supreme being that drifted in from outside the universe this time should be a member of the Magic Jade Tower, otherwise it would not contain evolutionary paths related to the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The information Lin Yuan obtained from the Magic Jade imprint shows that the connected Magic Jade Space was specially created by the master of the Magic Jade Tower back then to train its members.</p><p></p><p>Since it is for training, there must be risks involved. It's easy to have accidents if one's cultivation is not at the peak of the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of Lin Yuan's mental will descended into a mysterious space along the Magic Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Magic Jade Space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Am I here in mental will form? Is my physical body still on the main star of the galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately determined his own state.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced traveling through the Myriad Worlds Gate multiple times, Lin Yuan was no stranger to this feeling.</p><p></p><p>The difference is, when he descended to the traversed worlds through the Myriad Worlds Gate, he couldn't sense the existence of his physical body in the main world at all.</p><p></p><p>The eighth traversal allowed him to perceive the details around his physical body, that was by relying on the Myriad Worlds Gate as a "medium".</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense where his physical body was, although extremely far away, it felt real and not illusory.</p><p></p><p>"This Magic Jade Space is definitely not in the main world, but it should be in the same latitude and dimension as the main world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>If it was in a different latitude and dimension from the main world, he probably wouldn't be able to sense where his physical body was.</p><p></p><p>"If I want to go back now, I just need to disperse this wisp of mental will." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade imprint only brought a wisp of mental will to descend here, the main body of the mental will was still in the physical body. The current Lin Yuan was similar to a consciousness projection.</p><p></p><p>"A wisp of consciousness projection... The power I can utilize now is only rule insights and cosmic energy?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded as he looked around.</p><p></p><p>All he saw was white misty fog, Lin Yuan's mind was vaguely attracted to the front left.</p><p></p><p>"Is it telling me to go there?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment, this attraction came from the Magic Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>Without the Magic Jade imprint, even if he forcibly descended into this space, he wouldn't know which direction to go, as the white misty fog concealed and covered everything.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no intention of wandering around blindly, but followed the instructions of the Magic Jade imprint and walked towards the very front.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what level of expert the master of the Magic Jade Tower was, they definitely wouldn't be weaker than a supreme being. Being in a space created by such an existence, it was safest to obediently follow their rules. As for taking a different path? That would be the most foolish thing to do.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan's wisp of mental will descended.</p><p></p><p>In front of a nine-story black tower at the core of the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>A humanoid stone statue suddenly opened its eyes and looked at Lin Yuan who was cautiously coming this way.</p><p></p><p>"How many tens of thousands of years have passed, finally another Magic Jade Tower member has entered this training ground?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue looked at Lin Yuan from afar, but felt nostalgic in its heart, "Once upon a time, our Magic Jade Tower was so prosperous, with members coming to train at every moment. Now, to wait for a trainee, it takes a very, very long time."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue sighed, "Master, where exactly did you go? With you gone, is there still a need for the Magic Jade Tower to exist?"</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly, he could feel everything that the wisp of mental will sensed after entering the Magic Jade Space through the Magic Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>Even as that wisp of mental will explored the Magic Jade Space, he could still cultivate and comprehend the Dao on this side.</p><p></p><p>As an 8th stage evolutioner, multitasking was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>Unless the events encountered by that wisp of incarnated mental will were too important, most of his mental power was still on his true body.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any human evolvers who have become ordinary members of the Magic Jade Tower so far." Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Let alone comprehending the 3,333 evolutionary paths, in recent years, some human evolvers might have already perfected and made up for a certain evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>This method of becoming an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower was much simpler than comprehending the 3,333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>"What about the alien races?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Even the apex races didn't have the means of the human virtual world and couldn't isolate most of the powerful influence of that severed body.</p><p></p><p>So the apex races also faced great risks when comprehending that severed supreme being's body.</p><p></p><p>But similarly, the greater the risk, the greater the variables. Perhaps an alien who was extremely compatible with that severed body had their comprehension speed greatly increased?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I should focus on comprehending the 33,333 evolutionary paths as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Comprehending 3,333 evolutionary paths automatically makes one an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that if he could comprehend 33,333 evolutionary paths, his ordinary member rank in the Magic Jade Tower would likely rise by a level.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan didn't know what he would encounter in the Magic Jade Space, having a higher member rank in the Magic Jade Tower definitely wouldn't be a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's main focus and effort would definitely be on merging rules.</p><p></p><p>Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Following the guidance of the Magic Jade imprint, Lin Yuan passed through layers of fog and finally arrived in front of a huge nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>The nine-story tower was majestic and enormous, completely black, and the aura it emitted vaguely penetrated layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"This tower?" Lin Yuan felt the oppression his mental will was under.</p><p></p><p>The shape of this nine-story tower was identical to the "Nine-Layered Black Tower" of the Magic Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>However, the former was countless times larger than the latter, and the oppression it emitted was so strong that Lin Yuan had the illusion of facing the supreme being Xia Qin again.</p><p></p><p>"Consistent with the oppression of a supreme being, could it be that this tower is comparable to a supreme being?" Lin Yuan felt it was unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, supreme beings were the epitome of absolute invincibility, dominating the vast starry seas.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was repeatedly examining the nine-story tower.</p><p></p><p>A huge humanoid stone statue slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, don't stare at the Black Tower for too long, it will have a negative impact on you." The humanoid stone statue spoke.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had never heard the language it spoke, he inexplicably understood its meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior." Lin Yuan immediately said humbly.</p><p></p><p>The huge humanoid stone statue appeared outside the black tower, and its aura was consistent with the tower, clearly</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is a role similar to a guardian or a warden.</p><p></p><p>It may have a great connection with the Demon Jade Tower. Lin Yuan respectfully called him a senior, which is not inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." The human-shaped stone statue laughed, "It's been so many years. Finally, I met a member of the Demon Jade Tower. At last, there is someone to talk to me."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Hearing this, Lin Yuan's heart slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>From this sentence of the human-shaped stone statue, he could obtain a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>For example, before Lin Yuan, the last member of the Demon Jade Tower who entered the Demon Jade Space should be a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>Although there is a possibility of becoming an ordinary member with strength not reaching the peak of the eighth level, and thus not daring to enter the Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>But the probability is too small. Not everyone is like Lin Yuan, possessing a heaven-defying comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Shen Ji. Little fellow, you can directly call me by my name." The human-shaped stone statue said with a smile, also carefully looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You became an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Tower by comprehending the 3,333 paths of demonic evolution? Your comprehension is quite good."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji's tone revealed a trace of surprise. The 3,333 paths of demonic evolution are not easy to comprehend. The time required is far more than perfecting a single path of demonic evolution.</p><p></p><p>Unless one's comprehension is very strong, otherwise very few creatures choose this method to join the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, such ordinary members are more valued by the Demon Jade Tower compared to ordinary members who perfected a certain path of demonic evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Lucky." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He just instinctively felt that directly cultivating and comprehending the paths of evolution was too dangerous. And comprehending the paths of evolution one by one could also increase his own foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if you have any questions, you can directly ask me." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>He was still very satisfied with Lin Yuan. Mainly because in so many years, a practitioner could come to chat with him to relieve boredom.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's comprehension was quite good. No matter how much time it took, a million years or ten million years, as long as he could comprehend 3,333 paths of demonic evolution, his comprehension was definitely unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>If the comprehension was not enough, no matter how much time was spent, it would be impossible to comprehend so many paths of demonic evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shen Ji." Lin Yuan thought for a moment and asked, "How should I practice in this trial?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only obtained simple information from the Demon Jade mark. Entering the Demon Jade Space and going through the trial, one could obtain corresponding rewards.</p><p></p><p>As for how to practice and what rewards to obtain, it was not very clear.</p><p></p><p>"Very simple."</p><p></p><p>"Do you see this nine-story tall building?" The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji explained without any impatience, "For each floor you pass, you can obtain the rewards left by the great owner of the Demon Jade Tower."</p><p></p><p>"Rewards left by the owner of the Demon Jade Tower?" Lin Yuan's heart slightly moved.</p><p></p><p>"The higher the floor, the more rewards." The human-shaped stone statue added, "But don't think too much. For ordinary eighth-level lifeforms, passing the first floor is already as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Starting from the seventh floor, basically only twelfth-level lifeforms can attempt."</p><p></p><p>"Twelfth-level." Lin Yuan's heart jumped.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, the twelfth-level has many titles.</p><p></p><p>Ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>Or the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"What specific rewards are there?" Lin Yuan was curious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know about that. The rewards left by the owner are kept secret, even I don't know." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji patiently said.</p><p></p><p>For countless tens of thousands of years, he had been too lonely, to the point that now facing an eighth-level little fellow, he almost "answered whatever was asked".</p><p></p><p>The entrance of the majestic nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji brought Lin Yuan here.</p><p></p><p>Going further, one would enter the scope of the first floor of the nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>"Little fellow, keep walking straight ahead. When you reach that black staircase, you will have passed the first floor. Going up is the second floor."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>The entrance of the nine-story black building was several hundred miles wide. Lin Yuan glanced around and turned to look at Shen Ji, asking, "Senior Shen Ji, what strength is needed to pass the first floor?"</p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, only ninth-level lifeforms have hope of passing the first floor. As for eighth-level lifeforms? Comprehending the complete spatial laws is also possible."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji said in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>In his view, Lin Yuan had no hope of passing the first floor, but as long as someone could chat with him, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Tower and possessed the Demon Jade mark. He could enter the Demon Jade Space at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the complete spatial laws?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>For an eighth-level lifeform to comprehend the complete spatial laws, this was much more difficult than becoming an eighth-level invincible.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky of the main universe, there were still quite a number of eighth-level invincibles in the human civilization, other extremely powerful peak races, and even powerful races and ordinary races.</p><p></p><p>There were eighth-level invincible existences.</p><p></p><p>But an eighth-level comprehending the complete spatial laws?</p><p></p><p>It had indeed appeared before.</p><p></p><p>But it would only luckily give birth to one such individual in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you have comprehended a certain cosmic power, and this cosmic power is strong enough, there is also hope of passing the first floor."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji added.</p><p></p><p>The implication was that ordinary cosmic powers had no hope of passing the first floor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart slightly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He had nothing much, just many cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during the 920 years of stay in the Spirit Realm in the eighth crossing.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not spent a lot of time on comprehending the power of creation.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that he could comprehend 7,782 core spatial models and master the complete spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan never regretted his decision. Complete laws? With Lin Yuan's comprehension, as long as given enough time, he could comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>But the power of creation? After leaving the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan couldn't think of when he would next encounter a world without restrictions on cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"Go in." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji stood at the entrance and said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lin Yuan did not hesitate and directly entered the first floor of the nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji watched Lin Yuan enter the black building.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long he can persist. Just being able to join the Demon Jade Pavilion by comprehending 3,333 paths of evolution, even if only at the eighth level, there is hope of passing the first floor."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji thought to himself. The scene of the first floor of the black building appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As the guardian of the nine-story black building, the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji had many rights to prevent the ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower from "cheating" during the trial.</p><p></p><p>For example, using "external forces" and so on.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Demon Jade Tower opened up this space to train the members.</p><p></p><p>If external forces were used, the effect of the trial would be lost, and one would be expelled by the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji, never to enter again.</p>

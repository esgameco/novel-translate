            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way?" </p><p></p><p>The various Grand Sages looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The title of "Grand Sage" carries a specific meaning.</p><p></p><p>The "Red Leaf" of the Red Leaf Grand Sage signifies that he walks the path of the Chaotic Fire and Chaotic Life.</p><p></p><p>The "Azure Burning" of the Azure Burning Grand Sage also reveals the path he has taken to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>But the Milky Way?</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Grand Sage?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf Grand Sage's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He did not ask why Lin Yuan had chosen this title.</p><p></p><p>Each Grand Sage has their own secrets, and since Lin Yuan was willing to use "Milky Way" as his own title, he would not ask further.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Using "Milky Way" as his title was mainly to commemorate his life on "Earth" before he crossed over.</p><p></p><p>The true body of the Chaotic Void, the titles of Milky Way Star Lord and Milky Way Supreme Being, were also derived from this.</p><p></p><p>As for using "Milky Way Grand Sage" as his title, it would not expose his true identity of the Chaotic Void and this source world, as they are not even in the same dimensional space, and even a 13th-tier Temporal Life would find it difficult to cross dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he could cross over, the two words "Milky Way" are too ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"I believe that the title of Milky Way Grand Sage will surely resound throughout the surrounding ancient kingdoms and domains in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf Grand Sage said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The other Grand Sages, upon hearing this, were slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>They could hear the high praise the Red Leaf Grand Sage had for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Resounding throughout the surrounding ancient kingdoms and domains? This would require at least the peak strength of a Grand Sage to achieve.</p><p></p><p>But reaching the Grand Sage peak? Not every Grand Sage can cultivate to that level.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the many Grand Sages, Lin Yuan was just a newly ascended Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several months had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the mutual exchange and dissemination among nearly twenty Grand Sages, Lin Yuan's title of "Milky Way Grand Sage" had also spread out.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Sages had their own circles of connections, and Lin Yuan had managed to show his face through this war.</p><p></p><p>Under the backing of the Red Leaf Grand Sage and the Azure Burning Marquis, many Grand Sages also paid considerable attention to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, on the other hand, was not too concerned about this. Even if he did not have the "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens" divine art, his true combat strength was probably close to the peak of the Grand Sages.</p><p></p><p>And as time passed, Lin Yuan's combat strength and abilities were constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had no intention of revealing this.</p><p></p><p>Before he had fully comprehended the "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens" divine art imprint, he still wanted to maintain a low-key and cautious approach.</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis had a grave expression, and all the Grand Sages, including Lin Yuan, had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Purple Dream Domain is about to launch an attack."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was constantly monitoring the border battlefields and had vaguely sensed the movements of the many war machines from the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>"It was bound to happen sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see who can invade us."</p><p></p><p>The various Grand Sages were not particularly surprised. The Purple Dream Domain massing troops on the border and launching an attack at this time was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>They, the group of Grand Sages gathered here, were precisely for this day, weren't they?</p><p></p><p>"Red Leaf, Fire Axe, you two are the strongest in strength, so the Savage Moon Grand Sage and the Divine Roc Grand Sage will be left to you."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis looked at the Red Leaf Grand Sage and the Fire Axe Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>These two Grand Sages were the Azure Burning Marquis' good friends, and it was at his invitation that they had come to help defend against the invasion of the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf Grand Sage and the Fire Axe Grand Sage nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Moon Grand Sage and the Divine Roc Grand Sage were the peak Grand Sages from the Purple Dream Domain, with terrifying strength. Among those present, only the Red Leaf Grand Sage, the Fire Axe Grand Sage, and the Azure Burning Marquis had the confidence to withstand the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis needed to coordinate from the center, and would not join the battlefield unless absolutely necessary, so he could only rely on the Red Leaf Grand Sage and the Fire Axe Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>"And the rest of you, you must try your best to block the enemy. If any unexpected incidents occur or variables arise that you cannot handle, inform me immediately."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis looked at the other Grand Sages.</p><p></p><p>Over the past millennium, all the Grand Sages had repeatedly simulated war scenarios and had determined their respective opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way, your opponent should be the Thunder Roc Grand Sage. Do you have the confidence to handle him?"</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis looked at Lin Yuan and asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Roc Grand Sage was also a newly ascended Grand Sage, having crossed into the Grand Sage realm two hundred thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>For Grand Sages, two hundred thousand years was not a long time, so the Thunder Roc Grand Sage was still considered a newly ascended Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>"I have the confidence."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The border between the Azure Burning Domain and the Purple Dream Domain was very long, and each Grand Sage needed to guard a certain section of the frontline and command numerous war machines.</p><p></p><p>The section Lin Yuan was guarding was near the edge, where the veteran Grand Sages and peak Grand Sages would generally not attack.</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis also had great trust in Lin Yuan, after all, in his eyes, Lin Yuan possessed the bloodline of the core royal family, and even as a Sovereign, he could contend with the Grand Sages to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Azure Burning Marquis would also keep a close eye on Lin Yuan, and even if any unexpected incidents occurred, he would be the first to provide aid.</p><p></p><p>"This war must be won."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Marquis looked at all the Grand Sages and said solemnly, "After the war is won, I, Azure Burning, will have great rewards to bestow."</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Burning Domain were to fall, the one with the greatest responsibility would undoubtedly be the "Crimson Pine King".</p><p></p><p>But the one who would suffer the greatest losses would naturally be the Azure Burning Marquis himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Azure Burning Domain was his fief, and the collapse of his fief would be equivalent to the destruction of the foundation he had built up over the years.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Azure Burning Marquis was so determined to win this war.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>During the war preparation period, Hou tried to utilize his personal connections as much as possible, inviting peak Sovereign experts like the Crimson Leaf Sovereign and the Fire Axe Sovereign to lend their support.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the "Scarlet Pine King" had also summoned many Sovereign-level experts to provide reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>A manifestation of consciousness descended into his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum.</p><p></p><p>Almost every moment, his cosmic universe was undergoing a transformation, with the second layer of the "Infinite Void" slowly remodeling his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>At the Parting the Dao Realm, Lin Yuan's inner universe only spanned several million light-years, while a Chaotic Sovereign could have an inner universe spanning tens of billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>In terms of sheer size, the gap between them was practically incalculable.</p><p></p><p>Yet, their cosmic volumes were nearly equivalent.</p><p></p><p>This was all thanks to the empowerment and transformation brought about by the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>In fact, during the cultivation of the "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan's inner universe had been constantly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>However, the rate of shrinkage was lower than the rate of expansion, so his inner universe still exhibited an overall expansionary trend.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's inner universe had a diameter exceeding 100 billion light-years, and the power it contained could easily slay ordinary Chaotic Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was cultivating the second layer of the "Infinite Void" when he suddenly stopped, as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun, Open the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and a burst of flames suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the true self in the Source World was focusing most of its mental energy and efforts on comprehending the imprint of the "Blazing Sun, Open the Heavens" divine ability. Even if he had not fully grasped it, Lin Yuan could still replicate it to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would not last long.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to empower my inner universe with this divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>The key of the "Blazing Sun, Open the Heavens" divine ability was not in destruction, but in "opening the heavens". What is opening the heavens? It is to carve out the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Why can it open the heavens and the earth? Because wherever the blazing sun's radiance shines, that is the domain, that is the territory.</p><p></p><p>If he could condense an eternal blazing sun within his inner universe and have its brilliant light illuminate the cosmos, what kind of impact would it have on his inner universe? Lin Yuan's inner universe had already cultivated the 13th-tier inheritance of the "Infinite Void". If he could then empower it with the ability he had mastered at the 13th-tier of time and life - the Blazing Sun, Open the Heavens - and have the two 13th-tier powers fuse together, Lin Yuan's heart raced with excitement as he immediately began to attempt it.</p><p></p><p>Due to the fact that he had not yet fully grasped the imprint of the "Blazing Sun, Open the Heavens" divine ability, the flames Lin Yuan condensed could not last long.</p><p></p><p>They would soon extinguish.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan could still see the impact the blazing sun's radiance would have on his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>By the Jade Gourd.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was also observing the changes in the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child seemed to have sensed something, her face expressing surprise.</p><p></p><p>She clearly felt that the rate of transformation in Lin Yuan's inner universe had slowed down.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan had slowed down the pace of his cultivation of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>This piqued the red-robed girl child's curiosity. The "Infinite Void" was a 13th-tier inheritance, and its ability to elevate a 12th-tier life form was already inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was slowing down his cultivation of the "Infinite Void" - what could be the reason for that?</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Lord and many Sovereign-level experts were also making the final preparations for the war.</p><p></p><p>"My friends, once we have conquered the Azure Burning Domain, the prestige of the Spiritual Might Prince will rise greatly, making him a prime candidate for the imperial throne. The benefits we will receive are self-evident."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Lord's words were concise, but they stirred the hearts of all the Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>As Sovereign-level experts, they naturally understood why the Spiritual Might Prince had proactively initiated this war.</p><p></p><p>It was to become the emperor of the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Only by expanding the territory of the ancient kingdom could he gain enough prestige to become a candidate for the imperial throne.</p><p></p><p>As long as one is a candidate for the imperial throne, they can compete for the position of the ancient kingdom's emperor.</p><p></p><p>If the Spiritual Might Prince were to take that final step and become the next emperor of the ancient kingdom, under the principle of rewarding merit, how could they, the Sovereigns, not receive their fair share of the benefits?</p><p></p><p>"Now, let us proceed to the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Lord, accompanied by numerous Sovereigns, instantly arrived at the border battlefield through a spatial passageway.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Might Prince is closely monitoring this war, so you all must not hold back."  The Purple Dream Lord reminded them.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Azure Burning Domain or the Purple Dream Domain, the true trump cards or the strongest combat forces were surely still observing, not rushing to the frontlines immediately.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might Prince needed to make war decisions based on the situation.</p><p></p><p>"According to the plan we've laid out, when the time comes, we will proactively engage the designated opponents."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Lord spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Burning Lord had assigned various opponents for the Sovereigns, and the Purple Dream Domain had done the same.</p><p></p><p>"The battle line I need to breach is the Ding Seven Area. The one guarding this battle line region is the Silver River Sovereign? A newly ascended Sovereign from a thousand years ago?"</p><p></p><p>Lego the Sovereign was a thin, elderly man as he gazed upon the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The battle lines stretched endlessly, but the distinct aura of a Sovereign was quite conspicuous, and Lego the Sovereign quickly identified his opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Simple."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lego the Sovereign's face.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Lego the Sovereign had crossed into the Sovereign Realm just over 20,000 years ago, still considered a newly ascended Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he had been a Sovereign for over a million years, having simply concealed this fact.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, the Silver River Sovereign, a newly ascended Sovereign, will be easy prey."</p><p></p><p>"I will surely be able to put on a good show in front of the Spiritual Might Prince."</p><p></p><p>Lego the Sovereign was aware that the Spiritual Might Prince would be observing the battlefield, and if he performed well, his standing in the Spiritual Might Prince's eyes would change.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 246: Interstellar Great Migration (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The size of the inner world is influenced by two aspects.</p><p></p><p>One is internal factors.</p><p></p><p>The other is external factors.</p><p></p><p>Internal factors include the strength of the physical body and the level of comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the deeper the comprehension of the laws of space and the more core spatial models are realized, the larger the inner world will be.</p><p></p><p>As for the strength of the physical body? It is difficult to significantly improve physical strength in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>But slowly improving physical strength over a long period of time until it reaches its limit is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>For human eighth-level evolutionaries, there are basically no problems in terms of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>External factors, on the other hand, are some precious treasures related to space.</p><p></p><p>For example, the extremely precious "World Fruit" can forcibly expand the size of the inner world when it is first created.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of expansion is one-time. If a seventh-level peak evolutionary uses the "World Fruit" for the first time,</p><p></p><p>And opens up an inner world with a radius of several thousand miles,</p><p></p><p>To further expand this inner world with a radius of several thousand miles, the evolutionary's comprehension of the laws of space needs to be improved to a corresponding level.</p><p></p><p>That is, beyond the level of an inner world with a radius of several thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>But now--</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the laws of space has not greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>Nor has he used precious treasures like the "World Fruit".</p><p></p><p>Yet his inner world has suddenly doubled in size out of nowhere. This is simply shocking.</p><p></p><p>"This?!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The inner world is the foundation of eighth-level evolutionaries, and even relates to ninth-level evolutionaries and tenth-level evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>When two eighth-level evolutionaries fight each other, if one has an inner world with a radius of 100,000 miles and the other has an inner world with a radius of 50,000 miles,</p><p></p><p>If there are no other decisive factors, the battle will result in a crushing defeat.</p><p></p><p>The red liquid in the gourd instantly doubled the size of Lin Yuan's inner world, and the amplification of his combat power will far exceed double.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover--"</p><p></p><p>After sensing it carefully for a while, Lin Yuan discovered an even more astonishing fact.</p><p></p><p>This kind of amplification is not a simple amplification, but a fundamental amplification.</p><p></p><p>The initial inner world of a normal eighth-level evolutionary is about a hundred miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>After that, by continuously comprehending the laws of space and improving physical strength, theoretically, if one fully comprehends the complete laws of space at the eighth level,</p><p></p><p>The size of the inner world will reach a radius of 10 million miles.</p><p></p><p>This is the theoretical upper limit for eighth-level evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>Few eighth-level evolutionaries can expand their inner world to such an extent. Fully comprehending the laws of space? Even among ninth-level evolutionaries, some have not fully comprehended it, let alone eighth-level ones.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fundamental amplification is not adding another 700,000 miles in radius on top of the 10 million mile radius,</p><p></p><p>But rather, the theoretical upper limit for eighth-level evolutionaries has directly become 20 million miles in radius for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This kind of influence will definitely not be limited to the eighth level. In the future, when Lin Yuan enters the ninth level or even the tenth level, he will gain a huge advantage among evolutionaries of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"It's really unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart took a long time to calm down.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, he never imagined that in the universe, there would be such a method to break through the shackles of the race.</p><p></p><p>A radius of 10 million miles for the inner world is the shackle for human eighth-level evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>But for some special lifeforms, the maximum size of their inner world exceeds 10 million miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>For example, the peak bloodline special lifeform Star Sea Kun, the upper limit of such a lifeform's inner world far exceeds that of humans.</p><p></p><p>But there's no way around it.</p><p></p><p>Different races are different.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the first drop of red liquid, and I haven't even fully absorbed this drop yet. There are six more levels of liquid after this. If I absorb them all, how many miles will the upper limit of my inner world reach? Or should I say how many billions of miles?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted and he looked at the gray-red gourd in front of him again.</p><p></p><p>If the size of the inner world reaches hundreds of millions of miles or even billions of miles,</p><p></p><p>Then even if Lin Yuan has not mastered a certain cosmic power, he can still rub those invincible eighth-level beings into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The so-called cosmic power is nothing more than a means to greatly amplify eighth-level evolutionaries. A vast inner world is the same.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"This is definitely an extremely precious opportunity. Even for the strongest, it is very difficult to break through the shackles of the race, let alone far exceed the shackles of the race."</p><p></p><p>The strongest are high above, transcending the universe, and can cause permanent damage to the main world.</p><p></p><p>But that's the strongest themselves. If they want to break the limits and shackles for other evolutionaries, they will definitely have to pay a huge price.</p><p></p><p>"This gourd must not be leaked." Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was able to inform human civilization of the second way to become an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower, because it had no impact on him.</p><p></p><p>One Magic Jade Tower member and ten Magic Jade Tower members make no difference.</p><p></p><p>And it will definitely take a long time to comprehend the 3,333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan only has one of this gourd. If he tells the Goddess of Wisdom and the strongest borrows it, will Lin Yuan agree or not?</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook the gray-red gourd.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned the mouth of the gourd downward.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>Another drop of red liquid condensed at the mouth of the gourd.</p><p></p><p>The drop of red liquid Lin Yuan consumed before was not fully absorbed in the end, but his physical body turned into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>To fully absorb the liquid, one must persist until the all-burning flame is extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six months had passed.</p><p></p><p>On the main planet of the galaxy, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a red flame burning inside his body.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power almost overflowed, easily burning Lin Yuan's flesh, internal organs, and bones, forcing out the "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood" divine ability to continuously activate. The might of that kind of red flame cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long it took.</p><p></p><p>With a bang.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body directly turned into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, among the countless flying ashes, Lin Yuan's physical body quickly condensed and returned anew.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder one must have means like 'Rebirth from a Drop of Blood' to open the gourd. Without such means, no matter how many lives one has, it's not enough to dare to absorb the liquid inside the gourd."</p><p></p><p>Even with Rebirth from a Drop of Blood, Lin Yuan felt a bit exhausted at this moment. Rebirth from a Drop of Blood cannot be used indefinitely. Each use will consume some of Lin Yuan's strength. Although it can be quickly restored, it's still unbearable if used too many times.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>In the past six months, Lin Yuan spent most of his time absorbing the red liquid in the gourd, not knowing how many times he had used Rebirth from a Drop of Blood.</p><p></p><p>But the effect is obvious.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's inner world has reached a radius of 2 million miles.</p><p></p><p>It is three times the initial 700,000 miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>According to Chang Lai, to expand one's inner world to a radius of two million li, one needs to comprehend at least three thousand core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>This is a necessary prerequisite.</p><p></p><p>However, at present, Lin Yuan's comprehension of core spatial models is merely over two thousand, corresponding to an inner world size of only seven hundred thousand li in radius.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how large Teacher's inner world is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently pondered. The Chikunxing Lord's original form is the Starry Sea Roaming Kun, so the upper limit of his inner world should exceed ten million li in radius by a significant margin.</p><p></p><p>But that is the upper limit. Even among Starry Sea Roaming Kuns, few can reach the upper limit of their inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>For human evolvers to touch the upper limit, they need to comprehend the complete spatial rules, which is not much easier for Starry Sea Roaming Kuns.</p><p></p><p>"Let's rest for a bit first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped cultivating, planning to go out for a stroll.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Wisdom suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Galaxy Starlord, the current Galaxy Star Domain has stabilized. Should we begin interstellar immigration?"</p><p></p><p>"Interstellar immigration?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>This star domain, namely the Galaxy Star Domain, was seized by humans from the Shadow Race, and was originally the Shadow Race's territory.</p><p></p><p>Since it was the Shadow Race's turf, naturally there were only Shadow Race lifeforms, and no human citizens existed.</p><p></p><p>As for thoroughly transforming this star domain into the territory of human civilization, naturally a large-scale interstellar immigration was required.</p><p></p><p>Within the star domain, there were over 1.5 million life-bearing planets. If there were no large numbers of human citizens permanently residing, the significance of these life-bearing planets would not be great.</p><p></p><p>Those resource planets also required many human citizens to be stationed. On many resource planets, magnetic field fluctuations were frequent, which could cause intelligent lifeforms to malfunction.</p><p></p><p>There must be human citizens in control to ensure no major problems occur.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The current Galaxy Star Domain was in dire need of a large number of human citizens.</p><p></p><p>On an ordinary mid-sized life-bearing planet in the Chikunxing Domain.</p><p></p><p>A young man was bidding farewell to his parents.</p><p></p><p>"Son, wouldn't it be great if our family could just live here peacefully? Why must you immigrate to such a distant star domain?"</p><p></p><p>The father looked at his youngest son before him with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary citizens, they might not leave their star system in their entire lives, let alone star domains. With his son actively immigrating to a frontier star domain, there was a high chance they might never see each other again in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary citizens could not enjoy virtual world privileges.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, the universe is so vast, I don't want to be trapped on a planet my whole life."</p><p></p><p>"The star domain I'm immigrating to this time is the Galaxy Star Domain where our Thirteenth Peak Lord presides."</p><p></p><p>"As part of the first batch of immigrants, I will definitely gain more opportunities and might even become an evolver."</p><p></p><p>"By then, I will definitely come back to see you."</p><p></p><p>The young man was in high spirits and did not notice the disappointment in his parents' eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, our son has grown up. Since he has his own ideas, let's just go along with it." The mother beside him sighed.</p><p></p><p>"When you get there, be sure to give us a video call."</p><p></p><p>The mother patted the young man's head and urged.</p><p></p><p>"I know, I know."</p><p></p><p>"The immigration warship is almost here."</p><p></p><p>The young man glanced at the time and immediately turned to leave with big strides.</p><p></p><p>The two parents at the original spot watched for a long time. Only after the young man completely disappeared from sight did they withdraw their gazes.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Human Civilization Alliance was expanding at every moment, so immigration was very common.</p><p></p><p>Immigrating to a newly developed star domain had its drawbacks, but also its advantages.</p><p></p><p>The drawback was that the living environment and even the planetary environment would definitely not be as stable and safe as the mature rear star domains.</p><p></p><p>Some newly developed star domains would still face threats from some natives.</p><p></p><p>But the advantages were also very obvious.</p><p></p><p>That was the channels for advancement being completely open.</p><p></p><p>In those mature and stable rear star domains, even if human citizens did not work, they could live very well with ample social welfare.</p><p></p><p>But the class hierarchy was basically solidified. Unless one became an evolver or a high-level citizen, it was very difficult to cross class boundaries.</p><p></p><p>But was it so easy to become an evolver?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention high-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>However, in newly developed star domains, these were relatively easier to achieve.</p><p></p><p>The various evolution paths to become an evolvers, as well as the merit points to promote citizen levels, would all be opened to a certain degree to immigrating citizens in newly developed star domains as encouragement.</p><p></p><p>Although not much, at least there were ways to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many human citizens who were not content with the status quo and had grand aspirations did not reject immigration.</p><p></p><p>Chikunxing Capital.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a general look at the immigration situation.</p><p></p><p>"Many citizens from the Chikunxing Domain have come over?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Domain was the territory of the Thirteenth Peak Lord of the Chikunxing Domain. If one were to choose to immigrate, rather than relocating to a completely unknown star domain, it was better to come to the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention possibly receiving care from the Thirteenth Peak Lord, at least one would not suffer inhumane treatment.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of human civilization spanning the universe lies in the vast population base."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>On some battlefields between humans and the Insectoid Race, it was often a single Insectoid Queen against countless human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying aspect of Insectoid Queens was their ability to continuously produce and manufacture Insectoid warriors, and although it consumed a large amount of energy, there were no obvious restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Even so.</p><p></p><p>In the wars between humans and Insectoids, even excluding the influence of top-level combat strength at the supreme level, humans were only suppressed by Insectoids and far from being routed.</p><p></p><p>What was this relying on?</p><p></p><p>It was the large number of human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>And where did the large number of human evolvers come from?</p><p></p><p>It was from the even more vast population base.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield B520.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit disguised itself as an ordinary human Eighth Stage evolver and entered the human forces' territory on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>On medium-sized alien battlefields, Eighth Stage powerhouses were very common. Among Eighth Stage powerhouses, there were huge gaps between early, middle, late, and peak stages.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention there were Eighth Stage Invincibles that nearly transcended the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>An Eighth Stage Invincible could basically dominate a medium-sized alien battlefield. Even if unlucky enough to encounter a Ninth Stage powerhouse, there was still hope for survival.</p><p></p><p>"The permanent spatial rift on this battlefield reaches ten thousand meters, caused by the residual shockwaves of a strike from a certain supreme powerhouse 1.5 million years ago."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Spirit was full of anticipation as it followed the human evolvers ahead towards the permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Very soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw that permanent spatial rift emanating terrifying spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how much the accumulation of power to break through boundaries has improved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately immersed his mind into his sea of consciousness, carefully sensing that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rifts on the previous small-scale alien battlefields were all between ten to several tens of meters in size.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, his face revealing a joyful expression.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 529</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only half a day had passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already condensed nine Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>He had recovered to the level that took his original self hundreds of years of effort to reach.</p><p></p><p>"There's no change."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the nine Sun Seeds inside his body.</p><p></p><p>"It's probably because I had originally condensed nine Sun Seeds. Even though the Sun Seeds later collapsed, my realm remained. So now even though I've recovered nine Sun Seeds, there's no significant change."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll start condensing the tenth Sun Seed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Although there was only a difference of one seed between nine and ten Sun Seeds, it was a vast gulf in difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty was vastly different.</p><p></p><p>His original self had been stuck at nine Sun Seeds for who knows how long, unable to condense the tenth Sun Seed.</p><p></p><p>When condensing Sun Seeds, the first one is the hardest, the tenth is the hardest, the hundredth is the hardest...</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>The tenth Sun Seed slowly took shape.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The ten Sun Seeds slowly rotated inside his body, resonating with the surrounding world. Suddenly, much denser waves of the world's rules surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The rule fluctuations of the Origin World were already completely different from those described in the Chaos Void. They had a great impact on Lin Yuan. Now that the rule fluctuations were ten times denser, Lin Yuan was almost forced into a state of "sudden enlightenment".</p><p></p><p>"Is this the use of Sun Seeds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan steadied himself, feeling somewhat incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Increasing the degree of comprehension of rule fluctuations? Even if this effect wasn't as good as directly increasing enlightenment, it was still extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Enlightenment affects all aspects. For example, Lin Yuan's heaven-defying enlightenment not only far surpassed other life forms in comprehending rules, but could also have incredible effects on all things.</p><p></p><p>For instance, learning ability? Creative ability? And so on.</p><p></p><p>Even so.</p><p></p><p>The ability to directly increase the degree of comprehension of rule fluctuations was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, some special life forms had innately stronger comprehension of certain rules compared to other life forms, but this was an innate ability.</p><p></p><p>It was a talent.</p><p></p><p>Some treasures and spirit medicines could enhance comprehension of certain rules, but they had time limits, and such supreme treasures and spirit medicines were all exceptionally precious.</p><p></p><p>As for treasures that could permanently enhance comprehension of certain rules? They did exist, but were enough to make those Chaos Venerables and Chaos Great Saints fight to the death over them.</p><p></p><p>And now? The "Sun Seed Nurturing Spirit Method" that any living being in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country could cultivate actually had a similar effect? Moreover, ten Sun Seeds could increase the magnitude of rule fluctuations tenfold, so what about twenty? Thirty?</p><p></p><p>"Sun Seeds, this world, this Origin World..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The ten Sun Seeds floated in his body, vaguely communicating with the surrounding world, making Lin Yuan a "darling" of the rules' operation.</p><p></p><p>That's why there was such a degree of increase in rule comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"With the enhancement of ten Sun Seeds, my degree of rule comprehension could reach the peak of the Seventh Realm of Space-Time in at most a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it would have taken him at least tens of thousands of years of accumulation to reach the peak of the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, tens of thousands of years was already an incredibly short time. Those Twelfth Realm Path Openers and Sovereigns might sleep for tens of thousands of years in one nap. To go from the middle stage of the Seventh Realm to the peak might not be completed even in several universe eras.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, even if this Sun Seed Nurturing Spirit Method has hidden dangers, the rule comprehension is real. I'll continue condensing Sun Seeds. At worst, I'll just abandon this physical body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even the most mediocre ordinary person, after condensing ten Sun Seeds, could become a genius in terms of rule comprehension. Let alone someone like Lin Yuan who possessed heaven-defying enlightenment? The combination of the two far exceeded the effect of one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue cultivating and condense more Sun Seeds,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He looked outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>"Ayan, how are you now?" A male voice came, it was the father of the original Yu Yan, also the clan leader of the Yu family, Yu Chaolong.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong had Eleventh Realm Ultimate strength, and had long ago purchased a suitable path for himself from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country. He could enter the Self-Path Realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and opened the door of the cave dwelling. Father Yu Chaolong and mother were standing outside, with worried expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Yu Chaolong observed Lin Yuan's expression and sighed slightly in relief, then said angrily, "That little girl from the Yu family is truly vicious. She could do such a thing just to become the disciple of the Azure Burning Marquis."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Mother glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the original self and Dongyang Meng was unknown to others in the family, even Yu Chaolong didn't know, but mother was very clear about it.</p><p></p><p>"It's all in the past."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly. Everything that happened to the original self stemmed from the Dongyang family, from Dongyang Meng.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't care much. At most, he would wait until his strength was sufficient, then crush the entire Dongyang family with one foot.</p><p></p><p>"I've already told your grandfather about this matter. He will surely seek justice for you," said mother Yuchi Ling.</p><p></p><p>The Yuchi family was a first-class family in the Azure Burning Domain. Even though...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although it had declined, it still held great influence.</p><p></p><p>The East Yang family's assassination attempt on Lin Yuan, using any means to achieve their goal - if this matter reached the ears of the Qing Fen Marquis, it might directly cancel the East Yang family's admission quota.</p><p></p><p>This was also the only thing the Yu family could do at present.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was corrupted by the black force of the East Yang family, several of his Fierce Sun Seeds shattered, and coupled with his internal injuries, he would be unable to condense new Fierce Sun Seeds for decades to come.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, it directly eliminated his qualification to join under the Qing Fen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Even if in the end, the Qing Fen Marquis detested the East Yang family's actions and canceled their quota, he would not accept Lin Yuan - this had already become a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Leave the matter of the East Yang family to us. Son, you just focus on recovering from your injuries," Father Yu Chaolong said.</p><p></p><p>The East Yang family had lost the Yu family as a competitor, but they still hadn't become a first-class family. The Yu family would naturally take the opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>"Actually... there's no need to fight with the East Yang family," Lin Yuan thought for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family and East Yang family were both second-class families with similar strength. For the Yu family to fight the East Yang family would be like killing a thousand enemies but losing eight hundred of their own.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's view, this was completely unnecessary. At his rate of growth, he would soon reach a height far surpassing the East Yang family.</p><p></p><p>At that time, dealing with the East Yang family would be a mere thought away.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had only descended here, he had received Yu Yan's memories and still had some bias towards the Yu family. At the very least, he didn't want to see the Yu family members die meaninglessly.</p><p></p><p>"Not fight with the East Yang family?"</p><p></p><p>"After what they did to you, my son, I won't let them off," Father Yu Chaolong narrowed his eyes. "I've already spoken about this matter with several elders. The East Yang family will certainly pay the price."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan didn't try to persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well say that before long, he would grow to have the strength to crush the East Yang family, could he? To Father Yu Chaolong, that would be no different from a fool's dream.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family had inherited for countless tens of thousands of years, always on par with the East Yang family. How could they rely on Lin Yuan's strength alone?</p><p></p><p>"I need some cultivation resources," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts cultivation required a large amount of resources. By using the Yu family's channels, Lin Yuan wouldn't need to collect them himself, at least in the early stages.</p><p></p><p>As for the middle and later stages? Once his strength recovered to a certain level and he had the ability to protect himself, he would only need to show a little of his power, and large amounts of resources would naturally be sent his way.</p><p></p><p>"These resources... no problem," Father Yu Chaolong's gaze revealed a hint of surprise, but he finally nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll take our leave first. If you have any needs, you can tell your father at any time." Yu Chaolong finished speaking and left with Yu Chi Ling.</p><p></p><p>Watching the two of them disappear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to condense Fierce Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Cultivating the 'Fierce Sun Spirit Nurturing Method', you have condensed the twentieth Fierce Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Cultivating the 'Fierce Sun Spirit Nurturing Method', you have condensed the thirtieth Fierce Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong and Yu Chi Ling sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"Does your Yu Chi family really have the means to bring this matter to the Qing Fen Marquis?" Yu Chaolong asked.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Yu Chi family had declined. Otherwise, he, Yu Chaolong, wouldn't have been able to marry a daughter from a first-class family.</p><p></p><p>"We can indeed bring it up, but even if the Qing Fen Marquis doesn't know, his subordinates will know. However, even if they know, they probably won't do anything to the East Yang family," Yu Chi Ling shook her head and said.</p><p></p><p>For the lofty Qing Fen Marquis, only results mattered. As for the process? What did assassinating a competitor count as?</p><p></p><p>"Then you just now..." Yu Chaolong blinked.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't I just comforting our son?" Yu Chi Ling gave Yu Chaolong a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Yu Chaolong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that in the end, our son only condensed nine Fierce Sun Seeds. If he could have condensed the tenth, there would have been no need to compete with the East Yang family. He could have directly joined under the Qing Fen Marquis," Yu Chi Ling sighed.</p><p></p><p>Nine Fierce Sun Seeds and ten Fierce Sun Seeds were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Being able to condense ten Fierce Sun Seeds before the age of five hundred would catch the eye of even the lofty Qing Fen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>If such a genius were to die prematurely due to assassination, the Qing Fen Marquis would inquire into the matter and punish the family forces responsible.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, if Yu Yan had condensed ten Fierce Sun Seeds, he could have walked openly into the East Yang family and come out unscathed.</p><p></p><p>"A'Yan... we should still find some time to comfort him," Yu Chaolong thought. Being corrupted by the black force, shattering several Fierce Sun Seeds, and being unable to condense new Fierce Sun Seeds for decades due to injuries.</p><p></p><p>In Yu Chaolong's view, Lin Yuan's future potential would likely be greatly discounted.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Fierce Sun Seeds? When was the last time our Qing Fen Domain produced such a genius?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chi Ling shook her head. The Yu Chi family had been able to rise in the past because they had produced a genius who condensed ten Fierce Sun Seeds before the age of five hundred.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about this anymore. Even if A'Yan can't condense ten Fierce Sun Seeds, he's still our son," Yu Chaolong said.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several months went by.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Cultivating the 'Fierce Sun Spirit Nurturing Method', you have condensed the 3,689th Fierce Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan leisurely opened his eyes, countless suns floating in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

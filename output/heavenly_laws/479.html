            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 479 Resurrection (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"No more sparring?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No need for more sparring," the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons replied.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons still had even stronger trump cards that he had not used.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao in the origin realm of the Immortal Realm had not made a move yet. </p><p></p><p>But through these two probing attacks, the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons had already confirmed that not only could he not lock onto the spatial-temporal location where Lin Yuan was, the attacks he unleashed also could not touch or affect Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So continuing the sparring would be completely meaningless. It would just be the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons unilaterally outputting attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Then may I enter the origin realm of the Immortal Realm?" Lin Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." The corners of the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons' mouth twitched slightly. Based on his conclusions after sparring with Lin Yuan, even if he disagreed, it would be useless. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could simply ignore him and enter the origin realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to silently enter the Abyss of Demons and appear before the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons, and the latter was unable to do anything about it. </p><p></p><p>So he would similarly be able to silently enter the origin realm of the Immortal Realm, and even if he was in front of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, he would be powerless.</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although he could directly enter the origin realm of the Immortal Realm, he should still greet the master of the place.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be going first. If there's anything, just contact me directly."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lin Yuan's figure directly dissipated, as the incarnation that had descended here had dispersed its spiritual will, so the incarnation naturally vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan left, the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons stood for a long time, then sighed and disappeared as well.</p><p></p><p>The clash and sparring between the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons and Lin Yuan had caused profound ripples in the Abyss of Demons. Countless demonic beings and demonic sovereigns were uneasy and apprehensive. </p><p></p><p>Since their birth, they had never felt their divine father wield such power, the spatial-temporal fluctuations of which affected the entire Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>Xuantian Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Twelfth-tier strength..." Lin Yuan carefully examined the two attacks the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons had just unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Although on the spatial-temporal level, Lin Yuan was superior to the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons, standing undefeatable, it was only undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>If he were to directly resist, not just this incarnation, even his true body, the true body of the main universe, would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"I still have a considerable gap in direct combat strength compared to the Twelfth-tier ultimate." Lin Yuan assessed himself and reached this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>He could only survive in the face of the Twelfth-tier ultimate, it did not mean he could contend with the Twelfth-tier ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"But the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons' strength should be relatively weaker compared to the Twelfth-tier experts of the main universe?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even among the Twelfth-tier, there were differences in strength, not to mention the three great realms of Paragon, Sovereign, and Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Even within the Paragon Realm alone, the gap was huge. Twelfth-tier Paragon Realm experts at the peak could safely weather the great calamity of the universe's destruction, while ordinary Twelfth-tier Paragon Realm experts would die in large numbers facing the great calamity of the universe's destruction.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable that the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons was weaker than the powerful Twelfth-tier experts of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, those Twelfth-tier experts of the main universe occasionally clashed with each other, competed, and even obtained higher inheritances from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons? United with the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao as two sides of the same coin, before Lin Yuan's descent into the Immortal Realm, he had already been unrivaled for countless years, losing the driving force of having enemies, so his strength had naturally stagnated.</p><p></p><p>However, even the weakest Twelfth-tier is the ultimate, and Lin Yuan, who had thoroughly mastered the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal, could only survive in their presence.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial-temporal channel is completely formed now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, looking at the spatial-temporal channel in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This was a channel that Lin Yuan had forcibly established between the Immortal Realm and the Spirit Realm, based on his own comprehension of the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal.</p><p></p><p>This kind of method could only be done by Lin Yuan. Even the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons could at most bring a small number of lives into the Immortal Realm. </p><p></p><p>As for opening a stable spatial-temporal channel? They could hardly do it.</p><p></p><p>Before long, faint figures began to appear within the spatial-temporal channel in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Crossing the long spatial-temporal channel, upon entering the Immortal Realm, Qi Qing felt the dense immortal qi and the extremely complete Dao rules, and for a moment was lost in reverie.</p><p></p><p>She, Qi Qing, actually had the day to enter the Immortal Realm in this life?</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Behind Qi Qing, Shan Yang, Nie Yun, and the other Eighth Realm Martial Dao cultivators steadied themselves and, seeing the Lin Yuan standing in the distance with his hands behind his back, immediately knelt down in fervent worship.</p><p></p><p>The news that the Martial Ancestor had descended into the Spirit Realm again and opened a channel to the Immortal Realm had long since spread throughout the Three Thousand Dao States of the Spirit Realm, causing countless Martial Dao cultivators to go crazy.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the prospect of entering the legendary Immortal Realm, just seeing the Martial Ancestor, the progenitor of Martial Dao, was something they would die for.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p>"First get used to the environment of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. In the Eighth Crossing, Martial Dao was weak in the Spirit Realm, relying solely on the support of Qi Qing, Shan Yang, Nie Yun, the three Seventh Realm Martial Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the time when Lin Yuan had just met Shan Yang, the latter had planned to take Lin Yuan to the Nine Heavens for a visit.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Respect the Ancestral Order."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing, Shan Yang, Nie Yun, and the other Eighth Realm Martial Dao cultivators nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked behind him, and as Li Qing and the other three Eighth Realm cultivators passed through the temporal passage, more and more Eighth Realm cultivators entered the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among them were Jun Haiqiu, Jun Nangong, Jun Yunxun, and other scions of the Jun Family.</p><p></p><p>In the Middle Continent Divine Realm, Lin Yuan's identity after descending was the Third Generation Jun Wuji of the Moral Immortal Sect, as the Jun Family also had significant influence in the Moral Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation formed by Lin Yuan began to break free from the constraints of the world, coming to the world beyond.</p><p></p><p>"The Middle Continent Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked down below, as the Spirit Realm had hundreds of millions of subordinate worlds, with the Middle Continent Divine Realm being one of them.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the Spirit Realm and the Middle Continent Divine Realm was not far, and the Void Refining Realm experts of the Middle Continent could ascend to the Spirit Realm through the Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>This incarnation of Lin Yuan continued to descend, finally merging into the Middle Continent Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, immediately feeling an extreme 'narrowness', as if the entire Middle Continent Divine Realm could not contain this towering figure of his.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>To integrate as much as possible into the Middle Continent Divine Realm, Lin Yuan's spiritual will directly took control of the physical body he had previously left behind, that of Jun Wuji.</p><p></p><p>"This world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, and every detail of the Middle Continent Divine Realm was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The current Middle Continent Divine Realm had completely become one where the Martial Dao reigned supreme, perhaps due to the influence of Lin Yuan's eighth time traversing it, where Martial Dao cultivators had become the absolute mainstream.</p><p></p><p>"The river of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as he looked at the river of time in the Middle Continent Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of Lin Yuan's special descent into the Middle Continent Divine Realm this time was to revive Jun Dongjin, Mu Lian'er, and the others.</p><p></p><p>Although Jun Dongjin and the others had ultimately ascended to the Spirit Realm, they were born in the Middle Continent Divine Realm, and their life imprints were also there, so to revive them, he could only return to the Middle Continent Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Revive them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure became illusory, flowing against the current, and began to lock onto the auras of the lives that had died in the past.</p><p></p><p>The method of resurrection belongs to the abilities of Twelfth Realm experts, but at its core, it is just a mastery of the laws of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Even reaching the complete Eleventh Realm understanding of the laws of time, one could flow against the current and retrieve the lives that had died in the past, but they would be unable to withstand the backlash from the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's innate nature was unprecedentedly powerful, and reviving some Seventh Realm lives was nothing to him, as the backlash from the river of time was completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The river of time rippled, and one gray life imprint after another was retrieved and brought to the present.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I die?" </p><p></p><p>Jun Dongjin, Mu Lian'er, Jun Xiaotao, Jun Zhilan, and the others blinked their eyes, somewhat incredulous, as their memories were stuck at the moment of their final deaths.</p><p></p><p>Now, having been revived, it was as if they had just woken up from a long sleep.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that my lifespan has become incredibly long, at least able to live for millions or tens of millions of years," Jun Dongjin took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had barely any lifespan left, but now it had increased a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>"Me too," </p><p></p><p>Jun Xiaotao and Jun Zhilan exchanged glances. "Is this the Middle Continent? I remember I had already ascended to the Spirit Realm through the Ascension Platform."</p><p></p><p>"Wuji!" Mu Lian'er suddenly exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The family turned to look, and found Lin Yuan quietly watching them. At this moment, Lin Yuan was restraining his aura as much as possible, otherwise Jun Dongjin and the others would not even have the qualifications to gaze upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, I have revived you all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan explained with a smile, "Next, I will take you to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Reviving Jun Dongjin's family was effortless for Lin Yuan, as it was nothing to him, and he did not even need to pay any price.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Jun Dongjin's family, Lin Yuan also revived many others, such as the parents of his eighth time traversing the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's powerful life essence, even reviving Eleventh Realm lives would be more than enough, and reviving more ordinary lives was just a thought to him.</p><p></p><p>After the revival, Lin Yuan slightly infused each revived person with some of the source of heaven and earth, greatly extending their lifespans.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the revived lives who had reached their lifespan limit would still face the problem of their lifespan limit, even if they were revived.</p><p></p><p>"We've been revived?" Jun Dongjin's family was shocked in their hearts. They had also been to the Spirit Realm and knew that even Tribulation Crossing Immortal Kings, once dead, would simply remain dead, with no possibility of resurrection.</p><p></p><p>Yet Jun Wuji could easily revive them? And not just a simple revival, but their life essence and lifespan had also been greatly enhanced?</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm?" Jun Xiaotao paused, they could still go to the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>Reviving the acquaintances from the past was just a trivial task for a branch incarnation of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for his true self and main body, he was still in seclusion, cultivating and comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into the depths of his consciousness, gazing at the majestic and grand Multiversal Gate.</p><p></p><p>After his comprehension of the laws of time and space reached the Seventh Realm, this was the first time Lin Yuan observed this Multiversal Gate.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with his Seventh Realm understanding of the laws of time and space, he immediately noticed the changes in the Multiversal Gate.</p>

            <p>Chapter 329: Xilan - Where are the elders? (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, two auras were engaged in a chase.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the pursuing aura was far stronger than the fleeing one. </p><p></p><p>As time passed, the fleeing aura was slowly weakening.</p><p></p><p>However, at critical moments when the pursuer was about to catch up, the fleeing party would always manage to slip away through the cracks between the numerous spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>It was like a hundred-meter giant trying to hunt down an ant. The latter, taking advantage of the terrain, could to some extent make the giant's efforts futile.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a chase between two ninth-stage powerhouses spanning multiple spatial layers was far more complex than a single-space pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Even in the special environment of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the more time that passed, the more spatial layers the stronger party occupied, and the narrower the space the fleeing party could twist and shift became.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they would be completely locked down like a caged bird. </p><p></p><p>It was only a matter of time before they were caught.</p><p></p><p>"It's been two and a half years."</p><p></p><p>Xilan seized the opportunity to instantly cross from one spatial layer to another, once again widening the distance from Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only temporary. In less than half an hour, Hunyi caught up again.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that more and more spatial layers are being occupied, leaving me with less and less room to hide," Xilan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap brought about by absolute power. The spatial layers he had opened up were less than a million, while Hunyi, as the strongest ninth-stage life form of the supreme Tianyu race, had opened up over 30 million layers!</p><p></p><p>If not for being in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, which suppressed any means of teleportation and shifting, and Xilan actively burning everything, even his mental will, to gain a huge boost in strength, he would have been captured alive by Hunyi long ago.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Xilan vaguely felt that he might not be able to hold on for much longer. </p><p></p><p>One reason was that Hunyi was about to completely occupy all the nearby spatial layers; the other was that Xilan's mental will was running out and couldn't burn for much longer.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on for another half a year."</p><p></p><p>Xilan composed himself and glanced at Lin Yuan, who was sitting with his eyes closed in a corner of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>He trusted Lin Yuan very much. Since the Galaxy Star Lord said that as long as they persisted for three years, they could wait for the support of the "elders", Xilan had never doubted it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which powerful figure of our human civilization is the Galaxy Star Lord's elder?" Xilan was a bit curious. The Galaxy Star Lord's teacher was the Chikunxing Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>However, the Chikunxing Star Lord was only invincible at the eighth stage. Even if he broke through to the ninth stage, he would be far from being able to support them. As newly entered ninth-stage evolvers, they were no match for Hunyi, the strongest ninth-stage life form of a supreme race.</p><p></p><p>Xilan himself relied on burning everything, plus an escape technique from a certain supreme evolution path inheritance secret method of the human civilization, as well as the special environment of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, to persist until now.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the Chikunxing Star Lord... It should be one of those ninth-stage human evolvers who have opened up more than 20 million spatial layers," Xilan pondered.</p><p></p><p>To rescue them from Hunyi's hands, ordinary ninth-stage human evolvers at the 10-million-layer realm couldn't do it. They would need to open up at least 20 million spatial layers to restrain Hunyi and buy time for their safe retreat.</p><p></p><p>"20 million spatial layers..." Xilan sighed inwardly. The longer one cultivated at the ninth stage, the more they realized the difficulty of opening up spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Opening spatial layers was just the superficial aspect. More importantly, one needed sufficient comprehension of the essence of space. Without enough understanding to support it, one simply couldn't maintain the layers. Even if forcibly opened, they would quickly collapse.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Xilan had quite some respect for powerhouses like Hunyi who could open up spatial layers far exceeding 10 million, because he knew the difficulty involved.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Hunyi's voice transmission came from behind again.</p><p></p><p>"Xilan, I know you're desperately trying to escape to buy time, in order to keep the treasures you obtained in the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"How about this - I can promise that as long as you hand over the Galaxy Star Lord, I will let you leave. You can take back all the opportunity treasures you gained in the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>Hunyi continued, "You should know what my promise means, even if we belong to opposing factions, I will abide by it."</p><p></p><p>Hunyi was also getting a bit impatient with the chase. If this dragged on, it might take another three to five months.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, Hunyi's goal had been to kill the Galaxy Star Lord, or more precisely, to kill this avatar of his, as a bit of payback for the recent grudges on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As for Xilan, Hunyi had never taken him seriously. </p><p></p><p>If not for being in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, with his strength, why would he need to pursue for so long?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you bird people, still trying to drive a wedge between me and the Galaxy Star Lord." Xilan was not moved in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>As an evolver of the human civilization, Xilan was very clear about where his foundation lay. </p><p></p><p>The biggest crisis he faced now was nothing more than this avatar being completely finished off here, and the secret treasures and opportunities he gained in the secret realm not making it back.</p><p></p><p>And hand over the Galaxy Star Lord? Putting aside the matter of betraying the human civilization, just based on the potential and talent the Galaxy Star Lord had shown so far, Xilan wasn't stupid. How could he possibly choose to do that?</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, dying together with the Galaxy Star Lord in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could deepen the bond between them.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, since that's the case, prepare to completely leave this avatar behind." Hunyi no longer tried to persuade him. In the more than two years of pursuit, he had transmitted his voice more than once, but was ridiculed by Xilan in return.</p><p></p><p>"The escape techniques of the Void Evolution Path are indeed worthy of their reputation." Hunyi's expression turned slightly solemn as he sped up the process of completely occupying the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The Void Evolution Path was precisely the path Xilan cultivated, and was also one of the nine supreme evolution paths currently mastered by the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate existence of this evolutionary path was the Void God, one of the nine supreme powerhouses of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Void God's combat strength and killing power were not as good as the supreme powerhouses Xia Qin and Guli, but his mastery of the void was the strongest among the nine.</p><p></p><p>Within the human civilization, the evolution paths with the most cultivators were those of the nine supreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the supreme evolution paths were mature, well-developed, and nearly perfect. If one had the aptitude to cultivate a supreme evolution path, who would be willing to choose other paths?</p><p></p><p>Xilan had great talent in the spatial domain and also possessed the qualifications to cultivate the Void Evolution Path...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xilan possessed a special physique with spatial attributes, allowing her to activate many escape techniques from the Void Evolution Path, persisting under Hun Yi's pursuit until now.</p><p></p><p>"Almost there, almost there." </p><p></p><p>Hun Yi's thoughts converged. No matter how exquisite the Void Evolution Path was, it still required space. Now, after two to three years, by continuously occupying spatial layers, it seemed Xilan was about to be trapped to death by him.</p><p></p><p>The pursuit by Hun Yi, the strongest 9th-level lifeform of the Tianyu Clan, also attracted the attention of other surrounding 9th-level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Hun Yi of the Tianyu Clan? The one proclaimed as the number one 9th-level of the Tianyu Clan in this era? Who is he chasing?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know this? The one being pursued is Xilan, a 9th-level evolver from human civilization. However, Hun Yi is not chasing Xilan, but rather the Galaxy Starlord who is traveling with Xilan."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Starlord? The peerless genius of human civilization who recently caused the Tianyu Clan to lose face on the battlefield? The youngest 9th-level in human civilization history?"</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Nearby 9th-level powerhouses watched from afar. Hun Yi's pursuit was not concealed at all, and the erupting spatial fluctuations were easily detectable.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Starlord is being chased?"</p><p></p><p>Some 9th-level alien races who had decent relations with human civilization felt slightly moved. If they could save the Galaxy Starlord at this time, they would definitely gain the goodwill of this peerless genius of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>The one chasing the Galaxy Starlord was Hun Yi. Even if some 9th-level alien races wanted to curry favor with Lin Yuan and human civilization, they didn't have sufficient strength to hold back Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry space, human civilization was one of the few apex races, an absolute behemoth. They had enemies, but also follower races.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the grand alliance established by human civilization itself, there were still many races unwilling to offend human civilization and even wanted to befriend them.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Hun Yi has been chasing Xilan for over two years now. The Galaxy Starlord should be hiding within Xilan's inner world. It's said that Xilan cultivates the Void Evolution Path. Tsk tsk, it truly lives up to its reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Being chased for over two years, the Galaxy Starlord is really miserable, miserable, miserable!"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what the Galaxy Starlord is persisting for. For Xilan to hold on until now, she must have used secret arts and forbidden techniques that affect her true self. Paying such a price, could it be that some special 9th-level from human civilization is coming to the rescue?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't heard of any human 9th-levels close to Hun Yi in the nearby regions."</p><p></p><p>Many 9th-level alien races, separated by different spatial layers, were exchanging with interest. Both the pursuing side and the pursued side were extremely famous.</p><p></p><p>They were also happy to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi's prestige spread throughout the 9th-level circles, while the Galaxy Starlord, although only newly entered the 9th-level, with the talent he displayed, plus the halo of human civilization, was equally eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the Mysterious Yellow Realm,</p><p></p><p>His speed was extremely fast, with each leap affecting nearly 40 million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>This purple-robed evolver was named Duo Ke, who had opened up 39 million layers of space, and was the strongest 9th-level lifeform of human civilization in this era.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on a little longer. As long as I arrive, I will definitely make Hun Yi pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>The location Duo Ke was heading towards was precisely the region where Hun Yi was.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest 9th-levels of two apex races, Duo Ke and Hun Yi often clashed. The former had opened up slightly more spatial layers than the latter, naturally having an upper hand advantage when fighting.</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning about Hun Yi chasing the Galaxy Starlord over two years ago, he had been rushing over at top speed.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Mysterious Yellow Realm suppressed all convenient movement. Any powerhouse could only slowly fly. When Duo Ke received the news, he was a very long distance away from Hun Yi's location.</p><p></p><p>It was almost impossible to arrive within three years.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Duo Ke still came without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Hun Yi, if you dare to kill this clone of the Galaxy Starlord, then all the 9th-levels of your Tianyu Clan in the Mysterious Yellow Realm can forget about living."</p><p></p><p>Duo Ke silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Generally, special 9th-levels like them wouldn't deliberately hunt other 9th-level alien races after entering the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too much of a waste of time. The Mysterious Yellow Realm wasn't the outside world. One could only slowly fly when traveling, and it only opened for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Chasing and killing other 9th-level alien races, did they not want the various opportunities within the realm?</p><p></p><p>But Hun Yi actually dared to actively hunt a peerless genius of human civilization. This precedent couldn't be set. Duo Ke would rather give up seeking opportunities within the realm to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Deep within layers upon layers of space,</p><p></p><p>The Mado Practitioner was also observing the pursuing side and the pursued side from afar.</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi had been chasing Xilan and the Galaxy Starlord for over two years. After receiving the news, the Mado Practitioner also rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Starlord is really unlucky."</p><p></p><p>The Mado Practitioner thought to himself. He had already warned the Galaxy Starlord. The other party would definitely try to avoid Hun Yi as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The environment of the Mysterious Yellow Realm was unique. Even if Hun Yi received news of the Galaxy Starlord's location the moment before, by the time he arrived the next moment, the Galaxy Starlord would most likely have already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Unless the two happened to run into each other.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that... the Ancestor really values the Galaxy Starlord, actually telling me to use that trump card to block Hun Yi and save the Galaxy Starlord..."</p><p></p><p>The Mado Practitioner shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Once activating this life-saving trump card, even special 9th-levels who had opened up 50 million or 80 million layers of space would be trapped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor said not to directly use the trump card to save the Galaxy Starlord, but to take action when he is in the most critical moment, that is, when he is about to be caught by Hun Yi. Only then can we obtain the Galaxy Starlord's greatest gratitude."</p><p></p><p>The Mado Practitioner recalled the Ancient God Ancestor's instructions and felt they made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>The Mado Practitioner continued observing for a while and discovered that Xilan's speed of breaking free was gradually slowing down. His expression immediately turned solemn, waiting for the crucial moment to activate that life-saving trump card.</p><p></p><p>Inside Xilan's inner world,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep, the thousand years he experienced in the Gods' Realm flashing by like an illusory bubble.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Lin Yuan's movement, Xilan immediately descended her consciousness avatar, appearing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xilan." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Xilan's perseverance was crucial for perfectly concluding this crossing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Lin Yuan would have had to prematurely terminate the crossing or give up this avatar in the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Either choice would result in no small loss.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Starlord." Xilan's aura was weak, but she still forcibly lifted her spirits.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted for a bit, then Xilan carefully probed, "Galaxy Starlord, has your elder arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder?" Lin Yuan glanced at Xilan.</p>

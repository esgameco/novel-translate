            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 357 Evolution of the Inner World (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Finally...I have comprehended the rules of time. üëÆüéà6‚ûàsHux.‚í∏Om‚ôòüêü" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit was high, able to comprehend the rules of time as a ninth-rank life form.</p><p></p><p>In the vast main universe, there had never been such a precedent before.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Even in the records of the Magic Jade Pavilion and the Xuanhuang lineage, only the legendary primordial time beings, or extremely few extraordinary life forms, could accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>The so-called time beings are mysterious life forms that can travel back and forth across multiple timelines. </p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal of cultivation for twelfth-rank supreme beings is to transform into time beings.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of time." Lin Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the rules of time, Lin Yuan's physical body and soul did not undergo any changes.</p><p></p><p>But he clearly perceived the existence of the vast river of time.</p><p></p><p>It is worth noting that before comprehending the rules of time, even eleventh-rank experts could not sense the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Born in these deep mountains, Lin was unaware of his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can greatly slow down the flow of time for myself," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before comprehending the rules of time, Lin Yuan could also slow down his personal flow of time, but it was far from being a significant degree.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan could slow down the flow of time he experienced by thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>While the outside world passed tens of thousands of years, Lin Yuan himself would only experience one year.</p><p></p><p>This is also the main method used by the powerful ancient gods in the depths of the universe to extend their lifespans.</p><p></p><p>A small number of ancient gods possess the conditions to impact the ultimate, but they dare not attempt it, fearing failure.</p><p></p><p>So they have been waiting for opportunities, passing through one billion years after another by slowing down their personal flow of time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the eyes of these ancient gods, the time they have passed may only be ten or dozens of years, but the flow of time in the main universe has passed billions upon billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Slowing down the flow of time is useless for me," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He still had a long lifespan remaining, so there was no need to prolong his existence through such means.</p><p></p><p>"The river of time?" Lin Yuan gazed at this realm, and in the hazy distance, he seemed to see a vast and surging river flowing.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the rules of time, the most important point was perceiving his own struggle within the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the perspective of the supreme being Xia Qin previously bringing him to the "shore" to escape the constraints of the river of time, Lin Yuan's current perspective was within the river of time itself.</p><p></p><p>The two perspectives were completely different.</p><p></p><p>The latter's depth and breadth of vision were far less than the former's.</p><p></p><p>"My size within the river of time is too small," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though his life essence was comparable to a tenth-rank alpha, within the river of time, he was still inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>In the river of time, ordinary eleventh-rank life forms could only be considered "small fish," while eleventh-rank life forms that comprehended the rules of time could be considered "big fish."</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan? Although he comprehended the rules of time, his life essence was still too weak. At present, he could probably only be considered a mayfly.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, when I was on the 'shore' observing the river, I saw a 'big fish' whose body covered half the riverbed. I don't know what level of eleventh-rank life form that was?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since he was within the river of time, he was still at the eleventh rank.</p><p></p><p>However, to have a body that could cover half the riverbed meant its life essence was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The shore?" Lin Yuan tried to look towards the shore, but found it blurred. Life forms within the river were unable to glimpse the scenes on the shore.</p><p></p><p>"I now have the ability to leap out briefly and leave the river," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. "But I'll pass on that."</p><p></p><p>Life forms that comprehended the rules of time could exert all their power to briefly leap out of the river of time, but doing so would cause them to fall under the gaze of the supreme beings on the shore.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not worried about the nine supreme beings of human civilization, but there were many supreme beings in this universe who harbored deep malice towards human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Go against the flow towards the past?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned his head, gazing towards the distant past.</p><p></p><p>One life form after another that had died in the past appeared before Lin Yuan's eyes, with more and more shadowy figures emerging the further back into the distant past he looked.</p><p></p><p>These life forms all started from the sixth rank; Lin Yuan could not see the shadows of those below the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>"In theory, I now also have the ability to 'retrieve' people," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, theory is theory. With Lin Yuan's current strength and life essence, even if he "retrieved" a sixth-rank life form, he would instantly be crushed by the backlash from the main universe and the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Even eleventh-rank experts could not withstand the backlash of reviving a sixth-rank life form. Currently, only supreme beings could easily retrieve deceased life forms and bring them back to the latest time period for revival.</p><p></p><p>Supreme beings were too powerful. Only reviving eleventh-rank life forms would make them exercise a little caution, and even then, only for those extremely formidable eleventh-rank life forms.</p><p></p><p>The river of time.</p><p></p><p>The shore.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings of human civilization stood towering on this.</p><p></p><p>Further away,</p><p></p><p>The supreme being Xia Qin stood in the same manner, calmly looking down upon the river's surface.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A faint ripple from the depths of the river of time alerted him that a certain life form was gazing towards the shore.</p><p></p><p>Generally, such a ripple signified that a life form had comprehended the rules of time and could perceive that they were nothing more than a...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the long river of time, the "little fish" tried to look towards the shore.</p><p></p><p>"Has a life form comprehended the rules of time?" The thoughts of the Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi expanded. </p><p></p><p>If it was in the past, he naturally would not have thought too much about it. The long river of time is vast and endless, encompassing not only the many life forms of the present, but also the countless past lives as numerous as the smoke over the sea.</p><p></p><p>It would be perfectly normal for a life form that comprehends the rules of time to occasionally appear. </p><p></p><p>Just looking at how the other Supreme Lords paid no heed to this at all, one could tell.</p><p></p><p>But the Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi had a vague guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the one who comprehended the rules of time this time is that little fellow?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi began to look forward to it inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, separating a strand of will to descend into the inner world within his body.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the complete comprehension of the rules of time, the rules of time were added as a pillar to the inner world, along with the rules of space and many other rules, beginning to uphold the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>A special kind of change occurred in the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt intuitively that the inner world did not become larger, nor did it gain an additional spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>But with the integration of the rules of time, Lin Yuan vaguely felt that the inner world became "complete".</p><p></p><p>It was as if the previous inner world was "deficient", and now it was finally "made whole" and became "complete".</p><p></p><p>"Is this the 'independence' of the inner world?" Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>With the rules of time and space, the space-time within the inner world no longer relied on the main universe. Strictly speaking, the inner world and the main universe were on the same level.</p><p></p><p>They were both worlds with space-time.</p><p></p><p>As for the difference, it was simply that the main universe was countless times larger than the inner world, but no matter how great the difference, they both belonged to worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Too wonderful, is this an independent inner world?" Lin Yuan murmured to himself. At this moment, his inner world could already block out the perception of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the main universe could sense everything in the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Lin Yuan ended his journey through the Spirit Realm and comprehended dozens of Universal Forces, it was perceived by the main universe, and the power from the Universal Origin lingered outside Lin Yuan's inner world.</p><p></p><p>It was as if waiting for Lin Yuan to open his inner world, allowing the dozens of Universal Forces to adapt to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan had a feeling that even if there were treasures in the inner world that the main universe craved, they would not be perceived.</p><p></p><p>Because the inner world was completely isolated from the main universe, the two were "independent" and complete.</p><p></p><p>"Although there is no change in combat strength, there is more 'freedom'." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was inaccurate to say there was no change in combat strength. After comprehending the rules of time, Lin Yuan's attainments in the aspect of time were unknown as to how much stronger they had become compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>Even if his frontal combat strength was inferior to the Tenth Grade Alpha-level, he could still toy with those Tenth Grade Alpha-levels by relying on his comprehension of the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>For example, now Lin Yuan could use the rules of time to deploy the Time Prison. Even if those Tenth Grade Alpha-levels struggled with all their might, they would need to spend at least half a time period before they could break free.</p><p></p><p>Half a time period? The vegetables would have gone cold by then.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"After comprehending the rules of time, the inner world possesses both space and time, and the speed of metamorphosis has begun to soar?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough from the Ninth Grade to the Tenth Grade was a slow process of metamorphosis. According to Lin Yuan's own estimation, it would take about a hundred years to complete the metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan estimated that he would only need sixty or seventy years.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the rules of time actually has this kind of benefit?" Lin Yuan's mood was good.</p><p></p><p>Although with his foundation, breaking through to the Tenth Grade would not have any variables, the earlier he crossed into the Tenth Grade, the better.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi said that when an independent inner world undergoes a major boundary leap, it will receive the Primordial Essence infusion from the Chaos Void, which will be a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was slightly anticipatory.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Essence infusion from the Chaos Void? Theoretically, this was a treatment that Eleventh Grade life forms would receive when they impacted the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan would enjoy it when he broke through from the Ninth Grade to the Tenth Grade. If this were to spread, it would make countless Eleventh Grade life forms green with envy and their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to meet the Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and immediately began to connect his consciousness to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehending the rules of time also required quite some effort from the Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi. If it weren't for him guiding Lin Yuan to break away from the long river of time, even if Lin Yuan could comprehend the rules of time, it would have been significantly delayed, perhaps even until the Tenth Grade.</p><p></p><p>The virtual world.</p><p></p><p>The personal world of a Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi sat high on his throne.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow is coming to find me?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi's heart stirred, and he suddenly thought of the faint fluctuation he had sensed earlier at the "shore" of the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the fluctuation really came from Lin Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi's heart was slightly excited. He had only been guessing before.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yuan's figure appeared below.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Lord." Lin Yuan slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"You comprehended the rules of time?" The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi asked directly.</p><p></p><p>His expression rarely showed a hint of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a little puzzled as to how the Supreme Lord knew, but he still answered, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Comprehended the rules of time..."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi's tone was rarely invigorated, "Good, good, good!"</p>

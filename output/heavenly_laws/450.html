            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 450 The Might of the 'World' (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The first large-scale war after the opening of the super-large battlefield has also attracted the attention of the Twelve Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"The Nightmare Realm of the Insect Tribe was forged using the precious Nightmare Heart of the Twelve Ultimate Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Nightmare Heart originally drifted from the Chaotic Void into the universe and fell into the hands of the Insect Tribe's Wanhua Empress."</p><p></p><p>"With the Nightmare Heart as the main material, the Nightmare Realm was forged, possessing an incredible suppressive effect on the soul."</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Ultimates observed the core battlefield and exchanged views.</p><p></p><p>The Nightmare Heart was not a treasure that could be nurtured by the universe; it came from the even more vast Chaotic Void, innately suppressing any soul power.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Tribe's Wanhua Empress spent tremendous effort and many auxiliary materials to create the Nightmare Realm.</p><p></p><p>This tribal weapon in the hands of the Insect Tribe Empress could unleash power no less than the 'Virtual World' of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The Nightmare Realm?" </p><p></p><p>The nine human civilization Supremes, including Xia Qin, glanced at the Insect Tribe Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," said the silent Xuanyuan Supreme. "The Eleven Realms cannot fully unleash the power of the Nightmare Realm."</p><p></p><p>The more powerful the supreme weapon, the higher the requirements for the user.</p><p></p><p>For weapons like the Nightmare Realm and the Angel's Holy Crown, when grasped by Eleven Realm beings through 'tricks', the power they can unleash is only slightly stronger than ordinary supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme had given Xuanyuan Yu many backup treasures. Not only could they shatter the Nightmare Realm, they could at least block it without any issues.</p><p></p><p>Even before the opening of the super-large battlefield, human civilization had already conducted many simulations and predictions of the means of the other eleven peak tribal forces.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Tribe's Nightmare Realm was completely within their expectations.</p><p></p><p>"But... the Galactic Lord," the Xuanyuan Supreme muttered with slight doubt.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a figure plummeted into the center of the battlefield between human civilization and the Insect Tribe.</p><p></p><p>This figure was the Galactic Lord. With a light stomp of his foot, the terrifying spatiotemporal fluctuations formed a grinding millstone, tearing and crushing countless Insect Tribe warriors.</p><p></p><p>The Eleven Realm Insect Tribe Hives seemed like small boats floating on the sea, about to capsize.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Insect Tribe Alliance, the Hive that was activating the 'Nightmare Realm' retreated greatly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Palace' floating above, constantly emitting void fluctuations, also began to spin rapidly, as if receiving a violent impact.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the gaze of all the Twelve Ultimates converged on the battlefield between human civilization and the Insect Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Previously, most of the Twelve Ultimates had been focused on the battlefields of the Calamity Tribe, the Void, and the Chaos, as the fighting there was the most intense, especially the strongest Eleven Realm of the Calamity Tribe, who was basically suppressing the other peak tribal forces single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>Many Twelve Ultimates planned to glimpse the methods of the Calamity Tribe's two Twelve Ultimates from the strongest Eleven Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord? Just a stomp of his foot, and he almost swept away the Insect Tribe Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Nightmare Realm was impacted and its soul suppression was interrupted?"</p><p></p><p>"What treasure did the Galactic Lord use? Could it be that he brought the true foundation of human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Ultimates looked at each other in disbelief. At least the battle power the Galactic Lord displayed now was at the level of the strongest Eleven Realm of the Calamity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleven Realms of the major tribal groups, each wielding tribal weapons, had to barely hold back the strongest Eleven Realm of the Calamity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the battlefield between human civilization and the Insect Tribe, Lin Yuan looked around. The reason he waited until now to appear was that in the initial large-scale battle, there were still many Eleven Realms who had not yet entered Lin Yuan's killing range.</p><p></p><p>This killing range was a circle with Lin Yuan as the center and a radius of 700 billion li. This was the limit of the world within Lin Yuan's body, and after activating the 'World' divine ability, everything within this 700 billion li became Lin Yuan's world.</p><p></p><p>This did not mean that Lin Yuan's attack range was limited to 700 billion li. Beyond this range, he did not have the absolute certainty to kill.</p><p></p><p>After all, among the Eleven Realm experts who had entered the battlefield, a considerable number possessed supreme weapons to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan faced thousands of enemies, his power dispersed, and with the 700 billion li distance, he did not have the confidence to kill a crazily fleeing Eleven Realm expert with a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>But within the 700 billion li, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of the 'World' divine ability, Lin Yuan's strength would be fully unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time," Lin Yuan said calmly, also sensing the gaze of tens of thousands of Eleven Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he descended, a mere stomp of his foot had caused the entire Insect Tribe Alliance to be thrown into disarray, a scene that was also witnessed by the other peak tribal groups.</p><p></p><p>Such extraordinary strength left all the Eleven Realm experts dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability: World!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and the imprint of the 'World' divine ability deep within his body suddenly began to vibrate and expand. Threads of world power instantly permeated the 700 billion li range, centered on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the super-large battlefield, Lin Yuan had been suppressing his true strength, waiting for this moment.</p><p></p><p>If he had revealed his true power earlier, how could these Eleven Realm experts from the various peak tribal groups have gathered here obediently, allowing Lin Yuan to slaughter them?</p><p></p><p>Although with Lin Yuan here, he would ultimately be able to take control of the super-large battlefield war, if he could not kill those Eleven Realm experts from other tribes, where would he get the resources to cultivate the 'Mysterious Yellow Body'?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A heavy, oppressive aura instantly enveloped the 700 billion li area, and the tens of thousands of Eleven Realm experts immediately felt that their physical bodies and souls were being completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This was not ordinary suppression, but total suppression, with their entire strength reduced to almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>The 'World' divine ability, vast and mighty, with Lin Yuan's current strength, could instantly crush those ordinary Eleven Realm experts under its domain.</p><p></p><p>Even Eleven Realm Perfected experts with supreme weapons could only withstand it for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"My strength has been suppressed by 99%?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galactic Lord, the source of this suppression is the Galactic Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The thought processes of the Eleven Realm experts were extremely fast. They immediately realized that something was amiss, from the Galactic Lord's descent to the battlefield to the current moment, it had only been an instant.</p><p></p><p>In the previous moment, they were still shocked by the Galactic Lord's stomp, and in the next moment, they had all become trapped fish in the 'World' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat, immediately retreat from the Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Retreat from the Galactic Lord, see if we can escape this suppression."</p><p></p><p>The many Eleven Realm experts almost simultaneously made the decision to flee.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful ones had given up on killing each other and instead fled to more distant places.</p><p></p><p>As a natural instinct of the strong, they were told that continuing to hesitate would put their lives in danger. In such a situation, the major peak force groups surprisingly shared a unified goal - to flee in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Flee? Can you really escape?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood at the center of the domain covered by his divine ability "World". As the user of this divine ability, he had complete control over everything within a range of 700 billion li.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the expressions of those Eleventh Rank experts, the surging of their inner qi, and their desperate measures - all of it was observed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated his divine ability "World", harnessing the immense power of the 700 billion li world to crush all non-human civilization alliance experts, except for the human ones.</p><p></p><p>The duration of the "World" divine ability was only six seconds.</p><p></p><p>From the activation of the "World" divine ability to the enveloping of the 700 billion li domain, only one-hundredth of a second had passed.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming world forces poured down and crushed everything in their path.</p><p></p><p>In just one second, the first round of the world force's crushing was completed. Within the 700 billion li domain, all Eleventh Rank experts from the first to the fourth tiers, who did not have supreme divine weapons to protect them, were annihilated.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the number of Eleventh Rank experts from the various peak force groups who had entered the battlefield reached tens of thousands, but those below the fifth tier accounted for 90%.</p><p></p><p>And now, after just the first round of the world force's crushing, tens of thousands of Eleventh Rank experts had been extinguished, leaving only a few thousand Eleventh Rank experts of the fifth tier and above.</p><p></p><p>These survivors were able to withstand the first round of crushing not because of their own strength, as to Lin Yuan, the difference between the first and fifth tiers of the Eleventh Rank was not significant.</p><p></p><p>They were able to survive because they were equipped with supreme divine weapons, which belonged to the Twelfth Rank power level and shielded them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even with the protection of the supreme divine weapons, most of the Eleventh Rank fifth-tier experts were still deathly pale. Under the overwhelming world forces, the supreme divine weapons could only block 99.99% of the power.</p><p></p><p>But even the remaining one-hundredth of a percent that seeped through had severely injured these Eleventh Rank fifth-tier experts.</p><p></p><p>"I have the supreme divine armor to protect me, yet I still cannot block it completely? What kind of technique is this?" The Eleventh Rank Celestial Lord of the Tian Yu Clan exclaimed in terror as he looked around and saw that 90% of the Eleventh Rank Celestial Lords of his clan had been annihilated, leaving only a few who possessed supreme divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Flee. We can't stay here any longer."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Rank Celestial Lords panicked. Even facing the strongest Eleventh Rank expert, Tian Yu Meng, they had never experienced such a desperate moment.</p><p></p><p>So many Tian Yu Clan Eleventh Rank Celestial Lords had died? </p><p></p><p>This Eleventh Rank Celestial Lord wanted to flee without any regard.</p><p></p><p>But under the suppression of the external world, his speed was as slow as a turtle's.</p><p></p><p>Before he could escape far, the second round of the overwhelming world force's crushing descended upon him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's estimation, the external world that lasted for six seconds could complete five rounds of crushing, taking five seconds.</p><p></p><p>As for the last second? It would be used to detonate the entire external world, which was the most powerful way to unleash its might. What kind of power would be generated if the 700 billion li internal world self-destructed?</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh?!!"</p><p></p><p>The second round of crushing descended, and even with the supreme divine weapon protecting him, the Tian Yu Clan Eleventh Rank Celestial Lord could not endure it. The residual power that seeped through annihilated his physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>The second second passed.</p><p></p><p>The external world had completed the second round of crushing.</p><p></p><p>Under the second round of crushing, one-fifth of the Eleventh Rank fifth-tier experts with supreme divine weapons had perished.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eleventh Rank sixth-tier, the true Eleventh Rank perfected experts, they were barely clinging to life with the aid of the supreme divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"These Eleventh Rank experts still can't be underestimated," Lin Yuan thought to himself, as the external world entered the third second, and the third round of world crushing began to descend.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Eleventh Rank fifth-tier experts rapidly fell, and the remaining Eleventh Rank sixth-tier experts were trembling in their souls. Originally, they had planned to just observe, but the consequences turned out to be so severe.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, flee!"</p><p></p><p>"What is happening?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Silver Galaxy Master's doing?"</p><p></p><p>"How could the Silver Galaxy Master have such terrifying power?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be an Ascended One. An Ascended One is disregarding the agreement and attacking us."</p><p></p><p>The anguished cries of the numerous Eleventh Rank experts echoed through the 700 billion li space, filled with deep resentment and fear.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of all the Eleventh Rank experts, the only ones capable of unleashing such power were the Ascended Ones.</p><p></p><p>The third second passed.</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Rank fifth-tier experts were now few in number, and the Eleventh Rank sixth-tier experts began to suffer casualties.</p><p></p><p>Supreme divine weapons came in different types, some for attack and some for defense. Certain Eleventh Rank sixth-tier experts wielding offensive supreme divine weapons were not as capable in defense as the fifth-tier experts with defensive supreme divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The fourth second arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to die?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings' expression was one of despair. The successive four rounds of world force crushing had left this legendary Eleventh Rank perfected expert on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if not for the protection of the supreme divine weapon, the Four Divine Kings' strength would most likely not have lasted even the first second.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Master?"</p><p></p><p>Just before his physical body and soul completely collapsed, the Four Divine Kings stopped fleeing and turned to look at the Silver Galaxy Master standing in the center of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, when he learned that the Silver Galaxy Master was the Human Bloodbath, he was not only astonished but also realized that the gap between himself and the Silver Galaxy Master might not be as vast as in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of Eleventh Rank experts, including those wielding supreme divine weapons, could not withstand even a few seconds in the face of the Silver Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings' thoughts abruptly halted, for the clone of himself on the battlefield had already been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around.</p><p></p><p>When the "World" divine ability had just coalesced, the tremendous commotion caused by the tens of thousands of Eleventh Rank experts trying to break free from the suppression.</p><p></p><p>But after the first second passed, 90% of the Eleventh Rank experts had died, and the area within the external world had become much quieter, though still filled with some agonizing screams and resentful roars.</p><p></p><p>But as the second, third, and fourth seconds passed, the area within the external world had become completely silent.</p><p></p><p>The four rounds of overwhelming world force crushing had annihilated even the Eleventh Rank perfected experts, leaving only a few dozen of the mightiest Eleventh Rank experts from the various peak force groups, who were now struggling to survive.</p>

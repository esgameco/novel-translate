        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 431: I'll Be Waiting for You at the Eleventh Realm (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"My mental willpower is now too strong. Any Paramount Being would be able to sense it with just a slight perception," the Galactic Prime Star, Lin Yuan, thought to himself as he sat cross-legged in meditation. </p><p></p><p>This was one of the drawbacks of his mental willpower advancing too quickly - his realm had not caught up yet.</p><p></p><p>"But once I cross into the Eleventh Realm, it should get much better."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself. After crossing into the Eleventh Realm, the inner world within Lin Yuan's physical body and soul would undergo another major leap forward. </p><p></p><p>At that time, it was estimated that he would barely be able to withstand over 333 million units of mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>Then, unless Lin Yuan used his full power and deliberately exposed himself, even Paramount Beings would find it very difficult to detect the abnormality of his mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, Lin Yuan met with his parents and casually chatted with them.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan, your sister and brother-in-law are coming over too," his mother Lu Qiong said after receiving the news, looking towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let them come over," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ever since his sister Lin Yi married Xia Keran, he had rarely seen them.  </p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yi and Xia Keran appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galactic Prime Star," Xia Keran said very respectfully when facing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ever since marrying Lin Yi, Xia Keran had clearly felt that his status within the Xia family had risen by more than just one level.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xia Keran was merely an ordinary legitimate member of the Xia family. With the immense scale of the human Xia family, there were no less than 800,000 of such legitimate members.</p><p></p><p>He had a certain status and didn't lack for food and drink, but that was about it.  </p><p></p><p>With just the status of a legitimate Xia family member, Xia Keran could have lived a carefree life, but he basically had no chance of ever reaching the higher levels of power.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were ahead of him in line.</p><p></p><p>But simply by being with Lin Yi, Xia Keran was summoned to meet the Eleventh Realm elder patriarch of the Xia family.</p><p></p><p>After the two got married, Xia Keran directly entered the core of the Xia family, and even had the hope of becoming the next Xia family patriarch.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Xia family was a major figure in human civilization, wielding great influence. This was a status Xia Keran had never even dared to dream of before.</p><p></p><p>However, Xia Keran had a very clear understanding of himself. All of the changes to his status and identity now stemmed from the Galactic Prime Star.  </p><p></p><p>Without the Galactic Prime Star, Xia Keran would have remained just an insignificant legitimate disciple among the vast numbers of the human Xia family.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the other party's feelings towards Lin Yi were genuine. With Lin Yuan's current authority as a Ninth Rank citizen, Xia Keran basically had no privacy from him.</p><p></p><p>The family chatted about daily life for a while before Lin Yuan got up to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone outside says the Galactic Prime Star has the greatest talent in human civilization, but who knows that besides cultivation, he has no other interests," Xia Keran finally relaxed a bit after Lin Yuan left. For some reason, every time he saw the Galactic Prime Star, he felt extremely nervous and didn't even dare breathe heavily.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and three months went by in the blink of an eye.  </p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, that bodily projection was still suspended in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly broke out of his contemplative state. "In these three months, I've comprehended over 200 million paths of demonic evolution. There are no more paths of demonic evolution left for me to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. At this moment, the body he was contemplating was only a projection, naturally containing less information than his true physical body.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, I'll go to Realm 13 for now."</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Prime Star, Lin Yuan opened his eyes and separated a strand of mental willpower to form an avatar that immediately disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength of mental willpower, even just a temporarily condensed avatar could easily manifest the power of the Eleventh Realm.  </p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of powerful mental willpower. An avatar formed by a Paramount Being could similarly manifest power far surpassing the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>The avatar condensed by Lin Yuan instantly left the Galactic Prime Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time..."</p><p></p><p>With powerful mental willpower, this avatar could also manifest most of Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules, including the Six Realms of space-time.</p><p></p><p>So in terms of traveling speed, undoubtedly it was currently the fastest existence in human civilization below the Paramount Beings, without relying on external forces.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "fastest" was premised on other evolutionary cultivators of human civilization not relying on external assistance for travel.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on his own comprehension of the rules, Lin Yuan believed that no Eleventh Realm perfected cultivator could surpass the speed of this avatar of his.</p><p></p><p>A month later, as one of the vital realms of human civilization, any citizen entering this place needed to undergo multiple levels of verification.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan possessed the authority bestowed by the Paramount Being Xia Qin, so he naturally encountered no obstructions along the way and went directly to the depths of the vital realm.</p><p></p><p>"This vital realm is also a formidable Paramount weapon," Lin Yuan observed his surroundings, vaguely sensing a pressure.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yuan arrived before a great palace hall. After verifying his identity and soul, Lin Yuan smoothly entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, the interior space of the hall didn't seem very large, only a few dozen square miles.</p><p></p><p>But once Lin Yuan entered...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, he found himself in a vast expanse of space and time. </p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>At first glance, Lin Yuan saw that body lying at the center of this space and time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the projection in the virtual world, this body was now more realistic and intricate, with even the textures clearly visible. </p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming spiritual will pressure, surging like an ocean, poured down upon Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged. This spiritual will pressure far exceeded that of the projection in the virtual world, enough to shatter the will of an eleventh-stage evolutionary in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Even a perfected eleventh-stage evolutionary would not be able to withstand it for long in the face of this body, and might afterwards be left with some irreversible hidden threat.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>It was but a gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>With a spiritual will index of 33,434 million points, not to mention just a body, even if this supreme expert came back to life without using any other powers, Lin Yuan was confident he could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"The body of a supreme expert?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan approached to within ten meters, the optimal distance to observe the body.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, the projection of the body that Lin Yuan saw was blurred in many places, but now he could observe every detail of the flesh and blood with utmost clarity.</p><p></p><p>The skin of this body was like crystal, with a faint black membrane on the surface layer.</p><p></p><p>"These are the marks of cultivating the Demon Jade Indestructible Body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled. After becoming a core disciple of the Demon Jade Pavilion, he could choose from many secret arts, including the Demon Jade Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, Lin Yuan chose 'Virtual Reality', allowing his two elemental souls to transform into avatars with power approaching his true self.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made this choice not because the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' was weak, but because he needed the 'Virtual Reality' secret art more at the time.</p><p></p><p>"Did the cultivator of the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' perish?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, as a twelfth-stage body refining secret art, the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' was probably on the same level as the 'Profound Yellow Body', excelling in survival ability.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this supreme expert still perished.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after perishing, the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' within his flesh was broken open, otherwise those few supreme experts in the universe at that time would not have been able to 'dismember' this supreme expert so easily.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the 'Profound Yellow Body' to the perfected twelfth-stage realm allows one to withstand the collapse of the universe. The 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' was probably of a similar level.</p><p></p><p>Even without cultivating the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' to perfection, it should not have been possible for a few supreme experts to easily tear apart the flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn. Within the universe, supreme experts were absolute and invincible. Since the beginning of the universe's creation, there had never been news of a supreme expert perishing completely.</p><p></p><p>No matter how tragic the great war, at most they would be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>But outside the universe, in the chaos void, even supreme experts could die.</p><p></p><p>Only those as powerful as the Profound Emperor or the Master of the Demon Jade Pavilion could roam freely in the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. When directly facing this body, the comprehension that had stagnated before continued to surge madly into his mind.</p><p></p><p>[With your extraordinary comprehension, observing the mysterious body has allowed you to comprehend new paths of demonic evolution.]</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan continued to comprehend, a vast number of brand new paths of demonic evolution were comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I could try to comprehend the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' directly?" Lin Yuan suddenly had this thought.</p><p></p><p>Being able to be chosen alongside 'Virtual Reality', the preciousness of the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' needs no further explanation.</p><p></p><p>Since this body still retained the marks of cultivating the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body', with Lin Yuan's heavenly comprehension, he could comprehend part of it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not comprehend the complete 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body', just comprehending a portion would be an immense gain.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>On the eve of his breakthrough to the eleventh stage, Lin Yuan focused mainly on adjusting his own state, with cultivation being secondary.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign, how has your cultivation been recently?" the Black Star Sovereign smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>As a ninth-grade supreme, the Black Star Sovereign had taken the initiative to befriend Lin Yuan before he even entered the ninth grade, clearly placing great importance on this Galaxy Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Star Sovereign has already comprehended the second level of the Pillar Fusion Rules, he should be able to assault the eleventh stage soon," the Jade Sovereign interjected.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the second level of the Pillar-grade Fusion Rules, it would take as little as ten years or as long as a few hundred years to assault the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations," Lin Yuan immediately offered his congratulations upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>For any ninth-stage evolutionary, crossing into the eleventh stage was the greatest event, second to none.</p><p></p><p>After all, the twelfth stage supreme expert was an ultimate goal that almost all eleventh-stage evolutionaries could not achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Black Star Sovereign's face as he looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Galaxy Sovereign, with your talents, it's only a matter of time before you cross into the eleventh stage too."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go ahead and break through first, and wait for you in the eleventh stage."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 683</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the power of his spiritual consciousness was being eroded and suppressed, causing his awareness to be slightly muddled, unable to fully awaken.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long it had been, but Lin Yuan's innate spiritual power finally managed to expel that invasive aura.</p><p></p><p>The result of this was that Lin Yuan woke up.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only felt his head throbbing painfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also began to receive information from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? You actually managed to come back to life?"</p><p></p><p>"It's rare to see someone survive under the corrosion of the 'Demon'."</p><p></p><p>An aged voice came from beside him, tinged with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Countless pieces of information surged into Lin Yuan's mind - the memories of the 'original body'.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there is endless 'Demon' that cannot be exterminated, existing eternally. To contend with the Demons, one can only become a cultivator. And I am a cultivator of the Qingyun Sacred Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly clarified the current situation he found himself in.</p><p></p><p>This world was boundless, and the Demons did not exist since ancient times, but rather emerged after a great cataclysm millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Millions of years ago, cultivators ruled the world and dominated everything. But after that great cataclysm, 'Demons' came into being, their aura permeating everywhere and hindering the cultivation of the cultivators. At the same time, the concentrated Demon qi gave birth to terrifying Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun Sacred Sect that the 'original body' belonged to was once a supreme cultivator force before the great cataclysm, the hegemon of the surrounding boundless domains.</p><p></p><p>After the great cataclysm, they had weathered many great Demon attacks.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to before the cataclysm, the Qingyun Sacred Sect had already declined significantly.</p><p></p><p>The pervasive Demon qi had increased the difficulty of cultivation, reducing the number of powerful cultivators being produced. As the older generation of strong cultivators fell one by one to the Demons, the Qingyun Sacred Sect was on the verge of a generational gap.</p><p></p><p>Fledgling forces with insufficient foundations could not carry on their legacy to the present day.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and saw an unkempt old man standing beside him, curiously observing him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fang."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan moved his lips and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang was a Qingyun Sacred Sect elder, responsible for treating disciples injured by the Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've woken up, then I'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang continued to observe Lin Yuan for a while before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>"This physique..." Lin Yuan watched Elder Fang disappear, then began to sense the subtle changes in his body, only to find something amiss.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch of the Martial Dao, Lin Yuan's understanding of the physical body had reached an inconceivable level. Yet the body he now occupied, though weak, faintly contained almost limitless potential.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not an isolated case, this is one of the impacts of that great cataclysm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After the great cataclysm, while terrifying Demons had emerged in this world, the life forms here had also been nourished and enhanced. Both in terms of strength and potential, they far surpassed the pre-cataclysm era.</p><p></p><p>The power of the physique would directly boost one's strength. Although the influence of Demon qi had slowed down the speed of cultivation, the enhancement of the physique had accelerated by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the keys for cultivators to resist the Demons after the great cataclysm. If not for this boost, the Qingyun Sacred Sect would have perished long ago in the successive Demon attacks, unable to persist until now.</p><p></p><p>"A physique with such potential, cultivated to the extreme, might even surpass the fleshly bodies of the Chaotic Void and the First Source World?" Lin Yuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>No matter the Chaotic Void or the First Source World, Lin Yuan's fleshly body was already terrifyingly powerful, but this Source World's physique could even surpass the previous two? Even more unbelievable was that such physiques were 'common' in this world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, due to the inability to fully unleash their potential, the life forms in this world, despite having limitless potential in their physiques, did not know how to utilize them properly.</p><p></p><p>It was akin to a primitive society obtaining nuclear weapons but treating them as mere stones to be thrown.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan adjusted his breathing and soon recovered a bit, managing to sit up from the bed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a series of images flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li has actually fallen to the Demons?" Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had suffered such severe injuries was related to Brother Li's fall to the Demons.</p><p></p><p>Brother Li was the Qingyun Sacred Sect's Eldest Disciple, often leading many junior disciples to disperse the surrounding Demon qi.</p><p></p><p>The concentrated Demon qi could give birth to terrifying 'Demons', so the Qingyun Sacred Sect disciples would regularly patrol the vicinity to disperse the gathered Demon qi, thus preventing the birth of Demons.</p><p></p><p>But in a recent Demon qi dispersion operation, the leading Brother Li, upon discovering a source of dense Demon qi, secretly absorbed and devoured it.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by the 'original body', and Brother Li directly attacked him, using Demon qi to erode and extinguish the 'original body's' spiritual consciousness, creating the illusion of his death at the hands of the Demons.</p><p></p><p>The 'original body's' spiritual consciousness should have been completely consumed by the Demon qi, but it was immediately replaced by Lin Yuan. With Lin Yuan's spiritual will, he naturally blocked the subsequent Demon qi invasion, appearing to have 'come back to life' in Elder Fang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen to the Demons."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>After the great cataclysm, the endless Demon qi had flooded the world, causing unprecedented impact on the cultivators. Witnessing the power of the Demons, a division gradually emerged within the cultivator community.</p><p></p><p>One group was the ones who insisted on the current cultivation system, known as the traditional cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The other group were the ones who chose to become Demon-cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these Demon-cultivators, the Demons were indestructible, so the only way to contend with them was to become Demons themselves, using the power of Demons to fight against the Demons.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the phenomenon of 'falling to the Demons' emerged.</p><p></p><p>To 'fall to the Demons' meant that cultivators would abandon everything and begin to endure the baptism of Demon qi, during which they would be greatly influenced by the Demon qi.</p><p></p><p>"Falling to the Demons? Essentially, it's just using cultivators as vessels to cultivate a powerful 'Demon'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recalled the Qingyun Sacred Sect's evaluation of those who fell to the Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun Sacred Sect was a traditional cultivation force, and they strictly prohibited falling to the Demons. In the beginning, those who fell to the Demons could indeed obtain a tremendous boost in strength.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, as they were increasingly corroded by the Demon qi, the mental state of the Demon-cultivators would rapidly distort, drawing them closer to becoming true 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the most pressing matter is how to deal with Brother Li."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts, his expression turning grave.</p><p></p><p>Brother Li had used Demon qi to erode the 'original body's' spiritual consciousness, with the purpose of silencing him and preventing the news of his fall to the Demons from spreading.</p><p></p><p>If he discovered that the 'original body' was not dead, he would certainly not let it go.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li is the Qingyun Sacred Sect's Eldest Disciple, possessing Sovereign Realm strength. In my current state, I'm no match for him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after falling to the Demons, Brother Li's strength would have surged even further, perhaps even reaching the level of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, facing Brother Li's murderous intent, Lin Yuan had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Unless he used the power of the Boundary Breaking Source.</p><p></p><p>But the Boundary Breaking Source was a trump card among trump cards, to be used only when absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this unfamiliar Source World, rashly using the Boundary Breaking Source might bring some hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought it over and immediately contacted the just-departed Elder Fang.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Elder Fang quickly reappeared, looking at Lin Yuan. "You've recovered quite well, why are you calling me?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fang, I have an important matter to report to the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yuan was certain that Elder Fang should not be one of Li Shixiong's people, otherwise Li Shixiong would have known the moment he woke up, and he would have rushed over by now.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Elder Fang could be trusted.</p><p></p><p>"A major event?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang glanced at Lin Yuan: "What major event?"</p><p></p><p>"An event related to the Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Since he had confirmed that he was definitely not Li Shixiong's opponent, the only one he could rely on was the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had originally been injured by the Demon Realm, so his words were quite convincing to Elder Fang.</p><p></p><p>At least it was not without any basis.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure it's a major event? Ordinary matters that disturb the Sect Master will be punished." Elder Fang reminded.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud was mostly in seclusion to improve his cultivation, facing one Demon Realm attack after another.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang immediately planned to take Lin Yuan with him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fang." Lin Yuan said: "This matter is very important, please don't let it leak out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was worried that Elder Fang would inadvertently reveal it to Li Shixiong, unnecessarily adding variables.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang glanced at Lin Yuan, "I know the importance."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether Lin Yuan's matter was real or not, Elder Fang would definitely not disclose it to the outside world before getting the Sect Master's confirmation.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang led Lin Yuan to take a step.</p><p></p><p>The space-time changed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they arrived at a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the hall, a middle-aged man in a blue robe was sitting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man opened his eyes and looked at Elder Fang and Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang slightly bowed and briefly explained Lin Yuan's matter.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud looked at Lin Yuan, speaking calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Elder Fang standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang was slightly taken aback, but immediately turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the grand hall was left with only Lin Yuan and the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what's the matter."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong has already fallen to the Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not beat around the bush and said it directly.</p><p></p><p>"Qing'er has fallen to the Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud's pupils contracted, and he stood up from the throne.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know this?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud narrowed his eyes, and the surrounding space-time became oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Shixiong Li Qing was the eldest disciple of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, being cultivated as the future Sect Master. The Sect Master naturally did not believe that Shixiong had fallen to the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I was attacked by the Demonic Qi is that I detected Shixiong absorbing and devouring the Demonic Qi." Lin Yuan looked at the Sect Master and said.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud did not respond, only silently looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, if this is false, I am willing to accept any punishment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jade Purity Hall.</p><p></p><p>This was the grand hall of the eldest disciple of the Holy Sect, second only to the Sect Master's residence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qing was sitting cross-legged in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"To preserve the legacy of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, I can only rely on the power of the Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing silently thought to himself. As the eldest disciple of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, he desired more than anyone for the Holy Sect to continue its legacy.</p><p></p><p>However, the "Demons" in the heavens and the earth were becoming more and more numerous and powerful, and it was becoming increasingly difficult for the traditional cultivators to resist the Demons. In the last major Demon Realm attack, the foundation of the Azure Cloud Mountain had been nearly exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was very clear about the hidden dangers of falling to the Demon Realm, but this was the fastest way to improve his cultivation, without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Qing was shocked to find that the formation in the Jade Purity Hall suddenly fluctuated, and a powerful spatial force came to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's expression changed drastically, wanting to rush out, but he was firmly confined by the omnipresent formation power.</p><p></p><p>"Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing found it unbelievable. The only one who could mobilize the entire formation of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud was the Sect Master, his own master.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The space-time changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing instantly appeared outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>He saw the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud high above, and Lin Yuan standing beside the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"You're not dead?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes were filled with disbelief. Lin Yuan had actually survived the Demonic Qi's invasion.</p><p></p><p>"Qing'er, stop resisting."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud looked at Li Qing and said, "As long as I confirm that you have no connection with the Demon Realm, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Although the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud did not believe that his disciple would fall to the Demon Realm, this kind of matter must be considered from the worst-case scenario.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, letting him thoroughly examine it once would not be a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing looked at the Sect Master, his tone slightly complicated: "I have indeed fallen to the Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan, Li Qing realized that his fall to the Demon Realm could no longer be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Since this was such a major event, no matter who said it, the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud would have to confirm it with him.</p><p></p><p>"Qing'er, you...?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud shook his head slightly, his expression showing a touch of sadness. "Don't you know what it means to fall to the Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I know."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded: "But I know better that if I don't fall to the Demon Realm, how long can my Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud withstand the next major Demon Realm attack?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, you should also be aware that even if we can withstand the next Demon Realm attack, how long can we last the one after that? And the one after that?"</p><p></p><p>"Without falling to the Demon Realm, the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud will eventually be unable to resist the great Demons, but by falling to the Demon Realm, the Holy Sect will have a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing said.</p><p></p><p>"Falling to the Demon Realm will only create an even more powerful 'Demon' in this world." The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you have to believe me, I can definitely resist the influence of the Demonic Qi." Li Qing said urgently.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qing, you have already been affected by the Demonic Qi." The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud's gaze was disappointed, and he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Majestic spatial forces converged towards Li Qing, this was the power of the protective formation of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, almost reaching the perfect level of the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you actually don't believe me, you actually don't believe me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes suddenly erupted with an extremely deep Demonic Qi, invading the spatial forces from all directions that were pressing down on him.</p><p></p><p>But obviously,</p><p></p><p>The current Li Qing was unable to withstand the protective formation of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, and was quickly eroded.</p><p></p><p>The most promising disciple of the current Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, who had the hope of stepping into the Chaos Realm, perished here.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood beside the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, silently watching this scene.</p><p></p><p>What Li Qing said was indeed the truth, and Lin Yuan also felt that Li Qing had truly fallen to the Demon Realm in order to save the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Li Qing's status as the eldest disciple of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud and the future Sect Master, even if the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud was eventually destroyed by the great Demons, Li Qing could still escape.</p><p></p><p>"This world"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt an even deeper sense of the despair faced by all living beings in this realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

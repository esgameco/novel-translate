        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will has returned.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a tremendous transformation occurred within him.</p><p></p><p>During the ultimate breakthrough, Lin Yuan went from falling into the world of demonic thoughts to breaking free.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that countless cosmic eras had passed, but only a dozen breaths had elapsed in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Yet in just those dozen breaths, Lin Yuan's physical body, spiritual soul, and even the inner world within him had expanded immensely.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body." Lin Yuan looked at his own hands.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, every drop of his blood was filled with boundless power. Relying solely on the strength of his physical body, without resorting to other rule-based methods, his pure physical power alone could suppress even the strongest cultivators at the Dao Parting realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancient Extreme Powerful Ones, one of the nine mightiest in human civilization, who specialized in the path of physical strength, would certainly be inferior to Lin Yuan in terms of physical prowess.</p><p></p><p>This is not to say that the path of the Ancient Extreme Powerful Ones is flawed, but rather that Lin Yuan's foundation is too formidable. He has endured the absorption of an immense amount of the primal chaos void origin, and even just a tenth of it being absorbed by his physical body has brought about an enhancement far exceeding the full benefits of breaking through from the Eleventh to the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the primal chaos void origin, the various blessings he has received, such as the Mysterious Gourd, the Xuanhuang Physique, and the Unbreakable Demonic Jade Body, have also allowed Lin Yuan's physical body to reach an inconceivable level.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Physique."</p><p></p><p>With the transformation of his life essence complete, Lin Yuan has smoothly advanced to the Twelfth Realm, and the Xuanhuang Physique he cultivates has also reached the Twelfth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Inhale! Exhale! Just by circulating it for a while, Lin Yuan's physical strength has increased significantly, but it soon stops.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it - the Xuanhuang Physique's consumption of resources is too terrifying. Even if he reaches the perfect Twelfth Realm Dao Parting realm, Lin Yuan sees no hope within this universe.</p><p></p><p>"However, the cultivation resources for the Xuanhuang Physique can be obtained from the Ancient Chaotic Continent?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The universal rules restrict any Twelfth Realm existence from leaving the universe, and the only thing they can do is condense a negligible avatar.</p><p></p><p>But the universal rules do not limit the entry of resources from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can completely obtain various resources from the Ancient Chaotic Continent and then send them back to his true self for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for how to obtain these resources? The simplest way is to sell the Chaotic Realm secret treasure left behind by the peak Sovereign realm expert, "Cang Weiyang."</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan has now advanced to the Twelfth Realm, he cannot activate the Chaotic Realm secret treasure in the short term. Rather than letting it gather dust, it would be better to convert it into his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The value of the Chaotic Realm secret treasure is more than enough to provide the resources for Lin Yuan to cultivate the Xuanhuang Physique to the perfect Dao Parting realm.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of my spiritual soul has also reached the peak of the Dao Parting realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, as the spiritual soul is determined by the physical body and spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>After the ultimate breakthrough, upon entering the Twelfth Realm, the enhancement of his spiritual soul is only natural.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual will... has reached at least 60 million points." Lin Yuan let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of spiritual will is far more difficult than that of the physical body and spiritual soul, especially after reaching 20 million points of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>During the Eleventh Realm journey, Lin Yuan spent hundreds of years observing and comprehending the rules at the core of the Immortal Realm origin, and his spiritual will index barely reached 40 million points.</p><p></p><p>40 million points of spiritual will is already at the peak of the Dao Parting realm, and many peak Dao Parting realm experts do not possess such powerful spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>As for 60 million points of spiritual will? It is likely already at the peak of the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The leap from 40 million to 60 million points of spiritual will is far more significant than the normal breakthrough from the Eleventh to Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The source of the power of the demonic thought world I experienced came from the main stream of the time river, and it was formed based on my own foundation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In that demonic thought world, Lin Yuan did not know how many cosmic eras he had traversed, thousands or even tens of thousands? How could a normal Eleventh Realm cultivator experience a hell-level difficulty demonic thought world like that? The only possibility is that the difficulty of the demonic thought world Lin Yuan experienced was greatly elevated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while the difficulty of the demonic thought world was raised, the benefits obtained upon overcoming it were also immense, as evidenced by the 60 million points of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they say that even with a strong foundation, breaking through to the Twelfth Realm is not guaranteed. The other aspects may be manageable, but the demonic thought world poses a different standard for each Eleventh Realm cultivator. The stronger the foundation, the more difficult the demonic thought world faced."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before experiencing the demonic thought world, the so-called time river backlash and the so-called universal backlash were like a gentle breeze to Lin Yuan, having no effect on him at all.</p><p></p><p>It was only when the demonic thought world descended that Lin Yuan felt the true difficulty.</p><p></p><p>In that demonic thought world filled with countless tribulations, apart from his memories, Lin Yuan was no different from an ordinary mortal. Even his memories began to blur as hundreds or thousands of cosmic eras passed.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the widespread dissemination of the martial dao evolution path, which could serve as an "anchor" for Lin Yuan to lock onto his own identity, even if he could successfully traverse the demonic thought world, it would not have been so easy.</p><p></p><p>"The inner universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his inner universe has reached a radius of 220 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that before the ultimate breakthrough, Lin Yuan's inner universe had only expanded to a range of 50 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>From 50 million light-years to 220 million light-years, it may seem like only a four or five-fold increase, but the difference in volume is dozens or even hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>"After the ultimate breakthrough, my inner universe will continue to expand, and its final limit should be around 800 million light-years in radius."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Normal Twelfth Realm Dao Parting realm experts have an inner universe that ultimately ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years, but Lin Yuan can reach 800 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Even the inner universe of the Sovereign realm is not much more than this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood. An inner universe with a range of 800 million light-years would be considered vast and boundless, even among the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>And within this universe? Probably all the inner universes of the ultimate Twelfth Realm cultivators combined would not even fill one-thousandth of Lin Yuan's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"My current realm... With the comprehension of various rules, I have already reached the peak of the Dao Parting realm upon entering it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is in terms of realm.</p><p></p><p>As for combat power?</p><p></p><p>Whether it is in physical body, spiritual soul, inner world, or rule comprehension, Lin Yuan far surpasses the normal Dao Parting realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if his life level has not yet reached the Sovereign realm, Lin Yuan's actual combat power is not weaker than any Sovereign realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the peak of the Dao Parting realm on par with the Sovereign realm is extremely rare in the vast chaotic void, and it is usually only the descendants of the great saints or those with a trace of time bloodline who can achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan has just entered the Dao Parting realm, and the next few hundred or thousand years will be a period of rapid increase in his strength. Reaching the peak of the Sovereign realm is not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"My combat power... has been suppressed." Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was powerful enough to rival the Sovereign realm, but his strength was being constrained.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power that rivaled the Dominator realm was subtly suppressed by this universe, only able to display the peak of the Paragon realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised by this, as there was information recorded in the lineage of the Xuan-Huang that described such a situation.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void nurtured countless universes, and within these universes, countless life forms were born. The upper limit of power within a universe was the peak of the Paragon realm.</p><p></p><p>Why was the peak of a universe only at the Paragon realm? Crossing into the Dominator realm within a single universe cycle was indeed very difficult, but with countless universes and the passage of countless universe cycles, surely there would be an exception? Even if normal life forms could not achieve it, what about the reincarnated Chaos Sages? If they were to recover a portion of their memories, could they not cross into the Dominator realm within a single universe cycle?</p><p></p><p>The truth was that the universe itself would suppress anything beyond the peak of the Paragon realm, that is, the Dominator realm level.</p><p></p><p>This was a limitation of the greater environment. Even for the reincarnated Chaos Sages, they had to abide by this. To display the power of the Dominator realm or even the Chaos realm, they could only go to the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this limitation was not unbreakable. That was to possess the power of a Chaos Sage within the universe.</p><p></p><p>Such power could shatter everything within the universe, causing a premature great destruction, exceeding the limits of the universe's suppression.</p><p></p><p>But this was too difficult. Even for those Chaos Sages, to recover to the Sage-level power within a single universe cycle was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Sage-level power not only required a profound understanding of the rules, but also a powerful physical body and soul to support it.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this level, it would require an astronomical amount of resources, even draining countless chaotic continents would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Paragon realm power is sufficient." Lin Yuan thought for a while and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>With his innate talents and methods, even with only the peak of the Paragon realm, he could easily subdue all the Ultimate 12th Realms within this universe.</p><p></p><p>If those Ultimate 12th Realms dared to engage in battle with Lin Yuan, their only fate would be complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? My gourd?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to have remembered something, raising his right hand and reaching into the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>When he withdrew his hand, a mysterious gourd the size of a palm appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious gourd was a spoil of war that Lin Yuan obtained when he took control of the Milky Way Star Realm. Its effects were extraordinarily powerful, able to break through the limits of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>It also had the effect of breaking through the limits of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Even now, Lin Yuan had not heard of any similar abilities. The treasure troves in the chaotic void were countless, and there should be similar treasures with almost the same effects.</p><p></p><p>But none were as rare as this. Even Chaos Lords or Chaos Sages were hard to come by, let alone this mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>The liquid inside contained all kinds of essences.</p><p></p><p>At least Lin Yuan had not discovered any signs of it being depleted.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan had completely absorbed the seven-colored liquids within the mysterious gourd, he found that the next step for the mysterious gourd was for his inner world to evolve into an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>That is, to cross into the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the assault on the Ultimate, Lin Yuan had prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>That was, if the assault failed, he would be completely annihilated, and even the Gate of the Myriad Realms could not save him.</p><p></p><p>So he did not carry the mysterious gourd with him, but placed it in the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's mastery of space-time, the Ultimate 12th Realms in this universe would never be able to find the location of the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>After a million years, as long as Lin Yuan did not take out the gourd, the spatial shackles locking it would be released, and the gourd would float towards the central star domain of human civilization, carrying the information Lin Yuan left behind.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's plan, if he were to truly perish and die, the mysterious gourd left for human civilization could continue to play its role.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed that everything was going smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the gourd in his hand, and as he made skin contact with it, the gourd seemed to sense something, and the originally gray-purple color began to fade.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a metamorphosis and incubation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed in his heart, and then placed the mysterious gourd back into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Based on the speed at which the gray-purple color was fading, this metamorphosis and incubation should not be completed in a short time.</p><p></p><p>In various corners of the universe, many Ultimate 12th Realms were closely monitoring Lin Yuan's assault on the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Whether Lin Yuan could cross into the 12th Realm was related to the future situation of this universe, and no Ultimate 12th Realm expert dared to ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Insect Clan and the Heavenly Feather Clan, who were already mortal enemies of human civilization. Their hatred could not be resolved.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan truly crossed into the 12th Realm, then in the long years to come, they and their clans would certainly not have a good time, and they might even end up hiding in their clan's protective weapons, barely surviving.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord, you must fail."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you must not cross into the 12th Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate 12th Realms all secretly wished for this in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the aura and karma of the Silver Galaxy Lord appeared in the universe again, and at the same time, the various Ultimate 12th Realms also sensed the Silver Galaxy Lord's aura and karma.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the Ultimate 12th Realms fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The reappearance of the Silver Galaxy Lord's aura and karma meant that he had succeeded in his assault on the Ultimate and smoothly crossed into the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>If the assault had failed, his life essence and everything would have been completely annihilated, and there would not have been the slightest trace of his aura and karma.</p><p></p><p>"The 12th Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Silver Galaxy Lord has crossed into the 12th Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's over. When the Silver Galaxy Lord was at the 11th Realm, he could already suppress the 12th Realm. Now that he has reached the 12th Realm, his life essence has leapt, and his inner world has expanded. The Silver Galaxy Lord's strength will be far beyond what it was before."</p><p></p><p>"Who can deal with the Silver Galaxy Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"I need to contact human civilization and seek reconciliation with the Silver Galaxy Lord."</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of the numerous Ultimate 12th Realms were diverse, but there was no doubt that in the long years to come, until the great destruction of the universe, the future direction of this universe would be determined by the Silver Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Ultimate 12th Realms had to bow to the Silver Galaxy Lord's will.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly sensed the changes within himself and then stepped out in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The nine Paramount Experts of human civilization had been protecting him during his assault on the Ultimate. Now that he had smoothly crossed into the 12th Realm, he naturally had to go see them first.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the Paramount Experts of human civilization, such as XuanYuan, were also filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>They had naturally also sensed the aura and karma of the Silver Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Paramount Experts like XuanYuan were filled with excitement, a figure appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Paramount Expert, looked at Lin Yuan. At this moment, he could not sense any aura at all, as if there was no one in front of him, which was a manifestation of a realm far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord, you have crossed into the 12th Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan, the Paramount Expert, also looked at Lin Yuan, and although he was already completely certain in his heart, he could not help but ask one more question.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was calm, and he smiled and said, "The light boat has crossed the mountain."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

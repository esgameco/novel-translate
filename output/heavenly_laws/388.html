        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>But every time he watched, he was still somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Tianshan Mountains were probably around 80,000 to 90,000 meters high, but compared to those massive celestial bodies in the cosmic universe, they seemed quite insignificant. </p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was able to vaguely sense that the entire Tianshan Mountains were flowing with a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>This aura made Lin Yuan think of the similar aura he had felt when he was on the ancestral star of human civilization.  </p><p></p><p>No, to be precise, the aura flowing through the Tianshan Mountains was even more vast and profound than the aura on the ancestral star of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianshan Mountains are like this, I wonder what kind of scene it will be when the Heavenly Gate appears," Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he had seen descriptions of the Heavenly Gate in many ancient books and manuscripts, the indigenous lifeforms of this two-dimensional world could not possibly describe one-millionth of the Heavenly Gate's true essence.</p><p></p><p>Just like the majestic Tianshan Mountains before him, in the eyes of the indigenous lifeforms of this two-dimensional world, they were just slightly taller mountains that became famous because of the Heavenly Gate. But to Lin Yuan, they were incredibly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, the higher the level one was at, the deeper the perception, and the more one could see and understand.</p><p></p><p>"This core area of this two-dimensional world should be these Tianshan Mountains," Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The core area here did not refer to the physical core area, but rather the place closest to the depths of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan paused and carefully observed the Tianshan Mountains in the distance, a series of powerful experts came rushing over.</p><p></p><p>These powerful experts released their mighty auras recklessly, but when they saw Lin Yuan, their expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the mysterious powerful expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Nation?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be him, the aura is about right, and he's carrying that jet-black iron staff on his back."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that 200 years ago, this mysterious powerful expert killed Pei Shen in just two breaths, and even Tuo Ba Ancient God, relying on that defensive mystical treasure, only lasted half a day."</p><p></p><p>Six or seven powerful experts from the myriad tribes respectfully bowed towards Lin Yuan from a distance.</p><p></p><p>On this visit, Lin Yuan did not conceal his appearance and form, mainly because he had previously revealed his aura when dealing with Tuo Ba Ancient God and those other special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, every lifeform's aura could not be changed. Under such circumstances, Lin Yuan had no need to hide his appearance and form either, because he would still be recognized.</p><p></p><p>As for the jet-black iron staff on his back, since he could not conceal his identity, there was not much point in putting this mystical treasure into the independent space contained within the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>Because the enemy would definitely be on guard against that move, which would only end up exposing the secret of the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>Inside the space within the silver mirror, Lin Yuan kept other backup items, such as that jade axe. This mystical treasure was extremely sharp, completely different in style from the jet-black iron staff.</p><p></p><p>If used at the right moment, it could definitely change the situation of a battle.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, those six or seven powerful experts from the myriad tribes were still secretly observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This mysterious powerful expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Nation has not taken action for the past 200 years, but is still ranked among the Nine Great Experts, albeit only ninth place. But his true strength is difficult to gauge."</p><p></p><p>"Not taking action for 200 years, yet still ranked ninth, that's too terrifying."  </p><p></p><p>"It's unknown what level of strength he is at now."</p><p></p><p>These few powerful experts from the myriad tribes discussed in low voices. On this occasion of the Heavenly Gate opening, they had only come to take a look, with no intention of actually entering the Heavenly Gate, because the possibility was almost zero.</p><p></p><p>"I should go meet up with the human evolutionary experts," Lin Yuan glanced at those six or seven powerful experts from the myriad tribes in the distance, not paying them much more attention.</p><p></p><p>Before his last period of seclusion, the powerful expert Xia Qinzhi had instructed him to rendezvous with the human evolutionary experts after reaching the Tianshan Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this was to have all the human evolutionary experts fully assist Lin Yuan, striving for the possibility of entering the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Although there were not yet any experts at the level of the Nine Great Experts among the current human evolutionary experts, the combined efforts of many eleventh-stage evolutionary experts could still have some effect when pushed to the limits.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, with these human evolutionary experts by his side, Lin Yuan would at least not be under as much pressure.</p><p></p><p>As the pinnacle tribe, in addition to having the Nine Great Experts standing guard, the most crucial aspect for the human civilization was unity.</p><p></p><p>Fighting alone? Even those unique special lifeforms were forced to establish the Cosmic Alliance to confront the grand alliances of the human civilization, insect tribe, and other pinnacle tribes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if Lin Yuan could enter the Heavenly Gate, he would need to retrieve mystical treasures from the human civilization to bring out.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would interact with the human evolutionary experts again.</p><p></p><p>"I have the silver mirror, and with the independent space inside it, I can easily bring out even some special mystical treasures," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Other powerful experts did not have the silver mirror. Even the Four Divine Kings could at most only bring out normal mystical treasures.</p><p></p><p>For non-normal mystical treasures, such as those several meters in size, it would be rather inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Without knowing whether they would need to immediately enter after the Heavenly Gate opened, it would not be feasible to carry around a mystical treasure several meters in size.</p><p></p><p>That would only restrict and encumber one's ability to fight and battle.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the Tianshan Mountains, Yan Fu, who had just entered the Shaman Ancestor realm, had originally harbored ambitions of displaying his strength at the Tianshan Mountains to intimidate the Twelve Ancient Nations.</p><p></p><p>But even before reaching the Tianshan Mountains, his heart began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that experts at the Shaman Ancestor level could definitely enter the Heavenly Gate? Wasn't it said that in previous openings of the Heavenly Gate, the competitors were only at the Shaman Emperor level?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu could not understand why on this journey, he had carefully sensed dozens of auras, and without exception, these dozens of auras...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>They were all at the level of Demonic Ancestors. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Yan Fu's perception, they far surpassed him, who had just entered the Demonic Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>This made Yan Fu's mentality somewhat collapse. He had just crossed into the Demonic Ancestor realm and originally thought he could dominate the world, but after sensing it for a while, he realized he was actually the weakest one?</p><p></p><p>"How could there be so many Demonic Ancestors?" Yan Fu couldn't understand. He had gone from being a Demonic cultivator to a Demonic King, then a Demonic Emperor, a Demonic Sovereign, and now a Demonic Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>He was all too clear about the difficulty of becoming a Demonic Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Should I still go to the Heavenly Mountains now?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu looked towards the distant Heavenly Mountains, whose outline was already vaguely visible, but suddenly hesitated. </p><p></p><p>Previously, he had sensed dozens of powerful Demonic Ancestor auras, which made him fear the distant Heavenly Mountains.</p><p></p><p>This was even before reaching the Heavenly Mountains, yet there were already so many experts. If he got closer, his life could be in danger.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated bitterly for six hundred years, just to witness the Heavenly Gate. No matter how many experts there are, they cannot stop me from going to the Heavenly Mountains."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Yan Fu was an existence that was one in a million among native lifeforms. He quickly adjusted his mentality and continued towards the Heavenly Mountains.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to before, this time Yan Fu was much more low-key, not daring to leak even a shred of his aura. And every distance he walked, he would stop, scan the surroundings for a moment, and then proceed.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Heavenly Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Inside a manor.</p><p></p><p>This was the base of human civilization, the place where the Heavenly Gate appeared. Two to three hundred years ago, the evolved humans of civilization had already rushed here and established a base.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of having backing - they didn't need to worry about trivial matters, as there were already dedicated people to handle them.</p><p></p><p>Deep inside the manor at this moment.</p><p></p><p>More than twenty figures had gathered.</p><p></p><p>These figures were all eleventh-stage evolved humans of human civilization. They were all seated here, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>"The Paramount Expert told us to wait here, saying an important figure of human civilization would come."</p><p></p><p>"Which important figure is it that the Paramount Expert specifically instructed us about?"</p><p></p><p>The many eleventh-stage evolved humans were puzzled. To have cultivated to the eleventh stage was already considered the top level of human civilization, and the experts of their tribes were basically all known to them. Yet this 'important figure' mentioned by the Paramount Expert was someone they were completely unaware of?</p><p></p><p>"According to the Paramount Expert, we need to assist this important figure to the greatest extent possible, even if it means sacrificing these avatars."</p><p></p><p>A tall female evolved human spoke, her tone carrying a hint of puzzlement. They, as eleventh-stage evolved humans, were being asked to sacrifice their avatars to assist this important figure - just what kind of background did this person have?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this important figure has the qualifications to compete for a spot at the Heavenly Gate?"</p><p></p><p>One of the eleventh-stage evolved humans speculated.</p><p></p><p>"It should be so."</p><p>"Yes, otherwise the Paramount Expert wouldn't be so solemn about it."</p><p>"Our human civilization actually has such a personage among the experts who fell into this two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>The eleventh-stage evolved humans discussed among themselves, all extremely curious about the important figure mentioned by the Paramount Expert.</p><p></p><p>Among the more than twenty eleventh-stage evolved humans, Nalan the Vice Pavilion Master, who was seated in the corner, merely listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>Although he was also an eleventh-stage evolved human, he had just entered the eleventh stage, so there was a gap in status between him and these veteran eleventh-stage experts present.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where the Galactic Star Master is now?" Nalan the Vice Pavilion Master thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the Galactic Star Master had heaven-defying talents, but there was still a considerable gap compared to those legendary, perfected eleventh-stage lifeforms. For this opening of the Heavenly Gate, he had probably just come to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>All the eleventh-stage evolved humans on the scene immediately sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"Someone's outside?"</p><p>"Is it the 'important figure' the Paramount Expert mentioned?"  </p><p></p><p>More than twenty eleventh-stage evolved humans immediately stood up and went outside the manor to welcome the arrival.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the visitor's appearance and sensed his aura, they were instantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom?"</p><p>"Over two hundred years ago, this mysterious expert took action and killed the two fifth-rank eleventh-stage special lifeforms Tuoba Ancient God and Pei God in one fell swoop."</p><p>"Heavens, this mysterious expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom actually comes from our human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>The tall female eleventh-stage evolved human Xuanyuan Duo stepped forward and communicated with Lin Yuan to confirm his identity. The other eleventh-stage evolved humans immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how you would like to be addressed, Sir?"</p><p>Xuanyuan Duo's tone carried a hint of respect. She was the strongest evolved human in the two-dimensional world and had even been ranked among the nine great experts during the initial descent period.</p><p></p><p>However, she was soon squeezed out.</p><p></p><p>"Just call me Blood Rain," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, every expert was suppressed, their auras becoming completely different from the outside world. Coupled with changes in appearance, physique, and fighting methods, unless they admitted it themselves, outsiders would find it difficult to deduce their true identities.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain."</p><p>The tall female Xuanyuan Duo invited Lin Yuan into the manor, then opened a huge box, revealing many strange artifacts inside.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall entrust these artifacts to Lord Blood Rain."</p><p>Xuanyuan Duo said solemnly. The more than ten artifacts in the box were the fruits of the efforts of many evolved humans of human civilization over the past three hundred years of searching and collecting.</p><p></p><p>According to the Paramount Expert's instructions, all these artifacts were to be handed over to Lin Yuan for safekeeping.</p><p></p><p>"These artifacts..." Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the many artifacts, and his expression suddenly showed astonishment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

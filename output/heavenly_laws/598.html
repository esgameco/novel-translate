        <h1>Chapter 598</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These 81 secret pattern diagrams were bestowed by the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun, which exhausted the profound essence of the Chaotic Principles.</p><p></p><p>The 27th Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagram is the last of the 18 diagrams of the second level of the Chaotic Realm. Comprehending this secret pattern diagram means that the understanding of the Chaotic Principles has reached the peak of the second level.</p><p></p><p>"I see." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. When he originally observed this Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagram, there were still many things he could not understand.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, there was no longer any doubt, and every strand of the intertwined Chaotic Qi appeared so wonderfully simple in Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor of the Scorching Sun."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. Stripping away the essential context of the Chaotic Principles and presenting them in the form of secret pattern diagrams, this method was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"However, even with such an excellent cultivation condition, the Scorching Sun Ancient Country has not given birth to a single 13th Realm cultivator throughout its endless years of history."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but feel the pressure.</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the birth of this Source World up to the present, only six 13th Realm temporal beings have been born, each of whom established a great ancient country.</p><p></p><p>Except for the very first 13th Realm temporal being, the remaining five 13th Realm temporal beings were three from the ancient country established by that initial 13th Realm being, and two from another ancient country.</p><p></p><p>As for the Scorching Sun Ancient Country? It has not given birth to any 13th Realm cultivators beyond its Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Exalted Ones of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, as long as they have experienced enough time, can basically accumulate a trillion merits, possess the Progenitor once, or even twice or thrice. Moreover, they can basically comprehend the 81 Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>A trillion merits may seem unattainable in the short term, but calculated based on the 100 merits accumulated per year by guarding a first-class Blessed Land, it would only take 10 billion years. For the Celestial Exalted Ones, 10 billion years is not considered a long time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during the full-scale wars between ancient countries, as long as the Celestial Exalted Ones take action, they will receive merit rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind."</p><p></p><p>"It's too early to think about these things now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind. At the moment, he had just reached the Mastery Realm, and the matter of breaking through to the 13th Realm would not be considered until he had fully comprehended the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the 28th Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, and a new "diagram" appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>From the 28th Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagram onwards, the 81 Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagrams expounded on the profound mysteries of the third level of the Chaotic Principles.</p><p></p><p>Encompassing the third level of the Chaotic Realm in 54 secret pattern diagrams shows how abstruse and difficult this level of the Chaotic Principles is.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary. Observing the Chaotic Secret Pattern Diagrams has greatly enhanced your understanding of the Chaotic Principles.】</p><p></p><p>After just a brief moment of contemplation, Lin Yuan could feel that the Chaotic Principles contained in this secret pattern diagram had already surpassed the total of the previous 27 diagrams.</p><p></p><p>"It's so wonderful, so beautiful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed and contemplated, and estimated that it would take about a thousand years to fully comprehend this secret pattern diagram.</p><p></p><p>In other words, barring any unexpected events, a thousand years from now, Lin Yuan's attainment in the Chaotic Principles would reach the third level of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of the second level of the Chaotic Realm."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. "I can try to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force."</p><p></p><p>Being able to evolve one's own unique power path through the Chaotic Principles is something only the Great Saints of the Chaotic Void can achieve.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's ability to attempt this is entirely due to the depth of his foundation in the Chaotic Principles.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Source World, whose understanding of the Principles far surpasses the Chaotic Void, would need a Great Exalted One to have a chance of evolving the Chaotic Exclusive Power Path.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He is attempting it at the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if not for the extreme difficulty of evolving the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force and the high requirement of Chaotic Principles comprehension, Lin Yuan could have tried it even at the Transcendent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the simple Chaotic Fire, Chaotic Shadow, or Chaotic Life, the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force is the fusion of two completely different paths, giving birth to a brand-new power.</p><p></p><p>The Cosmic Body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form solidified and emerged.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of Chaotic Qi gathered before him, like an ocean of Chaos, with the scorching and frigid energies constantly churning in the depths.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>"With my peak of the second level Chaotic Realm comprehension, I can indeed evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force, but the speed..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed it for a moment and found that it would take at least tens of millions of years to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Tens of millions of years? Although tens of millions of years is nothing to Lin Yuan, as there is no lifespan limit after reaching the 12th Realm, tens of millions of years is still too long.</p><p></p><p>How long has it been since he became an Evolving Being?</p><p></p><p>"With my peak second level Chaotic Realm principles comprehension, evolving the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force is still somewhat strenuous, which is why it would take tens of millions of years. If my Chaotic Principles comprehension reaches the third level, the time required to evolve it will likely be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force has Chaos as its foundation and container. The higher the Chaotic Principles comprehension, the shorter the time required to evolve the Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the second level of the Chaotic Realm, it would take tens of millions of years to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Ultimate Force.</p><p></p><p>If it were the third level of the Chaotic Realm, it might only take tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>And if it reached the peak of the third level of the Chaotic Realm, it could be done in just thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not in a hurry. Even if it really takes tens of millions of years, I can wait for it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the black jade has greatly helped my mental will. In just half a year, my mental will index has increased by at least 5 million points, reaching 75 million."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder that the Black Jade's Nest is considered a top-tier treasure land, as the progenitor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom was a Time Life at the 13th Realm. What treasures haven't those Venerable Celestial Sovereigns seen? Even so, they still scrambled to fight for the right to guard the Black Jade's Nest, which shows the effect of the Black Jade.</p><p></p><p>"But in just half a year, I've increased my Spiritual Will Index by 5 million points. It should be because I just recently started using the Black Jade. To increase it by that much again would take far more than just half a year."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never used the Black Jade before, which is why he was able to gain such a massive boost.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Blazing Sun Celestial Sovereign so readily gave up the Black Jade's Nest was twofold: one, he didn't want to offend Lin Yuan, and two, the hidden danger to his Spiritual Will had already been mostly remedied, so the Black Jade's effect on him was no longer as significant.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've accumulated some extra Black Jade, I can take it to the Chaotic Void and sell it to those Venerable Saints." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself, at least as far as he knew, he had never heard of anything in the Chaotic Void that could boost one's Spiritual Will as much as this precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan had been able to increase the strength of his Spiritual Will by traversing the boundless void through the Myriad Realms Gate and slaying the void creatures in the Void Mysteries. </p><p></p><p>But that kind of increase had an upper limit, reaching at most 40-50 million points.</p><p></p><p>How could that compare to the Black Jade, which had a significant effect even on the Spiritual Will of Celestial Sovereigns?</p><p></p><p>Between the Rippling Cloud Void Domain and the Tranquil Wave Void Domain, there was a vast and desolate void.</p><p></p><p>This so-called desolate void was a general term referring to the region between the two void domains.</p><p></p><p>Void domains were areas where the Chaotic Qi was dense, suitable for cultivators to live and thrive, as the Chaotic Qi nurtured the birth of powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>But the desolate void between void domains had sparse Chaotic Qi, and it was rare for strong experts to reside there.</p><p></p><p>If the Chaotic Void was likened to an ocean, then the void domains would be the islands within it, and the desolate void would occupy 99% of the ocean's area.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the boundless Chaotic Void was mostly made up of this desolate void.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the previously silent desolate void suddenly emanated a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>A fiery red energy clashed with an endless dark shadow, and the shockwaves spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the natural universes nurtured by the Chaotic Void were prematurely thrust into great destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Jiu Feng, what will it take for you to stop?" </p><p></p><p>The source of the endless dark shadow aura, the Demon Saint, spoke again.</p><p></p><p>When other Chaotic Realm cultivators broke through to the Saint Realm, they would usually receive congratulations from the other Saints. However, the Demon Saint, since becoming a Saint, had been relentlessly pursued by the Jiu Feng Saint not long after.</p><p></p><p>This had been going on until now, making the Demon Saint utterly miserable. If this continued, would he even be able to continue cultivating?</p><p></p><p>"Stop?" Jiu Feng Saint sneered. "I'll stop only if you can revive all my clan members. Can you do that?"</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible," the Demon Saint shook his head.</p><p></p><p>As a natural wonder of life, Jiu Feng's clan members had mostly transcended the 12th Realm, freeing themselves from the constraints of the Time River. How could they be revived?</p><p></p><p>Transcending the Time River shackles had broken the lifespan limit, but it also meant they had lost the chance to be revived.</p><p></p><p>Jiu Feng Saint did not respond, instead unleashing an endless stream of Chaotic Flames brimming with vitality towards the Demon Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Saint's form became blurred, and the Chaotic Flames struck the distant desolate void.</p><p></p><p>But then, a faint tearing sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Where the Chaotic Flames had struck, a rift in the space-time continuum suddenly appeared, revealing what seemed to be a fragment of a massive world.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of mysterious energies diffused and swirled around.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" </p><p></p><p>Both Jiu Feng Saint and the Demon Saint immediately noticed this and, with rare accord, stopped their battle to observe the revealed spatial fragment.</p><p></p><p>"This rift in the space-time continuum should be the entrance to a universe, originally hidden deep within the space-time, but exposed by my attack," Jiu Feng Saint said, filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a natural universe, but a universe opened by a Peerless Saint, or perhaps even a stronger Peerless Saint expert," the Demon Saint analyzed.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, universes were of two types: natural universes nurtured by the Chaotic Qi, and universes opened by Peerless Saints.</p><p></p><p>The latter, while lacking the indestructible nature of natural universes, far surpassed them in foundational essence, as they were created by Peerless Saints.</p><p></p><p>Peerless Saints could establish their own rules within the universes they opened, often using them as their own strongholds.</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity," the Demon Saint thought excitedly. A universe opened by a Peerless Saint, and judging by the current situation, the Peerless Saint who created it was likely no longer around, or else it would never have been exposed like this.</p><p></p><p>On the Ancient Bright Chaotic Continent, in the Star Tear 'Fragment World'...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a meditative state, contemplating the 28th Chaotic Rune diagram.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a beast hide appeared.</p><p></p><p>The beast hide floated up, emanating a mysterious aura, and the mysterious map on its surface began to faintly glow.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 232 - Entering the Eighth Stage (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a vast mental will condensed within Lin Yuan's body. It made him feel that everything he currently saw was like an illusion, easily punctured with a casual hand.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>The instant Lin Yuan became sober, his consciousness began to sink again. </p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan opened his eyes once more, he had already arrived in the cosmic starry sky. A powerful alien race's aura came from behind - Lin Yuan was apparently being hunted by the alien race.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, even if you are the ultimate genius of human civilization, so what? You still have to die." The alien pursuer behind him laughed maniacally.</p><p></p><p>"I'm being hunted?" Lin Yuan frowned, instinctively wanting to continue fleeing for his life.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the vast mental will condensed in his body again, making Lin Yuan instantly understand his situation. </p><p></p><p>"Mere heart demons." Lin Yuan stopped fleeing as the surrounding illusions began collapsing again.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the Heart Demon Tribulation was heart demons. When facing the Heart Demon Tribulation, the Evolver would experience the scenes they were most unwilling to experience. Or the scenes they most wanted to experience.</p><p></p><p>For example, what Lin Yuan feared most was being prematurely killed by alien races before he could grow up. Originally, if one's own mental will did not meet the standard, the Evolver could easily get lost in the layers of illusions before them, which meant failing the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>And a powerful mental will could make the Evolver quickly sober up. Or let the Evolver realize that everything around them was an illusion, all fictitious. Naturally, the probability of passing the Heart Demon Tribulation would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lin Yuan continuously broke through hundreds of heart demon illusions.</p><p></p><p>The scene changed. An insect race mother nest comparable to a star system appeared in the distance. Seventh stage, eighth stage, and even ninth stage insect race warriors manufactured by the mother nest rushed out one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an Insect Queen?" Lin Yuan was startled in his heart. An Insect Queen could continuously produce a large number of seventh, eighth and ninth stage insect warriors. These insect warriors, in a one-on-one fight, were definitely not a match for human Evolvers of the same stage.</p><p></p><p>But there was no way to match the sheer numbers - endless, millions of ordinary eighth stage insect warriors would make even the Vermilion Roc Star Lord's scalp go numb upon seeing them. It was precisely because of this that in the war between human civilization and the insect race, the human side did not have much of an advantage in the low and mid-level battlefields, but rather a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Only in the struggle at the supreme level were the Insect Queens suppressed by the supreme powerhouses on the human side. Because the Insect Queens could not produce insect warriors at the supreme level.</p><p></p><p>"An Insect Queen personally making a move against me is too fake." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Even without a powerful mental will, he felt that the scene before him was somewhat absurd. The Queens were such existences that they could forcibly contend against supreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Even the ultimate genius Evolver of the human race, unmatched in an era, was not worthy of a Queen's personal action. Their identity and status were there.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! </p><p></p><p>As the vast mental will gathered, Lin Yuan crushed this layer of heart demon illusion again.</p><p></p><p>On the top of a majestic and grand Evolution Tower, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged. At this moment, Lin Yuan's aura was as deep and mysterious as the cosmic starry sky, and wherever his gaze reached was the scope of his own territory.</p><p></p><p>"Great supreme powerhouse, under your leadership, human civilization has become an unprecedented force in the cosmic starry sky. The insect race and other top races have surrendered one after another." An old man below said loudly, his tone containing rich worship.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a supreme powerhouse and leading human civilization to the peak is something every human Evolver yearns to achieve." At this moment, Lin Yuan was being worshipped by countless humans, lofty and looking down, like a deity.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it's fake, all fake." Lin Yuan sighed, and the scenes in all directions began to collapse, along with the invincible power in Lin Yuan's body that was also dissipating.</p><p></p><p>On the high mountain, Lin Yuan opened his eyes without a sound. "The Heart Demon Tribulation has ended." Lin Yuan's eyes were deep and distant, as if he had broken through some shackles, and his entire mental state suddenly began to sublimate.</p><p></p><p>There were three prerequisites to becoming an eighth stage Evolver. One was the Heart Demon Tribulation, the second was the inner world, and the third was the ultimate perfection of the physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>Unable to pass the Heart Demon Tribulation, one would forever be only at the peak of the seventh stage. Even if the inner world and the physical body and soul all met the requirements, it would be useless. Because the realm could not be promoted.</p><p></p><p>Only after passing the Heart Demon Tribulation could one smoothly advance to the eighth stage in terms of realm. Next, if the inner world was opened up and the physical body and soul reached perfection, one could officially step into the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Let's end the traversal." Lin Yuan glanced at the remaining time. There were still five years left.</p><p></p><p>The countless layers of heart demon illusions Lin Yuan experienced in the Heart Demon Tribulation were just an instant in reality. As for the remaining five years in the traversal world, there was no need to waste them here.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing for Lin Yuan now was to completely step into the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Vermilion Roc Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Splash! </p><p></p><p>A large amount of Vermilion Spirit Liquid appeared in front of him. Early on, several years ago, Lin Yuan had already begun to prepare for stepping into the eighth stage, naturally not forgetting about the Vermilion Spirit Liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Breakthrough." Lin Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>First, the inner world began to expand crazily again. The original inner world of only 130,000 li in circumference instantly surged to 250,000 li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>The surge of the inner world did not cause much of a disturbance. Previously, when Lin Yuan expanded his inner world, it surged from a dozen or so li in circumference to 120,000 li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>But now, going from 130,000 li to 250,000 li in circumference, although the increase was greater than before, the base number was much stronger. Lin Yuan had the complete ability to restrain it himself.</p><p></p><p>Vermilion Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord was instructing the Great Peak Lord. With the Great Peak Lord's breakthrough to the eighth stage and imminent departure to take charge of the star domain, as his teacher, the Vermilion Roc Star Lord would naturally bestow some trump cards and backup plans.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Teacher, I will be cautious and careful." The Great Peak Lord nodded, also knowing that the Vermilion Roc Star Lord was concerned about him.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, among my disciples, who will be the next to break through to the eighth stage?" The Vermilion Roc Star Lord sighed, saying with some emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Second Junior Brother? Third Junior Brother? Or Little Junior Brother?" The Great Peak Lord tried to guess.</p><p></p><p>Among the Vermilion Roc Star Lord's disciples now, only these three were at the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you think it will be?" The Vermilion Roc Star Lord asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of talent, Little Junior Brother is definitely the strongest, but to step into the eighth stage, mental will is very important. This requires accumulation over a long period of time. Second Junior Brother has almost accumulated enough in this aspect. As long as he breaks through to the King realm, he should be able to try to open up his inner world and then charge into the eighth stage." The Great Peak Lord analyzed calmly.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he looked down on Little Junior Brother, but the increase in the mental will index indeed required a lot of time. Little Junior Brother was not even a hundred years old now.</p><p></p><p>"What you said is not bad." Upon hearing this, the Vermilion Roc Star Lord pondered carefully for a moment and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"It's just..." Before the Vermilion Roc Star Lord could finish, it was as if he sensed something.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hux.com</p><p></p><p>They looked in a certain direction with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has broken through to the 8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master also sensed it and looked towards the source of the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, the breakthrough from the 7th to the 8th stage itself could not be concealed, as it involved fluctuations in the fundamental rules.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master widened his eyes. The location of the breakthrough source was at the Thirteenth Peak.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the only person on the Thirteenth Peak capable of breaking through to the 8th stage was his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>As for those 7th stage guards? If these guards were about to break through to the 8th stage, they would definitely report to the Star Lord in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit."</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother opened his mouth wide. He had just analyzed with his teacher that the next ordinary 8th stage disciple would emerge, but his junior brother immediately broke through to the 8th stage?</p><p></p><p>No, that's not the point.</p><p></p><p>The point is, how old is his junior brother?</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he had just entered the 7th stage, and now he's at the 8th stage?</p><p></p><p>"My disciple..."</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Star Lord's thoughts were also flying. The Great Peak Master believed that the next person to enter the 8th stage would be the Second Peak Master, a view he did not agree with.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Great Peak Master, the Chikunxing Star Lord knew about Lin Yuan's cultivation progress and that internal world that had nearly reached the peak of the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>With such a vast internal world, even if Lin Yuan did nothing, his physical body, soul, and willpower would slowly grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Until it approached the peak of the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the 8th stage here referred to the physical body and soul, while the realm would still remain at the 7th stage.</p><p></p><p>But in the Chikunxing Star Lord's view, even if Lin Yuan entered the 8th stage, it would be a matter of decades or even hundreds of years later?</p><p></p><p>But now he had already done it?</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the 8th stage was vast and began to affect the entire Chikunxing Star.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, when the eldest senior brother broke through to the 8th stage, Lin Yuan sensed it from a great distance, because the transition from the 7th to the 8th stage would cause fluctuations in the fundamental rules, making it difficult to conceal.</p><p></p><p>Almost in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The countless 6th and 7th stage evolutionaries on the Chikunxing Star were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Shortly after the Great Peak Master became an 8th stage, another Peak Master followed closely behind?"</p><p></p><p>"Our Chikunxing Star Domain has really seen a multiplication of powerhouses recently."</p><p></p><p>The countless evolutionaries on the Chikunxing Star were somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"No, wait, I met with the Second and Third Peak Masters not long ago. They were going to leave for a while and should not be on the Chikunxing Star now."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, among the Peak Masters currently on the main star, only the Thirteenth Peak Master is at the 7th stage?"</p><p></p><p>"The one who broke through to the 8th stage is the Thirteenth Peak Master?"</p><p></p><p>This speculation left all the evolutionaries a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Any rational evolutionary would understand that the Thirteenth Peak Master had just announced his entry into the 7th stage not long ago, so how could he enter the 8th stage so quickly?</p><p></p><p>Did they really think cultivation was as simple as eating and drinking?</p><p></p><p>It's just that now, with the Second and Third Peak Masters not on the main star, the only one with the conditions to break through to the 8th stage was the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps those 7th stage King-level guards also had the conditions to break through to the 8th stage, but if the King-level guards were to break through, they would be sent by the Star Lord to a special breakthrough planet and would definitely not break through on the main star.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, only the Thirteenth Peak Master met the conditions.</p><p></p><p>"I have already contacted the Second and Third Peak Masters just now, and they are indeed not on the main star at the moment," said a certain 7th stage King-level evolutionary.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>It immediately set off a storm.</p><p></p><p>Because this meant that the evolutionary currently entering the 8th stage could only be the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>If not the Thirteenth Peak Master, could it be those Peak Masters who were only at the 6th stage?</p><p></p><p>"The breakthrough is going very smoothly."</p><p></p><p>"He has now completely entered the 8th stage level."</p><p></p><p>The various 7th stage evolutionaries carefully sensed that there were several possibilities of failure and difficulty in breaking through from the 7th to the 8th stage, such as not passing the heart demon tribulation or not opening up an internal world.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the possibility of failure, it would cause the signs of breakthrough to abruptly stop.</p><p></p><p>But now, the breakthrough aura they sensed was very smooth, as if it were flowing like clouds and water, without even a pause.</p><p></p><p>"If it is indeed the Thirteenth Peak Master entering the 8th stage, then the Thirteenth Peak Master's potential is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, even if he cannot break through to the 9th stage, he will at least be invincible at the 8th stage like the Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>As for the upper limit, that was unclear.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the 9th stage, or perhaps the 10th stage.</p><p></p><p>Just as countless evolutionaries on the main star were discussing and conversing.</p><p></p><p>The news that the ChikunSect was about to have another 8th stage evolutionary began to spread in all directions like a hurricane.</p><p></p><p>Especially when this newly advanced 8th stage evolutionary was most likely the youngest Thirteenth Peak Master, it sparked nearly frenzied heated discussions.</p><p></p><p>Wanyang Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of a star.</p><p></p><p>A black-haired old man appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired old man began to call out.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten years ago, the Wanyang Holy Son made a decision to risk his life and delve deep into the star to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Because only in this way could he fully exploit his potential and advance to the 7th stage as quickly as possible to catch up with the Thirteenth Peak Master of the Chikunxing Sect.</p><p></p><p>How arrogant was the Wanyang Holy Son? Being repeatedly beaten by the Thirteenth Peak Master twice, the depression in his heart almost overflowed.</p><p></p><p>At the call of the black-haired old man.</p><p></p><p>A piece of scorching red crystal flew out from the depths of the star.</p><p></p><p>The crystal stopped in front of the black-haired old man and began to melt. The Wanyang Holy Son walked out from inside.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say that without earth-shattering matters, you are not allowed to disturb me?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son frowned. This time, he planned to go into seclusion for two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>It's just that now, in less than ten years, he was called out, which made him very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, good news, especially great news."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired old man revealed a smile on his face and hurriedly spoke about the matter of the partial body of the Supremes that came from outside the main world.</p><p></p><p>"The body of the Supremes?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as we comprehend it and realize the path of supreme evolution, we have the hope of becoming Supremes?"</p><p></p><p>If this was really the case, then comprehending that body would be superior to going into seclusion deep within the star.</p><p></p><p>"As for the body of the Supremes, I don't dare to hope to comprehend that path of supreme evolution, but as long as I comprehend one billionth of the profundity of this body, it should not be a problem to help me enter the 7th stage."</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son's heart was burning.</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, by going into seclusion deep within the star and experiencing the danger of life and death, he would have the hope of entering the 7th stage in two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>And by comprehending the body of the Supremes, perhaps he could enter the 7th stage in just a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Just a hundred years, how far could the Thirteenth Peak Master advance at the 7th stage level?</p><p></p><p>He had more hope of catching up to the other party.</p><p></p><p>At that time...</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son's heart was excited. As long as he reached the 7th stage, he would be in the same great realm as the Thirteenth Peak Master. Relying on his "Nine Yang Divine Vein" physique, he probably wouldn't fall too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Wanyang Holy Son was full of hope and eager to apply to comprehend that body.</p><p></p><p>The black-haired old man beside him had a slight change in his expression. His consciousness was constantly connected to the virtual world, ensuring that he could know any latest information.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness..."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired old man carefully stole a glance at the ambitious Wanyang Holy Son and said in a low voice, "There is now a piece of bad news."</p><p></p><p>"Bad news?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son glanced at the black-haired old man, unconcerned, and said, "What bad news?"</p>

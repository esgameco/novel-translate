            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 437 The Shock of Human Civilization (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>From the 10th to the 11th level is a leap in the essence of life itself. </p><p></p><p>An 11th level life has already reached the pinnacle below the Supremes, and the comprehension of the great Dao rules that it can perceive is far beyond that of the 10th level.</p><p></p><p>The higher you stand, the farther you can see - this not only describes physical height, but more importantly the height of the level of life.  </p><p></p><p>Why can Supremes so easily reach the six-fold realm of space-time? It's because they have completed the "landing" and can see farther from the shore of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan is the same.</p><p></p><p>The elevation of his life level not only allows Lin Yuan to more easily sense the profound fluctuations of many rules, but the improvement of his transcendent comprehension is also terrifying.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is transcendent, you sense the primordial fluctuations of space-time, improving your comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is transcendent, by comprehending the secret law 'Heavenly River', improving your comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules.]</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules surpassed the accumulation of the past one to two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, after Lin Yuan comprehended the six-fold realm of space-time, he still stayed in that world for over a hundred years, but did not make much progress in refining the fusion of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how little, the accumulation over one to two hundred years was still considerable.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, having initially crossed into the 11th level, Lin Yuan swiftly surpassed it.</p><p></p><p>"At the current speed of comprehension, perhaps before breaking through to the Ultimate, there is hope of elevating the fusion of space-time rules to the seven-fold realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The seven-fold realm of the fusion of space-time? An overwhelming majority of 12th level beings in the universe have never reached this realm. Supremes, standing on the "shore", can easily reach the six-fold realm, but the seven-fold realm?</p><p></p><p>According to the records in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm, among the 12th level experts in the universe who have not yet crossed the first cataclysm of universal destruction, very very few have reached the seven-fold realm of fusion of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>Even if there are some, it is only after experiencing nearly a complete cosmic cycle, barely comprehending it before the collapse of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with the comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules reaching the seven-fold realm, crossing the cataclysm of universal destruction should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Experts of this level, even in the vast and boundless chaos, are rare.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts. From the six-fold to the seven-fold realm of space-time, it may seem like just one realm, but in reality it is an immensely long journey. Lin Yuan only felt that with the current speed of comprehension at the 11th level, he had hope of comprehending the seven-fold realm.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he could ultimately comprehend it or not, there was still no certainty - there were too many variables in between.</p><p></p><p>Just like when Lin Yuan was at the 1st and 2nd levels, facing the issue of whether he could become a Supreme - the gap was too vast to estimate well.</p><p></p><p>"The focus of 11th level cultivation is on the physical body and comprehension of rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself, silently thinking in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For the physical body, he would strive to cultivate the 'Profound Yellow Body' to 11th level perfection as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the vast resources needed for the 'Profound Yellow Body', Lin Yuan could not help but yearn even more to go to the super-large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even relying on human civilization, it would be very difficult to accumulate those resources in a short time, at most enough for a portion.</p><p></p><p>For the physical body, he would cultivate the 'Profound Yellow Body'.</p><p></p><p>For comprehension of rules, naturally he would focus on the fusion of space-time rules as the main, with other supporting fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>If possible, Lin Yuan still wanted to try comprehending the rules of chaos.</p><p></p><p>There were no precedents for the rules of chaos to refer to, but in Lin Yuan's estimation, the difficulty of comprehending the rules of chaos at the 11th level would be even greater than comprehending the seven-fold realm of space-time at the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not be worthy of being regarded by the Profound Emperor and the Lord of the Demonic Jade Pavilion as a legend among legends to break through to the Ultimate by comprehending the rules of chaos.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the physical body and comprehension of rules,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner world was also slowly metamorphosing.  </p><p></p><p>When breaking through to the 11th level, the vast primordial chaos that Lin Yuan swallowed sank deep into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current life level, he cannot rapidly transform all of this primordial chaos into foundation, but he can slowly absorb and metamorphose it.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan breaks through to the Ultimate, all the accumulated metamorphosis and foundation will erupt in one burst, pushing him to an unprecedented peak.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was getting familiar with the tremendous benefits brought by the 11th level of life,</p><p></p><p>An official announcement was made by human civilization:</p><p></p><p>That human civilization had once again given birth to an 11th level Evoluter.  </p><p></p><p>An 11th level Evoluter, second only to Supremes - even for the pinnacle race of human civilization,</p><p></p><p>The birth of each 11th level...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Whenever a human civilization member breaks through to the eleventh level of evolution, it would be celebrated grandly. </p><p></p><p>Previously, when Deputy Tower Master Nalan broke through to the eleventh level, it was the same - an eleventh level celebration was held, attracting congratulations from many forces of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Now, human civilization has given birth to a new eleventh level evolver once again.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the various forces of human civilization were still wondering which ancient tenth level evolver had newly advanced to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>However, they discovered that this new eleventh level evolver was none other than the Galactic Star Master himself.</p><p></p><p>From crossing into the sixth level and becoming the Peak Master of the Chihuo lineage, to now crossing into the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>The time the Galactic Star Master used was only a few hundred years, less than a thousand.</p><p></p><p>Such an astonishing speed of advancement left countless citizens of human civilization dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master...he became an eleventh level?" The Black Star Master was casually chatting with the Liuli Star Master and other Grade A tenth levels. </p><p></p><p>The Black Star Master would even often encourage former fellow level evolvers in the manner of a forerunner.</p><p></p><p>This contained both the Black Star Master's good intentions, as well as revealed some self-satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Star Master never imagined that the Galactic Star Master would cross into the eleventh level ahead of him?</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master? Eleventh level? So fast?"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the greatest genius in the history of our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"It's only been about three hundred years since the Galactic Star Master crossed into the tenth level right? Just what cultivation method did the Galactic Star Master use?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Grade A tenth levels immediately began rapidly discussing.</p><p></p><p>Given the talent the Galactic Star Master had revealed, none of the Grade A tenth levels had any doubts about him crossing into the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>If even the greatest genius in human civilization history could not cross into the eleventh level, then the other evolvers might as well not try.</p><p></p><p>But this speed was too fast, right?</p><p></p><p>In less than three hundred years, he not only comprehended a Pillar-level Fusion Law to the second realm, but raised it to the second realm?</p><p></p><p>All the Grade A tenth levels were tremendously shaken. What they didn't know was that the Galactic Star Master did not cross into the eleventh level by comprehending some Pillar-level Fusion Law to the second realm.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was with the Spacetime Sixfold Realm, as well as the unprecedented accumulation of many Pillar-level Fusion Laws at the Sixfold Realm pinnacle, that he forcefully crossed into the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Having just initially crossed into the eleventh level, Lin Yuan already surpassed all other eleventh levels. Even a perfected eleventh level holding the strongest weapon would at most only be able to preserve their life before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I even told the Galactic Star Master that I'd wait for him in the eleventh level?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the discussions of the many Grade A tenth levels, the Black Star Master recalled what he had said to the Galactic Star Master before, and felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Master could guarantee that he absolutely had no intention of showing off at the time, and spoke from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined the Galactic Star Master's cultivation speed was this fast?</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Master's initial intention was to wait for the Galactic Star Master in the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>But now, it had become the Galactic Star Master waiting for him in the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>In the central star domain of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>On a huge planet.</p><p></p><p>In a certain manor.</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran was spending time with Lin Yi. After getting married, the two had moved to live on this planet, which was also a symbol of Xia Keran's core family status in the Xia clan.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran suddenly received a message, and his heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh level Ancestor of the human Xia clan held an extremely lofty status. An heir like Xia Keran should, by rights, never have the chance to see the Ancestor from birth to death.</p><p></p><p>But because of his relationship with Lin Yi, Xia Keran was fortunate enough to be summoned by the Ancestor twice before.</p><p></p><p>Once was when he learned about Xia Keran's relationship with the Galactic Star Master's sister, and once was right before his marriage to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>These were the only two times Xia Keran had been summoned by the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>And now was the third time.</p><p></p><p>"What could the Ancestor want to summon me for?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran felt quite nervous. Being summoned by the Ancestor did not necessarily mean something good.</p><p></p><p>One could say that the vast majority of those summoned by the Xia clan Ancestor faced the Ancestor's wrath and punishment.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p>"It probably isn't anything major."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi consoled from the side.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so."</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran's expression was solemn as he headed towards the palace where the Ancestor was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Xia Keran walked out of the palace utterly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This time the Xia clan Ancestor summoned him, it was not for anything bad.</p><p></p><p>But rather, something good. Something incredibly good.</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran had never seen the supremely exalted Xia clan Ancestor show such a warm side towards him before.</p><p></p><p>On the two previous summons before today, the Xia clan Ancestor had only briefly expressed concern and emphasized the importance of that Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Just now.</p><p></p><p>And all of this originated from—</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord has crossed into the eleventh stage?" </p><p></p><p>Xia Keran recalled the news he received from the Venerable Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Although it was almost inevitable for the Galactic Lord to cross into the eleventh stage, being able to do so in less than three hundred years meant that the Galactic Lord's talent and potential exceeded everyone's expectations.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, after crossing into the eleventh stage, the Galactic Lord has officially become part of the decision-making echelon just below the strongest of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>His status is no lower than the Xia Family's Venerable Ancestor, and the Galactic Lord's future is even more brilliant than theirs.</p><p></p><p>Inside the manor.</p><p></p><p>"My brother has become an eleventh stage?" Lin Yi received this news from Xia Keran and was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>To the current Lin Yi, Lin Yuan had become her spiritual pillar, but crossing into the eleventh stage? Isn't that too fast?</p><p></p><p>Before marrying Xia Keran, Lin Yi might not have been so shocked. But the more she was exposed to it, the more she realized what it meant.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Ancestor told me personally, it can't be false."</p><p></p><p>Xia Keran swallowed, and even until now, the shock in his heart had not dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple has crossed into the eleventh stage?" The Crimson Carp Lord was casually instructing the various Peak Lords on the Crimson Carp Lord's main star. </p><p></p><p>After crossing into the ninth stage, the Crimson Carp Lord's ability to guide his disciples improved considerably, and two Peak Lords successively crossed into the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Crimson Carp Lord received news that Lin Yuan had crossed into the eleventh stage, and a look of emotion immediately appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all his disciples, while these Peak Lords were still racking their brains on how to break through to the seventh stage, the youngest Thirteenth Peak Lord Lin Yuan had already crossed into the eleventh stage?</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Little Junior Brother crossed into the eleventh stage?"</p><p>"Teacher, great news."</p><p>"The eleventh stage? It's only been a short while, Little Junior Brother's talent is too monstrous."</p><p></p><p>One Peak Lord after another couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. An eleventh stage evolver? That was an existence so powerful they couldn't even look up to.</p><p></p><p>"Joyous news."</p><p>"Indeed, joyous news."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Crimson Carp Lord's face, while his heart felt wonderful.</p><p></p><p>The ninth and tenth stage evolvers from the various major domains of human civilization were extremely envious and jealous of the Crimson Carp Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Carp Lord's explanation for this was: "I couldn't help it either, I just happened to accept the Galactic Lord back then, and good luck came that couldn't be blocked."</p><p></p><p>When the Galactic Lord was at the tenth stage, he had already made those ninth and tenth stage evolvers green with envy. Now that the Galactic Lord had crossed into the eleventh stage, the Crimson Carp Lord could already imagine the "criticism" he would receive from those friends.</p><p></p><p>The news of Lin Yuan crossing into the eleventh stage had an impact far beyond just human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The peak forces of the major races in the vast cosmic starry sky also received the news immediately.</p><p></p><p>In a barren expanse of starry space.</p><p></p><p>Several majestic figures condensed and emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord of human civilization has crossed into the eleventh stage? How coincidental? Right after that human evolver who failed to break through to the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>These figures were the strongest of the Insect Race and Feather Race, currently gathering together and mentioning this matter.</p><p></p><p>Too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>The timing of the Galactic Lord crossing into the eleventh stage was too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>Coincidental to the point that these strongest beings couldn't help but make an association.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Galactic Lord be that evolver who failed to break through to the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>The strongest beings looked at each other, their minds surging with this unthinkable idea.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible."</p><p>"The Galactic Lord only crossed into the eleventh stage, how could he have caused that level of primal chaotic void infusion?"</p><p></p><p>One of the strongest immediately voiced his doubts.</p><p></p><p>Although the timing was very close, it was only close. Thinking carefully, one would realize the absurdity.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the eleventh stage and breaking through to the ultimate were completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"We might be overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>The other strongest beings nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Their guess had no substantive evidence, only based on association.</p><p></p><p>"However, even if the Galactic Lord is unrelated to that evolver who failed to break through to the ultimate, an eleventh stage Galactic Lord will likely become no small trouble."</p><p></p><p>"A massive battlefield is about to be opened, and we must come up with a way to deal with the Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figures discussed.</p><p></p><p>The myriad races of the starry void were all shocked and awed that the Galactic Lord had crossed into the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh stage realm was already standing at the apex of the cosmos, second only to the strongest beings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fame also shook the starry void for the first time.</p>

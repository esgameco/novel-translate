            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 429: The Perplexed Supreme Being (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The task of refining the supreme martial weapon was naturally assigned to the Solar Primordial Spirit. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self and the two major primordial spirit wills shared consciousness. No matter which aspect did the refining, the other two could enjoy the results.</p><p></p><p>Essentially speaking, the true self and the primordial spirits belonged to the same person.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"After a few more months of adjustment, I can advance to the eleventh stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had almost reached the pinnacle in all aspects. </p><p></p><p>The only choice left was to cross into the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's current accumulation, not to mention the tenth stage, even in the eleventh stage, it was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of this universe, no eleventh stage life had comprehended the sixfold realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"However, now I can try to become a sequence disciple of the Devil Jade Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>A thought arose in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Devil Jade Pavilion, or rather the members of the Devil Jade Pavilion, were divided into four types:</p><p></p><p>Ordinary disciples/members.</p><p>Core disciples/members. </p><p>Sequence disciples/members.</p><p>Personally transmitted disciples/members.</p><p></p><p>According to the way Lin Yuan had chosen to join the Devil Jade Pavilion, to become a sequence disciple, the first condition was to comprehend all the demonic evolutionary paths within the body of the supreme being.</p><p></p><p>The second condition was to be below the twelfth stage of life.</p><p></p><p>To become an ordinary disciple of the Devil Jade Pavilion, one needed to comprehend three thousand three hundred and thirty-three demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>To become a core disciple of the Devil Jade Pavilion, one needed to comprehend thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>To become a sequence disciple, one needed to comprehend all the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>These were the conditions for Lin Yuan to become a sequence disciple.</p><p></p><p>The sequence disciples of the Devil Jade Pavilion were considered the elite foundation of the Devil Jade Pavilion. According to the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji, if Lin Yuan could become a sequence disciple, he would have the authority to take over that Devil Jade space.</p><p></p><p>But to become a sequence disciple was too difficult. Even Shen Ji, who had witnessed the creation of many miracles, did not think Lin Yuan had this hope.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend all the demonic evolutionary paths? And be limited to life below the twelfth stage?</p><p></p><p>For a life below the twelfth stage to comprehend the demonic evolutionary paths originating from the body of the supreme being? Even if this supreme being had perished, it was almost impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Most of the lives that became sequence disciples during the heyday of the Devil Jade Pavilion followed the path of cultivating a certain demonic evolutionary path and perfecting it.</p><p></p><p>To directly comprehend the demonic evolutionary paths from the supreme being's body itself? It was almost impossible to do.</p><p></p><p>The interference originating from the supreme being's body itself was too great. The ubiquitous will pressure was greatly increasing the difficulty of comprehending the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But now Lin Yuan was planning to try.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the rewards for becoming a sequence disciple of the Devil Jade Pavilion greatly attracted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, taking over the Devil Jade space would allow Lin Yuan to enjoy the benefits of being a sequence disciple to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the tenth traversal gave Lin Yuan the confidence to comprehend all the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>Virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Space for comprehending the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>The illusory body of the supreme being still hovered in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Countless human civilizational evolutionaries came and went.</p><p></p><p>So far, among the many human civilizational evolutionaries, only the one named "Yuan Qing" had become an ordinary member of the Devil Jade Pavilion by cultivating and supplementing the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>"The more I cultivate, the more I can sense the unfathomable depths of the supreme being's realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, looking up at that body fragment.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had reached the twelfth stage realm in certain aspects, there was still a vast gap compared to a true supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other things, the size of the internal universe within a supreme being's body reached tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years. The physical and spiritual bodies nurtured in such a vast internal universe, how immense must they be?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner world had already broken through the constraints of the main universe, but it was only two to three billion miles in diameter. Compared to a supreme being's internal universe measured in light-years, it was not even on the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first comprehend the demonic evolutionary paths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and carefully observed the body fragment in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Before the tenth traversal, the biggest obstacle for Lin Yuan in comprehending this body fragment was the ubiquitous mental will pressure originating from within the body.</p><p></p><p>These mental will pressures constantly interfered with Lin Yuan's comprehension of the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, compared to when his mental will was below ten thousand, using these mental will pressures to temper his own mental will had almost no effect when his mental will index exceeded ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Having lost the use of tempering his mental will, coupled with the constant interference from the mental will pressures, even with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension ability, he saw no hope of comprehending all the demonic evolutionary paths in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The mental will pressure originated from the supreme being. Any life below the supreme being would be disturbed. Comprehending the demonic evolutionary paths...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The more evolutionary paths of demons one comprehends, the greater the interference one faces. </p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuanzhi had the confidence to comprehend all the evolutionary paths of demons was because he had faith in resisting these pressures and interferences from spiritual willpower.</p><p></p><p>The tenth traversal brought Lin Yuanzhi the greatest help, not in comprehending the sixth level of space-time, but in raising his spiritual willpower index to around 33.34 million.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuanzhi was confident he could comprehend the sixth level of space-time even without the Boundless Void, he had never expected such a huge increase in his spiritual willpower before the traversal.  </p><p></p><p>A spiritual willpower index of tens of millions not only reached the level of the most powerful, but was also considered high among them. Facing the spiritual willpower pressure emanating from physical bodies of the same level, he could ignore it directly, or at least resist it effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he got rid of the interference from this spiritual willpower pressure, comprehending all the evolutionary paths of demons was only a matter of time for Lin Yuanzhi with his unconventional comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>[With your unconventional comprehension, observing the mysterious body, you comprehend ten evolutionary paths of demons.]</p><p></p><p>[With your unconventional comprehension, observing the mysterious body, you comprehend fifty evolutionary paths of demons.] </p><p></p><p>[With your unconventional comprehension, observing the mysterious body, you comprehend two hundred evolutionary paths of demons.]</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuanzhi expected, the spiritual willpower pressure that had greatly interfered with him when contemplating the body projection previously was now like a gentle breeze, no longer affecting him at all.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Lin Yuanzhi had comprehended thousands of evolutionary paths of demons.</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend all the evolutionary paths of demons, relying solely on the body projection in the Void World may not be enough. If necessary, I need to contemplate this body fragment itself."</p><p></p><p>While contemplating, Lin Yuanzhi still had the mind to consider his reliance.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all human evolutionary cultivators were contemplating a body projection that was a partial recreation of that body fragment's essence by several powerful human experts.</p><p></p><p>As for why they did not contemplate the body fragment itself, it was because the influence and pollution from the body fragment itself was too great. Even an eleventh-stage evolutionary cultivator dared not get too close, let alone contemplate it.</p><p></p><p>As for evolutionary cultivators below the eleventh stage, if they dared to directly contemplate the body of a powerful expert, they would likely be instantly overwhelmed by the vast information contained within, or rapidly collapse under the immense spiritual willpower pressure originating from the body itself.</p><p></p><p>However, for the current Lin Yuanzhi, the aforementioned problems were no longer issues.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuanzhi's current spiritual willpower index, even if he faced a living powerful expert, he would remain unfazed in terms of spiritual willpower, let alone a deceased one.</p><p></p><p>That fragment of a powerful expert's body was definitely kept in the human civilization's treasury.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuanzhi's current status in human civilization, he only needed to inform the powerful experts of the Xia Qin to directly contemplate that body fragment.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just contemplation, not taking away the body fragment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzhi separated a strand of spiritual willpower to contemplate the many evolutionary paths of demons within the body.</p><p></p><p>His true self remained seated on the main star of the galaxy, adjusting his state to perfection as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Before crossing into the eleventh stage, I still need to see the powerful experts."</p><p></p><p>Crossing into the eleventh stage would cause a major commotion, so Lin Yuanzhi naturally had to inform the powerful experts in advance.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to hide the infusion of primal chaos from the Void. Rather than having the powerful experts sense his breakthrough, it was better to take the initiative and inform them now.</p><p></p><p>At least this way, the several powerful experts of human civilization would be prepared and not have to worry about actions from other races.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzhi believed he could still trust the powerful experts of human civilization, as long as he was a human evolutionary cultivator, he would gain their support.</p><p></p><p>Hmm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuanzhi once again separated a strand of will and entered the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>In the Xia You virtual world.</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert Xia Qin suddenly opened his eyes as he sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master is looking for me?" Xia Qin's expression turned somewhat solemn. "Is it to discuss breaking through to the eleventh stage?"</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning that Lin Yuanzhi had comprehended the space-time fusion rules at the tenth stage, he had no doubts about Lin Yuanzhi crossing into the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The second level of the Pillar-level fusion rules was enough to cross into the eleventh stage, and comprehending the space-time fusion rules could also allow one to cross into the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>In terms of difficulty, the latter was countless times harder than the former.</p><p></p><p>"In this era of our human civilization, such a talent has actually been born."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin felt quite pensive after agreeing to let Lin Yuanzhi enter.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the space-time fusion rules at the tenth stage? Xia Qin had only heard a few mentions of such monstrous geniuses in the records of legacies from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for within the universe itself? At least Xia Qin had never known of such an unprecedented talent being born before.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Xia Qin saw Lin Yuanzhi's form appear.</p><p></p><p>Since it was in the virtual world, whether Xia Qin or Lin Yuanzhi, they were both strands of spiritual willpower that had condensed.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin was all smiles and was about to ask Lin Yuanzhi what the matter was.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, Xia Qin could no longer smile.</p><p></p><p>He stared at Lin Yuanzhi with some uncertainty and disbelief, scrutinizing him repeatedly, almost thinking he had sensed something wrong.</p>

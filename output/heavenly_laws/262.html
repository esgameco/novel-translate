            <p>Chapter 262: The Aura of an Immortal King (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Inside the Huai Dragon Palace, many true immortal dragon descendants were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>After the initial confusion, these dragon descendants realized that the existence that had struck them was most likely a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>If not a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King, who could easily suppress dozens of true immortal dragon descendants and the Huai Dragon Palace Master, a half-step Immortal King who had passed the physical body tribulation, as if it were a piece of cake?</p><p></p><p>If not a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King, who could ignore the core water vein of the Nine Rivers Domain and treat the million-mile-wide Huai Dragon Palace as a plaything, holding it in their palm?</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, when did we offend an Immortal King?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Palace Master, what exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"A Tribulation Transcending Immortal King, such a powerful existence, why would they take action against us ants?"</p><p></p><p>The true immortal dragon descendants looked at the Huai Dragon Palace Master one by one, asking in panic.</p><p></p><p>Although they were all trapped inside the Huai Dragon Palace and couldn't go out, they could still communicate with each other.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master's expression was gloomy as he swept his eyes over the many panicked true immortal dragon descendants.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>How would he know when the Huai Dragon Palace had offended a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King?</p><p></p><p>Although the Huai Dragon Palace acted tyrannically, they also distinguished between people. Those who might have the backing of an Immortal King or powerful forces were absolutely not to be offended and were even well-supplied.</p><p></p><p>"Which Immortal King is it exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Huai Dragon Palace Master was also afraid, he realized that fear was meaningless. If the Immortal King really wanted to kill them, none of the dragon descendants would be able to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master raised his head and looked outside the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>With one glance, he saw the huge figure overlooking them.</p><p></p><p>The million-mile-wide Huai Dragon Palace was only one-tenth the size of the figure's palm. Compared to this huge figure, the Huai Dragon Palace Master and the others were extremely tiny, and they couldn't even look up to see Lin Yuan's full appearance.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the Immortal King who took action against my Huai Dragon Palace." The Huai Dragon Palace Master had an idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The other true immortal dragon descendants also saw Lin Yuan, but due to the close distance, they couldn't see the full picture and could only confirm that this Immortal King had a human body.</p><p></p><p>Having a human body didn't necessarily mean he was from the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Great Immortal King, all living beings in my Huai Dragon Palace are willing to submit." The Huai Dragon Palace Master immediately said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>She understood that the fate of the entire Huai Dragon Palace depended on the whim of this mysterious Immortal King in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Submit?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the Cangqing Immortal beside him and asked, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"What do I think?" The Cangqing Immortal was trembling, not knowing why Lin Yuan asked him at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Although in their eyes at this moment, the Cangqing Immortal was also a huge figure, he was much farther away, and they could roughly see his appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It's Cangqing?"</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master's heart turned cold.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace had been fighting with the Daode Immortal Sect for so many years, and the Cangqing Immortal was very familiar with her. Naturally, the Huai Dragon Palace Master was also very familiar with Cangqing.</p><p></p><p>However, the more this was the case, the more desperate the Huai Dragon Palace Master felt in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The grudge between the Huai Dragon Palace and the Daode Immortal Sect was too great. The two had been fighting for hundreds of thousands of years, and countless subordinates had died.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Huai Dragon Palace had fallen into the hands of the Cangqing Immortal, how could there be a good ending?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll decide."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that the Cangqing Immortal didn't dare to make a decision, so he moved his mind slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace in his palm immediately began to disintegrate. All matter, whether living or non-living, was completely transformed into the most fundamental essence.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it formed a thumb-sized essence pill.</p><p></p><p>This essence pill, refined from all the true immortal dragon descendants of the Huai Dragon Palace, including the Palace Master who was a half-step Immortal King who had passed the physical body tribulation, as well as the Huai Dragon Palace itself, had a negligible effect even on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although the Cangqing Immortal didn't dare to make a decision, Lin Yuan could still sense his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>That was to eliminate future troubles forever.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Huai Dragon Palace had a great karmic connection with Jun Dongjin. The former had once severely injured the latter, reducing the possibility of him breaking through to the Harmonious Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan had no intention of sparing the Huai Dragon Palace at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Huai Dragon Palace is gone."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal's expression was dazed, not because he pitied or sympathized with them.</p><p></p><p>But because the Huai Dragon Palace, which had been passed down for millions of years, would end in such a dramatic scene.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Martial Ancestor." The Cangqing Immortal carefully stole a glance at Lin Yuan's back, and his heart trembled even more.</p><p></p><p>Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings were high and mighty. If an Immortal King took action against the Huai Dragon Palace, they could indeed do what Lin Yuan had done.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through layers of barriers and grabbing the entire Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>The many descriptions of Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings collected by the Daode Immortal Sect could also confirm this point.</p><p></p><p>The farther the distance, the more the power of the same attack would dissipate and decrease. Not to mention that Lin Yuan was separated by the distance of two major domains, and he easily captured the entire Huai Dragon Palace. This involved not only the issue of distance.</p><p></p><p>But also the insight into the essence of heaven and earth, as well as the mastery of the profoundness of space.</p><p></p><p>In short, Lin Yuan's strength seemed to be a bit beyond the standard, exceeding the limit of what a normal Tribulation Transcending Immortal King could do.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, the Huai Dragon Palace Master never knew that she and the entire Huai Dragon Palace had instantly crossed a distance of billions of miles to arrive at the Martial Temple, which was why she thought Lin Yuan was a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>But the Cangqing Immortal saw it clearly. The Huai Dragon Palace was originally located in the Nine Rivers Domain, but Lin Yuan easily grabbed it over.</p><p></p><p>"The little fellow from back then, meeting again, not only has he become an Immortal King, but among Immortal Kings, he can also be considered..."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal sighed in his heart, not knowing how to describe Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was an ordinary Immortal King or a supreme Immortal King, the difference wasn't very big to him. In any case, they were all existences that he couldn't look up to.</p><p></p><p>"You can tell the truth about the destruction of the Huai Dragon Palace." Lin Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of this sentence was that there was no need to hide the fact that the mysterious Immortal King who destroyed the Huai Dragon Palace was the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>This course of action was also decided by Lin Yuan after careful consideration. With his current strength, he didn't need to hide his identity at all.</p><p></p><p>Revealing some of his strength had many benefits.</p><p></p><p>One was to greatly promote the martial cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Let more cultivators embark on the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation system with true immortals as the top combat power and a cultivation system with Immortal Kings as the top combat power were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, as the Martial Ancestor, was comparable to Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings. At the very least, it proved that the martial dao was also a great dao leading to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The second was that Lin Yuan had always wanted to make contact with other Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings in the Spirit Realm, but these Immortal Kings were either untraceable or too far away.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Lin Yuan would display his strength and actively attract those Immortal Kings to come over.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Cangqing Immortal said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>It was not a difficult task for the Daode Immortal Sect to pass on a message.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the Huai Dragon Palace caused a great uproar in the entire Dongyun Daozhou, and even the nearby...</p><p></p><p>The other Daozhu were all shaken by this matter.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Huailong Palace had great influence. In fact, even if Huailong Palace obtained the essence of Tianshui, it would still be difficult to rival the few core domains of a Daozhu in the end.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Huailong Palace caused such a big stir was entirely due to the existence that made a move against Huailong Palace, which could almost certainly be confirmed to be a Transcendent Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a Transcendent Immortal King was enough to shake the Daozhu and trigger discussions like a tsunami.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also very curious. Huailong Palace is nothing special. With just a word from an Immortal King, I would personally go to destroy it. Why would an Immortal King need to take action himself?"</p><p></p><p>"In our Dongyun Daozhu, another Immortal King has finally appeared."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwang Domain, Dongyun Daozhu, and even the numerous true immortals of other Daozhu were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>This was an Immortal King after all.</p><p></p><p>In the long years past, a true immortal at the peak of the Unification Realm, traveling through the three thousand Daozhu, would only hope to see one or two Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>Just as countless forces were discussing the origins of that mysterious Immortal King,</p><p></p><p>A force called Daode Immortal Sect from the Xuanwang Domain announced that the mysterious Immortal King who destroyed Huailong Palace was none other than the Martial Ancestor of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>This news spread like a hurricane.</p><p></p><p>The true identity of a Transcendent Immortal King, what kind of important intelligence was this?</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor of the Martial Temple? I have some impression of the Martial Temple, a cultivation system that tends towards tempering the physical body. The strongest should only be comparable to true immortals. Can this cultivation system give birth to an Immortal King?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this true or false? A Martial Temple limited to a city actually has an Immortal King presiding over it?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be fake. Even if the Daode Immortal Sect had the guts, they wouldn't dare to spread rumors about an Immortal King's identity, right?"</p><p></p><p>Although many true immortals had doubts about the information that the mysterious Immortal King came from the Martial Temple, they didn't dare to publicly refute it.</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>If you refute other major domain forces, what can they do to you? After all, separated by a major domain, even a half-step Immortal King would be powerless.</p><p></p><p>But if you question and refute an Immortal King... In the three thousand Daozhu, the desolate lands, no matter how far you run, you can't stop the malice of an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. I have to go to Xuanwang Domain to visit that Martial Ancestor. This is an existence comparable to an Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going too. If the Martial Ancestor agrees to accept me as a disciple, I'm willing to abandon my cultivation and walk the path of martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"Accept you as a disciple? Have you looked in the mirror? That's an Immortal King level expert, and he would still accept you as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>A large portion of the true immortals from dozens of nearby Daozhu began heading towards Dongyun Daozhu.</p><p></p><p>True immortals at the peak of the Unification Realm hoped to see an Immortal King. It was through this kind of method, where an Immortal King revealed his whereabouts somewhere,</p><p></p><p>Attracting numerous other true immortals to come from far and wide.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the true immortals who came to pay their respects,</p><p></p><p>Countless low-level cultivators were even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"It just so happens that my spiritual root aptitude is lacking, and my potential in the immortal dao is limited. I've decided to go to the Martial Temple to become a disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, with an Immortal King level expert presiding over the martial dao cultivation system, becoming a martial dao cultivator is infinitely better than joining those forces. The vast majority of forces have never had an Immortal King level expert appear."</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The many martial dao cultivators were a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"What? Not only has our Martial Ancestor returned, but he has also become an Immortal King level expert and casually destroyed Huailong Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"This... this... this..."</p><p></p><p>Many newly joined cultivators of the Martial Temple suddenly felt a sense of unexpected joy.</p><p></p><p>Originally, joining the Martial Temple meant they would definitely not be able to compete with the disciples of Daode Immortal Sect and Xuanwang Palace, but now, those disciples should be the ones fawning over them, right?</p><p></p><p>Outside Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>Jun Haiqiu, Jun Nangong, and Jun Yunxun, the three outstanding descendants of the Jun family, finally arrived at Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>"Our Wuji Ancestor has become an Immortal King?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at each other. They were not Cangqing Immortals and had spent a lot of time rushing from Daode Immortal Sect to Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>However, on the way, they had already received the news that the Martial Ancestor was an Immortal King level expert.</p><p></p><p>"Wuji Ancestor disappeared for hundreds of thousands of years, and when he reappeared, he was an Immortal King level expert? I feel like I'm dreaming."</p><p></p><p>The three Jun family descendants only felt that happiness had come too suddenly and too fiercely, and it was a bit hard to bear.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that Wuji Ancestor would be very strong. After all, they had heard legends about Wuji Ancestor since they were young. But at most, they thought Wuji Ancestor would be similar to Cangqing Immortal.</p><p></p><p>As for an Immortal King?</p><p></p><p>They had never even considered it.</p><p></p><p>If it were that easy to become an Immortal King,</p><p></p><p>There wouldn't be so few Immortal Kings in the three thousand Daozhu of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Wuji Ancestor has become an Immortal King, will he not want to see us?" Jun Haiqiu asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>That was an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>High and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the three thousand Daozhu.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A purple-robed elder suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>His gaze glanced at the position of Dongyun Daozhu below.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that in such a remote Daozhu, a fellow Daoist could also be born." The purple-robed elder was also a Transcendent Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was vast and boundless, and the number of Transcendent Immortal Kings was extremely rare. It was not easy to see a fellow Daoist, so the purple-robed elder naturally had the idea of paying a visit.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor... I haven't heard of this title. It seems to be a newly ascended Immortal King?" </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Those powerful Immortal Kings, such as the Supreme Immortal King and the Peerless Immortal King, shook the three thousand Daozhu, and even other Immortal Kings had to show sufficient reverence.</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder considered himself well-informed and had a wide network, but he had never heard of an Immortal King with such a title.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he believed that this Martial Ancestor had only recently ascended to the Transcendent Realm, which was a very reasonable guess.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder instantly arrived outside Xiaoyao City and stopped on a mountain peak in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what kind of bearing this newly ascended Immortal King has." The purple-robed elder's eyes faintly emitted a purple light.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Transcendent Realm, Immortal King level beings began to influence their surroundings and even connect with the heaven and earth of the Spirit Realm, thereby exhibiting some "bearings".</p><p></p><p>These kinds of bearings had no specific form and were difficult to observe, but the purple-robed elder cultivated a secret technique that could capture these Immortal King bearings to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"For a newly ascended Immortal King, the bearing shouldn't be great. Those veteran Immortal Kings, and even the Peerless Immortal Kings, just their own bearings can stir the Nine Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder thought to himself while observing the location of Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>At the Transcendent Realm stage, the longer the cultivation time and the stronger the strength, the greater the invisible influence on the surrounding environment, which in turn led to increasingly terrifying Immortal King bearings...</p><p></p><p>Almost like some "wonders" and "anomalies" in the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Through the Immortal King's bearing, one could also judge the strength of this Immortal King to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"This?!!"</p><p></p><p>The more the purple-robed elder observed, the more obvious his expression changed, and in the end, he even revealed a look of shock.</p>

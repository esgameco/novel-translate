        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A stream of information entered Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"So, after absorbing the seven liquids, there was actually a continuation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan massaged his brow. The grayish-purple gourd didn't convey much information to him. </p><p></p><p>To summarize:</p><p></p><p>The gist was probably this - </p><p></p><p>After the seventh purple liquid, there was an eighth liquid.</p><p></p><p>But to condense the eighth liquid required demands on one's physical body and inner space.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, the physical body must reach the twelfth level realm, while the inner space must undergo a metamorphosis to become an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Only such a physical body and inner space could support the amplification of the eighth liquid.</p><p></p><p>"The twelfth level realm?"</p><p></p><p>"An inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly. Existences possessing both of these conditions were probably only at the level of paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>According to the information from the Xuanhuang lineage, by relying on various external secret methods and specific fusion rules, there was a slim hope of elevating an eleventh-level life's physical body to the threshold of the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>But an inner universe? That could only be formed when breaking through to the ultimate realm, after a final leap and reaching the pinnacle of transcendence.  </p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, his current inner world was far from meeting the minimum standard of an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Even if he underwent another primordial chaos infusion, causing his inner world's foundation to explosively increase by several realms, it still wouldn't compare to an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>A paramount expert's inner universe was the source of their power, their reliance for transcending the river of time - it was akin to a weakened version of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"What is the origin of this gourd?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed solemnly at the floating grayish-purple gourd before him.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what use the eighth liquid of the gourd had for an inner universe, judging from the effects of the previous seven liquids on his own inner world, he could easily deduce that even paramount experts would undergo some kind of metamorphosis from it.</p><p></p><p>And this was quite inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The realm paramount experts existed in was so immensely high. Some treasures and rarities had tremendous boosting effects on tenth-level or eleventh-level lives.</p><p></p><p>But in front of paramount experts, they were basically useless, let alone causing a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never heard of any treasure or rarity that could make a paramount expert undergo a metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"I must keep the gourd safe," Lin Yuan's thoughts focused.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan thought the mysterious gourd only had effects on lives below the twelfth level. Even so, its value far exceeded that of the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>If it could grant even paramount experts a metamorphosis, the value of the mysterious gourd was incalculable.</p><p></p><p>"Put it away?"</p><p></p><p>"Where to put it?"</p><p></p><p>With a mental nudge, Lin Yuan communicated with the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and placed the mysterious gourd into a spatial bracelet, sending it to the deepest part of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's true self was stationed at the main star of the Milky Way, within the domain of human civilization under the watchful eyes of paramount experts, it couldn't be considered completely secure.</p><p></p><p>For instance, if several ultimate experts from alien races joined forces and attacked before the human paramount experts could react, they might be able to kill Lin Yuan and seize the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was slim - ultimate existences wouldn't team up against a mere tenth-level life, would they? Moreover, with the Zhen Shen Pearl's existence, alien ultimates couldn't completely kill Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But the possibility remained, so Lin Yuan had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Placing the mysterious gourd in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was basically foolproof. At least since the secret realm appeared, no paramount expert had entered it.</p><p></p><p>Keeping the mysterious gourd in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was far safer than keeping it on Lin Yuan's person, even if it would be slightly more inconvenient to use later.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>On the Black Planet, in the Path Guiding Space of the Life and Death Cycle rules, one of Lin Yuan's avatars sat, constantly observing the alternating fusion of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Almost every second, Lin Yuan gained new insights into the Life and Death Cycle fusion rules. His inverse transcendent comprehension ability combined with the guiding path allowed Lin Yuan to soar rapidly in cultivating this fusion of rules.</p><p></p><p>"Marvelous, marvelous!"</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined the Life and Death Cycle could be integrated in this way."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in it, his mind constantly sparking with epiphanies.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary tenth-level life to gain insights into a pillar-level fusion of rules would require immense effort and payment.</p><p></p><p>But for the current Lin Yuan, it had almost become 'routine'.</p><p></p><p>"Life is not simply life."</p><p></p><p>"Death is not simply death."</p><p></p><p>The deeper Lin Yuan's comprehension of these two rules, the deeper his understanding of the Life and Death Cycle rules became.</p><p></p><p>The rules of life and death, if taken individually, were not particularly powerful pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>But when fused together, the life and death cycle force that erupted became one of the most lethal fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>On Battlefield A076 of the alien races, compared to the large alien battlefield Lin Yuan was at, the intensity of war here was even higher, gathering four apex races - human civilization, the Feather Race, the Prison Race and the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>The entire battlefield was like a meat grinder - eighth-level, ninth-level experts died every day.</p><p></p><p>Even tenth-level experts who hadn't reached the highest ranks could easily perish if caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>Of course, experts daring enough to come to this large alien battlefield were basically just avatars. But even if an avatar perished, it had no small impact on the true self.</p><p></p><p>The expenditure of various resources to raise an avatar close to the true self's strength was not much less than for the true self itself.</p><p></p><p>If a tenth-level expert lost their avatar, it would likely take thousands or tens of thousands of years to recover.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>At the center of Battlefield A076, deep within a permanent spatial rift spanning a thousand miles, grayish mist slowly billowed out.</p><p></p><p>The depths of the permanent spatial rift were filled with this grayish mist everywhere.</p><p></p><p>This was the primordial chaos, the source that birthed countless universes.</p><p></p><p>And far away from this permanent spatial rift, a dazzling, prismatic 'aurora' rapidly pierced through.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the aurora passed, all the grayish mist was instantly vaporized.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, this prismatic aurora penetrated into the permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>On Battlefield A076, numerous experts were fighting fiercely. </p><p></p><p>Even tenth-level peak and eleventh-level experts occasionally entered, influencing the tilt of the local war.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, from within the permanent spatial rift high above the battlefield, a prismatic aurora burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble rumble!</p><p></p><p>The aurora tore through everything. The extremely stable space of the large battlefield was as fragile as paper. Even the battlefield itself was exceedingly feeble.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh??"</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Before the eleventh-level lives on the battlefield could react, they were reduced to ashes by the aurora.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Battlefield A076, spanning hundreds or even thousands of light-years in diameter, rapidly collapsed. Countless lives, including eleventh-level experts, perished completely.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, an invisible ripple spread out in all directions from each life that died, pervading the universe.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>"This aurora?"</p><p></p><p>Around the battlefield, over a dozen towering figures appeared, their expressions grave as they looked at the shattered large alien battlefield and the still dazzlingly prismatic aurora that showed almost no signs of weakening.</p><p></p><p>"Stop it."</p><p></p><p>The over a dozen towering figures swiftly acted, forces transcending space and time continuously expanding until they finally constrained the aurora.</p><p></p><p>"This aurora carries the power of karmic curses. Every life killed by it must bear the corresponding karmic curse."  </p><p></p><p>"Lives below the tenth level probably can't withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"Which ruin is this method from?"</p><p></p><p>The over a dozen towering figures, all paramount experts, exchanged a few words before starting to study the aurora.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, all sorts of variables would occasionally emerge from the permanent spatial rifts, like the paramount expert's body over a hundred years ago, and the dazzling aurora just now.</p><p></p><p>Both of these clearly reached the twelfth level realm. Especially that aurora - after piercing through infinite distances, its remaining might was still extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>News of the events at Battlefield A076 quickly spread throughout the universe's races.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"A large alien battlefield is gone?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan blinked, looking at Vice-Pavilion Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>Large alien battlefields each spanned hundreds of light-years in diameter. Even in the vast cosmic starry sky, they were considered massive entities.</p><p></p><p>How could one just vanish like that?</p><p></p><p>"Supposedly it was destroyed by an aurora that came from outside the universe," Vice-Pavilion Master Nalan's tone was also extremely astonished.</p><p></p><p>Normally, large alien battlefields were personally refined by experts, making them extremely difficult to destroy.</p><p></p><p>Even paramount experts fighting each other at most would only shatter a local area, as paramount experts...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>During battles, they would try their best to avoid damaging the battlefield itself.</p><p></p><p>"Aurora from outside the universe?" Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows. </p><p></p><p>"Correct," said the vice chief of the Nalan Tower. "An aurora from outside the universe shattered an entire large alien battlefield. If it weren't for the intervention of a supremely powerful being, the might of that aurora would have caused widespread devastation."</p><p></p><p>This incident was no secret - the entire universe of myriad races was going crazy over it.</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying," Lin Yuan said quietly after a moment.</p><p></p><p>Although he had long known that the dangers on large alien battlefields went far beyond just the aliens themselves. The many perils of the chaotic void outside the permanent spatial rifts also threatened all the powerful beings on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to that aurora now?" Lin Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Unclear," the Nalan vice chief shook his head. "It probably fell into the hands of a supremely powerful being."</p><p></p><p>"That aurora carried the power of karmic killing curses. All the ninth and eighth level lifeforms killed by the aurora, including their main bodies and avatars, perished completely. Over a million ninth and eighth level lifeforms from my human civilization were annihilated."</p><p></p><p>"The power of karmic killing curses..." Lin Yuan's expression turned grave. A killing curse powerful enough to slay ninth and eighth level lifeforms on such a large scale would be a burden even for a supremely powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"So it seems the resurrection date for our human civilization will be moved up," said the Nalan vice chief.</p><p></p><p>According to past patterns, the next time a supremely powerful being would act to resurrect the fallen should have been two thousand years from now. But after the collapse of this large alien battlefield and the sudden surge in the number of fallen evolved humans to unprecedented levels, the future resurrection list for the next two thousand years was already filled.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, a supremely powerful being would generally take action to resurrect them ahead of schedule.</p><p></p><p>"The resurrection date will be moved up?" Lin Yuan nodded slightly, not completely unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful beings did not resurrect the fallen based on fixed intervals, but rather based on the number of fallen lifeforms - in other words, the number of evolved beings on the resurrection list. As long as the number on the resurrection list reached a certain threshold, the supremely powerful being would take action to resurrect them all at once.</p><p></p><p>In the personal virtual world of the Supreme Lord Xia Qin...</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Lord," Lin Yuan's form appeared as he slightly bowed to Xia Qin seated on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"How is it going? Have you comprehended the fusion rules within the Inheritance Star?" Xia Qin asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan nodded. With the guidance of the fusion rules and his own extraordinary comprehension abilities, his understanding of the rules of life and death reincarnation was progressing by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>"There is something I wish to discuss with the Supreme Lord this time," Lin Yuan said after a moment's hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it?" Xia Qin's expression remained unchanged, but he was actually quite pleased inwardly. He did not fear Lin Yuan asking him for things, only Lin Yuan being without any desires.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the next resurrection date will be moved up," Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. The next resurrection will be set one year from now," Xia Qin nodded. When the resurrection list was full, it was only natural to resurrect them sooner rather than later.</p><p></p><p>For ultimate beings, going against the flow came at a fixed cost. Resurrecting one life or resurrecting tens of thousands of lives required the same cost of going against the flow. Only the subsequent backlash depended on the strength and number of resurrected lives.</p><p></p><p>"I have a good friend who just entered the sixth level, not on this resurrection list," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>There were two ways to get on the resurrection list. One was to have extremely shocking innate talents and qualifications. Evolved beings like this, if they fell accidentally, would be placed on the resurrection list by the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The second was for evolved beings who fell on the battlefield while fighting for humanity - basically all of them would be resurrected by their own supreme lord.</p><p></p><p>Of course, regardless of which category, the resurrected evolved beings would need to bear part of the 'cost'. But compared to being given another chance at life, this cost was negligible.</p><p></p><p>"You want me to resurrect your friend as well?" Xia Qin asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded. Previously, due to the ancient divine path of evolution, Fang Qing's spiritual will had been taken away by the ancient god Tuo Ba, who used it to threaten Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not submit to the threat. Instead, he took the initiative to curse and kill that strand of Fang Qing's spiritual will. This seemed cruel, but it was actually Fang Qing's best chance at survival. If Lin Yuan did not take the initiative to kill it, allowing Tuo Ba to take over Fang Qing's experiences, Fang Qing's own memories would be tainted, making resurrection impossible.</p><p></p><p>It was just that with Fang Qing's talents and qualifications, he had not yet met the prerequisites for resurrection and was not on the supreme lord's resurrection list. So Lin Yuan had to personally plead with the supreme lord.</p><p></p><p>"A small matter. Just send me the citizen ID of the one to be resurrected later," Xia Qin said nonchalantly. For an ultimate being, resurrecting an evolved being who had just entered the sixth level was trivial, especially when resurrecting them together with a large batch.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supreme Lord," Lin Yuan said with some solemnity. What was an effortless deed for the supreme lord was an unimaginable scenario for anything below the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>One year later, at the Xia You Evolution Spire...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood alongside many tenth level evolved beings and eleventh level evolved beings. During each resurrection performed by the supreme lord, there would be many high-level evolved beings present to observe.</p><p></p><p>Such an event involving the operation of the laws of space-time would provide an excellent opportunity for any evolved being studying the laws of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Lord, this must be your first time witnessing a supreme lord performing a resurrection, right?" The Nalan vice chief stood beside Lin Yuan and asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded. Based on the rate at which evolved humans fell on the battlefield, it would take around ten to fifty thousand years to accumulate enough for a resurrection list. </p><p></p><p>In other words, the supreme lord would perform a resurrection once every ten to fifty thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Then you should observe carefully," the Nalan vice chief said quickly. "When the supreme lord goes against the flow, it will cause a partial manifestation of the river of time. Observing it carefully will aid in comprehending the laws of time."</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan replied immediately. In fact, not to mention a partial manifestation of the river of time - he had already witnessed its full appearance before. Of course, he did not mention this to the Nalan vice chief.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the watchful eyes of all the evolved beings present, the figure of Xia Qin the Supreme Lord appeared noiselessly. Although he did not emanate any aura, Lin Yuan could feel the rules of the universe and starry skies retreating in deference to Xia Qin's presence.</p><p></p><p>As a supreme lord containing an entire universe within his body, embodying myriad complete laws, his fundamental nature transcended the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Lord..." This was Lin Yuan's first time witnessing the true form of a supreme lord within the universe. Previously, although the supreme lord had brought him out of the river of time, Lin Yuan was but a strand of spiritual will at the time.</p><p></p><p>"It's starting," the Nalan vice chief said in a low voice. Having experienced the supreme lord's resurrection many times before, he was quite experienced with it.</p><p></p><p>Just as the vice chief finished speaking, intense fluctuations of space-time surged forth. A vast, illusory river appeared before Xia Qin the Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also felt the enormous fluctuations of the laws of time, although far less than when he had previously witnessed the full appearance of the river of time. But it was still much more potent than normal comprehension of the time laws.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin then began moving against the flow of the river of time, reaching fixed points in time before extending his massive hands into the illusory river to scoop out figure after figure encased in amber.</p><p></p><p>With each sweep of his hands, thousands or tens of thousands of amber figures would be pulled out. At the same time, an intangible backlash from the universe and river of time descended upon Xia Qin, but he blocked it all.</p><p></p><p>Unless resurrecting large numbers of eleventh level powerhouses, or eleventh level beings of extremely special natures, this level of backlash could hardly affect a supreme lord.</p><p></p><p>"The river of time... Except for ultimate beings, all things and beings exist within the river of time," Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although lifeforms below the twelfth level all existed within the river of time, their relative sizes within the river differed based on their strength.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan had just comprehended the laws of time as a ninth level evolved being, his form within the river of time was minuscule, like a subatomic particle.</p><p></p><p>"But I crossed into the tenth level quite a while ago. I wonder what size my form has reached within the river of time now?"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Lin Yuan began to sense the true river of time and the size of his own form deep within it.</p>

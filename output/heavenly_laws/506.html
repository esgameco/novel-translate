        <h1>Chapter 506</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the 11th time-traveling, Lin Yuan felt that the vast river of time seemed a bit narrow for him.</p><p></p><p>Over the following centuries, after thoroughly comprehending and undergoing the transformation brought about by the rules of chaos, this feeling became even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Within the river of time, Lin Yuan had to curl up his body, trying his best to make himself smaller.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if he lay flat, part of his body would still exceed the limit that the river of time could accommodate.</p><p></p><p>This hidden danger was not small. At the lightest, it might alert the Twelve Ultimates on the riverbank, and at the heaviest, it could directly trigger the river of time to retaliate, forcing him to make the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>But when the Twelve Ultimate Celestial Feather Dust of the Celestial Feather Tribe actively entered the space of the river of time, hiding from the attack of the Taiji Primordial Spirit wielding Twelve Ultimate weapons...</p><p></p><p>The curled-up Lin Yuan underneath the river of time couldn't help but reach out his right hand, extending it into the riverbank, grasping Celestial Feather Dust's ankle, and pulling him into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Just extending a hand, without staying out of the river of time for a long time, should not trigger the river of time's retaliation," Lin Yuan thought to himself, as even an ordinary Eleven-Completed life would occasionally leap out of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>As long as the time was short enough, there would be no major problem. Even if he was forced to make the ultimate leap prematurely, it would not affect Lin Yuan, as his current state was perfect, reaching the pinnacle in all aspects, ready to assault the Twelve Ultimate realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" </p><p></p><p>Celestial Feather Dust, who was originally standing on the riverbank and pondering how to wage war against human civilization, suddenly found himself being dragged into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"No!!"</p><p></p><p>Celestial Feather Dust's face was filled with terror, as he never expected an attack from underneath the river of time.</p><p></p><p>On the riverbank of the river of time, even if the Twelve Ultimates fought each other, it would only be a battle on the riverbank. And this kind of battle was relatively simple within the universe, without many profound rules, so normally no Twelve Ultimate would engage in fierce fighting on the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>As for what was underneath the river of time? They were just some trapped ants and dust, and the most they could do was briefly leap out of the water to glance up at their own Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>Before Celestial Feather Dust could react, his right foot that was grabbed had already touched the water of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>For life forms below the Twelve Ultimate realm, the water of the river of time was extremely gentle, without any lethality. But for those who had broken free from the river of time, the river of time's water was the most deadly poison.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Ultimate beings standing on the riverbank had never re-entered the river of time, precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as the Twelve Ultimates, prolonged contact with the river of time's water would greatly erode their fundamental life essence, possibly causing them to fall back to the Eleven-Completed life level, and be bound by the river of time once again.</p><p></p><p>This was something that any Twelve Ultimate could never accept.</p><p></p><p>Hum~</p><p></p><p>As Celestial Feather Dust's right foot was submerged in the river of time, his spiritual will was shaken, and before he could do anything, the hand from underneath the river of time had completely dragged him into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>In front of the space-time black hole.</p><p></p><p>The many Twelve Ultimate beings who were engaged in fierce battles with the nine Strongest of the Human Civilization gradually stopped their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Feather Dust had tried his best, but was ultimately suppressed and beaten by the Galaxy Overlord, and had no choice but to retreat into the space of the river of time - this scene was unacceptable to the more than ten Twelve Ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Overlord's attack power had already reached the Twelve Ultimate threshold, and judging from the situation, it was not just reaching the threshold, but could actually injure Celestial Feather Dust? Otherwise, Celestial Feather Dust would not have chosen to retreat into the river of time space.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the Twelve Ultimate beings fell silent.</p><p></p><p>What were they gathered here to do again? Surround and kill the Galaxy Overlord?</p><p></p><p>But the current Galaxy Overlord, could they really surround and kill him? With the strength the Galaxy Overlord had just displayed, the difficulty would be no less than surrounding and killing a Twelve Ultimate being.</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of this universe, even in the most brutal battles between Twelve Ultimate beings, there had never been the fall of a Twelve Ultimate life.</p><p></p><p>On the human civilization side, the Nine Strongest, including Xuanyuan the Strongest, also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Strongest had rushed here, intending to avenge Lin Yuan. In their eyes, more than ten Twelve Ultimate beings had locked onto Lin Yuan's avatar's coordinates.</p><p></p><p>The outcome was already determined. Xuanyuan the Strongest, Xia Qin the Strongest, had already prepared to make a big demand - so many Twelve Ultimate beings surrounding and killing the Galaxy Overlord? </p><p></p><p>Even if it was just an avatar, it was a serious violation of the unspoken rules between the Twelve Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if these Twelve Ultimate beings did not pay a satisfactory price to the human civilization afterwards, Xuanyuan the Strongest would immediately take action himself to kill the Eleven-Completed and Ten-Completed lives of other tribes.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanyuan the Strongest's and the others' predictions, the Twelve Ultimate beings surrounding the Galaxy Overlord should back down, after all, it was they who had overturned the table.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The development of the situation was somewhat out of Xuanyuan the Strongest's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of the Galaxy Overlord had not fallen, but was instead suppressing the Twelve Ultimate Celestial Feather Dust.</p><p></p><p>This made Xuanyuan the Strongest feel somewhat unfamiliar. They, the Nine Strongest, had rushed here just to avenge the surrounded and killed Galaxy Overlord's avatar.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just an avatar.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Galaxy Overlord's avatar not only did not die, but the Celestial Feather Tribe's Ultimate was being beaten up.</p><p></p><p>This actually left Xuanyuan the Strongest and Xia Qin the Strongest at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Overlord."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Tribe's Ultimate's gaze was deep, looking towards the space of the river of time, making eye contact with the Celestial Feather Dust standing on the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>The other Twelve Ultimate beings did the same. They realized the seriousness of the situation - the Galaxy Overlord was not someone they could surround and kill.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Tribe Queen's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The other Twelve Ultimate beings were the same.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, under the watchful eyes of the Twelve Ultimate beings, Celestial Feather Dust was ruthlessly dragged into the river of time by a hand emerging from beneath it.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>On the riverbank of the river of time, the Twelve Ultimate beings all stared solemnly at the vast river of time.</p><p></p><p>"That hand?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galaxy Overlord."</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Overlord is just a life form within the river, how could he have the power to drag us Twelve Ultimates down?"</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Ultimate beings found it unbelievable. The space of the river of time was the fundamental reflection of life, to be able to drag a Twelve Ultimate being in here, how strong must the life essence be?</p><p></p><p>"Why not possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, you saw how the Galaxy Overlord was suppressing and beating Celestial Feather Dust earlier."</p><p></p><p>The Cosmos Tribe's Ultimate spoke up.</p><p></p><p>At these words, many Twelve Ultimate beings immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>Even an Eleven-Completed life had appeared that could suppress a Twelve Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>A life form within the river of time dragging a life form on the riverbank was not absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tian Yu Chen is going to take a big fall this time."</p><p></p><p>The ultimate of the Prison Clan said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of Twelfth-Stage Ultimates stood on the banks of the River of Time, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>But not a single Twelfth-Stage Ultimate was willing to step in and enter the River of Time to save Tian Yu Chen. Even the other Ultimates of the Tian Yu Clan only stood silently on the shore, without the slightest intention of rescuing him. Rescue?</p><p></p><p>How could they rescue him?</p><p></p><p>Twelfth-Stage life forms are inherently repelled by the River of Time. If a Twelfth-Stage life form dares to enter the River of Time, they would have to face the cost of their fundamental life essence being severely eroded.</p><p></p><p>Splash splash.</p><p></p><p>Just as the many Twelfth-Stage Ultimates were gazing at the River of Time,</p><p></p><p>the previously calm surface of the long river suddenly began to churn with ripples.</p><p></p><p>The ripples kept increasing in intensity, eventually forming waves, as if there were two prehistoric giant beasts grappling beneath the river.</p><p></p><p>"Get out, get out, get out!!"</p><p></p><p>Within the River of Time, Tian Yu Chen felt his fundamental life essence constantly weakening, and in his shock and fury, he fought back.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, however, was unfazed. He could sense the River of Time's influence and suppression on Tian Yu Chen. At this moment, he only needed to hold Tian Yu Chen, the Twelfth-Stage life form, in place.</p><p></p><p>After a certain time limit, the other party would face the risk of their life essence regressing.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Chen's eyes turned bloodshot, and the twenty-four pairs of wings on his back began to flap.</p><p></p><p>Silently, two of those pairs of wings started to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Chen's power surged greatly, and with a casual wave of his hand, he repelled Lin Yuan, then directly charged out of the River of Time, fleeing hastily towards the shore.</p><p></p><p>"He's out?"</p><p>"Tian Yu Chen has come out."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth-Stage ones on the shore saw this and let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p>They also noticed Tian Yu Chen's weakened aura, and that his original twenty-four pairs of wings had been reduced to twenty-two. But as long as he had escaped the River of Time, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestral Elders of the Tian Yu Clan quickly retrieved Tian Yu Chen, and their figures disappeared, returning to the Tian Yu Clan's domain.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Beneath the River of Time, Lin Yuan watched as the escaped Tian Yu Chen, feeling a slight regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, even if Lin Yuan deployed his true self and the supreme boundary-breaking weapons, he would have no hope of killing a Twelfth-Stage Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Primordial Spirit wielding Twelfth-Stage weapons, even if it struck out tens of millions of blows, could at most inflict some minor injuries on Tian Yu Chen.</p><p></p><p>And given enough time, the other awakened Twelfth-Stage Ultimates would also intervene.</p><p></p><p>But within the River of Time?</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Chen had a real chance of perishing.</p><p></p><p>However, the gap in fundamental life essence between Lin Yuan and Tian Yu Chen was still quite large, even though Tian Yu Chen had to devote nine-tenths of his power to resist the erosion from the entire River of Time.</p><p></p><p>If Tian Yu Chen were to go all-out, Lin Yuan wouldn't even be able to hold him back.</p><p></p><p>Although he failed to completely keep Tian Yu Chen, Lin Yuan still achieved his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Because the injuries Tian Yu Chen sustained can almost be described as irreparable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the erosion his life essence suffered during his fall into the River of Time, just the last two pairs of wings that were shattered in order to escape the River of Time...</p><p></p><p>This had likely exacted an irreversible price from Tian Yu Chen.</p><p></p><p>The power core of the Tian Yu Clan lies in the wings on their backs, even at the Twelfth-Stage.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the wings can certainly provide a sudden surge of power, but afterwards, they will face a near-permanent weakening and decline in strength.</p><p></p><p>As a Twelfth-Stage life form, even if Tian Yu Chen has the confidence to recover the two shattered pairs of wings, it would likely take billions upon billions of years.</p><p></p><p>And before the recovery, Tian Yu Chen probably wouldn't dare show his face.</p><p></p><p>A Twelfth-Stage Ultimate with only twenty-two pairs of wings, their strength is likely at the bottom among Twelfth-Stage life forms.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"These Twelfth-Stage ones haven't left?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, hiding beneath the river water, noticed that the many Twelfth-Stage Ultimates on the river bank were still gazing at the water below.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan clearly noticed that the positions where these Twelfth-Stage Ultimates were standing had moved a considerable distance away from the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, these Twelfth-Stage Ultimates had been standing right at the river's edge, looking down upon the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, the 'big fish' leaping out of the water would be seen from below.</p><p></p><p>But now, it could no longer be considered the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>"They're all guarding against me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. He wasn't surprised.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was able to drag Tian Yu Chen into the River of Time was mainly due to the element of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Chen never expected the pull from beneath the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of thing could only be done once.</p><p></p><p>Now that these Twelfth-Stage Ultimates were on guard, constantly vigilant about Lin Yuan beneath the River of Time, it would be impossible to repeat the same feat.</p><p></p><p>One reason was the distance was too far, Lin Yuan would have to climb out halfway just to reach the current positions of those Twelfth-Stage Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>The other reason was that with their guard up, the Twelfth-Stage Ultimates would react immediately. Given the gap in fundamental life essence, Lin Yuan would have difficulty continuing to drag them down.</p><p></p><p>"But I no longer need such methods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. His breakthrough to the Ultimate was imminent, and if everything went smoothly, he would stand alongside those Twelfth-Stage Ultimates on the riverbank, without needing to hide beneath the river water and ambush.</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the River of Time,</p><p></p><p>the Twelfth-Stage Ultimates stood far away from the river water.</p><p></p><p>"The injuries Tian Yu Chen sustained, I estimate he'll have difficulty fully recovering even by the end of this universe cycle."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the River of Time's water is too devastating to our Twelfth-Stage selves."</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yu Clan has suffered a heavy loss, and it will likely impact them even after the great destruction of the universe."</p><p></p><p>The many Twelfth-Stage Ultimates discussed among themselves. For any Twelfth-Stage life form, the great destruction of the universe was akin to the gates of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the peak of the Boundary-Breaking Realm, they would only have a fifty percent or even smaller chance of surviving.</p><p></p><p>And in Tian Yu Chen's current state, before the great destruction of the universe, not only would his strength not improve, but he would struggle to even recover to his former peak.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, Tian Yu Chen's chances of enduring through the great destruction of the universe are likely only around twenty to thirty percent, or even lower.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Boundary-Breaking Realm cultivator, the higher their probability of weathering the great destruction of the universe, until reaching the peak of the Boundary-Breaking Realm, where they would safely pass through.</p><p></p><p>As for why the Twelfth-Stage Ultimates were unwilling to engage in mutual combat?</p><p></p><p>One reason was that it was difficult for Ultimates to truly decide a victor in their battles, so fighting held little meaning.</p><p></p><p>The other reason was, even if a victor was decided, what then? Killing a thousand enemies while losing eight hundred oneself, if you severely injured the enemy, you would certainly also sustain injuries as the Twelfth-Stage ones fought desperately.</p><p></p><p>This would affect their own condition and combat power when facing the great destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>If they failed to endure the great destruction of the universe, for any Twelfth-Stage Ultimate, it would be complete death and annihilation, with no other possibility.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Paramount was surprised. These kinds of inheritance stars were divided into three types. </p><p></p><p>The 9th tier space inheritance stars, the 10th tier fusion rule inheritance stars, and the 11th tier fusion rule inheritance stars.</p><p></p><p>This black planet belonged to the 10th tier fusion rule inheritance stars, only allowing 10th tier lifeforms to enter. </p><p></p><p>Apart from comprehending the corresponding pillar-level fusion rules, there was also this implicit requirement of the life realm tier. Higher 11th tier lifeforms or lower 9th tier lifeforms did not meet the conditions.</p><p></p><p>Given the 'weight' of a 10th tier fusion rule inheritance star, even an 11th tier paramount would not be able to shake it in the slightest if outside.</p><p></p><p>But if inside? Attacks of the 11th tier realm might have a chance of causing an impact, but this involved a paradox.</p><p></p><p>Which was that the 10th tier fusion rule inheritance star did not allow 11th tier lifeforms to enter.</p><p></p><p>11th tier lifeforms could not enter, while 10th tier lifeforms differed too greatly from 11th tier lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Adding that the inheritance space inside the inheritance star suppressed fluctuations of other rules, only allowing the corresponding fusion rule to operate, external forces, treasures and such means were all useless -</p><p></p><p>Resulting in each inheritance star being extremely stable, not changing due to external forces.</p><p></p><p>So the Summer Qin Paramount was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from the Butterfly Paramount, an avatar descended outside the black planet.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the time within a radius of millions of miles centered on the black planet suddenly began to 'reverse flow'.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the originally 'normally' playing scene suddenly began 'rewinding'.</p><p></p><p>Time regression. Any lifeform that comprehended the time rules could unleash this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>However, even for Lin Yuan, the area he could regress time in at most was just dozens or hundreds of miles. Any more would be too much, yet the Butterfly Paramount's time regression area was directly millions of square miles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was just an insignificant avatar of the Butterfly Paramount. As long as within the domain of human civilization, under the virtual network's shroud, the Butterfly Paramount could have as many such avatars as needed.</p><p></p><p>"There was indeed a slight tremor."</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Paramount nodded slightly. Through time regression, she also discovered the black planet had experienced a slight tremor.</p><p></p><p>"What caused this?"</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Paramount was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Actually, there were only two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One was that the black planet's interior itself had some issue or accident during operation. </p><p></p><p>Two was that inside the black planet's inheritance space, a cultivator unleashed an 11th tier realm attack, exceeding the black planet's interior limit, thus leading to that scene just now.</p><p></p><p>Not discussing the first possibility for now.</p><p></p><p>As for the second possibility? Currently in the black planet's interior inheritance space, there was only Lin Yuan alone.</p><p></p><p>Which was to say, if this was the possibility, then the one who unleashed the 11th tier realm attack was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p></p><p>If the gap between the 8th and 9th tiers was one, then the gap between the 9th and 10th tiers was a hundred, and the gap between the 10th and 11th tiers was ten thousand or a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Crossing realms to fight?</p><p></p><p>At the 3rd, 4th, 5th tiers, perhaps it could be achieved by relying on one's bloodline, constitution, mastered secret techniques and so on.</p><p></p><p>But the higher the realm, the lower the probability of such an occurrence, until it became impossible.</p><p></p><p>The two Paramounts knew when Lin Yuan broke through to the 10th tier, he endured the immense infusion of primal chaos void origins, gaining immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how great the benefits, it could not change the fact that Lin Yuan was a 10th tier lifeform.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps with Lin Yuan's talents and aptitude, plus enduring so much primal chaos void origin infusion, by cultivating to the 10th tier peak, he might be able to raise his attack limit to the 11th tier threshold.  </p><p></p><p>But it had only been so long?</p><p></p><p>For a normal 10th tier newcomer, they still hadn't fully familiarized themselves with their explosively increased power, yet Lin Yuan's attack limit had already reached the 11th tier threshold?</p><p></p><p>"This little guy." The Butterfly Paramount shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Since the two of them began paying attention to Lin Yuan, the frequency they were surprised was almost catching up to the total of the past millions of years.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's star calendar only spanned over two million years, but before that were the long dormant years.</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin and Butterfly Paramounts were born long before even those dormant years.</p><p></p><p>Inside the black planet's vast world,</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man stared blankly at the terrifying scene caused by Lin Yuan's strike.</p><p></p><p>Strands of terrifying aura from the life-and-death cycle force kept diffusing outwards through the hole, even causing space to twist and annihilate under this strand of power.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the life-and-death cycle rules you just comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was silent for a while. "At least comparable to the second or even third level of the life-and-death cycle rules."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's gaze shifted to Lin Yuan who unleashed that strike, replaying many scenes in his mind.</p><p></p><p>As the altar's spirit, he had absolute control over this space. </p><p></p><p>The life-and-death cycle rules Lin Yuan operated were indeed just comprehended, only at the initial first level.</p><p></p><p>Whether ordinary rules fused into new rules, or pillar-level rules fused into new rules, based on the depth of comprehension, they were divided into nine levels from the first to ninth.</p><p></p><p>For a 10th tier cultivator to break through to the 11th tier, the threshold was to at least comprehend a pillar-level fusion rule and cultivate it to the second level.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending rules themselves was extremely difficult, let alone fused rules?</p><p></p><p>If comprehending the universe's original rules, one only needed to quietly sense the rule fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>It was like having the direction ahead, though still difficult but at least the end could be seen.</p><p></p><p>But fused rules? Fused rules were formed by experts based on their comprehensions, fusing different rules' characteristics together.</p><p></p><p>In cultivating fused rules, each level was worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>"Why would a first level life-and-death cycle rule have such great power?" The black-robed man carefully observed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Without borrowing any external forces, nor any fluctuations from treasures or weapons, is it his own strength? His flesh and blood far exceeds a normal 10th tier lifeform."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man vaguely discovered something.</p><p></p><p>This world's trial did not allow using any external forces.</p><p></p><p>But the external forces referred to weapons, treasures, or higher level trump cards and so on.</p><p></p><p>As for one's own strength, like the flesh, soul, mind, will - did those count as external forces?</p><p></p><p>In the black planet's initial rules, those did not count as external forces.</p><p></p><p>The life-and-death cycle rules Lin Yuan operated, though only at the initial first level he just comprehended,</p><p></p><p>His foundation was simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was like the same knife, being swung with a hundred pounds of force,</p><p></p><p>Versus being swung with a hundred tons of force.</p><p></p><p>The explosive power would obviously be different.</p><p></p><p>And here the 'knife' referred to the life-and-death cycle rules.</p><p></p><p>The depth of comprehending the life-and-death cycle rules did indeed affect the power of these fused rules.</p><p></p><p>But it was also related to the strength of the cultivator mastering these rules.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, have I passed the trial?" Lin Yuan unleashed his full power strike, then looked towards the black-robed man not far away and asked.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man told him not to hold back, so Lin Yuan naturally did not hold back at all. That strike was made with his full effort, pouring in the vast power of his inner world, flesh, blood, soul, as well as the third stage 'Profound Yellow Strike' he had cultivated - all infused into it.</p><p></p><p>As for the divine ability 'Strengthen'? Lin Yuan did not activate it, as catalyzing this ability would make it not a full power strike, but a desperate strike.</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules, you naturally pass the trial," the black-robed man said impassively.</p><p></p><p>The trial the black planet originally set was that as long as Lin Yuan had the power of the first level peak life-and-death cycle rules, he could pass.</p><p></p><p>This was basically also the peak a 10th tier lifeform could reach.</p><p></p><p>As for the second level life-and-death cycle rules? Cultivating the pillar-level fusion rules to the second level would swiftly cross into the 11th tier.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's life-and-death cycle rules were only at the initial first level in terms of comprehension, the power had even reached the threshold of the third level.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lin Yuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The trial inside the black planet was not too troublesome, just needing to unleash one strike.</p><p></p><p>"Pass through that door, and that is where the ultimate reward of this path lies," the black-robed man looked at Lin Yuan for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a black door had appeared at some point.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the twelve great doors outside, this black door was only five meters tall, quite small.</p><p></p><p>"But let me remind you."</p><p></p><p>"Any lifeform only has one chance to enter this door. If you come out midway, even if you pass the trial again, you cannot enter."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man reminded.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if there will be any dangers inside the door?" Lin Yuan asked upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Is there any danger?" Lin Yuan probed and asked. </p><p></p><p>"No danger," the man in the black robe shook his head. Although he didn't know what was inside the door, there was indeed no danger.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a need to use strength inside the door?" Lin Yuan continued to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have passed the test, there is no need for further tests," the black-robed man answered.</p><p></p><p>"Can I send in an avatar?" After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>An avatar was different from a clone. An avatar was a vessel formed by condensing a strand of spiritual will with the power of the universe. Its strength would be far lower than the original body's clone.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man reminded him that once he left after entering the door, he would not be able to re-enter. Naturally, Lin Yuan had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"You can," the black-robed man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good." With a subtle mental command from Lin Yuan, an illusory figure materialized in front of him. It exchanged a glance with Lin Yuan, then stepped through the black door.</p><p></p><p>"What is this place?" After a brief darkness, Lin Yuan's avatar felt like a fish breaking through the water's surface, finally arriving at its destination. </p><p></p><p>This was a space spanning several miles in diameter. The left half was filled with vibrations of the rules of life, while the right half was filled with vibrations of the rules of death. The two sets of rules interchanged and fused with each other. </p><p></p><p>The end of life was death, the end of death was life. Life and death cycled endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of rules points the way?" Ripples rose in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The fused rules did not have a general direction like the innate rules of the universe. The comprehension of the fused rules mainly relied on oneself.</p><p></p><p>But nothing was absolute. If a being who had reached the seventh realm of comprehending the fused rules was willing to 'separate' their understanding, they could create a guiding path like this.</p><p></p><p>But the seventh realm of fused rules? Even for the fusion of ordinary rules, the seventh realm was the limit for an eleventh-stage life.</p><p></p><p>If it was the seventh realm of a pillar-level fused rule, that was a domain only the most powerful could enter.</p><p></p><p>The cycle of life and death before him was precisely a pillar-level rule. In other words, the guiding path to the cycle of life and death was derived from a supreme being's comprehension of this fused rule.</p><p></p><p>This separation was permanent. Even for a supreme being, it came at no small cost.</p><p></p><p>"The guiding path to the cycle of life and death rules has reached the fourth realm." After a moment of comprehension, Lin Yuan concluded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A fourth realm guiding path meant that when Lin Yuan studied the cycle of life and death rules, from the first to the fourth realm, he could obtain concrete guidance.</p><p></p><p>And depending on how much of their comprehension a supreme being separated, the resulting guiding path would differ.</p><p></p><p>Just a second realm guiding path would not greatly impact a supreme being, who could re-cultivate and recover in a few thousand years.  </p><p></p><p>A third realm guiding path would have a significant impact, requiring at least tens of thousands of years to re-comprehend and make up for the loss.</p><p></p><p>A fourth realm guiding path was already the limit a supreme being could recover from. If it was a fifth realm guiding path, the separated supreme being would essentially have to abandon that fused rule.</p><p></p><p>"What is the origin of this black planet that made a supreme being pay such a price?" Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>No, not one supreme being. Perhaps twelve supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Because there were twelve black gates on the black planet. </p><p></p><p>Each black gate corresponded to a different pillar-level fused rule, like the fourth realm guiding path to the cycle of life and death that Lin Yuan was currently observing.</p><p></p><p>The final rewards behind the other eleven black gates were likely similar.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"I'll just comprehend it first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and immediately began observing the essence of the intermingling life and death rules.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the fusion of the life and death rules, your understanding of the life and death rules has greatly increased.]</p><p></p><p>Just from a moment of comprehension, Lin Yuan felt the bottleneck that had trapped him before dissolve. The cycle of life and death rules now seemed like an easy mode to him.</p><p></p><p>"At my current comprehension speed, it will take at most fifty years to elevate the cycle of life and death rules to the second realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years? To a tenth-stage evolver, fifty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>For a tenth-stage evolver to cultivate to the peak of the tenth stage and comprehend a pillar-level fused rule, then elevate it to the second realm, who knows how many millions of years that would take. This bottleneck had trapped many peak tenth-stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>The deputy tower master Nalan was stuck here, as were veteran tenth-stage experts like the Black Star Master and the Liuli Star Master.</p><p></p><p>Even with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension, it would probably take him hundreds of years to cultivate the cycle of life and death rules to the second realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, it would only take fifty years?</p><p></p><p>That meant, if Lin Yuan was willing, he could attempt to break through to the eleventh stage in fifty years.</p><p></p><p>"What a great opportunity." Lin Yuan's mind was invigorated.</p><p></p><p>The formation of such a fused rule guiding path involved beings at the supreme level. At least up until now, Lin Yuan had only heard of such things but never seen them before.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization might have similar opportunities, but they would definitely have to queue up.</p><p></p><p>Taking the black planet as an example, only one life could be inside each black gate at a time.</p><p></p><p>For instance, Lin Yuan's avatar was currently comprehending the guiding path to the cycle of life and death rules. Even if other tenth-stage evolvers passed the test of the cycle of life and death gate, they would have to wait until Lin Yuan finished comprehending before they could enter.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy, a smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate I sent in an avatar."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if it was a true spirit clone, it would probably be stuck there for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood. Even with a complete guiding path, it would still take considerable time to elevate the cycle of life and death rules to the fourth realm.</p><p></p><p>If his true spirit had entered that gate, Lin Yuan estimated he would be unable to use that spirit's power for a very long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>After all, once you left during the comprehension of a fused rule guiding path, you could not re-enter. This was a cost Lin Yuan could not accept.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the avatar is comprehending the cycle of life and death rules over there."</p><p></p><p>"My two main spirits can still be used - this is the best outcome."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan took out a mysterious gourd and tilted its mouth down, condensing a drop of purple liquid.</p><p></p><p>Ever since stepping into the tenth stage and receiving a massive infusion of primal chaotic void essence, Lin Yuan's physical body, inner world, and soul had all explosively grown by several levels.</p><p></p><p>This led to his absorption of the purple liquid in the mysterious gourd rapidly increasing as well.</p><p></p><p>He estimated it wouldn't be long before he completely absorbed the purple liquid. At that point, the apparent size of his inner world would reach an unprecedented 2.33 billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Solar Spirit has already arrived under that permanent spatial rift?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was absorbing the purple liquid, a thought suddenly crossed his mind and his gaze turned towards that large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield #A098.</p><p></p><p>Near the central northern region, a permanent spatial rift over a thousand miles wide spanned across.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared there soundlessly.</p><p></p><p>"A permanent spatial rift?" Lin Yuan looked up at the thousand-mile wide crack in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Grayish mists occasionally drifted in, emanating fluctuations that made Lin Yuan's mind shudder.</p><p></p><p>The key difference between the permanent spatial rifts on the large alien battlefields versus the small and medium ones was that due to the massive tear, things from outside the universe could now squeeze through.</p><p></p><p>For example, over a hundred years ago, that supreme being's body had drifted in through such a rift.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, many 'things' had floated in through the permanent spatial rifts on the large battlefields. But the vast majority were extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>As recorded in human civilization's history, during the Dormant Era when the Insect Race and Feather Race opened up a large battlefield, a strange life form squeezed through a permanent spatial rift there, nearly bringing an irreversible disaster to the universe's starry skies. In the end, over ten supreme beings had to join forces to barely banish that strange life form back outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>There were many such examples. Basically, out of every ten 'things' that drifted in from the permanent spatial rifts, nine would cause disasters of varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>"On this large alien battlefield, I need to be extra cautious."</p><p></p><p>"Besides facing those alien experts, I also need to constantly be on guard for changes in the permanent spatial rifts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression grew solemn. Then a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Because after arriving at this thousand-mile wide permanent spatial rift, Lin Yuan could feel his speed of accumulating disruptive origin power increase to an almost exaggerated degree.</p>

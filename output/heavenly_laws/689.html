        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This technique originates from the eternal sect at the center of the heavens and earth, a special application of the Talisman Way. Even a being as powerful as a Source Demon would be unable to detect it.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect was able to withstand wave after wave of demonic attacks was partly due to this talisman projection technique, which allowed them to predict the trajectory of the 'Demons' in advance and make corresponding countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, more and more elders of the Sacred Sect discovered something abnormal, their gazes fixed intently on the image formed by the interweaving talismans.</p><p></p><p>The main subject in the image was still that terrifying giant Demon, its body size exceeding countless billions of miles, with a pair of black wings and countless gaping maws covering its body, constantly devouring massive amounts of demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Although the giant Demon was horrifying, what left the elders and the Sect Master even more astonished was that a tiny figure had somehow appeared in the space above the Demon's path.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the towering giant Demon, this figure was almost negligible, less than a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>If the giant Demon had not suddenly stopped in its tracks, the elders of the Sacred Sect might not have even noticed that tiny figure.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's mind stirred, and the talisman-woven image rapidly expanded, making the tiny figure more visible in comparison to the giant Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Tong?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master was somewhat bewildered. After the image was enlarged, the tiny figure became clearly visible - a young man with his hands clasped behind his back, wearing the 'unified' robe of the Sacred Sect's steward, which the Sect Master recognized.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master had a deep impression of Chen Tong. Centuries ago, it was because of Chen Tong that he had exposed the Sect's former senior disciple who had fallen to the Demons.</p><p></p><p>Later, when Chen Tong wanted to join the Azure Cloud Academy as a steward, the Sect Master had agreed. After that, he had not heard any special news about this disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master had not paid much attention to this disciple since then, as the incident of the Sect's senior disciple falling to the Demons had been a blow to him, and the Sect's situation required stabilization.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sect Master never imagined that he would see this disciple again in such a situation.</p><p></p><p>"It's Chen Tong, the steward of the Azure Cloud Academy."</p><p></p><p>Upon the enlargement of the talisman image, the many elders also immediately recognized Chen Tong.</p><p></p><p>Over the past millennium, although Chen Tong had never displayed any remarkable power, he had expressed many insights regarding the 'Demons', which the elders had repeatedly verified and found to be accurate.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, many elders had come to know the steward of the Azure Cloud Academy, Chen Tong, and would occasionally visit him to inquire about questions related to the 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Tong?"</p><p>"Why is Chen Tong there?"</p><p>"What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Sacred Sect elders were filled with bewilderment, they were also clear that Chen Tong's sudden appearance before that giant Demon was truly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>First, how did Chen Tong leave the Sacred Sect? The giant Demon was an unimaginably vast distance from the Sacred Sect, and for any disciple to cross such a distance without prior approval was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, with the terrifying power of that giant Demon, approaching the level of a Source Demon, its mere aura alone would be enough to suffocate even the Sect Master, yet Chen Tong stood there calmly observing it from above.</p><p></p><p>The elders themselves would likely be gravely injured or even die if they tried to approach that Demon.</p><p></p><p>All the elders stared intently at the talisman-woven image, holding their breath.</p><p></p><p>Under their watchful gaze, the terrifying giant Demon seemed to grow impatient, and the boundless demonic energy around it began to seethe, surging towards the tiny figure above.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's heart sank. With the Demon's power, even he would be severely injured, let alone Chen Tong.</p><p></p><p>The other elders trembled inwardly, instinctively putting themselves in the Azure Cloud Academy steward's position.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, they witnessed a sight they would never forget.</p><p></p><p>The tiny figure above raised its right leg and gently stepped down on the towering, terrifying giant Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Demon, whose aura had been horrifying beyond measure, suddenly stumbled, retreating several steps, and the surging demonic energy around it abruptly ceased.</p><p></p><p>Another step.</p><p></p><p>The massive, towering Demon was directly stomped into the ground, its upper body buried in the earth.</p><p></p><p>Yet another step.</p><p></p><p>The Demon, trying to struggle to its feet, was stomped back down into the deep pit.</p><p></p><p>One final step.</p><p></p><p>The colossal Demon, thousands of miles in height, collapsed limply into the crater, its demonic body weakened and barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>The tiny figure then retracted its right leg.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the terrifying giant Demon, this diminutive figure was now the true titan, with the fearsome Demon reduced to a mere insect beneath its feet.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The highest hall of the Azure Cloud Sacred Mountain fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>All the elders, including the Sect Master, were left with their minds completely blank.</p><p></p><p>Many elders had sensed that the Azure Cloud Academy steward, Chen Tong, was no ordinary person, but they never imagined it would be to this unbelievable extent.</p><p></p><p>That Demon, approaching the power of a Source Demon, had only lasted four steps against him. It was clear that Chen Tong had not even used his full strength, merely stepping on the Demon four times to leave it gravely injured and on the verge of death. What kind of power was this?</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master trembled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying giant Demon, with power rivaling the Transcendent Third Realm experts, had been defeated so easily. Just how strong was Chen Tong? Was he in the Transcendent Second Realm? Or even the Transcendent Third Realm? Even in the prosperous era before the great changes in the heavens and earth, Transcendent Third Realm experts were extremely rare, essentially the pinnacle beneath the Eternal Sects.</p><p></p><p>The founding patriarch of the Azure Cloud Sacred Sect had only barely reached the Transcendent First Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master took a deep breath, about to speak, when he suddenly noticed that the talisman-woven image showed Chen Tong seeming to sense something and turning his gaze towards them.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's scalp tingled, and he unhesitatingly interrupted the talisman activation, causing the image to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The many elders present felt a sense of relief, as if being under Chen Tong's gaze would impose an immense burden on them.</p><p></p><p>Demonic energy permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tong looked down at the dying giant Demon below.</p><p></p><p>His gaze briefly swept towards the direction of the Azure Cloud Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling of being observed, it's a secret divination technique based on the Talisman Way?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tong pondered. The sensation was extremely faint, so subtle that even a Source Demon would be unable to detect it, but Chen Tong was not a Source Demon - he was an existence even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"A highly skilled application of talismans."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tong evaluated inwardly. Even he had not mastered such a technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He immediately sensed that he was being watched.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate he has already seen me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was calm. The sense of being watched came from the Holy Cloud Sacred Mountain, and he had not concealed his attack on this terrifying giant demon at all. At this moment, the Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect must have already known about him.</p><p></p><p>Although his identity was exposed, Lin Yuan did not really care. His strength had already fully recovered, and with the opening of the hundred-million-particle world, in terms of combat power, this physical body was the strongest among the three true bodies.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, even before the great changes in heaven and earth, he could act recklessly, let alone now. "This demon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the collapsed giant demon again.</p><p></p><p>The giant demon's strength was very powerful. In the chaotic void, it was at the Great Saint level, and even more troublesome than the Great Saints due to its demonic qi, with endless demonic qi supporting it, almost immortal. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Each of the four steps Lin Yuan took could have crushed a Great Saint, but it took four steps to completely deprive this giant demon of the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also because Lin Yuan did not go all out. He hunted the giant demon not to kill it, but to refine its demonic body and extract its essential power to support the opening of a large number of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan was very careful in his actions, afraid that if he was not careful, he would crush this giant demon to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan immediately moved this giant demon to a certain particle world of his own.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Great Millstone formed by the chaotic Taiji power inside began to grind, constantly crushing the demonic body of the giant demon.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>At the highest hall of the Holy Cloud Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Many elders were silent, looking at the Sect Master standing above.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, that senior?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the elders gathered the courage to ask, addressing Lin Yuan as "senior" instinctively.</p><p></p><p>As an inheritance from the top forces before the great changes in heaven and earth, the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect must have a certain foundation, such as Guardians or the like.</p><p></p><p>But even the most imaginative elders did not dare to associate Chen Tong with the Guardians of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect.</p><p></p><p>What a joke? If the Guardians of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect had such strength, how could the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect be so hard-pressed by those demons? A random giant demon attacking the mountain would make the entire sect tremble in fear?</p><p></p><p>The Guardians certainly could not act rashly, but if they really had such strength, how could the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect be so cautious?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He knew very little about Lin Yuan. Now, seeing his strength, he found that he had almost no understanding of this disciple who had been quietly staying in the Holy Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"But no matter what, the senior must not have any ill intentions towards our sect."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect thought for a moment and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The many elders nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>That's right, with Lin Yuan's strength, if he really had some kind of evil intention, the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect would have been gone long ago.</p><p></p><p>"So what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Another elder asked.</p><p></p><p>The other elders looked at the Sect Master upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect let out a long sigh, his expression solemn: "Since our sect has such a senior guarding it, we should naturally go and pay our respects immediately."</p><p></p><p>If they didn't know, it was fine. But now that they knew, if they didn't go to pay their respects, the Sect Master, no matter how bold he was, wouldn't dare to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's go pay our respects immediately."</p><p></p><p>The many elders nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Holy Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had just returned and had already completely refined that terrifying giant demon.</p><p></p><p>The endless demonic qi had been crushed and returned to its source, forming an extremely pure energy.</p><p></p><p>"Enough to support the opening of six million particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>A demonic spirit could provide Lin Yuan with the resources to open hundreds or thousands of particle worlds.</p><p>A great demon could provide the resources for Lin Yuan to open tens of thousands or millions of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>And this terrifying giant demon, although still belonging to the great demon realm, was very close to the source demon, and the help it brought to Lin Yuan was unprecedented, equivalent to the harvest of slaying dozens of great demons.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the pure energy, faintly sensing an extremely primal aura from it.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the source demon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. He had not hunted a source demon before, but this giant demon was just a step away from becoming a source demon, and some parts of its own had already started to evolve towards the source demon.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I don't have the time to wait for it to become a source demon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Although the giant demon was just a step away from becoming a source demon, he didn't know how long it would take to cross that step - thousands of years? Tens of thousands of years? Hundreds of thousands of years? Or even millions of years?</p><p></p><p>The growth of demons was certainly much faster than the cultivation of cultivators, but it still required time, especially for the critical transition from great demon to source demon, which could take hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had this time long ago, and he could have hunted a true source demon.</p><p></p><p>"This primal aura has traces of the Thirteenth-Tier power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it and came to the conclusion that the Thirteenth-Tier power was easy to recognize, towering above everything else.</p><p></p><p>At every moment, there were a large number of disciples of the Holy Cloud Sect passing through the Holy Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>However, on this particular day, a large number of Holy Cloud Sect disciples were all asked to leave the Holy Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Why do they want us to leave?"</p><p>"I just exchanged a secret technique and haven't finished copying it yet."</p><p></p><p>Many Holy Cloud Sect disciples naturally had objections, but when they saw the Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sect himself appear outside the courtyard, followed by many high-ranking elders, they immediately realized that a major event must have occurred.</p><p></p><p>They quickly moved away.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p>"Why is the Sect Master here too?"</p><p>"And many elders, no, it seems all the elders are here."</p><p>"The Sect Master and all the elders? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Many disciples had solemn expressions. The Sect Master and all the elders would only gather when deciding on the truly important matters of the sect, but now? </p><p></p><p>Gathered outside the Holy Cloud Courtyard?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Holy Cloud Courtyard is related to the future survival of the sect?</p><p></p><p>Although the Holy Cloud Sect disciples could not understand, they did not dare to disobey the orders of the Sect Master and the many elders.</p><p></p><p>All the disciples withdrew from the Holy Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sect calmed himself and swept his gaze over the many elders behind him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the elders were in a respectful posture, for they knew from the interwoven symbols the true identity of the being they were about to pay respects to, and naturally did not dare to show any disrespect.</p><p></p><p>"The 2,638th generation Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect, accompanied by 456 elders, pays respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Cloud Sacred Sect bowed deeply towards the depths of the Holy Cloud Courtyard, his tone respectful.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

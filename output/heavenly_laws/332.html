            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 332 - The Value of the Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Essence Gold." Lin Yuan carefully observed. </p><p></p><p>After absorbing the true body and two major nascent souls in the world of gods, this secret treasure had already undergone several transformations.</p><p></p><p>The aura it exuded now was not much different from a tenth stage secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Activating the Primordial Bell, plus the two protective divine abilities 'Elemental Body' and 'Rebirth from a Drop of Blood', my defensive power should be comparable to the tenth stage now, right?" </p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The over two billion layers of space allowed Lin Yuan's all-out erupting power to surpass ordinary tenth stage, </p><p></p><p>and even exceed most tenth stage in comprehending the essence of space.</p><p></p><p>As for defense, with the help of the Primordial Bell and the two divine abilities, Lin Yuan was not inferior to any tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>This defense was direct defense.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan occupying over two billion spatial layers, even powerful tenth stage experts would find it very difficult to lock onto the location of his true body.</p><p></p><p>Let alone being able to attack it.</p><p></p><p>"After finishing this trip to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, I will start preparing to break through to the tenth stage," Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He believed he had already done his utmost at the ninth stage. As for continuing to open up spatial layers? There was absolutely no need for that.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan spent a lot of time opening up tens of thousands more spatial layers on top of the over two billion layers, compared to this scale of over two billion, it would have almost no impact.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after the spatial layers reached over two billion, the difficulty of opening up each additional layer was incomparably higher than before.</p><p></p><p>"That Hun Yi did have quite a few good things." Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly. After killing Hun Yi in the Xuanhuang World, he took the other party's spatial bracelet and also swept a glance at the treasures inside.</p><p></p><p>There were secret treasures, some 'Xuanhuang Crystals', and also some opportunities obtained from the secret realm itself.</p><p></p><p>Added together, they were worth about two million Fang Universe Crystals.</p><p></p><p>Although this was incomparable to the value of a normal special ninth stage expert, considering that it was Hun Yi's avatar that entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it was quite normal that he wouldn't bring overly precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even though experts who opened up millions of spatial layers basically had no opponents in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it didn't mean they wouldn't die.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm itself still had many dangers, especially the core area, which did not lack perilous lands that could severely injure special ninth stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his thoughts, Lin Yuan brought Xilan to the depths of the myriad spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, I'm afraid I can't hold on anymore." Xilan's aura was exhausted beyond control, having continuously burned his physical body, soul, mind and will for two and a half years.</p><p></p><p>Xilan's life signs had already fallen to the bottom at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I will help bring your treasures back for you." Lin Yuan was also clear about Xilan's condition. If they were in the outside world, there would be a possibility to save him using various cosmic rarities.</p><p></p><p>But inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, there was no such condition.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if there was, Xilan would not use them. After all, it was just an avatar. Even if it perished, he could still condense a new one.</p><p></p><p>Wasting many life-saving cosmic rarities for this was completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he could still persist for a few more months, but there was no need. In the end, he would still dissipate. Dissipating earlier meant he could condense a new avatar earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xilan."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the spatial bracelet left by Xilan and decided to allocate a small portion of the gains he would obtain on the way to the core area to the other party.</p><p></p><p>Without Xilan, it would have been difficult for Lin Yuan to persist until now. This favor had to be acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"A summoning sensation?" Lin Yuan raised his head and looked towards the core area of the secret realm. Along with the soaring number of opened spatial layers, he gained a deeper understanding of that summoning sensation.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's feeling was not wrong, that summoning sensation was located in a certain spatial layer in the core area.</p><p></p><p>"I'll know when I go take a look."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan quickly headed towards the core area.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan did not conceal any of his aura, but intentionally revealed it to attract the attention of the secret realm's native lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Under that summoning sensation, Lin Yuan did not have time to specifically seek out and kill the native lifeforms, but it did not affect him luring the native lifeforms over to be killed.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, he could basically sweep through the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. No matter how many native lifeforms came, they would die, simply delivering Universe Crystals to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The myriad spatial layers trembled, even alerting the nearby ninth stage alien races.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, that's the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly get far away. Even Hun Yi died at the hands of the Galaxy Star Lord, directly forced to self-detonate."</p><p></p><p>"Go, go, go. Absolutely don't let the Galaxy Star Lord discover us."</p><p></p><p>"The direction the Galaxy Star Lord is heading is the core area?"</p><p></p><p>"In this secret realm exploration, try to stay as far away from the core area as possible."</p><p></p><p>Countless ninth stage alien races were frightened out of their wits, deeply afraid of being discovered by the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Especially those alien race experts who had poor relations with human civilization were even more terrified and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Even the few special ninth stage experts, the instant they sensed the Galaxy Star Lord's aura, also quickly fled far away, not daring to linger at all.</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>Even Hun Yi died at the hands of the Galaxy Star Lord, let alone them?</p><p></p><p>Although a few special ninth stage experts might be slightly stronger than Hun Yi, the Galaxy Star Lord killed Hun Yi without much effort.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, those special ninth stage experts naturally fled as far away as possible. Even the few special ninth stage experts who did not have much enmity with human civilization were unwilling to get too close to the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>No one was willing to stay together with an existence that could kill them at any time. That was too risky.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the special ninth stage experts who could survive until now had all gained a lot. In the eyes of the Galaxy Star Lord, they were no different from moving opportunity lands.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan satisfiedly stored the Primordial Bell inside his body and continued to nourish it with the power of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter." Lin Yuan's smile faded as he planned to upload the Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter first.</p><p></p><p>This was also something that needed to be done after each crossing - constantly updating the martial dao evolution path to attract more evolvers to cultivate it, providing assistance for the ultimate leap in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, receiving a huge amount of merit points and wealth from this could also be considered an additional gain.</p><p></p><p>Uploading the martial dao evolution path to the Goddess of Wisdom did not mean selling the ownership of this evolution path. Lin Yuan was still the founder of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Every time a copy of the martial dao evolution path was sold, Lin Yuan could receive 30% of the revenue.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly connected to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected ninth stage evolver Galaxy Star Lord Lin Yuan, Great Scholar, the Goddess of Wisdom is pleased to serve you."</p><p></p><p>A solemn and cold voice sounded by Lin Yuan's ear almost without any pause.</p><p></p><p>"I want to upload the Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He then uploaded all the contents of the Ninth Stage Chapter that he had already organized.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan also uploaded the bloodline cultivation path he had summarized as a branch of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"Respected..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Respected 9th-level evolution Galaxy Star Master Lin Yuan, the Great Scholar, please wait a moment. The 9th-level chapter and the Bloodline Cultivation Path you uploaded are undergoing evaluation."</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar → 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>After the Goddess of Wisdom finished speaking, she fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had anticipated this and sat there patiently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>Nine grand and magnificent thrones.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the ultimate powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Yu Die, the ultimate powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Gu Li, the ultimate powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Xu Shen, the ultimate powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>A total of four Evolution Tower Masters' consciousnesses descended.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom, what's the matter that you notified us to come over?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Shen, the ultimate powerhouse, slightly frowned. As the ultimate existence of the void evolution path, he spent most of his time integrating into the vast and endless spatial origin.</p><p></p><p>This time, he finally came out for a trip, only to be summoned by the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shen, don't be so irritable. The Goddesses are also doing this for the sake of human civilization." Gu Li, the ultimate powerhouse, spoke.</p><p></p><p>The nine ultimate powerhouses of human civilization had different personalities. Gu Li was decisive in killing foreign races, preferring to kill by mistake rather than let them go, but he was quite gentle towards his own race.</p><p></p><p>"Four ultimate powerhouses, the 9th-level chapter of the martial arts evolution path requires your appraisal." At this moment, the Goddess of Wisdom's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The 9th-level chapter of martial arts? Is it the evolution path established by that most talented genius in the history of our human civilization?" Xu Shen's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow is growing too fast. Just now, he killed Hun Yi of the Tianyu race in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and created at least 100 million layers of space."</p><p></p><p>Yu Die spoke with a slightly amazed tone.</p><p></p><p>As ultimate powerhouses, they could go against the flow, witness the past of the universe and stars, and observe all kinds of unimaginable geniuses, but even so, they were still surprised by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>100 million layers of space? Even with the help of time treasures, it would be extremely difficult to create so many layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The nine ultimate powerhouses of human civilization had also cultivated many descendants, pouring in various resources, but none of them could create more than 100 million layers of space at the 9th level.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I've never seen or even heard of such a genius." Gu Li was also a little surprised. After confirming that Lin Yuan belonged to the human race, he actually felt a bit relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully, this little fellow can make it to the end." Xia Qin sighed.</p><p></p><p>The so-called making it to the end meant stepping into the 12th level, becoming the ultimate existence of a certain evolution path, and ranking as the tenth ultimate powerhouse of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom, quickly show us the 9th-level chapter of martial arts." Xu Shen also became interested.</p><p></p><p>Especially after seeing the evaluation of Lin Yuan by Yu Die and the other two ultimate powerhouses, he became even more curious.</p><p></p><p>That had basically nothing to do with talent. How many of those who could step into the peak of the 11th level had poor talent and aptitude?</p><p></p><p>The main thing was the accumulation in all aspects. And that bit of luck.</p><p></p><p>No one at the peak of the 11th level could be certain that they would succeed before challenging to become an ultimate powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Four ultimate powerhouses, please take a look." The Goddess of Wisdom sent the 9th-level chapter of martial arts and the Bloodline Cultivation Path to the four ultimate powerhouses respectively.</p><p></p><p>With the computing power of the three Goddesses, even a 9th-level evolution path could be independently evaluated without the need to notify the ultimate powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial arts evolution path had too much potential. Relying solely on computing power might lead to oversights, so it still required the ultimate powerhouses to keep an eye on it.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could the potential of the 9th-level chapter of martial arts be more accurately evaluated.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>The several ultimate powerhouses had roughly finished reading.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting. This 9th-level chapter actually involves the transformation of the inner world? I can deduce that the transformed inner world will indeed be much more stable."</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful. Such a transformation direction has never appeared in the universe before. How did this little fellow come up with it?"</p><p></p><p>"Rare. The 9th-level chapter of martial arts... The martial arts 9th-level evolvers of later generations will actually be much stronger than other powerhouses of the same level."</p><p></p><p>The four ultimate powerhouses discussed in low voices. They could naturally see through the ingenuity of the 9th-level chapter of martial arts, possessing a stable and perfect method for world transformation.</p><p></p><p>World transformation? Is it that easy to transform? A stable world, with every part forming a perfect balance, would likely collapse if changed even slightly.</p><p></p><p>"And this Bloodline Cultivation Path is several grades more mature than the current bloodline cultivation methods of those bloodline evolution families in our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Xu Shen gave his evaluation after reading the Bloodline Cultivation Path.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts evolution path, even if it can't transform into an ultimate evolution path in the future, will definitely be a foundational-level evolution path of our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Our human civilization has really picked up a treasure this time."</p><p></p><p>The four ultimate powerhouses looked at each other, smiles appearing on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Four ultimate powerhouses, regarding the final evaluation of the 9th-level chapter of martial arts, it's worth 80 million merit points. The final evaluation of the Bloodline Cultivation Path is worth 50 million merit points. Are there any objections?"</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom spoke.</p><p></p><p>"80 million merit points is a bit too little. Let's make it a whole number, count it as 100 million."</p><p></p><p>"As for that Bloodline Cultivation Path, although it's most compatible with the martial arts evolution path, other evolvers can also learn from it. Let's also count it as 100 million."</p><p></p><p>"We share the same opinion." Gu Li and the other two ultimate powerhouses nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the three Goddesses had many bases for the final evaluation, neither too much nor too little.</p><p></p><p>But the four ultimate powerhouses felt that when facing such an unparalleled genius like Lin Yuan, what was wrong with giving a few more merit points? Anyway, human civilization had a vast foundation. If Lin Yuan benefited, it was equivalent to human civilization benefiting.</p><p></p><p>"Evaluation passed."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom replied.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was resting with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>"Respected 9th-level evolution Galaxy Star Master Lin Yuan, the Great Scholar, the martial arts 9th-level chapter and Bloodline Cultivation Path you uploaded have completed evaluation."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom's solemn and cold voice came.</p><p></p><p>"The evaluation is done?" Lin Yuan opened his eyes and continued listening.</p><p></p><p>"After evaluation, the 9th-level chapter of martial arts is worth 100 million merit points, and the Bloodline Cultivation Path is worth 100 million merit points, for a total of 200 million merit points. Do you want to receive them now?"</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom spoke quickly.</p><p></p><p>"200 million merit points?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>What is the most precious thing in the Human Civilization Alliance? Civilization currency? Cosmic currency? Cosmic crystals? Numerous secret treasures?</p><p></p><p>None of them.</p><p></p><p>The most precious thing in human civilization is merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't understand this before, but after soaking in the Eternal Spring once, he understood the value of merit points.</p><p></p><p>To put it this way, human civilization has many strategic-level treasures that are not open to the public at all. Even if those foreign races paid a huge price, they couldn't obtain them.</p><p></p><p>But as long as you are human and your authority meets the requirements, you can achieve it through merit points.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, merit points can do anything, which is not an empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Even if you pay enough merit points, even ultimate powerhouses can do things for you.</p>

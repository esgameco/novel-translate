            <p>Chapter 236: Choosing a Star Domain (End of Volume, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to reality. Scenes of his interactions with the Supreme Being Xia Qin kept flashing through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Beings are too terrifying," Lin Yuan marveled in his heart. Just based on the virtual world's conscious avatar, Xia Qin was able to see the traces of time passing in his mind and will?</p><p></p><p>"But the Gate of Myriad Realms..." Lin Yuan was quite certain that the Supreme Being Xia Qin had not noticed the Gate of Myriad Realms at all.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only experienced seven crossings, Lin Yuan was truly clear about how much value the Gate of Myriad Realms held for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If human civilization could master the Gate of Myriad Realms, there would be no need to continue waging wars with the surrounding peak races.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Human Civilization Alliance keep launching wars? </p><p></p><p>For resources.</p><p></p><p>It was all for resources.</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, resources were limited.</p><p></p><p>If human civilization wanted to keep developing, it could only continuously plunder resources.</p><p></p><p>And this inevitably led to conflicts with other peak races, triggering wars.</p><p></p><p>But with the Gate of Myriad Realms, human civilization could completely invade other dimensional planes and obtain vast resources.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very clear about this point, but he absolutely could not actively reveal the existence of the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>The human heart was unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute benefits, no one could guarantee what they might do.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the future, when Lin Yuan became a Supreme Being, or surpassed the Supreme Beings, he would use the Gate of Myriad Realms to open up passages to other dimensional worlds, allowing human civilization's evolved beings to expand their territory.</p><p></p><p>As for now, Lin Yuan absolutely could not reveal the existence of the Gate of Myriad Realms to anyone.</p><p></p><p>This was Lin Yuan's biggest trump card.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Peak Masters of the Chiyu Lineage stepping into the Eighth Stage was a major event that shook the Chiyu Star Domain and the Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Great Peak Master had also stepped into the Eighth Stage not long before. In a short period of time, the Chiyu Lineage gained two Eighth Stage experts, so it was no exaggeration to say their foundation had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Chiyu Lineage decided to hold a grand ceremony to celebrate the birth of the two Eighth Stage experts.</p><p></p><p>The ceremony was held in the virtual world. The Annan Star Alliance and dozens of surrounding star alliances, as well as any somewhat renowned forces or independent evolved beings, all rushed over. It was much grander than the ceremony held when Lin Yuan stepped into the Sixth Stage.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu Lineage gaining another Peak Master was a big deal for the Chiyu Star Domain, but outside the Chiyu Star Domain, it wasn't as significant. </p><p></p><p>However, the birth of Eighth Stage evolved beings, especially one under a hundred years old like Lin Yuan, signified Lin Yuan's terrifying future potential to any force.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't come to congratulate him now, they might not have the chance to do so in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Hongfeng Star Lord? And the Wanyang Star Lord? Even the Jinlong Star Lord is here?"</p><p></p><p>"With this scale, it's comparable to a Star Alliance level ceremony..."</p><p></p><p>The guests whispered among themselves. In their respective star domains, they were all big shots presiding over their territories. But here, they were just ordinary.</p><p></p><p>At the Thirteenth Peak Master's ceremony, only Eighth Stage Star Lords could make people take a second glance. As for Seventh Stage and Sixth Stage evolved beings, there were too many of them to count.</p><p></p><p>"That should be the Thirteenth Peak Master. So young."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed. Who knows how he cultivated to reach the Eighth Stage at such a young age."</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Lin Yuan was the focus of countless guests. As for the Great Peak Master, although his advancement to the Eighth Stage was dazzling, he paled in comparison to the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat at a table with his parents and family. The surrounding tables were all for the Star Lords.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many big shots..." Lin Yizuo looked around in amazement. Fortunately, they were in the virtual world where the auras of high-level evolved beings were restrained. If this was reality, a low-level evolved being like her might tremble in fear just from a glance.</p><p></p><p>This was the oppression from the essence of life.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyuan, you..." Father Lin Shoucheng sighed. His son was truly outstanding. Originally, he thought Lin Yuan becoming the Thirteenth Peak Master of the Chiyu Lineage was already an ancestral grave-shaking result.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan had stepped into the Eighth Stage, and under a hundred years old at that.</p><p></p><p>During this period, countless massive forces from other star domains had contacted him, either actively or passively.</p><p></p><p>Their goal was to curry favor with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyuan, I heard Eighth Stage evolved beings all need to be stationed at the border star domains. Isn't it very dangerous there?" Mother Lu Qiong asked in a low voice, her tone revealing concern.</p><p></p><p>"It is somewhat dangerous, but I can handle it," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The one stationed at the border star domain was Lin Yuan's true body, while his Yin and Yang Spirits were in the alien battlefield and the Chiyu main star respectively.</p><p></p><p>They were quite safe.</p><p></p><p>For other evolved beings' cloning techniques, the clones could only be revived if the true body still existed.</p><p></p><p>If the true body perished, all the clones would perish together.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's Martial Dao Primordial Spirits were not clones in the strict sense.</p><p></p><p>Even if the true body perished, the Yin and Yang Spirits could use the Taiji Creation technique to recreate a physical body.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with the physical body divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", Lin Yuan didn't need to go through such trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, come over for a moment." Just then, the voice of the Chiyu Star Lord sounded by Lin Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be away for a bit." Lin Yuan stood up and gestured to his parents.</p><p></p><p>"These few are all my good friends who wanted to meet you." The Chiyu Star Lord was chatting and laughing with a few other Star Lords.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan approach, he immediately introduced them.</p><p></p><p>"So this is your little disciple."</p><p></p><p>"His talent is indeed terrifying. An Eighth Stage under a hundred years old. Old Chiyu, your luck is too good!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Lords spoke one after another.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan stepped into the Sixth Stage under a hundred years old, most of these Star Lords had praised the Chiyu Star Lord's excellent methods in guiding disciples.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Lin Yuan stepping into the Eighth Stage under a hundred years old, the tone of all the Star Lords changed. They felt the Chiyu Star Lord was just lucky.</p><p></p><p>Several Star Lords' eyes turned red when they saw Lin Yuan, feeling that if they had taken in such a disciple, they would have done no worse than the Chiyu Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>In fact, that was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu Star Lord knew his own affairs well.</p><p></p><p>His guidance to Lin Yuan was pitifully little.</p><p></p><p>Apart from material resource support, the Chiyu Star Lord had instructed Lin Yuan less than five times.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, what's wrong? Luck is also a kind of strength. Not convinced? Go find a disciple like this yourself."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu Star Lord was in a good mood. Not only did he not refute them, he took pride in it.</p><p></p><p>The ceremony lasted for several days.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly began cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind raced as a flood of insights surged in his mind. He comprehended the gains from that torso fragment, all of which were now transformed into his foundation, pushing him to continuously open up the Eighth Stage chapters of his Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Rule fusion must have a pillar rule. I will fuse the Yin-Yang Rules with the Spatial Rule..."</p><p></p><p>The foundation of Lin Yuan's cultivated Martial Dao was the Yin-Yang and Taiji.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at the Eighth Stage, the rule fusion...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Closing up, naturally the Yin and Yang went to merge with the rules of space.</p><p></p><p>This was the path of martial arts evolution, set since the second and third stage chapters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, other martial arts evolutionaries did not have to do this. They could follow their own paths and not be limited to Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>Finishing the day's cultivation, Lin Yuan began to take stock of the congratulatory gifts given to him by other evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>Since the Chihu lineage held a celebration, participating evolutionaries would more or less express themselves.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the 13th Peak Master with unlimited potential at the 8th stage, if you don't invest at some point, will you wait until the 13th Peak Master is invincible at the 8th stage and 9th stage before investing?</p><p></p><p>At that time, it would depend on whether they accept it or not.</p><p></p><p>Although investing now is just icing on the cake, it's still better than not investing.</p><p></p><p>"All the congratulatory gifts add up to about 150,000 cubic universe crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood. This was much more than the congratulatory gifts he received when he was promoted to a level 7 citizen before.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was promoted to a level 7 citizen, he hid his true identity, and many evolutionaries were unwilling to invest too much.</p><p></p><p>But now, being promoted to an 8th stage evolutionary under a hundred years old, which evolutionary dares to underestimate this gimmick?</p><p></p><p>"My current universe crystals, plus the income from several martial arts evolution paths, are close to 200,000 cubic."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Universe crystals were the common currency of the myriad races in the universe. They not only had monetary value, but also practical value.</p><p></p><p>200,000 cubic universe crystals exceeded the amount ordinary peak 8th stage evolutionaries had.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most 8th stage evolutionaries' wealth was concentrated in weapons and treasures. As for the amount of universe crystals, it was not the main part.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up, gazing outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the hall and saw a thin man standing there.</p><p></p><p>"You are?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at this thin man, slightly startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This man's appearance was extremely similar to the Nalan Vice Tower Master who, not long ago, destroyed a light-year area at the edge of the Dark Abyss secret realm with a snap of his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan determined through the video that the other party was at least a 9th stage evolutionary, and most likely even stronger.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dark Abyss clan also had five or six 9th stage powerhouses stationed, but in front of the Nalan Vice Tower Master, these five or six 9th stage powerhouses didn't even dare to leave the secret realm, watching helplessly as the Nalan Vice Tower Master shattered a large area at the edge of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the Bug Race powerhouses came to support that the Nalan Vice Tower Master withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"This is what the Tower Master asked me to give you."</p><p></p><p>The Nalan Vice Tower Master smiled slightly and handed a metal box to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan solemnly took the metal box.</p><p></p><p>"The Tower Master values you very much. I haven't seen the Tower Master treat a junior like this in a long time." The Nalan Vice Tower Master smiled slightly, and his figure directly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Nalan Vice Tower Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned. The Nalan Vice Tower Master should be the vice tower master of the evolution tower where the Xia Qin Supreme was stationed.</p><p></p><p>"The evolution tower where the Xia Qin Supreme is stationed is who knows how many tens of thousands of light-years away from the Chihu Star Domain. Even with continuous wormhole travel, it would take hundreds or thousands of years to get there. The Nalan Vice Tower Master arrived in just half a month."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a little shocked.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that after comprehending the complete spatial rule model, one will master the means of large-scale teleportation. In one teleportation, hundreds or thousands of light-years are just a step away. But that's an ability that only 9th stage evolutionaries can grasp."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of human civilization's territory, several huge wills penetrated through.</p><p></p><p>"Who on earth was it that initially noticed the Chihu lineage's 13th Peak Master's talent and didn't report it to the Bug Race Alliance at the first opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>The strongest will suppressed his anger.</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier that the 13th Peak Master could cross into the 8th stage under a hundred years old, they would have paid any price to strangle him before he crossed into the 6th stage.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was killed before the 6th stage, even a Supreme could not resurrect him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either. The one in charge of the Chihu Star Domain at that time was Pan Yong, but he disappeared some time ago, and we can't find him no matter how we look."</p><p></p><p>One of the wills immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we too. He just suddenly disappeared. Now we can't know why he didn't report it at the time."</p><p></p><p>"Disappeared? What a coincidence." The strongest will obviously didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>As long as the person involved couldn't be found and no evidence could be formed, the Bug Race couldn't punish the corresponding race.</p><p></p><p>"I speculate that those few people were probably bought off by human civilization long ago. This is also a blow to us."</p><p></p><p>The third will immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Bought off?" The strongest will was expressionless.</p><p></p><p>"I will continue to report this matter. You few races, just wait." The strongest will said and then directly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Chihu Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the God-Suppressing Bead?"</p><p></p><p>"A treasure that can withstand a Supreme's instant?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the metal box, and a colorless, transparent bead slowly floated up.</p><p></p><p>It faintly emanated an extremely gentle power, making Lin Yuan's soul and will feel like they were soaking in a hot spring.</p><p></p><p>"It's much more precious than an 8th stage soul defense treasure. Even the Primordial Essence Gold given by my teacher can't compare to it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Essence Gold was indeed precious and had growth attributes, but who knows how many resources it would take to grow it to the Supreme level.</p><p></p><p>And this God-Suppressing Bead should be a treasure at the Supreme level. Otherwise, it wouldn't be able to block a Supreme's instant.</p><p></p><p>You should know, a Supreme who has mastered the complete time rules, if they want to kill an 8th stage evolutionary, the other party can't react at all. But this God-Suppressing Bead can forcibly buy an instant of time.</p><p></p><p>With an instant of time, Lin Yuan can choose to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>As long as he hasn't received memory pollution from a Supreme, the so-called death is just like taking a nap under a Supreme's resurrection means.</p><p></p><p>"I have a Yang Spirit on the Chihu Main Star. Even if I encounter a Supreme, I can directly self-destruct my true body and don't need a Supreme to resurrect me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it's better not to die if you can avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Successfully refining the God-Suppressing Bead, Lin Yuan began to consider the things he needed to face next.</p><p></p><p>That is, to choose a frontier star domain and then go to preside over it for 500 years.</p><p></p><p>"Most 8th stage evolutionaries preside for far more than 500 years. For example, the Chihu Star Lord entered the 8th stage and presided over the Chihu Star Domain. He hasn't left until now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>People all have feelings, and evolutionaries are no exception.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see which star domain to choose."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the map of the human alliance's territory and carefully looked at it.</p><p></p><p>The frontier area presided over by an 8th stage evolutionary will have the right to be named. The Chihu Star Domain was not originally called the Chihu Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>After the Chihu Star Lord presided over it, it became the Chihu Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>"This place it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart moved as he looked at a certain location on the map.</p>

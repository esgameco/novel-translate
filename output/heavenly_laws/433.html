            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 433 Breakthrough (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Outside the nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan strode over.</p><p></p><p>After the metamorphosis of the demonic jade imprint, besides being able to sense the specific location coordinates of this demonic jade space, Lin Yuan had also gained partial authority over this demonic jade space. For example, as long as he was willing, he could easily appear in any place.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past when descending into the demonic jade space, he would walk to the front of the nine-story black tower. Lin Yuan had become accustomed to this, so this time he also strode over.</p><p></p><p>"You've become a member of the Sequence?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji had been waiting for a long time, looking at Lin Yuan with a complicated gaze. </p><p></p><p>Even he had never imagined that Lin Yuan could become a member of the Sequence.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the Demon Jade Tower headquarters had collapsed, and the foundation carrying all the paths of demonic evolution had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, to comprehend all the paths of demonic evolution, one could only comprehend them from the bodies of the twelve-stage experts subordinate to the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>But the difficulty was too great.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend all the paths of demonic evolution from the bodies of twelve-stage experts? It was still fine for living twelve-stage experts who could restrain their own pressure, but for fallen twelve-stage experts, even if it was just their remnants, they would still release an intangible spiritual will pressure.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual will pressure might not mean much to experts of the same twelve-stage realm, but for lives below the twelve-stage, it was simply impossible to withstand.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't even withstand it, let alone comprehend all the paths of demonic evolution.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji knew of Lin Yuan's monstrous talent and aptitude, he had never hoped that the other party could become a member of the Sequence.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because this path had basically been cut off with the disappearance of the Demon Jade Tower master.</p><p></p><p>"Lucky." Lin Yuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Lucky?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Even during the most prosperous period of the Demon Jade Tower, Sequence members were extremely rare. In the same era, the number of Demon Jade Tower Sequence members did not exceed one hundred.</p><p></p><p>Each Demon Jade Tower Sequence member had the potential to become a twelve-stage expert. How could it be just a matter of luck?</p><p></p><p>The personal disciples accepted by the Demon Jade Tower master were cultivated to become supreme experts, and Sequence members also had the potential to become supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the way Lin Yuan became a Demon Jade Tower Sequence member was much more difficult than the previous Sequence members, perhaps even more difficult than becoming a personal disciple of the Demon Jade Tower master.</p><p></p><p>"You were born in the wrong era," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said with some emotion after a long silence.</p><p></p><p>If it were during the prosperous period of the Demon Jade Tower, or even if it wasn't the prosperous period, as long as the Demon Jade Tower still had twelve-stage experts presiding over it, Lin Yuan would have received the full cultivation of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Even if he forcibly became a Demon Jade Tower Sequence member, what Lin Yuan obtained would be far less than before, and he wouldn't even get the various benefits and treatments that Sequence members originally had.</p><p></p><p>"I think it's fine," Lin Yuan shook his head. He had already reaped many benefits from this demonic jade space. As for truly being in the prosperous period of the Demon Jade Tower, it might not necessarily be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about the main business."</p><p></p><p>This was the reward for becoming a Sequence member.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Lin Yuan became a core member of the Demon Jade Tower, he gained the right to choose one method from many secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had become a Sequence member, the rewards he obtained were greater and more valuable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave the selection for later," Lin Yuan carefully scanned and said.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was about to enter the eleventh stage, the rewards on the light curtain were not of great help to the current Lin Yuan, so it was better to wait until after the eleventh stage before selecting according to his needs.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Lin Yuan was not clear about the extent of the metamorphosis that would occur after crossing into the eleventh stage, so he planned to wait and see first.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan was a Sequence member, his authority over this demonic jade space was only slightly lower than his own.</p><p></p><p>"Do Sequence members also have the authority to descend into this space?" Lin Yuan carefully sensed it and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said, "You can limit the descent into this space to the identities, races, bloodlines, and so on of ordinary members."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Jade Tower had strict hierarchies. For the lofty Sequence members, the future of ordinary members was just a matter of words.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll limit it so that from now on, only lifeforms from my human civilization can descend into this demonic jade space," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although so far, no alien experts had become ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower and descended into the demonic jade space.</p><p></p><p>But it was still necessary to be cautious. Those alien experts were also comprehending the paths of demonic evolution within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>If the timeline was extended, it was also possible for them to become ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan cut off this possibility.</p><p></p><p>If they could not enter this demonic jade space, even if those alien experts became ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower, it would be of no benefit at all.</p><p></p><p>It would be the same as wasting effort.</p><p></p><p>"Done."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji closed his eyes, and soon opened them again.</p><p></p><p>Screening the identities of ordinary members descending into this demonic jade space was a simple matter for him.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I want to try to break through the seventh floor."</p><p></p><p>The seventh floor of the black tower was where only twelve-stage experts had a chance of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>If it were before the tenth spatial shuttle, Lin Yuan wouldn't even dare to think about it.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the second level of the space-time fusion rules? It was already difficult to break through the sixth floor, let alone the seventh.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the space-time fusion rules had reached the sixth level, completely standing in the twelve-stage realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his spiritual will strength had also crossed into the twelve-stage realm.</p><p></p><p>With both aspects reaching the twelve-stage realm, Lin Yuan believed he could still try to break through the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh floor?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji fell silent again, then stepped aside, watching as Lin Yuan entered the nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, Lin Yuan retreated from the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>"Still not enough," Lin Yuan frowned tightly. To break through the seventh floor of the black tower, if one was a twelve-stage expert, they needed to reach the pinnacle of comprehending the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>If not at the twelve-stage, in the space-time fusion realm, one had to at least reach the seventh level to have a chance.</p><p></p><p>After all, although Lin Yuan's comprehension of space-time and spiritual will had reached the twelve-stage realm, he was ultimately not a twelve-stage expert. To break through the seventh floor, the requirements would definitely be higher than for a normal twelve-stage expert.</p><p></p><p>"Completed two-thirds of the path?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji beside him remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan ultimately still did not break through the seventh floor, he had completed two-thirds of the path on the seventh floor. This was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>A mere tenth-stage life had completed two-thirds of the path that only supreme experts had a chance of breaking through on the seventh floor?</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of freak was this?</p><p></p><p>Recalling that Lin Yuan was able to become a Demon Jade Tower Sequence member at the tenth stage realm, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji's mind was barely settled.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Heart and will power, as well as the comprehension of the laws of space-time fusion, have all completely crossed into the twelfth level, especially the strength of heart and will power."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Qi recalled the scenes of Lin Yuan storming through the seventh level just now, and his heart was stirred up again. </p><p></p><p>Up until now, the talents that Lin Yuan has revealed, even the young master of the Devil Jade Tower was far from matching.</p><p></p><p>Not that he couldn't match up. </p><p></p><p>The young master of the Devil Jade Tower had experienced many adventures in his youth, and had reached the twelfth level realm in certain aspects even before the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, the master of the Devil Jade Tower was already at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>But now Lin Yuan is only at the tenth level?</p><p></p><p>The tenth and eleventh levels, though seemingly only one level apart, are like a gulf.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Lin Yuan finally looked at the towering nine-story black building and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Still a pity?" The corners of the humanoid stone statue Shen Qi's mouth twitched slightly. A tenth level cultivator who hasn't even passed the seventh level, and he still feels it's a pity?</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go first." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan bade farewell to the humanoid stone statue and his figure disappeared from the Devil Jade space.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the vast Devil Jade space, only the humanoid stone statue Shen Qi was left standing alone in front of the nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>"Master, with your means, you probably didn't expect that the Devil Jade Tower could still give birth to a sequence member now?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Qi murmured to himself for a while before falling back into slumber.</p><p></p><p>Main Star of the Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"First cultivate the 'Deathless Devil Jade Body' to the perfect realm." Lin Yuan quickly took out numerous resources.</p><p></p><p>Early on when adjusting his state, Lin Yuan had purchased a large amount of resources, preparing to cross into the eleventh level and cultivate the 'Profound Yellow Body'.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had obtained the tenth level volume of the 'Deathless Devil Jade Body', he naturally planned to first cultivate this body refining method to perfection.</p><p></p><p>When crossing into the eleventh level and triggering the infusion of the primordial chaos void, the stronger the world within one's physical body and soul, the more primordial chaos void essence one could withstand, and the greater the benefit to oneself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan's physical body had already reached the pinnacle. At the tenth level realm, no matter how many methods, resources or secret arts were expended, it was difficult to improve it further.</p><p></p><p>But the 'Deathless Devil Jade Body' still allowed his physical strength to continue increasing by a notch. Lin Yuan naturally had to seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had already reached the perfect boundary of the 'Deathless Devil Jade Body'. With sufficient resources, it would not take long to cultivate it to the perfect realm.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six months went by.</p><p></p><p>"Finally reached the perfect tenth level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed the black jade-like flesh deep within his body, with streaks of profound yellow light flowing, its terrifying blood essence undulations shaking layer after layer of space.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready."</p><p></p><p>As for the original large-scale battlefield? Lin Yuan had long placed an avatar there.</p><p></p><p>Before the tenth spatial crossing, Lin Yuan's heart and will power was only at the ordinary level. The large-scale alien battlefield was extremely dangerous, requiring his primordial spirit to preside in order to ensure the long-term accumulation of spatial crossing forces.</p><p></p><p>As for the avatar? It was too weak to cope with the oppression of the large-scale alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But after the tenth spatial crossing, Lin Yuan's heart and will power had greatly improved, causing the battle prowess of his avatar to also be maintained at the eleventh level realm.</p><p></p><p>Although still not as powerful as his two primordial spirits, it was more than enough to deal with the dangers of the large-scale alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, battles at the eleventh level realm would not erupt in the large-scale alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I can contact the top experts now." Lin Yuan's consciousness connected to the virtual world and informed the top expert Xia Qin. He then took a step forward, leaving the Main Star of the Galaxy and heading towards a deep space layer at a certain location of the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the eleventh level would trigger the infusion of primordial chaos void essence. Naturally, he could not break through on the main star, as the impact would be too great. Even a slight influence could cause the Main Star of the Galaxy to disintegrate into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan sat in the depths of the space layer, making the final adjustments.</p><p></p><p>In the Galactic Star Domain, the avatars of the top experts of human civilization descended one by one.</p><p></p><p>The top expert Xia Qin.</p><p>The top expert Yudie.</p><p>The top expert Gu Li.</p><p>The top expert Xushen.</p><p>And so on, the virtual shadows of nine top experts all appeared.</p><p></p><p>Even Xia Qin's true self was paying attention here.</p><p></p><p>Through his avatar as a marker, Xia Qin's true self could descend at any time.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally starting to break through." Xia Qin's expression was slightly excited. He was even more anxious than Lin Yuan himself, having been waiting for Lin Yuan's news these past few months.</p><p></p><p>"I have already set up spatial domains in dozens of nearby star domains."</p><p></p><p>The top expert Xushen spoke. His profound attainment was in the space dao.</p><p></p><p>With Xushen's mastery over space, the spatial domains he set up were impenetrable even to a group of top experts in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"For this little fellow's breakthrough, we've put in quite a bit of effort."</p><p></p><p>The top expert Gu Li couldn't help but speak as well. Throughout the history of human civilization, apart from the eleventh level's push towards the ultimate, they had never paid such attention before.</p><p></p><p>However, given the talents Lin Yuan has displayed, it was worth it for the nine top experts to do this.</p><p></p><p>It was something unprecedented in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the nine top experts, Lin Yuan's push to the eleventh level was even more significant than those eleventh level cultivators pushing towards the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"Last time during the breakthrough to the tenth level, I wasn't present. Now I can see what kind of commotion this little fellow will cause."</p><p></p><p>Another human top expert said with keen interest.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan broke through to the tenth level, triggering the infusion of primordial chaos void essence, although the scale was far from comparable to pushing towards the ultimate, it was still an unprecedented event.</p><p></p><p>Those top experts who missed it felt quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>"The commotion should be considerable," Xia Qin guessed. "Perhaps close to pushing towards the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was at the tenth level, he had already comprehended the laws of space-time fusion, greatly enhancing his inner world. Coupled with the metamorphosis of his physical body and soul, the primordial chaos void essence he could withstand would far exceed his breakthrough from the ninth to the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>"A commotion close to pushing towards the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining few human top experts looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Was it possible that Lin Yuan now possessed the perfect foundation of the eleventh level? How could that be?</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch."</p><p></p><p>The top expert Yudie spoke.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the space layer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his two primordial spirits having already returned to his body.</p><p></p><p>Transforming from reality to illusion, the inner worlds of the two primordial spirits did not shrink to a million mile radius, but maintained their 2.3 billion mile radius, with the mystical gourd still enhancing them.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>"Begin the breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner aura was perfectly harmonious as he released the suppression on himself.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't suppress it, Lin Yuan would have been forced to cross into the eleventh level long ago, when he comprehended a certain pillar-level fusion law at the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>Following Lin Yuan's complete release of himself.</p><p></p><p>His life essence rapidly leapt towards the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after—</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p>

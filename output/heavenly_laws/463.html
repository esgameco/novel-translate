        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 463 Little Creature, Obediently Offer Your Flesh (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang Yan had not fled very far when the surrounding space-time changed, and the time and space were all compressed and finally condensed in the palm of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>"Aren't you Gao Wu You?!"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?!!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang Yan's expression was extremely panicked. He had once seen a jade immortal carriage cross the sky from afar, and the suppression of many rules was still deeply imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But the lofty jade immortal carriage was like dust compared to the space-time that Gao Wu You was manipulating at the moment - the two were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly, "You don't need to know."</p><p></p><p>With a slight mental movement, Lin Yuan erased Wu Xiang Yan's physical body and soul, leaving only the fragments of memories.</p><p></p><p>As a newcomer to the immortal realm, Lin Yuan naturally wanted to understand the situation in the immortal realm. In addition to Gao Wu You's original memories, he also needed to observe Wu Xiang Yan's memories.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Not dead?"</p><p></p><p>After completely erasing Wu Xiang Yan, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed through the causal connection that there was still a trace of the other party's causality in an extremely distant place - a deep underground.</p><p></p><p>When Wu Xiang Yan was erased by Lin Yuan, the black pool of water in this underground quickly rippled, and the spiritual will of Wu Xiang Yan was revived in the depths of the pool.</p><p></p><p>"I'm dead."</p><p></p><p>The revived spiritual will was slightly stunned, and then the many scenes before his death flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>The black pool of water was a life pool that Wu Xiang Yan had refined at great cost. Once his true body fell, the fragments of spiritual will in the life pool would quickly grow to completion, that is, to "resurrect".</p><p></p><p>"What a terrifying method. What's going on with Gao Wu You, how can he have such a mastery of the rules?" </p><p></p><p>The "resurrected" Wu Xiang Yan still had a look of terror in his eyes. "It's impossible for Gao Wu You to have such strength. How could I have seriously injured him before?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang Yan couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I spent a lot of my wealth to refine this life pool, otherwise I would have been completely destroyed just now."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang Yan calmed down and thought gratefully to himself.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator at the tribulation-crossing stage, refining a life pool was not an easy task. Only someone like Wu Xiang Yan, who secretly plundered other weak cultivators, could barely afford the cost of refining the life pool.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wu You must have a big secret. If I tell this secret to those gold immortals and jade immortals, I should be able to get a reward."</p><p></p><p>Although Wu Xiang Yan had "resurrected", it was equivalent to starting from scratch, and he urgently needed a lot of resources to recover. Gao Wu You's secret was the key to his rise again.</p><p></p><p>Even if those gold immortals were not interested in Gao Wu You, the opportunities of the jade immortals would still have some appeal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wu Xiang Yan had a clear understanding of himself - regaining the jade immortal opportunity was basically impossible. He even dared not face Gao Wu You again, as that kind of suppression over space-time and numerous rules made him tremble with fear.</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But while he didn't dare to face Gao Wu You, he could sell the information about Gao Wu You and that jade immortal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wu Xiang Yan planned to rest for a while and then leave the underground...</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>An invisible attack, following the ubiquitous causal rule connection, descended with a thunderous roar across countless miles.</p><p></p><p>"No!!!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual will in the depths of the black life pool had not yet reacted, and all the black pool water turned to powder, and the internal spiritual will was also reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"This time it's completely solved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his right hand. After finding that Wu Xiang Yan was still alive, he casually carried out the causal curse killing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true realm was at the perfect 11th stage, while Wu Xiang Yan was only at the 8th stage. Cursing a life of this level did not even require Lin Yuan to pay any price.</p><p></p><p>"Find a place to recover."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, and his figure silently disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Although the demonic marrow poison had been resolved, his heavily injured physical body still needed to recover.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of a mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in a cave.</p><p></p><p>"The environment of the immortal realm is far superior to the spirit realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally had time to feel the aura of the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Even in this remote mountain range, Lin Yuan could still sense the dense immortal qi permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, the hope of cultivating to the tribulation-crossing stage would be far stronger than in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the sky, and with his level, he vaguely sensed a huge existence, like a great sun overlooking and illuminating all beings.</p><p></p><p>The countless immortal cultivators of the immortal dao cultivation system all originated from that huge existence.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was absolutely certain that the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao who propagated the immortal dao cultivation system was indeed an ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, in addition to the dazzling Ancestor of the Immortal Dao who illuminated all beings like the great sun, there also existed another unfathomable huge existence in the depths of the earth, whose dao energy was completely opposite to that of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, permeated with endless madness and destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Another ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate in the depths of the Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was aware of Gao Wu You's memories and knew of the existence of the Demon Abyss. That was the gathering place of all evil and madness, and at all times, a large number of demonic beings would crawl out from the Demon Abyss, only to be suppressed by the Thirty-Three Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The immortals in the immortal realm suppressed [the situation].</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Demonic Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"That is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin, and he vaguely surmised that this was a struggle between the two ultimate existences. Currently, it seemed that the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>At least in the immortal realm, the immortals were generally suppressing those demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Spirit Realm or the Central Divine Continent, the cultivation system of the Immortal Dao was dominant, while the cultivation system of the Demonic Dao did exist, but it was not the mainstream.</p><p></p><p>This also implicitly reflected the victory and defeat in the struggle between the two ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the spiritual judgment that contained the memories of Wu Xiang-yan, and began to quickly browse through it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the original body of Gao Wu-you, Wu Xiang-yan's memories were more chaotic. In addition to cultivation, there were also many fragments of memories of plundering other weak cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In summary, Wu Xiang-yan was a person who did not hesitate to use any means for the sake of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In fact, such people were not uncommon in the immortal realm, and it was even very common. There were too many cases of brothers turning against each other for the sake of opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"But he has accumulated quite a few cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sorted out Wu Xiang-yan's spoils of war. These spoils of war would be a huge fortune for fellow Tribulation Crossing cultivators at the same level, but in Lin Yuan's eyes, they were just ordinary, basically not worth much.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at that Jade Immortal opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and he took out a white, crystal-clear jade stone.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura lingered on the jade stone, an aura that surpassed even that of Gold Immortals. This was the basis for Wu Xiang-yan's judgment that it belonged to a Jade Immortal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Except for the opportunities left behind by Jade Immortals, other opportunities would not have such a lingering aura.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Interest appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Jade Immortals corresponded to the Eleventh-Tier powerhouses of the main universe. The opportunities left behind by existences of such a level, for Lin Yuan in his prime, would not have been anything special.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan was basically starting from scratch, so he was quite interested.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lin Yuan divided a thread of consciousness and began to refine the jade stone.</p><p></p><p>The jade stone should belong to a certain spatial immortal artifact, containing a vast space within.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Lin Yuan had completely refined the jade stone.</p><p></p><p>"These..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness entered the interior of the jade stone, and it was a vast heaven and earth, with countless resources neatly piled up there.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Crane Grass, Secluded Water Immortal Lotus, Myriad Souls Fruit, Dual-Life Tree..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced over, and many resources that were extremely rare in the memories of Gao Wu-you and Wu Xiang-yan, or even just heard of, were piled up like small mountains.</p><p></p><p>These were just the resources that Gao Wu-you and Wu Xiang-yan had heard of. The vast majority of the resources were things they had never heard of, but based on the energy aura and vibrational patterns they emanated, Lin Yuan could tell that they were of great value.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Jade Immortal opportunity? It should be called the entire wealth of a Jade Immortal, that would be more appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The resources arranged in the jade stone far exceeded what could be called an "opportunity". Perhaps the entire wealth of many Jade Immortals would not be more than this.</p><p></p><p>And the arrangement of these resources was very orderly, from low to high, as if they had been prepared specifically for later comers.</p><p></p><p>"I'm this lucky? Just after my consciousness has awakened, I've obtained such a great benefit?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although these resources could not restore him to his peak, he should have no problem recovering to the peak of the Tenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"There are also many immortal dao cultivation technique inheritances?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, looking towards the corner of the heaven and earth within the jade stone, where a pile of jade slips were placed, clearly recording many cultivation technique inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to divide his consciousness and began to explore them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The complete immortal dao cultivation system should have a good promoting effect on opening up the Eleventh-Tier evolution path of the Martial Dao for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Gold Immortal? Jade Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Gold nature is imperishable, jade nature does not fall, flesh body like gold, spirit soul like jade, form and spirit do not fall."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly absorbed the immortal dao cultivation technique inheritances recorded in these jade slips, which described the essence of cultivation evolution from a completely different direction compared to the Eleventh-Tier evolution paths of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was constantly browsing through one jade slip after another, a jade slip that was purple in color quietly lay among them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan's consciousness explored this purple jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!!</p><p></p><p>A huge consciousness was awakened in this purple jade slip, and it quickly spread along Lin Yuan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Ancestor has waited for millions of years, and finally the time has come."</p><p></p><p>This consciousness was extremely excited, constantly spreading along Lin Yuan's consciousness, breaking into the spiritual barrier, and quickly arriving at the outer world of the spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>"Little fellow, obediently offer your physical body, rest assured, this Ancestor is the supreme Jade Immortal, to take possession of your physical body is the highest honor."</p><p></p><p>This huge consciousness that had awakened from the purple jade slip was impatient to enter the spiritual world, intending to replace Lin Yuan's spiritual will and completely take over.</p><p></p><p>"With this Ancestor here, your physical body is destined to shake the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>After the awakened consciousness from the purple jade slip quickly entered the spiritual world, it was about to find Lin Yuan's spiritual will, but suddenly it stopped, and the waves of consciousness it emitted also abruptly ceased.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of it, there was a majestic figure sitting in meditation, this figure seemed to permeate the heavens and the earth, towering and vast, powerful and boundless.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this majestic figure, the Jade Immortal consciousness that had just awakened from the purple jade slip seemed as small as dust.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The awakened Jade Immortal consciousness fell silent.</p>

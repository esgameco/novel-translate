            <p>Chapter 221: The Secret of the Supreme Beings, That Piece of Corpse (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's knowledge, comprehension indeed had different focuses. </p><p></p><p>Even the most monstrous geniuses in human civilization history had areas they were not good at.</p><p></p><p>Those evolutionary scholars delved deeply into different fields, such as the mind and consciousness, certain rules or categories, the essence of life, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Red Kun Star Lord's reminder made sense.</p><p></p><p>That piece of corpse originated from outside the main world, completely different from everything Lin Yuan had encountered so far.</p><p></p><p>The innate comprehension talent Lin Yuan currently displayed might not necessarily work on that piece of corpse.</p><p></p><p>But what the Red Kun Star Lord didn't know was:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension was omnipotent. </p><p></p><p>This had been fully verified through the past six traversals.</p><p></p><p>Six traversals, six worlds. These six worlds came from different dimensions and realms. Especially the last Tian Qing world, which even had the existence of evil gods from outside the domain.</p><p></p><p>But it still did not pose the slightest hindrance or discomfort to Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Red Kun Star Lord, "Why did the supreme beings release this piece of corpse for us to comprehend?"</p><p></p><p>This was also the question in Lin Yuan's mind. </p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to give opportunities to the younger generation, there was no need to do it in such a semi-public way, right?</p><p></p><p>"I only heard about it." </p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord pondered for a moment, "You should know that supreme beings are all 'unique'. They are the ultimate existence on an evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically speaking, as long as this supreme being is alive, then on the evolutionary path he stands on, or the road he established, it is impossible to give birth to the next supreme being."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard of that." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the current Human Civilization Alliance tilted resources towards pioneering brand new evolutionary paths was precisely because the more evolutionary paths there were, the greater the hope of giving birth to the next supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the vast majority of human evolutionaries, there was no hope of becoming a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many evolutionaries cultivated on the nine evolutionary paths that had given birth to supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Since these nine supreme evolutionary paths could give birth to supreme beings, it meant they were very well-developed and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Thus, even without the possibility of becoming a supreme being, one could still crush other evolutionaries of the same level.</p><p></p><p>However, the human civilization authorities, the three goddesses, and the nine supreme beings still hoped that human evolutionaries would walk more on other evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>"It is difficult for supreme beings to die, they are almost imperishable and exist eternally."</p><p></p><p>When the Red Kun Star Lord said this, a glimmer flashed in his eyes, "But now, a supreme being has died."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is." Realization dawned on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Through that piece of corpse, it might be possible to comprehend the path that supreme being walked when he was alive.</p><p></p><p>A path that had given birth to a supreme being before had proven to be sufficiently well-developed and perfect. As long as the conditions were met, such as the death of this supreme being, a second supreme being could be born.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to a heavenly road, a heavenly road leading to the level of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Other evolutionary paths, even if they had not given birth to supreme beings, the evolutionaries walking on this path did not know which step they could take.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the current human civilization would not have only nine supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>One should know that the evolutionary paths currently mastered by human civilization were as vast as the sea.</p><p></p><p>But now, the path walked by the owner of that piece of corpse had clearly been proven to be able to become a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't be tempted by this?</p><p></p><p>The reason why the supreme beings of human civilization took the initiative to release that piece of corpse and let countless evolutionaries comprehend it was precisely because they hoped that some human evolutionaries could walk the path of the corpse's owner and eventually become new supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, that insect race planned to enjoy this corpse alone, so they could master another path leading to supreme beings."</p><p></p><p>"But now, that body has been divided into several pieces. All races that obtained a piece of the corpse have the hope of mastering this supreme path."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord said slowly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the human civilization authorities were so eager to release that piece of corpse.</p><p></p><p>Human evolutionaries could comprehend the corpse, and the powerhouses of other races could also comprehend the corpse. It was equivalent to the several major races that obtained the corpse competing for a spot to become a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>"This opportunity is rare in the over two million year history of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord sighed. The nine supreme beings of human civilization, which one of them did not go through numerous attempts, and the evolutionary paths they walked were also adjusted many times.</p><p></p><p>How could it be like now, as long as one could comprehend the path within the corpse, they could directly reach the supreme being level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, saying it was direct was a bit of an exaggeration, but at least compared to the vast majority of evolutionaries, there was hope of becoming a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, why don't you comprehend it?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm at the peak of the 8th stage, my path is set. That piece of corpse is useless to me. Even if I comprehend the path of the corpse's owner, I can't compete with other powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That piece of corpse is quite strange, many of the paths it contains are wrong and have hidden dangers." The Red Kun Star Lord said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The path of a supreme being..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were deep. In the starry universe of the main world, supreme beings were the ceiling of combat power. The human civilization had nine supreme beings presiding, overlooking the myriad races in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"But... supreme beings can also die?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. However, this involved the secrets at the level of supreme beings. Even as the 13th Peak Lord of the Red Kun Lineage and a Level 7 citizen, Lin Yuan could not find specific information.</p><p></p><p>"The place to comprehend that piece of corpse is in the virtual world? Our human civilization's nine supreme beings paid a certain price to replicate 30% of the essence of that piece of corpse into the virtual world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan received the information and thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was also to make it more convenient for human evolutionaries to comprehend. Otherwise, to comprehend that piece of corpse, one would have to go to the central star domain. How long would that take?</p><p></p><p>The virtual world was much simpler.</p><p></p><p>One only needed to connect their consciousness to enter.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly received an invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to enter the virtual world No. 124354?"</p><p></p><p>"Enter." Lin Yuan immediately chose to agree.</p><p></p><p>In order to facilitate human evolutionaries to comprehend that piece of corpse, the virtual world specially opened up many worlds and dispersed all the evolutionaries into them.</p><p></p><p>After all, with too many people, it was better to manage them separately.</p><p></p><p>Each world had dedicated administrators to check the comprehension progress of each evolutionary.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan opened his eyes, he found himself on the top of a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Looking out...</p><p></p><p>Go, in all directions, there were such mountain peaks, and on the top of each peak, there were ten to twenty evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"Most of them are seventh-level evolved beings, with sixth-level evolved beings occupying a minority, and there are even eighth-level evolved beings?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze and took in the many auras.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of human evolved beings who comprehended that torso were basically the geniuses of a stellar domain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, under the same circumstances of being geniuses, they were divided again when entering different comprehension worlds.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses among geniuses like Lin Yuan, seventh-level beings under a hundred years old on the surface, were certainly placed together with seventh-level genius evolved beings of similar levels who entered between a hundred and a thousand years old.</p><p></p><p>"You are the thirteenth peak master of the Chikunlun Sect, right?" At this time, a voice came from the side.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced over, and the other party was a sturdy man with a physique as perfect as a sculpture, standing there with an extremely sharp power.</p><p></p><p>He was an evolved being from the Nine Swords Stellar Domain, named Gao Wufeng, the most valued disciple of the Nine Swords Stellar Lord. He entered the seventh level at the age of four hundred and thirty, and was now at the peak of the seventh-level king realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, this Gao Wufeng was far superior to the great peak masters of the Chikunlun Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. Now, the evolved beings who could comprehend that torso were all starting from the sixth level, so there was no need to worry about being assassinated by different races, and there was no need to hide his identity.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The other evolved beings on this mountain peak also started discussing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"That's the thirteenth peak master?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he the freak from the Chikunlun Stellar Domain who entered the seventh level before a hundred years old?"</p><p></p><p>"He's really abnormal. I have a special physique and awakened the ancestral bloodline, and received the all-out cultivation of the family. Even so, I entered the seventh level in my six hundreds. How did this thirteenth peak master do it?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that this thirteenth peak master doesn't have any special physique or bloodline boost."</p><p></p><p>"Abnormal, too abnormal."</p><p></p><p>The evolved beings who could be in the first batch to comprehend all had big backgrounds and origins, and were rare geniuses even in a stellar domain. They had a lot of pride, but at this moment, seeing Lin Yuan, there was no thought of comparison in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, entering the seventh level before a hundred years old without any physique or bloodline boost was simply terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In terms of talent, Lin Yuan could probably leave his name in the history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how much the thirteenth peak master understands about this comprehension matter?" On the other side, Gao Wufeng from the Nine Swords Stellar Domain said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"My teacher said it has something to do with the strongest." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no need to hide it, Gao Wufeng's teacher in front of him, the Nine Swords Stellar Lord, had a combat power no less than the Chikunlun Stellar Lord, and was also an invincible existence at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest..." Gao Wufeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>As the pillar of human civilization, who doesn't want to become the next strongest?</p><p></p><p>"With the thirteenth peak master's talent, you should make a big splash this time, right?" Gao Wufeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Just let those with the highest talent comprehend privately."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"The thirteenth peak master is right." A woman with golden wings walked over, her whole body seemed to be shrouded in endless light, exuding a holy aura.</p><p></p><p>"Zuoqiu Guang?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng looked at the golden-winged woman.</p><p></p><p>This golden-winged woman was called Zuoqiu Guang, and she had awakened the light elf bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The elf bloodline was a very powerful branch in the human bloodline system, especially good at comprehending the rules.</p><p></p><p>The light elf bloodline had an innate affinity for the rules of light, and the concentration of Zuoqiu Guang's bloodline was even more unimaginably high. In addition, both of her parents were high-level evolved beings of human civilization, and they spared no effort in cultivating her.</p><p></p><p>Zuoqiu Guang entered the seventh level at the age of only three hundred and sixty-two.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth peak master." Zuoqiu Guang looked at Lin Yuan, a smile appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng beside her also nodded slightly. In terms of talent, Zuoqiu Guang was even stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>The three of them sat together and started communicating with each other. As for the other evolved beings on the top of the mountain, they all subconsciously stayed away from the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, under the vast sky, a huge figure appeared. He coldly swept his eyes over the many evolved beings on the mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I want to remind you of a few things."</p><p></p><p>"First, in this world, your physical body and soul are all of the same standard, both at the first level. Don't try to recover or synchronize your strength."</p><p></p><p>"Second, no matter what kind of evolution path or method you comprehend from that torso, don't cultivate it in reality, but first cultivate it in the virtual world."</p><p></p><p>"Third, it is forbidden to cultivate any evolution paths or methods other than those comprehended from that torso."</p><p></p><p>"Fourth, boldly comprehend. Even if you die due to some accident, the strongest will 'resurrect' you."</p><p></p><p>After the huge figure finished speaking, he spoke no more.</p><p></p><p>On the top of the many mountain peaks, the evolved beings heard this and immediately started discussing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that comprehending that torso will be very dangerous." Gao Wufeng said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they wouldn't forbid cultivating the comprehended evolution paths or methods in reality, and if they unfortunately died, the strongest would help 'resurrect' them.</p><p></p><p>"How can one become the strongest without taking risks?" Zuoqiu Guang's expression was full of fighting spirit. From a young age, she had been obsessed with cultivation, yearning to become the strongest.</p><p></p><p>And in the human alliance, in the universe, only the strongest dared to call themselves the 'strongest'.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"I wish you good luck."</p><p></p><p>The huge figure under the vast sky disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place was a torso.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, even the light seemed to dim.</p><p></p><p>The attention of all the evolved beings fell on that torso.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the partial body of the strongest?" Lin Yuan also raised his head to look.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was observing that torso, an intangible pressure began to press down, pressing down on Lin Yuan's mind and will.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Under this kind of suppression, as the observation time passed, it slowly increased, and the oppression on Lin Yuan's mind and will gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>"This is the strongest, just relying on a broken torso, and it's a replica in the virtual world, with only thirty percent of its power left, and it can still exert such a great mental pressure on me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the others around him and found that they also had solemn expressions, enduring the mental pressure naturally emanating from that torso.</p><p></p><p>"However, this kind of suppression is a good place to temper the mind and will."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit was lifted. Even if his teacher, the Chikunlun Stellar Lord, was far superior to him in strength,</p><p></p><p>he couldn't give too much pressure on his mind and will.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps relying on this kind of suppression, the index of my mind and will can break through ten thousand points in a short period of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p>

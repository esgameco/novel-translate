            <p>Chapter 282 - Suggestion to Invite the Galaxy Star Lord (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"World Tree Sapling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also found this treasure from the reward list.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had been paying attention to the World Tree Sapling for a long time,</p><p></p><p>because it was one of the few treasures he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>In the main world universe starry sky, the World Tree was a precious treasure that could be encountered but not sought after.</p><p></p><p>The World Fruit it bore could open up an internal world for evolvers in advance, leading other evolvers of the same level by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>It was known that even with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, he had only managed to condense an internal world with great difficulty when he was at the peak of the sixth stage and trying to break through to the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The World Fruit, however, could directly achieve this, which showed how precious the World Tree was.</p><p></p><p>"You have integrated dozens of universal powers with the rules of space, and your foundation is so deep that it's terrifying. Your internal world must also have a treasure of sufficient weight to preside over it."</p><p></p><p>"The World Tree is just right."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue of Shengji spoke.</p><p></p><p>The World Tree had many uses, one of which was to preside over the internal world and stabilize the energy rules of earth, fire, wind and water in the internal world.</p><p></p><p>A World Tree was more useful than thousands or tens of thousands of universal rarities.</p><p></p><p>Even if the World Tree presided over the internal world, it could expand the internal world to a certain extent, with the hope of breaking through the shackle of the upper limit of a million square miles for the internal world of human evolution.</p><p></p><p>"In the first-level reward treasury and the second-level reward treasury, the value of the World Tree Sapling ranks in the top three, and I even think it's number one."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue said.</p><p></p><p>The reason why it was "think" was because for treasures of the level of the World Tree Sapling, it was difficult to distinguish between first and second, and it all depended on whether it was suitable for oneself.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's the World Tree Sapling." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Even without the suggestion of the stone statue Shengji, Lin Yuan would most likely choose this World Tree Sapling in the end.</p><p></p><p>After all, based on human civilization's understanding of the World Tree, Lin Yuan was very eager to have one himself.</p><p></p><p>"Rooting the World Tree Sapling in the internal world, generally speaking, the more abundant the foundation of the internal world, the faster the growth of the World Tree Sapling."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shengji said.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After the World Tree matured, it would bear World Fruits, which were extremely precious treasures. Even if Lin Yuan didn't use them himself, he could easily sell them.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that even the strongest beings would be willing to pay a price to purchase World Fruits in order to lay a foundation for their offspring.</p><p></p><p>With the World Fruit, even sixth-stage evolvers could open up an internal world, equivalent to a weakened version of the Starry Sea Wandering Kun.</p><p></p><p>"As for the third treasure, I have no suggestions for now." The stone statue Shengji spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No suggestions." Lin Yuan looked at the reward list again.</p><p></p><p>If he chose wrong, Lin Yuan estimated that he would regret it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shengji, is it possible to keep the last chance to select a reward for later use?" Lin Yuan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Once the treasures on the reward list were selected, they could not be changed. Lin Yuan planned to leave it for later.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shengji nodded.</p><p></p><p>If it were during the heyday of the Magic Jade Tower, with practitioners entering the Black Tower at all times, naturally the earlier the treasures on the reward list were selected, the better.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the selection was too late, they would probably be taken by other practitioners. But now?</p><p></p><p>For countless tens of thousands of years, there had only been Lin Yuan as the sole practitioner. It could be predicted that for a long time to come, there would still only be Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So there was no way that the treasures on the reward list would be taken in advance.</p><p></p><p>Without even a single practitioner, who would choose?</p><p></p><p>"Do you plan to try the second floor?" The stone statue said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Only eighth-stage life forms who had thoroughly comprehended the complete rules of space or several powerful universal powers could possibly pass the first floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>As for the second floor of the Black Tower? It had nothing to do with eighth-stage life forms anymore. Only the extremely powerful among ninth-stage life forms had a chance to pass the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, who had comprehended dozens of universal powers, including origin-level universal powers, there was no possibility of passing the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The essence of life was there. Although origin-level universal powers had unlimited potential, the prerequisite was that they had to grow, and Lin Yuan was currently only at the eighth stage. Even if he possessed origin-level universal powers, it was absolutely impossible for him to pass the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the stone statue asked Lin Yuan if he planned to try the second floor was simply because he was bored and wanted Lin Yuan to stay in this practice space for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Following the black staircase, he arrived at the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the stone statue's figure disappeared in the distance and reappeared outside the nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Layers of images appeared in front of the stone statue, showing every detail of the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"The pressure has increased a lot."</p><p></p><p>On the second floor of the Black Tower, as soon as Lin Yuan appeared, he felt the terrifying pressure coming from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had walked a third of the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of universal powers shattered, and even the primordial power turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Without the protection of many universal powers, Lin Yuan's figure also turned into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the nine-story Black Tower, the stone statue Shengji did not show any surprise.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was already extremely incredible that Lin Yuan could walk a third of the way through the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that this floor was completely prepared for ninth-stage life forms. Lin Yuan completing a third of it had essentially surpassed many ninth-stage life forms.</p><p></p><p>Even some of the strong among ninth-stage life forms were not as good as Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "not as good" here was completely in terms of mental will and many universal powers.</p><p></p><p>The power mastered by ninth-stage life forms was far more than just this aspect, but the nine-story Black Tower was specifically designed to test this aspect.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, you appeared too late. If it were when the master was still here, what you would have gained would not be limited to these few reward treasures." The stone statue Shengji sighed.</p><p></p><p>With the talent and aptitude shown by Lin Yuan, as long as the master of the Magic Jade Tower knew about it, he would definitely cultivate him with all his might as a treasure. But now, he could only make do with these treasures.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"The second floor is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive. According to the experience of the first floor of the Black Tower, after walking a third of the way, illusory creatures condensed out of thin air would appear.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was crushed by the omnipresent pressure before he even saw the illusory creatures, and dozens of universal powers could not withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"If I thoroughly comprehend the rules of space, can I pass the second floor?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The complete rules of space did not allow Lin Yuan to have the ability to move or teleport on the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>But by relying on the mastery of the rules of space, Lin Yuan could greatly weaken the heavy pressure enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>The rules of space were profound and mysterious. With the power of the rules of space, Lin Yuan could completely distort and stretch the space of a few inches around him, forming a vast space of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>From there, no matter how great the pressure was, it would be greatly weakened after entering this space.</p><p></p><p>According to the stone statue Shengji, the second floor of the Black Tower was completely prepared for ninth-stage life forms. Only the extremely powerful among ninth-stage life forms could</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There is hope to break through.</p><p></p><p>In other words, most ninth-level lifeforms have not broken through the second layer of hope.</p><p></p><p>As for mastering the complete spatial rules, although some ninth-level lifeforms have not achieved it, it obviously has nothing to do with "most".</p><p></p><p>Many ninth-level lifeforms who have mastered the complete spatial rules still cannot break through the second layer.</p><p></p><p>"I still have a trump card, which is the magical ability 'Strengthen'." Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he didn't use the magical ability "Strengthen" when breaking through the second layer just now was simply because it was meaningless. At that time, Lin Yuan had only walked one-third of the way.</p><p></p><p>Using the magical ability "Strengthen" at that time, with only ten breaths of duration, it was impossible to walk through the remaining two-thirds of the journey.</p><p></p><p>"I'll see when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>The rewards of the nine-layered dark path are too abundant, and Lin Yuan naturally won't easily let go of such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Even if he can't break through the second layer at the eighth level, he will definitely try again after he enters the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>"World Tree"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed himself and looked at the sapling in front of him, his eyes showing a burning color.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of this Jade Tower has reached an unimaginable level in spatial attainments, directly sending this World Tree sapling along the jade mark."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was filled with emotion.</p><p></p><p>What descended into the jade space was just a wisp of Lin Yuan's mental will, unable to carry physical objects back.</p><p></p><p>Even knowing that the jade space is not in the main world, and is incredibly far away from the main world, he can still achieve this scene, which amazes even Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This is already similar to the Myriad Worlds Gate.</p><p></p><p>As long as sufficient world-breaking power is paid, the Myriad Worlds Gate can similarly bring items from the main world into the traversing worlds, or bring items from the traversing worlds back to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's just similar.</p><p></p><p>The items carried by the Myriad Worlds Gate cross different dimensional latitudes, which has already surpassed the concept of space, not knowing how much more brilliant it is compared to the owner of the Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far the distance between the jade space and the main world is, they are still in the same latitude and dimension.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly plant the World Tree in the inner world."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, he brought the World Tree sapling into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gently placed the World Tree sapling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the World Tree sapling began to take root in the soil, slowly absorbing the world power.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"A very special feeling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression moved.</p><p></p><p>When the World Tree took root in his inner world, Lin Yuan vaguely had a strange experience.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this World Tree was his own bloodline descendant.</p><p></p><p>"It's absorbing the world power." Lin Yuan clearly felt that this World Tree sapling was slowly absorbing the world power into its trunk.</p><p></p><p>As the world power entered the World Tree sapling, Lin Yuan also noticed that he was rapidly refining this World Tree sapling.</p><p></p><p>"No changes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly sensed his inner world and found that the World Tree sapling did not have any effect.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood in his heart that the World Tree is too small now. Even if its quality is unimaginably high, it is impossible to affect the billions of miles of the world in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>After settling the World Tree sapling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to comprehend the "Void Interpretation".</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary scholars of the human civilization in the main world divided the complete spatial rules into basic spatial models and core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Only by understanding these two types of spatial models can one grasp the complete spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>But this is just the understanding of those pioneering evolutionary scholars of human civilization. In fact, the spatial rules are vast and endless. How can a few thousand or tens of thousands of spatial models encompass the true spatial rules?</p><p></p><p>The so-called basic spatial models and core spatial models are just attempts to understand a certain aspect of spatial rules based on the evolution of human evolutionary beings.</p><p></p><p>The "Void Interpretation" written by the owner of the Jade Tower interprets the spatial rules from a completely different angle than humans.</p><p></p><p>In the understanding of the owner of the Jade Tower, all things in the world originate from space, and many rules, such as the rules of the five elements, the rules of thunder, the rules of light, etc., are all part of the spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>"So spatial rules can also be comprehended in this way?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was instantly a little obsessed, and insights kept flashing.</p><p></p><p>And during the continuous comprehension of the "Void Interpretation", Lin Yuan's understanding of spatial models was also deepening.</p><p></p><p>He quickly comprehended up to the 6,000th core spatial model and was rapidly advancing towards the 7,000th core spatial model.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield B0001.</p><p></p><p>This medium-sized alien battlefield is the oldest among all alien battlefields, and it is the place where human civilization and the apex race - the Feathered Tribe - fight fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The Feathered Tribe has a similar appearance to humans, with an average height of five to ten meters, but they have white wings, and these wings symbolize the status and potential of the Feathered Tribe members.</p><p></p><p>For two million years, countless evolutionary beings of human civilization have fought fiercely with the Feathered Tribe, and the war is even more intense than that between human civilization and the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>Every day, a large number of human evolutionary beings die at the hands of the Feathered Tribe powerhouses, and similarly, there are also Feathered Tribe powerhouses who die at the hands of human civilization's evolutionary beings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>On one side of the B0001 battlefield, dozens of eighth-level invincible evolutionary beings gathered, discussing the war strategy against the Feathered Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"In a few years at most, the Feathered Tribe will definitely launch an all-out war to determine the ownership of that star domain." The leading eighth-level invincible, with a short and fat figure, said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization specially opened up many battlefields to control the impact of the war within a certain range as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>If they don't fight in specially opened battlefields, but in the starry sky, it will definitely cause a large number of planets to be destroyed and annihilated.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if they win the war, they will only reap a devastated star domain.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan went to the Galaxy Star Domain to take up the position of Star Lord, and the original owner of that star domain belonged to the Shadow Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Tribe lost the war against human civilization on the battlefield and admitted defeat, so they voluntarily gave up a star domain.</p><p></p><p>This is also something agreed upon by the major apex races' grand alliance.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>The upcoming war between human civilization and the Feathered Tribe will determine the ownership of a vast star domain.</p><p></p><p>"The Feathered Tribe is fully prepared and is determined to obtain that star domain. They have mobilized many eighth-level invincibles. The chances of our human civilization winning are slim."</p><p></p><p>A woman in green clothes spoke up.</p><p></p><p>It's not that human civilization is inferior to the Feathered Tribe, but some time ago, human civilization mobilized a large number of evolutionary beings to go to war with another apex race.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the number of evolutionary beings in the current war is somewhat insufficient.</p><p></p><p>"I have a suggestion."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an eighth-level invincible spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Speak." The short and fat old man immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He was also troubled by the upcoming war with the Feathered Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, the Galaxy Star Lord overwhelmed five eighth-level invincible aliens."</p><p></p><p>"He repelled three and killed two, earning a resounding reputation."</p><p></p><p>The third eighth-level invincible evolutionary being slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"So my suggestion is..."</p><p></p><p>This eighth-level invincible evolutionary being looked around, "Go and invite the Galaxy Star Lord to come, no matter what price we have to pay."</p>

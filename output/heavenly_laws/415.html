        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The true body of the Venerable One was seated presiding over the Heavenly Azure World headquarters, while his two principal spirit souls were separately exploring. </p><p></p><p>This was the safest method.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Sun Spirit Soul or the Moon Spirit Soul, their combat strength was not much weaker than Lin Yuan's true body.</p><p></p><p>Even if they fell, the true Venerable body could condense them with a thought.</p><p></p><p>Nothing could be more secure.</p><p></p><p>Although the levels of the boundless void were not as high as the main universe, </p><p>Lin Yuan had never underestimated them. At least the legendary ninth stage demon gods could pose a slight threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Swish. </p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze,</p><p>The Sun Spirit Soul and Moon Spirit Soul immediately left the Heavenly Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"...The Void Secret Realm?" Following the coordinates in the scroll, Lin Yuan's Sun Spirit Soul rapidly headed towards the location of the Void Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's mastery over space-time, it would take the Black Demon Pavilion Master five or six days to fly to the entrance of that Void Secret Realm from the Heavenly Azure World, but Lin Yuan only needed half a stick of incense.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Secret Realm, even the memories of entering the secret realm are obscured and cannot be passed on externally. What kind of place is it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization of the main universe could also do such things, but the human civilization had nine peerless experts presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what benefits can be obtained from killing void creatures?"</p><p></p><p>The information in the scroll did not mention any benefits, but Lin Yuan speculated that there must be some.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the physical bodies of the void creatures themselves, or some kind of material treasure?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most normal speculation. Just as Lin Yuan could study the physical bodies of demon gods he killed, the physical bodies of void creatures could similarly be studied.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p>Lin Yuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Here it is."</p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the boundless void in front of him.</p><p></p><p>But from the outside, the void here looked no different from the void elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on the token scroll, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed a mysterious space hidden deep within the void.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was the entrance to that mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the entrance to the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even without relying on the token scroll, Lin Yuan could detect the existence of the Void Secret Realm with his own space-time comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But the more so, the heavier Lin Yuan's heart became.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the vastness of the Void Secret Realm was almost an infinite void space layer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the "entrance" in front of him was just one of the many entrances to the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Profound Yellow Secret Realm of the main world, this Void Secret Realm probably had many entrances.</p><p></p><p>"If I didn't have this token scroll, I couldn't enter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, "Probably only those at the fifth level of space-time fusion rules could forcibly enter the Void Secret Realm without relying on tokens."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was inwardly amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Then what level of attainment in space-time fusion rules did the existence that opened up this secret realm have? The sixth level? The peerless realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not dare underestimate it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Although many secret realms were naturally formed, since this Void Secret Realm allowed direct entry by relying on tokens, there must have been artificial factors involved.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately activated the scroll, and instantly a suction force surged out from the depths of the void, pulling him inside.</p><p></p><p>If it were his true body, Lin Yuan naturally would not dare so easily enter an unknown secret realm. But with just his Sun Spirit Soul, he could try and experiment as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p>Lin Yuan arrived in a vast space.</p><p></p><p>He could not see the end in any direction, with black mist occasionally floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Void Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very cautious and immediately hid within layers of nested spaces.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Void Secret Realm, it was like another boundless void, with many layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the void creatures?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around but did not find any signs of living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Let's explore slowly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to carefully select a direction and venture deeper.</p><p></p><p>...The Void Secret Realm was too vast. Although Lin Yuan could traverse long light-years in a single step when traveling, he naturally had to search bit by bit to look for void creatures. Otherwise, if he crossed long light-years and there were void creatures in between, he would miss them.</p><p></p><p>One month after Lin Yuan's Sun Spirit Soul entered the Void Secret Realm,</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was moving rapidly, but from the outside it did not seem to cause any disturbance.</p><p></p><p>And tens of thousands of miles away, under a black mountain peak, there was an enormous creature staring at the flying Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body was hiding within layers of nested spaces, but this enormous creature could clearly sense the aura of those nested space layers and lock onto Lin Yuan's position.</p><p></p><p>The enormous creature slowly approached Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is that a void creature?"</p><p></p><p>While maintaining his movement, Lin Yuan had naturally already noticed the enormous creature approaching him.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's perception, even without actively extending his world shadow, it was like observing the lines on his palm within tens of billions of miles - there was no possibility of being ambushed.</p><p></p><p>"But it is markedly different from the demon gods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The void creature he sensed felt no different from a wild beast, with not a shred of intelligence, only instinctively approaching and concealing its aura.</p><p></p><p>Whereas demon gods, although occasionally going into frenzies, at least possessed intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the enormous creature had approached within a hundred miles of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The next instant,</p><p>That enormous creature stopped and no longer...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Drawing near.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not immediately attack, but wanted to see what abilities this void creature had.  </p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>An illusory world descended, instantly enveloping Lin Yuan's spiritual will within layers of illusions.</p><p></p><p>The scene before Lin Yuan's eyes was no longer the void secret realm, but inside an imperial palace, with alluring beauties approaching, trying to seduce Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"An illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was unfazed. With his abilities, even without borrowing any spirit defense treasures, he could easily dispel these illusions.</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mental intent transformed into a sharp blade, easily tearing apart the illusory world before him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the void creature was about to approach, intending to attack while Lin Yuan was dispelling the illusion.  </p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan regained clarity too quickly. Before the void creature could draw near again, the so-called illusion had already ended.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just illusory abilities, then let it be."</p><p></p><p>Confirming that this void creature posed no threat to his strength, Lin Yuan directly attacked.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous boom.</p><p></p><p>Vast world forces surged forth, space itself subtly twisting. Before the void creature could react, it fell into Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>This void creature was at least tens of miles large, but under the suppression of space, it had become palm-sized, struggling incessantly in Lin Yuan's grip.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Unable to search its soul? No specific memory scenes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to search its soul but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>The thought processes of these void creatures were as chaotic as beasts', unable to even store specific memories.</p><p></p><p>"Just kill it then."</p><p></p><p>After investigating for a while with no gains, Lin Yuan decided to directly kill this void creature according to the information in the manual.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>At the moment this void creature died,</p><p></p><p>Its physical body suddenly</p><p></p><p>began to dissipate into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Once dead, the physical body dissipated? It didn't even leave the body for him? Then what was the benefit of killing void creatures? Before Lin Yuan could ponder further, the completely dissipated void creature scattered into wisps of energy that merged into Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to activate his world forces to expel these unknown energies - he could not absorb them before confirming their uses no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But even his world forces could not touch those wisps of energy.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>Those wisps of energy disappeared within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Eh?" Lin Yuan seemed to sense something. "My spiritual will has increased by a bit, because of this void creature?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few ways to increase spiritual will:</p><p></p><p>One was through the slow accumulation over a vast span of time.</p><p></p><p>The other was by enduring various tortures and suffering.</p><p></p><p>For example, when Lin Yuan comprehended that fragment from an almighty being's body, enduring the omnipresent pressure on his spiritual will, his own spiritual will had slowly increased.</p><p></p><p>But this method of increasing spiritual will became weaker as Lin Yuan's spiritual will grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Yet now? Lin Yuan was astonished to discover that after killing this void creature, his spiritual will had actually increased by a bit.</p><p></p><p>This was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The importance of spiritual will needs no explanation.</p><p></p><p>It is the core of the soul. The stronger one's spiritual will, the greater the enhancement to all aspects.</p><p></p><p>And to break through to the ultimate realm, a powerful spiritual will is required. Without meeting the benchmark, one cannot withstand the backlash from the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly,</p><p></p><p>Compared to physical treasures,</p><p></p><p>Increases in spiritual will could be directly brought back to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's main body traversing and descending was his spiritual will. When ending the traversal and returning to the main universe, what went back was also his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>And in this period, if his spiritual will gained increases, he could naturally bring them back in full.</p><p></p><p>...In the Tiancai World, deep within the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The originally meditating Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual will has indeed increased."</p><p></p><p>A hint of shock appeared on Lin Yuan's face. With the wealth of information from human civilization in the main universe, he naturally knew just how difficult it was to increase spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>According to the experiences summarized by human civilization, one of the hurdles for eleventh step experts breaking through to the ultimate realm was having a spiritual will index reaching ten million.</p><p></p><p>This was the threshold. The higher one's spiritual will, the greater the aid in breaking through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan was somewhat worried about how to improve his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Compared to special lifeforms like the Four Divine Kings, Lin Yuan's biggest flaw was being too young, with too little time experienced, resulting in his spiritual will lagging behind.</p><p></p><p>"A great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"That void secret realm is a great opportunity for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze burned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The main task for my Solar Primordial Spirit in the void secret realm is to seek out more void creatures, then kill them to increase my spiritual will."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately made his decision.</p><p></p><p>His true self would comprehend the "World" divine technique imprint, comprehend the rules of space-time fusion, comprehend various other fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>As for the two Primordial Spirits...the Solar Spirit would focus fully on seeking void creatures.</p><p></p><p>The Lunar Spirit would search the boundless void for worlds, while also comprehending rules and so on.</p><p></p><p>Thus, time flowed swiftly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three hundred years passed.</p>

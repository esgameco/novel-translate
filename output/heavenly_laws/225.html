            <p>Chapter 225: The End of the Road (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord had mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>It should have been a joyous occasion for him that his eldest disciple had entered the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was his first Eighth Stage disciple.</p><p></p><p>But people tend to compare.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Eighth Stage, the eldest disciple's inner world reached a size of 230 li in diameter. </p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan's inner world which exceeded 100,000 li in diameter...</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was currently only at the Seventh Stage. Once he entered the Eighth Stage, his inner world would experience an explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them would only widen further.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the elated expression on his eldest disciple's face,</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord couldn't help but sigh inwardly. </p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes ignorance is bliss.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too complacent. The path beyond the Eighth Stage is not an easy one. You need to collect various cosmic treasures and comprehend more laws to perfect your inner world."</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord spoke.</p><p></p><p>As someone who had been there before, an invincible existence at the Eighth Stage, the Vermilion Roc Star Lord was fully qualified to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Even among those at the Eighth Stage, the differences were vast. For example, for the Vermilion Roc Star Lord, killing an ordinary Eighth Stage expert was not much harder than slicing vegetables.</p><p></p><p>On many medium-sized alien battlefields, when the Vermilion Roc Star Lord revealed his true form, blotting out the sky, he simply needed to open his mouth and lightly inhale, and countless alien experts would be devoured.</p><p></p><p>Another example was that invincible Eighth Stage expert from the Dark Abyss race 1 million years ago, Dark Abyss Qingyu.</p><p></p><p>With just a single soul attack, he pierced through the many defenses of the Eighth Stage evolutioner Ou Yin, nearly shattering even his Eighth Stage soul defense treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Ou Yin still could not escape the fate of death.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master's heart trembled and his thoughts immediately sobered up.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, for the entire human civilization and the myriad races in the cosmic space, reaching the Eighth Stage only meant having the qualifications to stand on the stage.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Peak Master was far from being comparable to Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>He still hoped that this disciple of his could go further on the path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Which star domain do you plan to preside over?"</p><p></p><p>"Preside over which star domain..."</p><p></p><p>Below, Lin Yuan and many Star Lords heard this and all looked towards the eldest senior brother.</p><p></p><p>In the Human Civilization Alliance, evolutioners below the Eighth Stage were actually protected and sheltered.</p><p></p><p>There were basically no mandatory missions or orders. Even going to alien battlefields required the evolutioners to voluntarily apply.</p><p></p><p>As long as evolutioners below the Eighth Stage did not actively cause trouble or violate the laws of human civilization, they could live very comfortably. </p><p></p><p>This seemed ordinary, but in reality, among the other alien races in the cosmic space, the weak had to be enslaved and driven. Where was the freedom? Let alone comfort?</p><p></p><p>But all this only applied to those below the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Once an evolutioner reached the Eighth Stage, they needed to fulfill obligations for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, it meant choosing a star domain and going there to preside over it as a Star Lord for 500 years.</p><p></p><p>After 500 years, the Eighth Stage evolutioner could choose to continue presiding or step down.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, below the Eighth Stage, evolutioners were protected, while at the Eighth Stage, it was the evolutioners protecting other citizens.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I haven't decided yet."</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master said.</p><p></p><p>Before attempting to break through to the Eighth Stage, the Great Peak Master didn't even know if he could successfully enter the Eighth Stage. If he died under the Heart Demon Tribulation, no matter how much he thought about it, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"No worries, take your time to consider."</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Roc Star Lord just asked casually. Presiding over a star domain and serving as a local Star Lord, although it was the duty of an Eighth Stage evolutioner,</p><p></p><p>It wasn't something that had to be done immediately. There was still a buffer period.</p><p></p><p>After the Vermilion Roc Star Lord reminded him of a few things,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the others left one after another.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Peak Masters of the Vermilion Roc Lineage gathered at the First Peak.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, eldest senior brother, while you were in seclusion attempting to break through to the Eighth Stage, the supreme experts of human civilization took out that corpse of an extraterrestrial lifeform obtained from a large battlefield."</p><p></p><p>The third senior brother spoke about the events that happened recently, emphasizing the partial corpse of that extraterrestrial supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>"I'm aware of this matter too."</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother nodded. As long as his consciousness connected to the virtual world, he could understand the gist of it.</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts didn't intend to conceal this matter either, because this partial corpse would eventually be open to most human evolutioners.</p><p></p><p>The other few apex races that obtained parts of the corpse would do the same. The major apex races were all competing, competing for the only evolutionary path leading to the supreme level.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher told me that the evolutionary paths contained within that partial corpse are very strange, and in recent years, those evolutioners who comprehended the evolutionary paths have not been progressing smoothly in their cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"So I plan not to comprehend that partial corpse."</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Whether to comprehend that partial corpse was entirely up to the evolutioners to decide. It's just that when an opportunity at the supreme level was placed in front of them, very few evolutioners would refuse.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother's family knew his own situation best. He had just broken through to the Eighth Stage and needed a lot of time to stabilize his realm.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there was absolutely no need to go comprehend a corpse of unknown origin.</p><p></p><p>For the eldest senior brother, stabilizing his own realm was the most important. By the time his realm was stabilized, many genius evolutioners would have already invested themselves in it. Competing with these geniuses who took the first step basically had no hope.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the eldest senior brother directly chose to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan inwardly nodded.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension ability, he constantly comprehended the many evolutionary paths within that partial corpse and increasingly realized that almost all the evolutionary paths he perceived had problems to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother was steady and did not participate in it, so at least he would not be affected by that partial remnant corpse.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still sat at the top of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the many mountain peaks in this virtual world were still filled with evolutioners.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, nearly 99% of the evolutioners had been replaced. Most of the evolutioners had just entered not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed that partial corpse under the sky, his mind and will constantly suppressed, while also comprehending the evolutionary paths contained within that partial corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have already perceived 2,837 evolutionary paths and thoroughly analyzed and comprehended these evolutionary paths, integrating them into myself."</p><p></p><p>"But compared to the myriad evolutionary paths within this partial corpse, this is just a drop in the bucket."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly. High-level evolutioners indeed cultivated many evolutionary paths simultaneously, but the owner of this corpse cultivated too many.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, these evolutionary paths are all very deviant."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, especially that mental pressure that compelled evolutioners to quickly choose a certain evolutionary path to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>It was like a prescription. No one knew what effects the medicinal soup brewed from this prescription would have.</p><p></p><p>To figure it out, one had to drink the medicinal soup. But Lin Yuan had no intention of drinking the medicinal soup at all. He was only comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The medicine formula naturally wouldn't have any problems.</p><p></p><p>"The 2,837th Path of Evolution"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he comprehended another path of evolution from that corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill everything. All living things can be killed."</p><p></p><p>The moment he comprehended this path of evolution, Lin Yuan felt an overwhelming killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a desire arose in his heart, wanting to immediately devote himself to cultivating this path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped his comprehension, suppressing the oppressive force on his mind and will. The killing intent lingering in his ears gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>"If other cultivators were to comprehend this path of evolution, they would probably start cultivating it immediately, right? They would then be influenced by the immense killing intent within, and their true bodies in the outside world would likely turn into madmen who only know how to kill."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. This wasn't the first time he had encountered this. Previously, on several occasions, the paths of evolution he had comprehended began to influence him even before he started cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Lin Yuan set a restriction for himself. Once his body in the virtual world began cultivating, he would directly force a disconnection and return his consciousness to his real body.</p><p></p><p>This way, at least the influence would be severed.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, continue."</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Lin Yuan began to analyze this path of evolution focused on slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Not far from Lin Yuan, Gao Wufeng was also sitting cross-legged in comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the paths of evolution contained within the corpse, as long as one simultaneously observed and comprehended that corpse beneath the vast sky, the speed of cultivation could be terrifyingly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gao Wufeng continued his cultivation, his mind and consciousness began to silently sink.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>But he received no response.</p><p></p><p>In all directions, there was only a vast whiteness.</p><p></p><p>At first, Gao Wufeng didn't act rashly out of caution.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed - a hundred years, two hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years...</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's expression gradually turned mad. In this vast white space, there were no fluctuations of rules at all, making it impossible to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng could only watch as time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>After twenty thousand years, Gao Wufeng completely lost control and went berserk, frantically attacking in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Although many cultivators could spend decades or centuries in seclusion, that was when they were immersed in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the fluctuations of rules, experiencing the great Dao of heaven and earth, they would be engrossed in it, and time would pass quickly.</p><p></p><p>But in the vast white space Gao Wufeng was in, there were no fluctuations of rules at all, and he couldn't enter a state of sleep. He could only watch helplessly as time passed.</p><p></p><p>Being able to endure for twenty thousand years was already a result of Gao Wufeng's extremely strong mind and will.</p><p></p><p>If it were other cultivators, they probably would have gone mad before ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Another fifty thousand years passed.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Who am I? My name is Gao Wufeng? I come from human civilization, but where are the other humans besides me? I remember I had a teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the trial. I remember I was comprehending that corpse, but how did I end up here?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's mind was anxious.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred thousand years, Gao Wufeng looked up at the sky, still seeing only a vast whiteness.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's eyes instantly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>His mind and will began to dissipate. This kind of dissipation was done actively, meaning Gao Wufeng did it himself, having lost the motivation to live on.</p><p></p><p>For Gao Wufeng, he had experienced hundreds of thousands of years in the white world.</p><p></p><p>But in the outside world, only a few breaths had passed.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's body began to collapse, and his mind and will also started to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately noticed the change and stopped his observation, looking towards Gao Wufeng.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't far from Gao Wufeng and discovered the abnormality at the first moment.</p><p></p><p>"Did his cultivation fail? He didn't make it through this time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. Last time, when facing his inner demons, Gao Wufeng had forcefully overcome them, leading to a rapid advancement in his cultivation afterward.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed he had encountered a similar predicament with his inner demons and couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Lin Yuan had already seen many such situations. Some cultivators would suddenly have their bodies collapse and their consciousness dissipate while cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if it affected their real bodies in the outside world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. If it was only the collapse of the body in the virtual world, it wouldn't be a big problem as long as the real body and soul in the real world were fine.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Zuo Qiuguang walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao nearly went on a killing spree in the Nine Swords Star Domain. If it weren't for the timely intervention of the Nine Swords Star Lord, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang said directly. She had a good relationship with Gao Wufeng and usually kept in contact. After Gao Wufeng's incident, she immediately went to check on the situation in the Nine Swords Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao's mind and will must have had a problem. Fortunately, with the timely suppression by the Nine Swords Star Lord and the use of some cosmic treasures that heal the mind, there shouldn't be major issues later on."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang's tone carried a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>Just yesterday, Gao Wufeng was discussing insights with her and seemed completely normal. But today, it was as if he had gone mad. If the Nine Swords Star Lord hadn't stopped him in time, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"This corpse..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang looked up at the corpse beneath the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>At first, she thought it was a great opportunity, a hope for her to become a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, Zuo Qiuguang witnessed with her own eyes as one genius after another walked towards a dead end, many of whom were not much inferior to her, yet still couldn't endure it.</p><p></p><p>"This corpse has a big problem. It's definitely not as simple as comprehending paths of evolution..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang muttered to herself, "I might not be able to persist anymore either. Thirteenth Peak Master, sometimes I quite envy you for not rashly cultivating the comprehended paths of evolution. Now, even if I don't want to cultivate, it's difficult."</p><p></p><p>Once a path of evolution contained within the corpse was chosen for cultivation, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>Unless one didn't enter this virtual world, as long as they continued to observe that corpse, the path of evolution within their body would automatically be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Can't persist anymore?" Lin Yuan looked at Zuo Qiuguang.</p><p></p><p>"Although I haven't gone mad now, the more I cultivate, the more I occasionally fall into some illusions, sometimes without even realizing it myself," Zuo Qiuguang said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she didn't consider these as problems until she saw Gao Wufeng, who had nearly gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang was very worried that one day she would become like Gao Wufeng.</p><p></p><p>"Then you should indeed stop."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. According to Zuo Qiuguang's description, if she continued cultivating, she would likely develop serious problems, not much better than Gao Wufeng.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite funny when you think about it."</p><p></p><p>"Originally, among the three of us, Brother Gao and I were both in high spirits, full of ambition, determined to obtain that supreme path of evolution. In the end, both of us have left, while you, Thirteenth Peak Master, have persisted until now."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang sighed, and her figure disappeared as she left the virtual world.</p>

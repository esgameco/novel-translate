        <h1>Chapter 462</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 462 - First Arrival in the Immortal Realm (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm, the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heaven Immortal Domain is one of the thirty-three immortal domains, with vast and boundless territory, bordering the Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Within the immortal domain, there are many immortals who constantly battle the countless demonic beasts from the depths of the Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>A flash of teleportation light flashed by in an instant, faintly permeated with a bloody aura, evidently a blood teleportation technique that consumed one's primordial essence.</p><p></p><p>Within the teleportation light was a young man, his face deathly pale and his breath weak. The man's name was Gao Wuyou, who had recently explored a relic site with his good friend.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they obtained a great opportunity, as the relic site was left behind by a Jade Immortal, containing treasures of the Jade Immortal level. However, that good friend, in order to monopolize the opportunity from the relic site, had ambushed and severely injured Gao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Through sheer willpower, Gao Wuyou managed to escape, but was still being pursued by his friend.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Gao Wuyou, you have been infected by the Demonic Marrow Poison. Unless a Golden Immortal intervenes, you are doomed to die. Why bother struggling?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wu, if you want the gains from the relic site, you can just say so directly. Why do this?"</p><p></p><p>"Say it directly? Can you give me what I want? This is a treasure left behind by a Jade Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wu, you have helped me many times. Between us, is there anything we can't discuss?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I only trust myself. Discuss? Too much trouble. As long as you die, won't all the treasures be mine?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Wuyou was constantly burning his own spiritual essence, his mind flashing back to the conversation with "Brother Wu" during the pursuit, and for a moment, he felt utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>He had truly treated Wu as a close relative, and on the cultivation path, he had been quite lonely. Wu, as a guide, held a very special position.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, for an opportunity from a Jade Immortal, which Wu did not even know the specifics of, he unhesitatingly resorted to cruelty against Gao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Although Gao Wuyou had long known that on the cultivation path, there was always deception and one must always keep a trump card, he still could not believe that Wu would do this to him.</p><p></p><p>"Well then."</p><p></p><p>"Consider it repaying the kindness of these years."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wuyou's consciousness gradually sank into darkness. Severely injured, and with the Demonic Marrow Poison, he could not hold on much longer.</p><p></p><p>He burned his spiritual essence to escape, only wanting to find out why Wu had turned against him.</p><p></p><p>With Gao Wuyou's strength, he could have easily tried to destroy the Jade Immortal's opportunity before his death, at least attempting to destroy the part that contained the inherited cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, Gao Wuyou did not do so. Since Wu wanted this opportunity, then let him have it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gao Wuyou's will was about to completely plunge into darkness, a brand new consciousness quietly awakened.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wuyou's expression suddenly became calm, and he glanced around the environment, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly absorbed Gao Wuyou's memories, understanding the current situation - his closest "brother" was pursuing him, and he also had a death wish.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Immortal's opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned, and after absorbing Gao Wuyou's memories, he naturally understood the level of this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation system of the Immortal Realm is connected to the Divine Continent and the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is divided into - Refining Qi, Foundation Establishment, Cinnabar Formation, Nascent Soul, Spirit Transformation, Void Refinement, Dao Attainment, Tribulation Crossing, Great Perfection, Golden Immortal, Jade Immortal, and Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Tribulation Crossing stage corresponds to the eighth level of the main universe, Great Perfection to the ninth level, Golden Immortal to the tenth level, Jade Immortal to the eleventh level, and Dao Ancestor to the twelfth and ultimate level of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the correspondence of these realms is only a rough estimate. Due to the differences in cultivation systems, even at the same level, the combat power can vary, but the overall gap will not be too large.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wuyou was a wandering cultivator in the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Domain, at the Tribulation Crossing realm, while Brother Wu was at the peak of the Tribulation Crossing realm. They had known each other since the Nascent Soul realm and had advanced together to the Tribulation Crossing realm.</p><p></p><p>"Now, what is my situation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed as he felt the current state of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The severe injuries were not a problem, as with Lin Yuan's revived spiritual will, a single thought could suppress the worsening of the injuries. With Lin Yuan's control over the physical body, as long as he had time, no matter what injuries, he could recover. Once he re-engraved the divine imprint "Dripping Blood Resurrection" onto this physical body, it could be considered an immortal body.</p><p></p><p>But the Demonic Marrow Poison?</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Marrow Poison came from the unfathomable Demonic Abyss, and for cultivators of the Dao, it was a rare poison that suppressed their spiritual power and soul.</p><p></p><p>During the poisoning period, it was like having one's marrow extracted and bones stripped, an excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Marrow Poison that Lin Yuan had contracted was at the Tribulation Crossing level, and only a Golden Immortal could hope to detoxify it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was for cultivators of the Dao. Lin Yuan was not within that scope.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Demonic Marrow Poison in his body.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Your understanding of this unknown poison has rapidly improved.]</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan prioritized resolving the Demonic Marrow Poison was that he had sensed that this deadly toxin could have an irreversible impact on the physical body and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Although this irreversibility was not absolute for Lin Yuan, it was still a nuisance, so it was best to resolve it as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>In the high space behind Lin Yuan, Brother Wu, whose name was Wu Xiangyan, was quickly traversing the space, his vast spiritual sense faintly locking onto the fleeing Gao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"The blood teleportation technique consumes primordial essence, and with the Demonic Marrow Poison, Gao Wuyou won't be able to hold on for long," Wu Xiangyan thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>He and Gao Wuyou had indeed been extremely close, but so what? Could that compare to the importance of his own cultivation path?</p><p></p><p>After entering the Tribulation Crossing realm, Wu Xiangyan had become increasingly aware that relying solely on his own talent, it was basically impossible for him to break through to the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>To advance further, he needed to rely on external opportunities.</p><p></p><p>So in recent years, he had been frantically exploring the nearby relics, and to ensure his own safety, he had also brought Gao Wuyou along.</p><p></p><p>In Wu Xiangyan's eyes, Gao Wuyou was just a pawn, who could be sacrificed when necessary. </p><p></p><p>"I'm not wrong in doing this. To become strong, one must be cold and ruthless. Even if it's a close relative, in the face of an opportunity, they can be sacrificed, let alone a friend or fellow cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Only by treating cultivation as one's everything, with absolute sincerity, can one ultimately achieve great accomplishments!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan's thoughts turned, and his heart immediately burned with passion.</p><p></p><p>The relic site they had explored this time had actually yielded an opportunity of the Jade Immortal level.</p><p></p><p>A Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Domain, that was a lofty and exalted figure. A single drop of a Jade Immortal's legacy would be enough to propel him to break through to the Great Perfection, or even the Golden Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, at the time, Gao Wuyou was closer to the Jade Immortal's opportunity, so he was the first to take it."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan felt a bit helpless. The Jade Immortal's opportunity had fallen into Gao Wuyou's hands, so he could only act preemptively, otherwise, what if Gao Wuyou escaped with the Jade Immortal's opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wuyou must die."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan secretly thought. This was not only because Gao Wuyou had taken the Jade Immortal's opportunity, but even if he hadn't, Wu Xiangyan still wouldn't let him go.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortal's opportunity, how extraordinary was it?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only I knowing is safe.</p><p></p><p>If one more person knows, there is one more risk of leakage.</p><p></p><p>If the matter of the Jade Immortal opportunity is revealed, it will attract a large number of Mahayana and even Golden Immortal cultivators. In that case, I won't be able to keep the Jade Immortal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>for the sake of security,</p><p></p><p>all the people who know about the Jade Immortal opportunity must die, except for myself.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I obtain the Jade Immortal opportunity, I will go to the Cangwu Immortal City to cultivate in seclusion, and I absolutely will not go out before breaking through to the Mahayana realm," Wu Xiangyan thought to himself, already formulating a series of plans for himself.</p><p></p><p>[Your spiritual perception is extraordinary, observing the unknown toxicity, thoroughly mastering this kind of toxicity.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanwei maintained the Blood Escape Technique, and after merely observing the toxicity in his body for over a dozen breaths, he had already thoroughly mastered the Demonic Marrow Poison.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly master it means to completely understand this type of toxicity, and also means that he can easily detoxify it.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Marrow Poison is indeed terrifying, but Lin Yuan's realm is too high - at the peak of the 11th level, he can even be said to be infinitely close to the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Marrow Poison at the Tribulation Transcendence level, in Lin Yuan's eyes, is not only completely revealed, but also not much different.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the Demonic Marrow Poison was not a unique and deadly poison in the immortal world, and was just an ordinary 8th level toxicity, Lin Yuan could have instantly grasped and mastered it.</p><p></p><p>"Detoxifying the Demonic Marrow Poison is very simple."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped observing and began to circulate his own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of many immortals in the immortal world, the only way to detoxify the Demonic Marrow Poison is to forcibly resolve it with a higher level of immortal dao foundation.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Demonic Marrow Poison at the Tribulation Transcendence level requires the immortal dao foundation at the Golden Immortal level to suppress and erase it.</p><p></p><p>But after thoroughly grasping and comprehending this type of toxicity, Lin Yuan can neutralize this toxicity from the most microscopic level without any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's control, countless qi and blood began to constantly condense and interweave, merging with the Demonic Marrow Poison that was deeply rooted in the flesh and soul.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, all the Demonic Marrow Poison began to transform, forming a rich life force, and began to heal Lin Yuan's bodily injuries.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Marrow Poison is a deadly toxin, but it is also a great tonic. As long as it can be thoroughly transformed, it can be directly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"It's solved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, and after comprehending the Demonic Marrow Poison, a single thought completely resolved the deadly poison that permeated the depths of his flesh and soul.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that with the degree of Demonic Marrow Poison in Gao Wuyou's original body, even if there were Golden Immortals willing to expend their foundation to save him, it would still require hundreds or even thousands of years of cultivation to recover.</p><p></p><p>Let alone having a Golden Immortal expend their foundation to save a mere Tribulation Transcendence cultivator? Even for a close relative, they might not necessarily do it.</p><p></p><p>Consuming foundation will cause a drop in strength, which is very dangerous for any Golden Immortal, and they may even be attacked by enemies taking advantage of the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Has Gao Wuyou stopped?"</p><p></p><p>In the sky behind, the pursuing Wu Xiangyan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Because in his spiritual sense lock, he found that the Gao Wuyou who was fleeing with the Blood Escape Technique had actually dispersed the fleeing light and stopped in place.</p><p></p><p>"It's because he has reached his limit."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan knew this in his heart. In his estimation, Gao Wuyou could probably only persist for this long, with the consumption of the Blood Escape Technique, his severely injured state, and the torment of the Demonic Marrow Poison.</p><p></p><p>That Gao Wuyou could hold out until now already shows his unwavering will and solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Jade Immortal opportunity is not too damaged."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan thought to himself. He also expected that before Gao Wuyou died, he would try his best to destroy the Jade Immortal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Those Jade Immortal level treasures and immortal artifacts, Gao Wuyou definitely cannot harm, but the jade slips recording the cultivation methods and inheritances, may not be so indestructible.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Xiangyan felt that even the most fragile jade slips, as left behind by a Jade Immortal, should not be so easily destroyed, right?</p><p></p><p>Especially in Gao Wuyou's current state, how much strength could he have to destroy them?</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan also stopped, gazing into the distance at Gao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wuyou? Why didn't you run away?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan carefully observed Gao Wuyou, although he had determined that Gao Wuyou was now at the end of his rope, he still could not be careless.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortal opportunity was right in front of him, and the path to openness was right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan did not want to stumble at the last hurdle.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wuyou, do you have any last words now?" Wu Xiangyan looked at Gao Wuyou, and a strange feeling began to emerge in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but the Gao Wuyou in front of him had a sense of unfamiliarity, as if he was no longer the Gao Wuyou he knew.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, just attack directly."</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan felt a little panicked, and still decided to use his strongest killing move to send Gao Wuyou on his way.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he still wanted to savor the feeling of the victor looking down, but now Gao Wuyou's unfamiliarity made him tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Five Elements Cycle."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the power of the Five Elements rules of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth began to circulate.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Five Elements is a fundamental rule, but when the Five Elements are combined, they can approach the pillar-level rules.</p><p></p><p>It was relying on his comprehension of the Five Elements rules that Wu Xiangyan possessed the peak Tribulation Transcendence realm. In fact, Wu Xiangyan vaguely sensed that if he could follow the path of the Five Elements, he might not necessarily lack the opportunity to break through to the Mahayana realm.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a faint possibility, and the time consumed was unknown, so Wu Xiangyan ultimately chose to place his hopes on external opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan diverted a thread of his mind and glanced at Wu Xiangyan.</p><p></p><p>He had just placed most of his mind on his physical body, constantly adjusting various forces through his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, Gao Wuyou's physical body was really too bad, with many forces unable to coordinate, not a problem of physical strength, but a problem of perfection.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest ordinary physical body, as long as the various forces are coordinated as one, can be considered perfect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the stronger the physical body, the greater the forces it contains, and the more difficult it is to coordinate.</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of Wu Xiangyan, whom the original body regarded as a close friend, and let out a light sigh. The space-time in all directions began to solidify, and all the rules, including the Five Elements rules, began to shatter.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of pillar-level fusion rule comprehensions at the 7th level, as well as mid-6th level space-time fusion rule comprehensions.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Lin Yuan, even though he had just descended and had not yet fully adjusted his physical body, to have enough self-defense power. At least, even if faced with Jade Immortal pursuit, he could easily escape with his mastery of space-time.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Xiangyan, a peak Tribulation Transcendence cultivator? He was no different from an ant.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiangyan's pupils suddenly shrank. In his vision, the Five Elements rules he had comprehended seemed to have completely disappeared, and in an instant, not only the Five Elements rules, but the fluctuations of all other rules had also disappeared, as if he had come to a place where there were no rules at all.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>A great fear surged in Wu Xiangyan's heart. Although he did not know the reason for all this, or what it had to do with Gao Wuyou, he unhesitatingly fled far away.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 602</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Immeasurable Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Rivers Chaotic Continent, the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The surrounding void domains have been quite turbulent recently," a few deputy pavilion masters whispered in discussion.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilion is spread across numerous void domains, but only the Pavilion Master is directly appointed by the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>As for the deputy pavilion masters? Normally, most of the Myriad Dao Pavilion's affairs are handled by the deputy pavilion masters, while the Pavilion Master only deals with the uncertain paths of cultivation, and communication with the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, many Venerable Ones have been passing by the vicinity."</p><p></p><p>One of the deputy pavilion masters sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Rivers Chaotic Continent was opened up by the Venerable One of the Myriad Rivers, but aside from him, it is rare to see other Chaotic Venerable Ones for millions or even tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>But recently, numerous Chaotic Venerable Ones have been rushing over from the surrounding void domains.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Posterior Heavenly Universe was opened up by an extraordinary existence, which is why it has attracted so many Venerable Ones."</p><p></p><p>The deputy pavilion masters exchanged information, as they had access to a lot of intelligence and reports due to their affiliation with the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the gathering of so many Venerable Ones, I would have wanted to take a look myself." Another Venerable One spoke up, his tone slightly curious.</p><p></p><p>As deputy pavilion masters of the Myriad Dao Pavilion, they were only Sovereign Realm beings, and did not dare to approach the vicinity of the Primordial Universe. That place was gathering numerous Venerable Ones, and Sovereign Realm beings were far too fragile compared to the Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just Venerable Ones rushing there." At this moment, the Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He had been listening to the deputy pavilion masters' discussion all along, and now finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Not just Venerable Ones?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy pavilion masters felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the deputy pavilion masters, the Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion received direct orders from the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws, and had access to more information and intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Several Great Saints have also rushed over there," the Pavilion Master said.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saints have gone there?" </p><p></p><p>The deputy pavilion masters swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>A void domain would typically have a few Venerable Ones guarding it, but Great Saints? It was rare to find even one Great Saint in hundreds or thousands of void domains.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you believe it?" </p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master glanced at the deputy pavilion masters, about to speak further.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He immediately stood up and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to the Pavilion Master?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy pavilion masters looked at each other, not knowing what had occurred.</p><p></p><p>The inner sanctum of the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Time and space slowly turned, and a stable spatial-temporal passage formed.</p><p></p><p>A young man walked out from within.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a massive eye coalesced, hovering over the young man. "Silver River, you have arrived."</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion stood respectfully beside him, carefully observing the young man who had emerged from the spatial-temporal passage.</p><p></p><p>For the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws to personally welcome him, this young man had to be at least a Great Saint realm existence.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this young man before them was a Chaotic Great Saint? And judging from the All-Seeing Eye's attitude, this young man did not seem to be an ordinary Chaotic Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. The moment he stepped out of the spatial-temporal passage, he felt the distance between himself and the divine soul he had left behind in the Star Tear Fragment World had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will not see you off." </p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws looked at Lin Yuan, then quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Great One." </p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion immediately stepped forward, respectfully saying, "This way is the exit."</p><p></p><p>For a 'guest' that the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had personally welcomed, the Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion dared not be negligent in the slightest. Just because the All-Seeing Eye did not see Lin Yuan off did not mean he could ignore Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In truth, with his mastery of spatial-temporal techniques, he could forcefully break free from this space-time. But there was no need for that, as the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had just brought him here, so it was polite to go along.</p><p></p><p>Soon, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived at the exit of the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the Myriad Rivers Chaotic Continent, right?" Lin Yuan casually said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's figure disappeared outside the Myriad Dao Pavilion,</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Myriad Dao Pavilion heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Saint, which Great Saint could he be? Silver River? I've never heard of that before." The Pavilion Master's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't think too much about it. The Chaotic Void was boundless, and while Chaotic Great Saints were extremely rare in any given void domain, there were still a few of them overall.</p><p></p><p>As a mere deputy pavilion master, not recognizing this Great Saint was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master."</p><p></p><p>When the Pavilion Master returned, the several deputy pavilion masters looked at him curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master had suddenly disappeared just now, and his expression still showed traces of change, piquing the curiosity of the deputy pavilion masters.</p><p></p><p>"Where was I?" </p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master glanced at the deputy pavilion masters.</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion Master just said that Great Saints have also rushed over there."</p><p></p><p>One of the deputy pavilion masters immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master nodded, not elaborating further. He had just personally welcomed a Great Saint, but this was a secret of the Myriad Dao Pavilion. Even if the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had not instructed him, he dared not spread it outside.</p><p></p><p>"The Immeasurable Void Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped out, leaving the Myriad Rivers Chaotic Continent and entering the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Universe is in that direction."</p><p></p><p>Even without specific spatial-temporal coordinates,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the Yiyun Void Domain, Lin Yuan could feel the changes in the beast skin map, with its radiance becoming increasingly intense. If Lin Yuan had not suppressed it in time, it would have directly resonated with the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"There are at least more than thirty Chaos Venerable Ones gathered there."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed from afar, and with his mastery of time and space, the aura of the Chaos Venerable Ones could not be hidden from him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? There are also Chaos Great Saints? Is it the Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix, the two Chaos Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to sense, and his expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Chaos Venerable One, Gu Ming, had not mentioned these two Great Saints when talking to him about the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>This is not surprising, as normal Chaos Venerable Ones can at most sense the aura of the posterior universe, but whether they can detect the presence of Chaos Great Saints or identify their identities is not certain.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I have a deep connection with these two Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was filled with surprise. His home universe was destroyed due to the fierce battle between these two Great Saints, and now the Xuanhuang Universe has emerged, also encountering these two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>However, back then, compared to these two Great Saints, Lin Yuan was like a firefly in front of the bright moon, and the aftershocks of their battle had already exhausted him.</p><p></p><p>But now? Lin Yuan did not dare to say he surpassed them by much, but at least he was not weaker than these two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the emergence of the Xuanhuang Universe is also because of these two Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his heart, "In addition to the Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix, there are two other Great Saints who have also arrived."</p><p></p><p>His mastery of time and space had reached the eighth realm, which belonged to the domain of the Great Saints, so he could detect the aura of the Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered the desolate void and saw that corner of the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Through this corner of the universe, Lin Yuan could vaguely sense the immeasurable vastness of the entire Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they are all guarding the outside, it turns out they are waiting for the surrounding space-time of the Xuanhuang Universe to collapse on its own." Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Universe had experienced too many years.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far superior to the naturally born universes nurtured by the Chaos Void in terms of size and scale, it lacked the indestructible and regenerative characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Lacking its master's maintenance, coupled with the erosion of time, the space-time of the Xuanhuang Universe was slowly collapsing.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Xuanhuang Universe's active emergence was ostensibly due to the impact of the Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix Great Saints, but in reality, it was an inevitability.</p><p></p><p>When the space-time reached a certain degree of collapse, it would reveal itself even without external forces.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a dying camel is still bigger than a horse, and even the gradually collapsing Xuanhuang Universe was not something that could be easily shattered and entered by a few Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint had also tried to forcibly enter, but not only did they fail, the resulting spatial disturbance also attracted a large number of Venerable Ones and several Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"At most two years, the surrounding space-time will be completely collapsed, and then we can enter." Lin Yuan observed for a while and came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly enter before the collapse? It would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and it might even provoke the backlash of the Xuanhuang Universe's primal essence.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the Yin Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint immediately stopped after launching a joint attack.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just wait then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually hid in a certain space-time layer, devoting a thread of his consciousness to sensing the collapse of the Xuanhuang Universe's space-time, while focusing the rest of his energy on cultivating and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>During the waiting period, no powerful experts would make a move. Beings who had cultivated to the Chaos Realm, who would not be cautious when they see a rabbit without shooting an eagle? With the Xuanhuang Universe's gate not yet open, they would not attack each other.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was naturally the same. His time was precious, and the more time he had to cultivate, the stronger he would become, and the more means he would have to deal with his opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it." The Yin Demon Great Saint merged into the space-time, coldly gazing at the constantly arriving Chaos Venerable Ones, as well as the two other Chaos Great Saints besides him and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"This posterior universe was the first one I discovered."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Demon Great Saint was extremely unwilling. If he had known that attacking the exposed corner of the universe would cause such a huge reaction, he would never have done it.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was too late to say anything.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Xuanhuang Universe's emergence had been completely leaked.</p><p></p><p>It could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Demon Great Saint was not worried about the Chaos Venerable Ones who had rushed over to grab the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>What he feared were the Chaos Great Saints of the same level. As time passed, more and more Chaos Great Saints would arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Demon." The Nine Phoenix Great Saint's attention was mostly focused on the Yin Demon Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>If they could enter the Xuanhuang Universe this time, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint's primary target would be the exploration and cognitive insights about the Thirteen Realms left behind by the creator of this posterior universe.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it would be to make the Yin Demon Great Saint pay a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Two years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>During these two years, five more Chaos Great Saints had arrived.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was extremely rare to encounter even one Chaos Great Saint in thousands or tens of thousands of void domains.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this time, the Xuanhuang Universe had only emerged for a few years, and it had already gathered nine Chaos Great Saints. Most of the Chaos Great Saints had arrived through special means, paying a great price.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Two years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The corner of the Xuanhuang Universe had finally reached the final stage of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan also temporarily stopped his cultivation and observed from afar.</p><p></p><p>Just as the outer edge of the Xuanhuang Universe was about to completely collapse,</p><p></p><p>the aura from within began to flow out, and Lin Yuan's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Because the beast skin map he possessed had undergone another transformation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

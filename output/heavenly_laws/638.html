        <h1>Chapter 638</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm definitely interested," said Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For a Celestial Sovereign, exploring and developing a newly born precious land, especially a top-tier one, is an opportunity that is hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the six great ancient nations control only a few hundred top-tier precious lands in total.</p><p></p><p>And these hundreds of top-tier precious lands are the result of accumulation over a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Celestial Sovereigns may not have even experienced the birth of a top-tier precious land from the time they were born to when they broke through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Haha," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation showed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>As an emperor, he needs to weigh the forces on all sides. But when it comes to real benefits, he will definitely prioritize his own people.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was the first to meet Lin Yuan, suppressing the other Celestial Sovereigns waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>"However, although I have the right to decide who can represent the ancient nation to participate in the competition, you still need to display some strength later on."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation looked at Lin Yuan, "Otherwise, the other Celestial Sovereigns may not be satisfied."</p><p></p><p>"That's understandable," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in the competition for a newly born precious land, any participating Celestial Sovereign can gain rewards. But the one who seizes the precious land will gain the most.</p><p></p><p>If the inclusion of a quota leads to the failure in the final competition for the precious land, losing to other ancient nations, even the emperor may not be able to suppress the backlash.</p><p></p><p>Factional struggles must be placed behind the interests of the ancient nation - this is the rule of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation looked at Lin Yuan, his expression somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He could feel Lin Yuan's confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, the strength of Celestial Sovereigns participating in the competition for a precious land must at least reach the threshold of Peerless Celestial Sovereigns. Do you have the confidence?" The Emperor's tone was slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had excavated his ancestral bloodline to an unprecedented Celestial Sovereign level. According to the potential of the ancestral bloodline, his growth to the limit would be slightly stronger than a Peerless Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite is reaching the limit.</p><p></p><p>Just like the core imperial clan at the Venerable Sovereign realm, if they haven't grown to the limit, they can't be called unrivaled Venerable Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"I will do my best," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Celestial Sovereigns of the six great ancient nations are equivalent to the supreme great saints of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>And before Lin Yuan's comprehension of the spatial-temporal rules breakthrough to the Ninth Realm, he could already contend slightly with the supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>After his spatial-temporal comprehension reached the Ninth Realm, and he continued to ponder the Thirteen Realms Celestial Void Cauldron, as well as the comprehension of the Scorching Sun and Dark Yin in this source world, Lin Yuan's true strength would be far stronger than when he fought against the Chaotic Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Just do your best," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation nodded. "I'll let those Celestial Sovereigns come in, and announce to the outside that I'm adding you to the competition quota for the precious land."</p><p></p><p>"If the other Celestial Sovereigns have major objections, I'll select one Peerless Celestial Sovereign to spar with you."</p><p></p><p>"You just need to hold on for a while, and prove that you have the strength at the Peerless Celestial Sovereign level, and there won't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>In the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation, the imperial clan can certainly obtain resource inclination, but the prerequisite is that they cannot be too weak, otherwise it would be a waste of resources.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll let them come in," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation glanced outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>Soon, powerful auras entered, all of them were the Celestial Sovereigns of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation. Many of them had been in seclusion for many years, but now they emerged due to the birth of a new top-tier precious land.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor," the Celestial Sovereigns slightly bowed, showing respect, their gazes intentionally or unintentionally falling on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River?" </p><p></p><p>"Is he the imperial clan member who has excavated his bloodline to the Celestial Sovereign level?"</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor met him first, so the twelve quotas are probably already allocated, with one for him."</p><p></p><p>Many Celestial Sovereigns stared at Lin Yuan, their thoughts fluctuating. There were only twelve quotas to participate in the competition for the precious land, and Lin Yuan occupied one, which meant they had one less.</p><p></p><p>"Let me introduce," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun smiled, "This is Silver River, the first core imperial clan member who has reached the Celestial Sovereign level in our Scorching Sun Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>After the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation introduced Lin Yuan, they began to introduce the other Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need to introduce them, as with the reputation of Celestial Sovereigns, Lin Yuan could at least sense their auras and know which Celestial Sovereign they were.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were more than thirty Celestial Sovereigns standing in the hall, of which twenty had the strength of Peerless Celestial Sovereigns, and the remaining more than ten also had strength close to that of Peerless Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this doesn't mean that the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation has more Peerless Celestial Sovereigns than ordinary Celestial Sovereigns, but rather that the Celestial Sovereigns present here are only a part, the most elite part.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded at each of the Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Among the Celestial Sovereigns present, the three most powerful ones were recognized as Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign, Eternal Sun Celestial Sovereign, and Vast Scorching Celestial Sovereign. These three Celestial Sovereigns were all Peerless Celestial Sovereigns, and the paths of their evolved Chaotic force were extremely powerful, shaking the six great ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't beat around the bush," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation looked at the many Celestial Sovereigns, "This time the appearance of a top-tier precious land, our Scorching Sun Ancient Nation will have twelve quotas to participate in the competition. As for the other eleven quotas, I don't care, but Silver River must occupy one."</p><p></p><p>"Do any of you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation said directly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereigns looked at each other, inevitably looking towards Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign, Eternal Sun Celestial Sovereign, and Vast Scorching Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's request was not unreasonable, just one out of the twelve quotas. They had even thought that more imperial clan members would be arranged to participate.</p><p></p><p>Among the imperial clan, there were also Celestial Sovereign-level powerhouses, but the Celestial Sovereigns here referred to those who had comprehended the path of Chaotic force evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Inappropriate," Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Sovereign's potential is indeed worth cultivating," Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan, "but the competition for a top-tier precious land relies on strength. Every participating Celestial Sovereign must not be a drag."</p><p></p><p>"I can promise that if we seize this top-tier precious land, we can give Silver River Celestial Sovereign more of the precious land and its rare treasures. But for the competition itself, he still needs to prove his strength."</p><p></p><p>Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign finally looked at the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation, "I hope the Emperor will prioritize the interests of the ancient nation."</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation nodded, then looked at Lin Yuan, "Silver River, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had just expressed uncertainty about his strength, the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation would have definitely refused Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign's request with various reasons.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go with what Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign said," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Celestial Sovereigns in the hall were stunned.</p><p></p><p>He agreed so easily? Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign also looked at Lin Yuan a little more.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought the Emperor would find some excuse to fend him off.</p><p></p><p>But this Silver River Celestial Sovereign was so confident.</p><p></p><p>Although Silver River Celestial Sovereign had previously left a mark against Extreme Cold Celestial Sovereign and North Yin Celestial Sovereign, that was in the Black Jade Nest, with the spatial-temporal transmission array connecting the capital just nearby.</p><p></p><p>Whether Lin Yuan's true strength was stronger than when he fought against the Chaotic Celestial Sovereign, remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those two Celestial Sovereigns relied not only on their strength, but also on the deterrence of the various Celestial Sovereigns of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>If the two Celestial Sovereigns had no reservations and fought to the death, it's not that they would definitely be able to defeat Lin Yuan, but at least they could retreat unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"My request is not high, I just want the Silver River Celestial Sovereign to be able to withstand the Red Lotus for a hundred breaths."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign said, the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign was an experienced Peak Celestial Sovereign, and to withstand the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign for a hundred breaths, one would need the strength of a Peak Celestial Sovereign at least.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to witness the strength of the Peak Celestial Sovereigns of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, which was different from the Peerless Great Saints of the Chaotic Void, as the Chaotic Evolution Dao of the Peak Celestial Sovereigns had reached the third level.</p><p></p><p>"Then the sparring between the Silver River and the Red Lotus will be set in the Celestial Sovereign-level spatial realm of the imperial capital."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country said.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Celestial Sovereign-level spatial realm was a stable spatial realm opened up by the power of the Scorching Sun imperial capital, capable of withstanding the clashes of Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>The sparring between Peak Celestial Sovereigns, if unleashed without restraint, could devastate an entire domain. So in order to minimize the impact, they must spar in the corresponding spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>In a spatial realm with extremely stable rules.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a series of figures appeared, which were the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country and the ancient Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign stood in the center of the spatial realm, facing each other from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign, the Chaotic Evolution Dao you have cultivated is the 'Red Lotus Hellfire', this kind of flame is extremely terrifying, almost able to ignore most defenses and directly burn the soul and flesh."</p><p></p><p>Information about this Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign flashed in Lin Yuan's mind. On a certain ancient battlefield, the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign had, with his own power, burned six Celestial Sovereigns of the enemy ancient country to nothingness, thus establishing his reputation as a Peak Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Sovereign." The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan from afar, "When it comes to the contention for a first-grade treasure land, I will not hold back."</p><p></p><p>If it were just a regular sparring, the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign would certainly take the imperial family's face into consideration, but now the sparring was related to the Celestial Sovereign's quota for the upcoming first-grade treasure land contention.</p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign did not want to be hindered by Lin Yuan in the future when contending for the first-grade treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"I will not hold back either." Lin Yuan's expression was also solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign nodded, and his mind slightly moved: "Burn."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Red flames like lotus flowers began to burn on Lin Yuan's physical body and spirit. This kind of flame was formless and intangible, impossible to block.</p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign watched Lin Yuan silently.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Red Lotus Hellfire, ordinary Celestial Sovereigns could not withstand it for long.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Silver River Celestial Sovereign admits defeat, I will immediately withdraw the Red Lotus Hellfire."</p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign thought to himself, Lin Yuan was not an enemy, so he naturally had no intention of seriously injuring him.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Red Lotus Hellfire?" Lin Yuan felt his physical body, spirit, and even the universe within him burning under the red lotus flames.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't even notice when this flame appeared, his surrounding spatial realm didn't even detect the burning, it just started burning in his physical body, spirit, and inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's just like scratching an itch." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Red Lotus Hellfire was mysterious, to burn Lin Yuan's physical body, spirit, and inner universe to the point of threatening his foundation, it would probably have to burn continuously for millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's foundation was too solid, his inner universe was calculated in billions of light-years, even if he opened it up to let the Red Lotus Hellfire burn, it would not pose any threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Even the burned foundation would recover faster than it was consumed.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign's methods are indeed extraordinary." Lin Yuan said with a slightly admiring tone.</p><p></p><p>Although the power was not great, this kind of suddenly appearing mysterious ability surprised Lin Yuan. If it was not the Red Lotus Hellfire but a method that could truly threaten him, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign saw that Lin Yuan was not showing any discomfort under the burning of the Red Lotus Hellfire, but was calmly conversing with him. He was somewhat astonished.</p><p></p><p>Other Celestial Sovereigns, when faced with the silent appearance of the Red Lotus Hellfire, would either try their best to dispel it or start to retreat, but Lin Yuan just let the Red Lotus Hellfire burn?</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Sovereign, are you not concerned about the burning of the Red Lotus Hellfire?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the observing Celestial Sovereigns all changed. Even the strongest Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign, Eternal Sun Celestial Sovereign, and Broad Scorching Celestial Sovereign found the Red Lotus Hellfire's mysterious method quite troublesome to dispel.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care about the burning of the Red Lotus Hellfire.</p><p></p><p>"How solid must this Silver River Celestial Sovereign's foundation be, to be able to not care about the Red Lotus Hellfire?" Scarlet Flame Celestial Sovereign thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had looked down on Lin Yuan quite a bit, thinking that no matter how strong the core imperial clan Celestial Sovereign was, they would still be suppressed by the Peak Celestial Sovereigns like them before reaching their limit.</p><p></p><p>"Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign, it's my turn now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly, raised his right hand, using spatial awareness as a sword and the power of his inner universe as the source, and slashed towards the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spatial awareness had reached the ninth level, which was not particularly outstanding among the Peak Celestial Sovereigns, but the power of his inner universe had greatly amplified the power of this move.</p><p></p><p>It was like the same knife, with the same material and sharpness, but one was driven by a hundred pounds of force, while the other was driven by a hundred tons of force. The difference in power was heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was like this, his solid foundation allowed any of his moves to have the effect of brute force overpowering skill.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign's pupils contracted, Lin Yuan's spatial sword slashed through layer after layer of spatial realms towards him.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign couldn't dodge in time, and his right hand was cut by this spatial sword.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign's entire body transformed into a cluster of red lotus hellfire, and finally reformed his figure. He looked down at his right hand, and a faint sword mark appeared, the overwhelming spatial power within it was eroding his physical body and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This move is not from the Chaotic Evolution Dao, but why is the power so great?" The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign couldn't believe it, the regular application of spatial fusion rules had resulted in such unfathomable power.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the ancestral bloodline of the Celestial Sovereign level?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan solemnly, the same level of rule awareness, but Lin Yuan's power far exceeded his, it could only be that he was borrowing the power of the Celestial Sovereign level ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"He blocked it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign, "It seems he is not that easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"Scorching Sun."</p><p></p><p>Two suns emerged in the depths of Lin Yuan's eyes, and his physical body also transformed into a scorching sun, the surrounding spatial realms were distorted and became a world of scorching suns under the illumination.</p><p></p><p>"Slash, slash, slash!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated the divine ability 'World', and in an instant, he slashed out three hundred and thirty-three spatial swords.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and thirty-three spatial swords composed entirely of spatial power but containing overwhelming power, slashed towards the distant Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign who was suppressing the remaining spatial power in his right hand.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Lotus Celestial Sovereign was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

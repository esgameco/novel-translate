        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 478 Lin Yuan and the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's spatial-temporal comprehension reached the Seventh Realm, as long as he was still within the range of his own spatial-temporal perception, he could condense his avatar at any location.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Realm of spatial-temporal comprehension allowed Lin Yuan's thoughts to reach and arrive instantly.</p><p></p><p>This "instant" still required some time, but it was exceptionally brief.</p><p></p><p>However, the Seventh Realm of spatial-temporal comprehension allowed Lin Yuan to achieve simultaneous arrival.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly far more powerful than the Sixth Realm, as the Sixth Realm's traversal still required crossing a specific distance. There might be obstructions in between, such as certain spatial-temporal dangerous areas that could not be crossed through spatial-temporal teleportation.</p><p></p><p>But the Seventh Realm was different - no matter how many dangerous labyrinths lay in between, as long as it was still within the range of Lin Yuan's spatial-temporal perception, he could directly arrive.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal range Lin Yuan could currently perceive was roughly equivalent to dozens of Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realms were vast and boundless, equivalent to one percent of the main universe's territory. Dozens of Immortal Realms were already equivalent to nearly half of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if he returned to the main universe, with just a thought, Lin Yuan could appear at any location within the majority of the main universe's territory.</p><p></p><p>Even if he used the two Great Primal Spirits as "aiming points", stationed at key nodes of the main universe, he would be able to instantly appear at any location within the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The only drawback was that only his avatar would descend, not his true body.</p><p></p><p>But with Lin Yuan's current level of rule comprehension and mental willpower, even just an avatar could display combat power far surpassing Demon Monarch-level beings. And if necessary, he could use the avatar as a coordinate to have his true self descend.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Lin Yuan was in the process of guiding many martial dao cultivators from the Spirit Realm through spatial-temporal passages into the Immortal Realm, when he sensed the Abyss of Demons Sovereign's observation.</p><p></p><p>So he decided to come and meet the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if the Abyss of Demons Sovereign had not observed him, Lin Yuan had planned to come and meet this Tenth Realm existence, the Sovereign of the Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of Demons Ancestor's expression was grave as he carefully observed the figure of Lin Yuan before him, realizing that the one he was conversing with was not actually present in this space-time, but rather a projection, an image.</p><p></p><p>"I have never heard of you before," the Abyss of Demons Ancestor said with a puzzled tone.</p><p></p><p>Although he spent most of his time in slumber, given Lin Yuan's strength, he should have left traces in the distant past. Yet the Abyss of Demons Ancestor had never heard of the title "Ancestor of the Martial Dao".</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if you haven't heard of me yet, just remember me from now on," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, over the past few centuries, with the push of the Yin Primal Spirit, the Martial Dao had also been spreading. But the movements were too small, not even most of the forces in the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm had heard of it, let alone the lofty Abyss of Demons Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of Demons Ancestor fell silent for a moment, then asked, "May I know why the Ancestor of the Martial Dao has come this time?"</p><p></p><p>"There are indeed two matters," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This was the main purpose of his descent to meet the Abyss of Demons Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Please go on," the Abyss of Demons Ancestor looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his realm, no one had ever dared to make requests of him like this.</p><p></p><p>But the spatial-temporal attainments Lin Yuan had displayed had instilled great pressure in the Abyss of Demons Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Since I am the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, I naturally walk the path of the Martial Dao and have also cultivated some disciples and followers. In the future, they will be walking in the Immortal Realm," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Abyss of Demons Ancestor will not target my weak disciples and followers, nor actively suppress and exterminate the Martial Dao cultivation system," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>For the Martial Dao cultivation system to exist and thrive in the Immortal Realm in the long run, in addition to needing a foundation of propagation at the grassroots level, the attitude of existences like the Abyss of Demons Ancestor was even more crucial.</p><p></p><p>If the Abyss of Demons Ancestor detested the Martial Dao cultivation system, even if one day it spread throughout the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, it would still be doomed to perish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was based on the premise that Lin Yuan would not intervene himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao cultivation system," the Abyss of Demons Ancestor's gaze was deep as he pondered for a long time before saying, "I will not take action."</p><p></p><p>Given his status and strength, even if Lin Yuan had not said this, he would not have bothered to target the weak.</p><p></p><p>In the past Immortal-Demon Wars, it was the casual conjurations of demonic beasts by the Abyss of Demons Ancestor that had caused the chaos, but the Abyss of Demons Ancestor himself had never taken direct action.</p><p></p><p>"The other matter," Lin Yuan smiled slightly as he continued, "I've heard that the Source Land of the Immortal Realm contains the manifestation of the most fundamental rules of the Immortal Realm, so I plan to go and take a look at the Source Land of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Abyss of Demons Ancestor's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"I do not understand the intention of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao. The Source Land of the Immortal Realm is not the Abyss of Demons," the Abyss of Demons Ancestor made it clear that the Source Land of the Immortal Realm was the domain of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, and Lin Yuan should go ask the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao instead.</p><p></p><p>"Haha," Lin Yuan laughed, "The immortals of the Immortal Realm, as well as the demonic beasts of the Abyss of Demons, all believe that the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Abyss of Demons Ancestor are adversaries, and the Immortal-Demon Wars stem from this."</p><p></p><p>"But the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Abyss of Demons Ancestor should share the same consciousness, right? Asking you is no different from asking the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Abyss of Demons Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that the Abyss of Demons Ancestor and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao were vastly different, and even the ultimate Tenth Realm existences in the main universe might not be able to discern that the two were originally one and the same.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Lin Yuan's spatial-temporal comprehension reached the Seventh Realm that he was able to determine, through the clues in the spatial-temporal domain, as well as the spatial-temporal structure of the Immortal Realm and the Abyss of Demons, that the so-called Immortal Realm had always had only one ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Abyss of Demons Ancestor were merely two sides of the same coin.</p><p></p><p>"You've actually figured it out," the Abyss of Demons Ancestor's face betrayed no emotion.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had stated it so clearly, there was no need for him to continue the pretense.</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without reaching the Seventh Realm of spatial-temporal comprehension, Lin Yuan had already harbored suspicions about the Abyss of Demons Ancestor and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, these two ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the beings of the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan came from the main universe where the strongest existed in abundance, and he knew how difficult it was to give birth to a Tenth Realm existence.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the Immortal Realm, there were two Tenth Realm ultimate existences? If it were just that, Lin Yuan would not have thought much of it, as the Immortal Realm's scale was more than capable of accommodating two Tenth Realm existences.</p><p></p><p>But these two Tenth Realm existences walked completely opposite paths, and the immortals and demonic beasts had a subtle sense of complementarity.</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beasts were extremely eager to devour the flesh and blood of immortals, and immortals could also consume demonic qi, but the corrosive nature of demonic qi was high, and immortals who consumed demonic beasts risked being demonized.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the fact that immortals and demonic beasts could complement each other had already sparked many speculations in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts originated from the Abyss of Demons Ancestor, while the immortals followed the Immortal Dao cultivation path passed down by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>The complementarity between demonic beasts and immortals meant that the Abyss of Demons Ancestor and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao were also complementary, the ultimate Tenth Realm existences, each the culmination of their respective evolutionary paths, unique and unparalleled?</p><p></p><p>Complementary?</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There is a possibility that these two Twelfth Realm cultivators have an extremely deep connection, or even that they are the same person.</p><p></p><p>"To enter the Source Land, you must agree to one of my demands," said the Progenitor of the Abyss, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What demand?" Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>If it was not absolutely necessary, Lin Yuan would still be reluctant to get into too much conflict with the Progenitor of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's time in this world was limited. Unless he could resolve the Progenitor of the Abyss once and for all, he still planned to coexist with him as peacefully as possible.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that you have not yet reached the Dao Ancestor Realm," the Progenitor of the Abyss said, "Yet you have such mastery of the Dao of Time and Space, so I wish to spar with you."</p><p></p><p>"Spar?" Lin Yuan nodded, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Abyss wanted to spar with him, likely to figure out the exact nature of Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>Relying on just sensing and observation, the Progenitor of the Abyss could not pinpoint Lin Yuan's exact location, but if he directly attacked, he would likely end up in an all-out confrontation with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So he wanted to probe through sparring.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also very happy to oblige. Up until now, he had never had the chance to engage in direct combat with a Twelfth Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>On the vast battlefields, Lin Yuan had swept aside and crushed countless opponents, but they were all Eleventh Realm cultivators wielding Twelfth Realm weapons.</p><p></p><p>As for Twelfth Realm experts themselves? He had only had a fleeting encounter with the Myriad Transformation Queen of the Insect Clan, but was immediately isolated by the Supremely Strong One of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you wish to spar?" the Progenitor of the Abyss asked.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss was the Progenitor of the Abyss's domain, so his strength would be greatly enhanced there. That's why he asked.</p><p></p><p>Since it was a spar, it meant they were not enemies, so they should try to make it as fair as possible.</p><p></p><p>If they were enemies, the Progenitor of the Abyss would not have hesitated to use any and all advantages, and would not have shown any humility.</p><p></p><p>"Right here," Lin Yuan looked around and said.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?" the Progenitor of the Abyss asked.</p><p></p><p>This Dao Ancestor was so confident to spar on his home turf?</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Although the Progenitor of the Abyss was a Twelfth Realm Ultimatum, he really had no idea about the heights of the Seventh Realm of Time and Space.</p><p></p><p>This was understandable. While the Immortal Realms were barely on the same level as the Main Universe, beyond the Main Universe lay the Chaotic Void, where there were many Twelfth Realm Sovereign and even Twelfth Realm Chaos Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of realms was far inferior to Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>If it was a Twelfth Realm Dao Severing Realm expert from the Chaotic Void who discovered Lin Yuan's Seventh Realm of Time and Space attainment, they wouldn't even have the slightest inclination to spar with him.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Abyss, the vast and empty expanse, Lin Yuan and the Progenitor of the Abyss stood facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"You may strike first," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can be hit by me, you lose."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Abyss's body shrank to around 10 meters, with a deep, dark aura swirling around him, like a black hole constantly devouring the demonic energy all around.</p><p></p><p>"Does this Dao Ancestor really think I can't even touch him?" the Progenitor of the Abyss thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Yes, he indeed could not pinpoint Lin Yuan's exact spatial coordinates.</p><p></p><p>But not being able to pinpoint the exact location does not mean he can't attack.</p><p></p><p>It's like a complex ant nest - the outsider cannot locate the exact position of a single ant inside. </p><p></p><p>But to deal with that ant, the outsider doesn't necessarily need to find its exact location.</p><p></p><p>Just destroy the entire ant nest, and the ant inside will inevitably perish.</p><p></p><p>This was the Progenitor of the Abyss's thinking - since he couldn't lock onto Lin Yuan's position, he would just annihilate all the time and space he could sense.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, sir," the Progenitor of the Abyss raised his hand, and a massive surge of demonic energy began to collapse the surrounding time and space.</p><p></p><p>As a Twelfth Realm existence, every action of the Progenitor of the Abyss could affect the surrounding time and space, like a fish in water casually swishing its tail to create ripples.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying spatial tremors spread out in all directions, enveloping Lin Yuan as the target. Endless demonic energy poured towards him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood still, and all the demonic energy seemed to just pass through him as if he wasn't there, rushing towards the back.</p><p></p><p>Even after being engulfed by the demonic energy, Lin Yuan still stood there, as if nothing had happened at all, apart from the spatial tremors around him.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't have any effect at all?" the Progenitor of the Abyss felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>The attack he just launched was only a probe, specifically targeting the breadth of the time and space.</p><p></p><p>In the Progenitor of the Abyss's view, even if he couldn't harm Lin Yuan, he should at least be able to cause some impact, like slightly lifting Lin Yuan's clothes with the residual ripples.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed...</p><p></p><p>His attack was far, far away from Lin Yuan's true position.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan nodded, evaluating the move.</p><p></p><p>Facing a direct strike from a Twelfth Realm Ultimatum was a rare experience even for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Realm of Time and Space put Lin Yuan in a state of absolute safety, allowing him to observe the Progenitor of the Abyss's attack in great detail.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad?" </p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Abyss took a deep breath, and the entire Abyss began to contract. "Then let's see how you handle this."</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>In all directions.</p><p>Above and below, left and right.</p><p>Many layers of time and space seemed to solidify, with Lin Yuan like an insect trapped in amber. Suddenly, fine cracks appeared at the edges of the time and space.</p><p></p><p>The cracks rapidly spread, branching out and covering everything in sight.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the surrounding time and space shattered like broken glass, revealing vast black spatial rifts - the scenery beyond the Immortal Realms. This attack from the Progenitor of the Abyss had completely pierced through all the spatial layers of the Immortal Realms, creating a huge breach connecting to the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Abyss looked back to Lin Yuan's previous position, only to find him still standing there, completely unaffected by the time and space in a state of great destruction around him.</p><p></p><p>This sight left the Progenitor of the Abyss greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"I've completely penetrated the time and space of the Immortal Realms, yet I still couldn't affect this Dao Ancestor at all?" The Progenitor of the Abyss immediately confirmed one thing, "The time and space that this Dao Ancestor resides in is likely already beyond the Immortal Realms. Even if the Immortal Realms were destroyed, it would not be able to constrain him at all."</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor of the Abyss's last move was much stronger than the previous one," Lin Yuan immediately praised, "It's almost reached me. Progenitor of the Abyss, you should keep trying."</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Progenitor of the Abyss's last attack was still very far from Lin Yuan's actual spatial position, but Lin Yuan had to encourage him a bit.</p><p></p><p>"No need," </p><p></p><p>"I really can't touch the Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Abyss fell silent for a moment, then spoke.</p>

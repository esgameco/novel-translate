        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chaotic energy drifted about.</p><p></p><p>A vast chaotic continent sped along, constantly traversing great distances of space and time, heading towards its predetermined destination.</p><p></p><p>On the chaotic continent, Lin Yuan's gaze was calm as he clearly sensed the distance between himself and his true body rapidly stretching and growing farther.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't reached the twelfth level, with his mental will greatly increased, he likely wouldn't have been able to maintain this avatar body at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension of space-time has already reached the peak of the seventh level. The maximum range of my avatar is thousands or tens of thousands of times what it was before reaching the twelfth level. It's more than enough," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the impact of the impending battle between two Chaotic Great Saints, the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent began migrating after the Thousand Treasures Conference ended.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's avatar stayed behind on the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent, serving as an "anchor" point.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's estimation, after the home universe's great collapse, the new home for human civilization should be near the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, being close to a chaotic continent provided safety without needing to say more.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Venerable Ancient Ming was quite benevolent and had a stable personality. Otherwise, he wouldn't have announced that the original area would soon become a battlefield for two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>After the universe's great collapse, stability would be most important for humanity's new home.</p><p></p><p>Life from within the universe would need a stable environment to adapt after entering the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left the inn and came to the trading area of Mingchuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe, want to come check out our shop? We just got a new batch of goods, specially for enjoyment."</p><p></p><p>"Little Brother Yinhe, what use is enjoyment? With that money, you'd be better off buying a suitable weapon. Our shop has the most weapons."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan walked among them, some twelfth-level Path Breaking realm beings immediately greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just an avatar, Lin Yuan's aura exuded the peak of the Path Breaking realm, which was enough to intimidate the vast majority of Path Breaking realm beings.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, twelfth-level Path Breaking realm beings qualified to roam freely, but those who reached the peak of Path Breaking were few, and Sovereign realm even fewer.</p><p></p><p>As for Chaotic Venerables? They were titans who dominated regions, not something ordinary Path Breaking realm beings could come into contact with.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's avatar had peak Path Breaking realm strength, so naturally many Path Breaking realm beings took the initiative to befriend him. After all, one more friend meant one more path forward.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and greeted people along the way, soon arriving in front of a palace.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe, you're here." A middle-aged man with thick wings came out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wanqu." Lin Yuan walked over. "How is it? Do you have any suitable fragment worlds that I asked for?"</p><p></p><p>Fragment worlds were the "fragment meteorites" surrounding the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent. With a bit of modification, they could become decent dwellings, so they were also called "fragment worlds."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Yinhe, the fragment world you requested needs to be big enough and not emit any radiation. It's not easy to find a suitable one," said the thick-winged middle-aged man, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "fragment meteorites" were formed from the convergence of various materials in the chaotic void, then attracted by the chaotic continent to ultimately orbit around it.</p><p></p><p>The sources of these materials were complex, and many would produce radiation effects.</p><p></p><p>Twelfth-level Path Breaking realm beings could naturally ignore such effects, but what about weaker life forms? For example, eighth or ninth level, or even first or second level beings living long-term under such radiation influence.</p><p></p><p>It was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"That's why I came to Brother Wanqu for help," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wanqu was one of Venerable Ancient Ming's disciples, specifically responsible for the fragment meteorites surrounding the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Since you put it that way, Little Brother Yinhe, I naturally have to handle it properly," Sovereign Wanqu said, looking at Lin Yuan and shaking his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, other Path Breaking realm beings saw Lin Yuan as peak Path Breaking, but powerful figures like Sovereign Wanqu had already determined that Lin Yuan was also a Sovereign level being.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had confirmed that the Lin Yuan before him was not his true body, but just an avatar.</p><p></p><p>An avatar with peak Path Breaking realm aura and strength? There was no doubt that the true body was Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Sovereign Wanqu addressed Lin Yuan as brother. Otherwise, as a disciple of Venerable Ancient Ming, how could Sovereign Wanqu look favorably upon a peak Path Breaking realm being?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there are a few fragment worlds that meet your requirements, Yinhe," said Sovereign Wanqu.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Wanqu raised his hand, and miniature "fragment meteorites" appeared before Lin Yuan. These "fragment meteorites" were "miniature versions" of those orbiting the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"These?" Lin Yuan immediately became interested. "How many chaos stones?"</p><p></p><p>"This fragment world is 180,000 chaos stones, that one is 170,000 chaos stones..." Sovereign Wanqu immediately began introducing them.</p><p></p><p>"Too expensive," Lin Yuan said, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already discussed finding a new home for human civilization with the nine supreme beings. This sum of chaos stones would come from humanity's treasure vault, with a budget between 120,000 to 150,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"Expensive?" Sovereign Wanqu nodded. "Indeed, it's a bit expensive, but these fragment worlds have no radiation effects whatsoever and are most suitable as places for nurturing a race."</p><p></p><p>"If you think it's expensive, I'll look for more options," said Sovereign Wanqu.</p><p></p><p>Even if the deal didn't go through, the friendship remained. Sovereign Wanqu didn't mind at all that Lin Yuan found it expensive.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the trouble, Brother Wanqu," said Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>There was no rush in finding a new home for human civilization. From the start of the main universe's great collapse to its complete destruction, there was still a considerable amount of time. Lin Yuan could completely wait for a more suitable "fragment world."</p><p></p><p>After all, a transaction involving over 100,000 chaos stones would almost empty out human civilization's resources, so naturally, they had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged. The surrounding space-time faintly collapsed, and myriad rules actively retreated, causing the area where Lin Yuan was to completely become a "black hole" without any rules operating.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred years of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes. These three hundred years had allowed him to thoroughly reach the peak of the seventh level in the realm of space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>He was just a hair's breadth away from the eighth level of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his mental will had also improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the greatest improvement was still his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and ninety years ago, Lin Yuan successfully refined the jade gourd and obtained the legacy contained within it â€”</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Void."</p><p></p><p>This legacy was created by a thirteenth-level time being, specifically targeting the foundation of the inner universe. It had seven layers in total.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, upon cultivating to the seventh layer, one's inner universe would evolve into an enormous entity comparable to the chaotic void, at which point it would sweep away everything.</p><p></p><p>However, the seventh layer of "Infinite Void" was only a theoretical realm. Even the creator of the jade gourd, that thirteenth-level time being, hadn't reached it. It was merely conjecture and speculation.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this legacy was incredibly powerful. As long as one completed the first layer and entered "Infinite Void," their inner universe would reach the level of a Chaotic Venerable's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cosmic level.</p><p></p><p>"First layer... completed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the cosmic energy within his body, emanating faint but terrifying fluctuations. After nearly 300 years of cultivation, Lin Yuan had finally completed the first layer of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>"Now your internal universe is no different from the internal universe of those at the Chaos realm," said the red-robed girl who appeared in his internal universe, observing the vast cosmos spanning nearly 20 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>The "Infinite Universe" inheritance had very high requirements for cultivators. Normally, without reaching the Sovereign realm and lacking sufficient foundation, it was very difficult to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Sovereign realm, completing the first layer was not easy and required immense effort and time.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl originally wanted to remind Lin Yuan not to be overconfident, as merely completing the first layer of "Infinite Void" was far from enough to freely traverse the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But then she remembered Lin Yuan was only at the Path-Opening realm, and was left speechless.</p><p></p><p>Completing the first layer of "Infinite Void" at the Path-Opening realm, with an internal universe comparable to those at the Chaos realm? Even with the partial memories imparted by the Jade Gourd's creator, the red-robed girl had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength still falls short compared to true Chaos Venerable beings," Lin Yuan concluded after examining himself.</p><p></p><p>Merely having an internal universe on par with Chaos Venerable beings? Of course he wasn't their equal yet.</p><p></p><p>After all, the abilities of Chaos Venerable beings were not limited to their internal universes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm probably somewhat stronger than that Chaos Dragon Beast from the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent," Lin Yuan judged inwardly.</p><p></p><p>That Chaos Dragon Beast from the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent was a miraculous life form born from the Chaos Void, with diluted Time bloodline flowing through its body.</p><p></p><p>That's why it could nearly match true Chaos Venerable beings despite only being at the peak of the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Dragon Beast reached this level relying on its innate advantages, while Lin Yuan achieved it purely through his own accumulation and foundation.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's true potential far exceeded that of the Chaos Dragon Beast.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Chaos Dragon Beast was already at the peak of the Sovereign realm, while Lin Yuan was only at the peak of the Path-Opening realm.</p><p></p><p>At merely the peak of Path-Opening, he could already surpass that Chaos Dragon Beast. Once he advanced to the Sovereign realm and his strength underwent another transformation, he would likely be considered powerful even among Chaos Venerable beings.</p><p></p><p>"Internal universe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly as he circulated the power of his internal universe, extending it towards the surrounding starry void.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Large swathes of starry sky turned to nothingness, demonstrating power far surpassing the peak of Path-Opening realm.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Universe Origin Consciousness descended, circling around Lin Yuan several times before slowly retreating.</p><p></p><p>"The Universe Origin Consciousness didn't suppress me?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered this, having been prepared to retreat into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm if the Universe Origin Consciousness tried to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, the Universe Origin Consciousness did not suppress him as expected.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because suppressing me would require too great a price?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Universe Origin Consciousness had no personal emotions and acted only for the overall benefit of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe did not allow power exceeding the peak of Path-Opening realm because such power could cause irreparable damage to the universe.</p><p></p><p>Hence this iron rule existed.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? The destruction he just caused far exceeded the peak of Path-Opening realm. When the Universe Origin Consciousness descended and assessed Lin Yuan's true strength, it realized that suppressing the current Lin Yuan would be an extreme challenge even for itself, and would consume an enormous amount of its essence.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it ultimately chose to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Universe Origin Consciousness weighed the pros and cons and concluded that the gains from suppressing Lin Yuan were completely disproportionate to the cost.</p><p></p><p>"Now, as long as I don't directly attack the Universe Origin, I can act unrestrained within this universe," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan also clearly understood that the Universe Origin Consciousness's tolerance towards him was limited.</p><p></p><p>If he exceeded this limit or crossed certain bottom lines, even knowing the terrible price of suppressing Lin Yuan, the Universe Origin Consciousness would still do it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what would happen if I chose to leave the universe now?" Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>Given his current scale, he had absorbed and consumed an unimaginable amount of the universe's energy and resources. If he were to leave and permanently separate from this universe, it would inevitably greatly stimulate the Universe Origin Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated this would be the bottom line for the Universe Origin Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't try," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If he chose to leave the universe now, he would face obstruction and suppression from the Universe Origin Consciousness at its peak strength.</p><p></p><p>But if he waited until after the universe's great destruction to leave, when the Universe Origin Consciousness was about to fall into slumber, the force of obstruction and suppression would be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Plunder Clan Territory.</p><p></p><p>Unknown Land.</p><p></p><p>In front of an ordinary-looking wooden cabin.</p><p></p><p>A Plunder Clan Ultimate walked out of the cabin and suddenly looked in a certain direction, "That is... the aura of power surpassing the peak of Path-Opening realm?"</p><p></p><p>The ordinary-looking wooden cabin was a treasure left behind by the Plunder Clan's ancestral clan. Not only could it survive repeated universal destructions, but it also had the ability to observe various auras within the universe.</p><p></p><p>Just now, two Plunder Clan Ultimates clearly sensed an aura far exceeding the peak of Path-Opening realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's the aura of the Milky Way's supreme being. Has the Milky Way's supreme being unleashed power surpassing the peak of Path-Opening realm?" the Plunder Clan Ultimate inside the cabin asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>The Plunder Clan Ultimate outside the cabin was also perplexed.</p><p></p><p>They had no doubt that the Milky Way's supreme being possessed power surpassing the peak of Path-Opening realm. Even a casually created avatar had strength at the peak of Path-Opening realm, so the true body must have reached the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason for not displaying Sovereign realm combat power was simply due to the universe's suppression.</p><p></p><p>But just now? The Milky Way Star Lord actually revealed Sovereign realm combat power?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Milky Way Star Lord worried about being suppressed by the Universe Origin Consciousness?</p><p></p><p>For beings like them who had survived from the previous universal era to this one, they would be suppressed by the Universe Origin Consciousness as soon as they unleashed power at the peak of Path-Opening realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan, who was born in this universal era, the restrictions were a bit looser, but if he unleashed power surpassing the peak of Path-Opening realm, he would still be suppressed by the Universe Origin Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Being suppressed by the Universe Origin Consciousness was not a pleasant experience.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Universe Origin Consciousness didn't take action? It retreated instead?"</p><p></p><p>Then, the two Plunder Clan Ultimates' eyes widened. Through the cabin's perception, they confirmed that the Universe Origin Consciousness had descended to the area where the Milky Way's supreme being had acted.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, no suppression waves occurred there. The Universe Origin Consciousness ultimately didn't take any action and quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"The Universe Origin Consciousness retreated on its own?"</p><p></p><p>The Plunder Clan Ultimate outside the cabin was shocked, his mind trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 234: Witnessing the Strongest (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu sat there quietly, reading the announcement over and over again. ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà Ôºñ‚ûà—ïƒ§ùî≤œá.‚ìíœÉÁà™ ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë</p><p></p><p>"The 13th Peak Master has entered the 8th stage." This message kept flashing through Feng Yu's mind, and the bitterness in his heart grew more intense.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to when he refused the 13th Peak Master's invitation, Feng Yu vaguely felt a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>If the 13th Peak Master had never invited him to join the 13th Peak, Feng Yu wouldn't have felt this way. Out of so many candidates, only two were favored by the 13th Peak Master in the end.</p><p></p><p>But he was clearly also favored by the 13th Peak Master. If he hadn't refused at that time, he should have been the 13th Peak Master's disciple now.</p><p></p><p>"My choice at that time, based on the situation then, wasn't wrong." Feng Yu calmed himself and began to "review" in his heart.</p><p></p><p>During the Seven Star Cave trial, the 13th Peak Master was only at the 7th stage, while the Great Peak Master was already at the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Even if the 13th Peak Master had the hope of entering the 8th stage, it was just hope. Giving up the illusory hope and choosing the more practical Great Peak Master wasn't wrong.</p><p></p><p>"How could I have imagined that the 13th Peak Master would enter the 8th stage so quickly," Feng Yu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but who in the entire Chi Kun Star Domain and the entire An Nan Star Alliance would have thought that the 13th Peak Master could break through so quickly?</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>"I should have been able to think of it."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Mo Li think of it?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu muttered to himself, "Mo Li is from the Crimson Mark. When he learned that I refused the 13th Peak Master and chose the Great Peak Master, I still remember the surprised look on his face."</p><p></p><p>"Mo Li knew from the beginning that the 13th Peak Master had unlimited potential."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"But even if Mo Li, who comes from a 7th stage power, chose wrong, it wouldn't have much impact. It's different for me. My family needs me to make the most beneficial choice as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"And at that time, the most beneficial choice for me was the Great Peak Master!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there's no such opportunity anymore."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu's mood was low.</p><p></p><p>He understood that he had missed the most important opportunity of his life.</p><p></p><p>That was to join under the 13th Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Even Feng Yu realized that for the 13th Peak Master to enter the 8th stage under a hundred years old, it was no exaggeration to say that his future achievements were limitless.</p><p></p><p>At the 13th Peak.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li and Wu Lan were completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The Peak Master has entered the 8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>"So fast?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Li blinked his eyes. Originally, he felt extremely excited about joining under the 13th Peak Master, precisely because he believed that the 13th Peak Master would sooner or later step into the 8th stage. Quickly embracing this big thigh would definitely bring endless benefits.</p><p></p><p>"8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p></p><p>She just felt that her Peak Master entering the 8th stage was very powerful, not knowing what it meant. In the future, the situation of the surrounding star domains and even the star alliance would change because of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was only at the 3rd stage and had no background. Being able to become a disciple under the 13th Peak Master was purely luck.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it wasn't entirely luck. Being able to achieve a top ten result in the planetary arena competition was also partly due to her own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Fools have fool's luck."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li glanced at Wu Lan. He had tried his best to perform well in the Seven Star Cave trial, with the goal of becoming a disciple under the 13th Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Lan, just an ordinary Silver Mark, was also chosen by the 13th Peak Master, achieving the result he had strived so hard for.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li couldn't help but sigh that sometimes luck was also a very important part.</p><p></p><p>At least for Wu Lan, becoming a disciple under the 13th Peak Master meant that her future status would definitely not be low.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was feeling the changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>"The inner world is more complete."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness appeared in his inner world. When he previously absorbed the three cosmic treasures, his inner world had already been greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>But as Lin Yuan entered the 8th stage, not only did his inner world expand to a radius of 250,000 miles, it also seemed to have fully matured.</p><p></p><p>"The origin of the world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Qing World, Lin Yuan replaced the world's will with his own heart, becoming an existence like the "Heavenly Dao".</p><p></p><p>But compared to now, there was a "qualitative" difference.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan controlled the Tian Qing World, with the emphasis on "control", but now, facing his inner world, Lin Yuan could achieve unity with it.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Solar Primordial Spirit walked out from within him and sat cross-legged face to face with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>"After reaching the 8th stage, even without relying on Yin-Yang Taiji, just by relying on the Solar Rule and Space Rule, a Flame World can be created."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan quickly thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of Yin and Yang into Taiji perfected the power and reduced the difficulty of creating a small world. That's why Lin Yuan was able to create an inner small world at the peak of the 6th stage.</p><p></p><p>And now, Lin Yuan was already at the 8th stage. Over the years, he had continuously comprehended the Solar Rule to an extremely deep level. As such, even if the Solar power was slightly extreme, with a high-level perspective and the expansion of the Space Rule, he could still create a Flame World.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in terms of world stability, a pure Flame World definitely couldn't compare to a Taiji World.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Myriad Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something and immediately immersed his mind into his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He arrived in front of that majestic and grand Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the 8th stage, the Gate of Myriad Realms has become a bit more solid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed. As early as when he entered the 6th stage, Lin Yuan knew that the Gate of Myriad Realms he saw was just a projection of the real Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's level of life, he simply couldn't withstand the real Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>It's just that as Lin Yuan's strength continuously increased and his life continuously transformed, the projection of the Gate of Myriad Realms clearly gradually solidified.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, entering the 8th stage didn't bring any additional functions to the Gate of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a bit disappointed, but he quickly cheered up.</p><p></p><p>The help the Gate of Myriad Realms had brought him now was already great enough.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Gate of Myriad Realms, he would probably still be struggling on Cang Lan Star now. How could he possibly have such a lofty position as he did now?</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level of strength is needed to fully bear the Gate of Myriad Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At least the current 8th stage was far from enough, and the 9th stage was probably also out of reach.</p><p></p><p>He continued observing the Gate of Myriad Realms for a while.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that he hadn't missed anything.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Jade Space?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing a vast and boundless mysterious space, as long as Lin Yuan was willing, with the help of the Demon Jade Mark, he could enter it with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not weaker than the peak of the 8th stage now."</p><p></p><p>"That's only in terms of combat power. My realm is still at the initial 8th stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. To enter the Demon Jade Space, he needed to be at least at the extreme peak of the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan planned to cultivate for a while longer and make more preparations before considering going in.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, the Demon Jade Mark had already condensed. The Demon Jade</p><p></p><p>Space was right there, and there was nowhere to run.</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial arts evolution can finally be perfected."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Previously, he was limited by the Tribulation of the Heart Demon, stuck at the seventh stage realm. Forcibly opening up the eighth stage chapter of martial arts, even with a heaven-defying comprehension, was still twice the work with half the results.</p><p></p><p>So most of Lin Yuan's energy was spent on comprehending the spatial rule model and the many evolutionary paths within that torso.</p><p></p><p>Now there was no such restriction.</p><p></p><p>"The eighth stage chapter of martial arts is extremely important. To be precise, the eighth stage chapters of all evolutionary paths are very important."</p><p></p><p>"The three goddesses of human civilization even consider the ability to open up a stable and complete eighth stage evolutionary path as a prerequisite for becoming a grand scholar of evolution."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Grand scholars of evolution held a special status in human civilization and were the treasures of the entire civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"Opening up the eighth stage chapter of martial arts cannot be rushed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very cautious. This was not only related to the potential of the martial arts evolutionary path, but also to his own potential.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared on the peak of a mountain.</p><p></p><p>"That torso?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the torso located beneath the sky.</p><p></p><p>After entering the eighth stage, Lin Yuan's realm was elevated. At this moment, when he comprehended that torso again, he felt a completely different sensation.</p><p></p><p>At the seventh stage, when Lin Yuan observed that torso, relying on his heaven-defying comprehension, it was like seeing a mountain as a mountain and water as water.</p><p></p><p>Even when Lin Yuan looked from the beginning, at the parts of the body he had already comprehended before, he could still comprehend evolutionary paths that were surprisingly different.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a supreme being?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a torso that has been dead for who knows how many years."</p><p></p><p>"It can give me a feeling of endless benefits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed in his heart. This was still based on his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme beings stand at the ultimate end of a certain supreme evolutionary path. They have comprehended the complete rules of space and the complete rules of time, and they have mastered a certain kind of 'authority'."</p><p></p><p>Going against the flow, bringing people back to life, was just the most common ability of supreme beings. Every supreme being could do it. In other words, as long as one mastered the rules of time and space, they could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>However, reviving creatures that had already died required enduring the backlash of the entire universe. Only supreme beings could easily withstand this kind of backlash.</p><p></p><p>"At my current comprehension speed, comprehending three thousand three hundred and thirty-three evolutionary paths will take at most a few months."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated in his heart that the effect of his heaven-defying comprehension depended on his height.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was just an ordinary person, observing a flower or a blade of grass, he could probably only comprehend ordinary martial arts and the like.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan was a high-level evolutionist, he might be able to comprehend insights related to the rules of life.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, after entering the eighth stage, Lin Yuan's comprehension speed had already risen to a new level.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending three thousand three hundred and thirty-three evolutionary paths can make one an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower. What about six thousand six hundred and sixty-six paths? What about nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what benefits being an ordinary member or core member of the Magic Jade Tower had.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan instinctively felt that the higher the member rank, the greater the benefits to himself.</p><p></p><p>In any case, even without the benefits of member rank promotion, Lin Yuan would continue to come here to comprehend more evolutionary paths to provide nourishment for the eighth stage chapter of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the sky.</p><p></p><p>On a high platform, several figures had their gazes fall on Lin Yuan at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"That's the thirteenth peak master of the Chihu Lineage? He entered the eighth stage not long ago?"</p><p></p><p>"Entering the eighth stage before a hundred years old, that Chihu fellow sure is lucky."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, cultivating to the eighth stage so quickly, could it be that he has other opportunities?"</p><p></p><p>These few figures talked to each other. As high and mighty ninth stage evolutionists, there were very few things that could attract their attention.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already at the eighth stage. Although he was still far from the ninth stage, he was also worthy of their attention.</p><p></p><p>"In this generation of our human civilization, under a hundred thousand years old, only those few descendants of the supreme beings and those few who have obtained special inheritances can compare, right?"</p><p></p><p>One figure said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of supreme beings, carefully nurtured by supreme beings, slept in the origin of space before birth, and were naturally enlightened to the rules of space after birth, and were extremely close to other rules.</p><p></p><p>Like children of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Plus all kinds of opportunities and resources.</p><p></p><p>Even so, in the eyes of these few figures, they could only be on par with Lin Yuan at most.</p><p></p><p>As for the other few people who obtained special inheritances, they were even more irreplicable existences.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>A majestic figure shrouded in gray haze suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Entering the eighth stage under a hundred years old?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>In front of this majestic figure, scenes flashed by.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing the second exploration method of that torso?"</p><p></p><p>This majestic figure had many guesses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Related to foreign forces?</p><p></p><p>Destined one?</p><p></p><p>Guided by the origin of the universe?</p><p></p><p>This majestic figure fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figure's voice shook the surrounding billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"Respected supreme being, what are your orders?"</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came.</p><p></p><p>The majestic figure said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Respected supreme being, this citizen is very important to human civilization. The evolutionary paths he establishes may become new supreme evolutionary paths in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know the limits."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figure curled his lips.</p><p></p><p>Just you, Goddess of Wisdom, know to protect the young talents of humanity?</p><p></p><p>On the main star of Chihu.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finished his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm at the eighth stage, has the mental pressure also risen to the eighth stage level?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The mental pressure from that torso was completely related to the realm and mental strength of the comprehender.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the eighth stage, even ninth stage evolutionists had to endure tremendous mental pressure at all times if they wanted to comprehend that torso.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to walk out of the hall and take a stroll.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Wisdom suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"Respected seventh-level citizen Lin Yuan, someone wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Wants to see me?" Lin Yuan stopped in his tracks, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Goddess of Wisdom relay messages for others. At least a seventh-level citizen like him couldn't order the Goddess of Wisdom to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme being."</p><p></p><p>PS: Let me explain here that I have never written about the specific rank of supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>The ninth stage is not a supreme being, and neither is the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>That vice tower master from before, the protagonist believed he was at least at the ninth stage, at least. Based on the combat power displayed by the vice tower master, shattering a light-year area of the Dark Abyss Secret Realm with just a snap of his fingers, his combat power clearly exceeded the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating.]</p>

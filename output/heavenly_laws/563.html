        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The incarnation returned, and Lin Yuanchen's original body and mind were joyful.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Wandu Pavilion has basically completed the task.</p><p></p><p>The dissemination of various martial dao evolution paths has also found a channel.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Wandu Pavilion, it can be predicted that the various branches of the martial dao evolution path will quickly spread across numerous void domains.</p><p></p><p>The speed and breadth of its dissemination will far exceed that within the universe.</p><p></p><p>"The number of branches opened up in the martial dao evolution path must have shocked that 'Eye of the Myriad Laws'," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao evolution path was a path he had opened up after traversing different dimensional worlds.</p><p></p><p>Its elucidation and encompassing of the essence of power and the essence of rules far surpassed other evolution paths at the same level.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the martial dao evolution path, which is only at the Dao-Establishing Realm, can open up such a large number of branches.</p><p></p><p>Traveling through different dimensions is something that even Thirteen Realms experts may not necessarily be able to do. Even for the great Time Immortals, exploring other dimensions is still in the exploratory stage.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan, with the Gate of the Myriad Worlds, can easily travel back and forth between different dimensional worlds, which is the key reason for him opening up the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"However, that 'Gate of the Myriad Laws' should be truly related to the Thirteen Realms," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he was conversing with the 'Eye of the Myriad Laws', Lin Yuan was also secretly observing the other party.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far from comparable to the majestic aura of the Gate of the Myriad Worlds, it still surpassed that of a normal Chaotic Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, for me, the level is still a bit too high, and I didn't gain any good insights," Lin Yuan felt a bit regretful. If he had conversed with the main body of the 'Eye of the Myriad Laws' instead of just a projection, he might have gained more insights that could have helped him.</p><p></p><p>With just a projection and the huge gap in their levels, Lin Yuan didn't gain much.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Has my incarnation successfully arrived at the Wanxiang Void Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>When he first explored the Chaotic Void, he obtained many treasures left behind by the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang', which was Lin Yuan's "first pot of gold."</p><p></p><p>'Cang Weiyang' didn't make any demands on Lin Yuan, only hoping that in the future, Lin Yuan could go to the Wanxiang Void Domain and take a member of the Stone People Clan as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's current strength, this task would be easy to accomplish, so he had already sent an incarnation to the Wanxiang Void Domain in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxiang Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic qi drifted, coalescing into a figure - Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Finally arrived."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxiang Void Domain and the void domain where the Ancient Ming Continent was located were not too far apart, belonging to neighboring void domains.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it still took Lin Yuan nearly ten years to travel from his departure to arrival.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Lin Yuan's time-space comprehension had already reached the Eighth Realm, and his travel speed was no worse than that of Chaotic Venerable experts.</p><p></p><p>Many newly ascended Chaotic Venerable experts had not yet reached the Eighth Realm in time-space comprehension, and their travel speed was not as fast as Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it is said that even Chaotic Saints and Peerless Saints can hardly traverse every corner of the Chaotic Void," Lin Yuan shook his head, feeling quite pensive.</p><p></p><p>The scale of the Chaotic Void was truly too vast.</p><p></p><p>"The Stone People Clan."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, confirming the direction.</p><p></p><p>The detailed information provided by 'Cang Weiyang' naturally included information about the Wanxiang Void Domain and the Stone People Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void gave birth to countless universes, and it also gave birth to countless life tribes.</p><p></p><p>These life tribes, whether strong or weak, the Stone People Clan was a relatively weak tribe, living in a secret realm.</p><p></p><p>This so-called secret realm was a hidden space naturally derived from the Chaotic Void. In terms of safety, it was certainly not as good as the universe, but for the Stone People Clan, it was already an excellent place, at least the entire clan could live quietly inside.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of "secret realm" meant that the cultivation resources were extremely scarce, which was also the reason why 'Cang Weiyang' left the secret realm and went out to wander alone.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on that "secret realm" could not cultivate a peak Sovereign Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan appeared in front of the secret realm where the Stone People Clan resided.</p><p></p><p>This secret realm was hidden deep within the layers of time and space, and was extremely difficult to detect.</p><p></p><p>But with Lin Yuan's time-space comprehension, it was naturally not a problem, especially since he had the detailed coordinates left by 'Cang Weiyang'.</p><p></p><p>Rustling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped forward and directly entered the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The various barrier obstructions outside the secret realm were as thin as paper to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Quick and decisive."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan planned to randomly select a member of the Stone People Clan and take them as a disciple, bringing them back to human civilization. As for how high this disciple could eventually grow, it would depend on their own destiny.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared in the sky, overlooking this secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm where the Stone People Clan resided was about a few hundred light-years in radius, which could be considered "narrow." Lin Yuan could see through it at a glance.</p><p></p><p>This was quite normal, as the Stone People Clan was not a powerful tribe, and even their strongest were only at the Dao-Establishing Realm, so the secret realm they occupied could not be very good.</p><p></p><p>If it was an extremely vast secret realm, how could it have been occupied by the Stone People Clan?</p><p></p><p>"There are no Stone People Clan members."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down and found the secret realm below to be completely empty, with some areas even having deep pits, showing a sense of ruin.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information from Senior 'Cang Weiyang', the Stone People Clan had over a hundred billion members, although most of them were only at the Fourth or Fifth Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. "But now there's not a single one?"</p><p></p><p>Actually, it's not that there were none at all.</p><p></p><p>In the central area of the secret realm, the region with the most optimal cultivation environment, there were a few auras at the Dao-Establishing Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"It seems some kind of mishap has occurred."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful, and he then disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>In the central area of the secret realm, within a massive building, four majestic figures were sitting cross-legged, all of them having Dao-Establishing Realm auras and casually conversing.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Stone People Clan must have offended the Nine Profound Venerable, and ended up with the entire clan being captured."</p><p></p><p>One of the long-horned majestic figures said.</p><p></p><p>If not for this, the four of them would not have been able to dominate this secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Stone People Clan was not strong, they had nearly ten Dao-Establishing Realm experts, including one at the peak of the Dao-Establishing Realm. Normally, with the Stone People Clan's methods, they would have been able to defend this secret realm easily, and the four of them would not have been able to break in.</p><p></p><p>"How could the Stone People Clan offend the Nine Profound Venerable? And have the Nine Profound Venerable personally order the capture of the entire clan?"</p><p></p><p>Another Dao-Establishing Realm figure was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Venerable was a Chaotic Realm Venerable. In the eyes of such an existence, the so-called Stone People Clan was nothing more than a speck of dust, and they wouldn't even bother to glance at it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, but I heard it was because of a Stone People Clan member who was wandering outside and had some kind of conflict with the Nine Profound Venerable," the third Dao-Establishing Realm figure said, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>A Venerable personally ordering the capture of the entire Stone People Clan had caused a great commotion in the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the reason, in the end, it's to our four brothers' benefit. This secret realm has now fallen into our hands."</p><p></p><p>The fourth Dao-Establishing Realm figure spoke up. For them, this secret realm was a heaven-sent gift.</p><p></p><p>With the entire Stone People Clan taken away, and the many formations within the secret realm still usable, as long as they made some minor adjustments, the four of them would become the masters of this secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as the four Dao-Establishing Realm figures were continuing their conversation, they suddenly felt the surrounding scene change, and a hazy light enveloped the space-time around them.</p><p></p><p>The external aura fluctuations they could previously sense were now completely cut off, and the four Dao-Establishing Realm figures seemed to be in a completely isolated space.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a Time-Space Realm?" The four Dao-Establishing Realm figures trembled.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Time-Space Realm was a realm solely formed by the comprehension of time-space rules.</p><p></p><p>Normally, one would need to reach the peak of the Seventh Realm in time-space comprehension to be able to condense a Time-Space Realm.</p><p></p><p>Within the Time-Space Realm, it was like being in a bubble, completely isolated from the outside world. Unless their time-space rules were close to or surpassed the one who created the realm, it would be difficult for them to escape.</p><p></p><p>The four Dao-Establishing Realm figures, with their time-space comprehension only barely reaching the Sixth Realm, immediately became cautious and fearful upon realizing they were enveloped by a Time-Space Realm. They dared not make any other moves, simply remaining where they were, trembling.</p><p></p><p>"If there is any instruction from an esteemed senior, please feel free to give it. We four brothers will certainly comply," the leading long-horned figure immediately called out.</p><p></p><p>Time-Space Seventh Realm peak comprehension? At least a peak Sovereign Realm expert would have such a technique. This level of existence...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If we wanted to kill them, we would have done it long ago. Why wait until now?" said the stone people. "What exactly happened to the Stone People Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's voice came from all directions, reaching the four towering figures.</p><p></p><p>"The Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The four Transcendent Dao realm figures trembled again in their hearts. A peak Mastery Realm expert was specifically inquiring about the affairs of the Stone People Tribe? Could it be that he had some connection with them? Although the Stone People Tribe was ordered by the Ninth Profound Venerable to be taken away, this secret realm was actively occupied by the four of them. "Venerable, the Ninth Profound Venerable ordered the removal of all the Stone People Tribe, and it has nothing to do with us," the ram-horned figure immediately spoke, fearing that this mysterious expert would involve them.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Profound Venerable?" Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was the latest Chaotic Realm cultivator to emerge in the Myriad Realms Void Domain in the past ten universe cycles.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Realms Void Domain was right next to the void domain where Lin Yuan was located, the two were very close, and Lin Yuan was aware of the major events that had occurred in the Ninth Profound Void Domain in the past few decades.</p><p></p><p>Among them was the newly emerged Venerable, the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Ninth Profound Venerable order the removal of all the Stone People Tribe?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had also secretly overheard the conversation of the four Transcendent Dao realm figures.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know either," the ram-horned figure said with difficulty. "The outside rumors say that a wandering member of the Stone People Tribe had a conflict with the Ninth Profound Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The four figures immediately spilled out everything they knew.</p><p></p><p>Under the shroud of the space-time domain, no one dared to lie or conceal anything.</p><p></p><p>In no time, Lin Yuan learned the full details of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"A wandering member of the Stone People Tribe offended the Ninth Profound Venerable? And then the Ninth Profound Venerable ordered the removal of all the Stone People Tribe?" Lin Yuan felt that there was a big problem with this.</p><p></p><p>With the Ninth Profound Venerable's strength, a mere Stone People Tribe member who offended and angered him could be erased with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>As for taking away all the Stone People Tribe, what was the purpose? In Lin Yuan's view, this action was extremely superfluous, or even completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was a deeper purpose behind it.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy space-time shroud, the four Transcendent Dao realm figures were extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>They had already revealed everything they knew, and whether they could live or not now depended on the mood of that expert.</p><p></p><p>"Give up resistance, I will 'search your souls'," Lin Yuan still planned to 'search the souls' of these four Transcendent Dao realm beings for final confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Although he was already certain that these four Transcendent Dao realm beings had not lied, based on his perception, he still needed to go through the final verification.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the four Transcendent Dao realm figures nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this point, they had no choice but to cooperate. Even if Lin Yuan 'searched their souls' and then killed them, they had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan completed the 'soul search'.</p><p></p><p>It was basically the same as what the four Transcendent Dao realm figures had said.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Profound Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually put the four completely unconscious Transcendent Dao realm beings into his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>Before fully understanding why the Ninth Profound Venerable treated the Stone People Tribe this way, he did not want the news of his arrival to be spread. So before that, these four Transcendent Dao realm beings could only remain in a deep slumber in Lin Yuan's cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the secret realm where the Ninth Profound Venerable resided, and it was countless times more vast than the secret realm of the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Not every Venerable would open a Chaotic Continent, and the Ninth Profound Venerable was a newly emerged Venerable who had become one only ten universe cycles ago. Opening a Chaotic Continent required the expenditure of immense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable did not have that foundation yet.</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the secret realm, in a grand palace.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable," three Mastery Realm experts bowed reverently to the thin, cold-faced old man sitting on the throne in the grand palace.</p><p></p><p>As Chaotic Realm experts, they naturally had a large group of followers, and many Mastery Realm experts were stuck at the peak of the Mastery Realm, unable to take that final step. At this time, the guidance of a Venerable was crucial.</p><p></p><p>"How, is that boy willing to speak?" the Ninth Profound Venerable said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"We have soaked him in the Abyss of Sins, assaulting his mind, spirit, and soul with endless sins and almost unimaginable torment, but..." The three Mastery Realm experts looked at each other, finally speaking in a low voice, "That boy is still unwilling to speak."</p><p></p><p>"Unwilling to speak?" The Ninth Profound Venerable frowned.</p><p></p><p>The 'that boy' referred to was Cang Yulong, from the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Half a universe cycle ago, the Ninth Profound Venerable was roaming the Chaotic Void when he discovered a distorted space-time, and in it, he vaguely saw a mysterious spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable realized at the time that this mysterious spatial realm had a very ancient origin, at least at the level of Chaotic Realm peak or even Saint-Emperor realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he spent half a universe cycle trying to break through the spatial-temporal barrier surrounding the mysterious realm and enter it.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable expended a huge cost, even risking his status as a Venerable, before he could barely approach the mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, a figure suddenly appeared within the mysterious realm. This figure had appeared out of thin air in the mysterious realm, obviously having entered through other means of transportation.</p><p></p><p>Before the Ninth Profound Venerable could take any action, he saw that figure in the mysterious realm activate some power, causing the mysterious realm to instantly vanish.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable had spent half a universe cycle of time, energy, and social capital, only to have someone else reap the rewards at the critical moment?</p><p></p><p>His anger was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Ninth Profound Venerable spent tens of millions of years tracing the karmic connection he had briefly established with that figure, finally locking onto and controlling him.</p><p></p><p>That figure was Cang Yulong.</p><p></p><p>After capturing Cang Yulong, the Ninth Profound Venerable planned to directly 'search his soul' to learn about the mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>But he found that Cang Yulong's sea of consciousness was protected by a mysterious power. If the Ninth Profound Venerable forcibly 'searched his soul', it would cause Cang Yulong's mental consciousness to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if the Ninth Profound Venerable wanted to know the information about the mysterious realm, he could only get Cang Yulong to speak it willingly.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong naturally did not want to speak, so the Ninth Profound Venerable subjected him to endless torment.</p><p></p><p>This Ninth Profound Realm was a natural secret realm nurtured by the Chaotic Void, and it had a wondrous place called the Abyss of Sins, containing endless sins. Any life that even slightly touched the Abyss of Sins would suffer unimaginable pain and torment.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Ninth Profound Venerable had not found a more torturous method than the Abyss of Sins, so he directly immersed Cang Yulong in it.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it had not produced any effect so far.</p><p></p><p>"Does that boy know that his tribesmen are all in my hands?" the Ninth Profound Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, he did not know Cang Yulong's origins.</p><p></p><p>But later, after repeated investigations, for the Ninth Profound Venerable, the only thing he could not forcibly explore was the protected sea of consciousness. As for other aspects, such as the physical body, everything was clearly visible to him.</p><p></p><p>After comparing the physical characteristics, the Ninth Profound Venerable discovered that Cang Yulong was from the Stone People Tribe, so he ordered the capture of all the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"We have already told him," the three Mastery Realm experts nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Tell that boy that for every additional day he refuses to speak, I will slaughter one hundred million Stone People Tribe members and immerse their souls in the Abyss of Sins as well," the Ninth Profound Venerable said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The three Mastery Realm experts trembled inwardly, for they knew the terrifying nature of the Abyss of Sins. To be honest, the fact that Cang Yulong had endured being soaked in it for so long was already incredible.</p><p></p><p>Watching the three Mastery Realm subordinates leave, the Ninth Profound Venerable's gaze once again flashed to the mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a fleeting glimpse, the Ninth Profound Venerable vaguely saw a towering ancient tree standing in the center of the mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>As the tree swayed, endless Chaotic Qi swirled around it.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Tree." A glimmer of desire appeared in the Ninth Profound Venerable's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If the World Tree was a top-tier Rank 11 treasure, then the Chaotic Tree would be a top-tier Rank 12 treasure.</p><p></p><p>And Rank 12 treasures corresponded to the Saint-Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Planting a Chaotic Tree in his cosmic universe would definitely stabilize it by a large margin, and then the Ninth Profound Venerable would be able to reach the Chaotic Realm peak in the shortest time.</p><p></p><p>This was just one use of the Chaotic Tree. As a Rank 12 top-tier treasure, the wondrous uses of the Chaotic Tree were countless.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 563</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the blind woman truly does not exist in this world, but is merely a reappearance of the imagination of the soul.</p><p></p><p>However... how should that night's charm be explained? There was still a lingering doubt in Qi Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze fell on Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qinmiao: "Last time you two said that if I came to the Taixin Domain, you could let me see the original copy of the 'Origin Esoterica'."</p><p></p><p>Under Qi Yuan's gaze, the two of them felt a tightness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yuan stepped forward and responded on behalf of Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qinmiao: "Lord Jiemaster, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Qi Yuan responded.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, he seemed to have thought of something, his gaze piercing through the clouds and falling on the old man and Long Qi.</p><p></p><p>"They are craving some immortal wine, lend them some immortal wine for me to give them."</p><p></p><p>The old man and Long Qi's expressions tightened, they had never been gazed upon by so many powerful figures at the same time, this feeling of being the center of attention made them both anxious and excited.</p><p></p><p>The old man's thoughts were complex.</p><p></p><p>Long Qi's joy was difficult to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Little Qi... no, Big Qi still remembered them!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Palace, the ancient books were as vast as clouds.</p><p></p><p>Some were engraved on stone steles, some were carved on bamboo slips, and some were printed on paper.</p><p></p><p>The vast library represented the historical and cultural development of various domains and worlds in the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>The original copy of the "Origin Esoterica" was hidden in the deepest part of the library.</p><p></p><p>"The original copy of the 'Origin Esoterica' is recorded on the Shenmu as the carrier, recording the various secrets of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>However, the years have been too long, and many chapters of the original have been lost."</p><p></p><p>Yuan handed the original copy of the "Origin Esoterica" to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling it a book, it was more like a wooden stele, a wood carving.</p><p></p><p>However, this wooden stele had been washed by the passage of countless years, and many of the characters on it were no longer visible.</p><p></p><p>"Good, let me take a look." </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>His attention was focused on the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>Yuan's figure retreated and left the library.</p><p></p><p>Only Qi Yuan remained in front of the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning of the universe, the first ancient god was Pan, it had a towering figure and used a giant axe to open up the heavens and the earth?"</p><p></p><p>"This... is related to the story I told the Voiceless Voice."</p><p></p><p>"The heavens and earth collapsed, the earth shattered, the goddess appeared... using stone to repair the earth."</p><p></p><p>"Is this because my story influenced the Voiceless Voice, or... can my words turn decay into miracles?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the awakening of his special ability.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have this special ability, he wouldn't be able to communicate with the Voiceless Voice.</p><p></p><p>His voice could be transmitted to any corner, and then... undergo special changes, causing unknown effects.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan secretly speculated.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was his voice that influenced the Voiceless Voice, leading to the birth of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>"It seems... my mouth is quite powerful, it can even make the universe pregnant." Qi Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the "Origin Esoterica", the records about the Shenmu Abyss only mentioned that it was the beginning of the world, a realm of nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there is no mention of Black Sky in the 'Origin Esoterica'."</p><p></p><p>The understanding of Black Sky by the ancestors like Qi Qi Hui Yuan might not be as good as Qi Yuan, who had slain many strange gods and swept through chaotic star domains.</p><p></p><p>After sitting for half a day, Qi Yuan had completely read through the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>The first half of the "Origin Esoterica" was very similar to the mythological story that Qi Yuan had told the Voiceless Voice.</p><p></p><p>As for the later content, it was about the various major and minor events of the invasion of Black Sky and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Void Paradise and the Radiant Universe were also mentioned in the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze shifted to the epilogue of the "Origin Esoterica".</p><p></p><p>The text there was completely different from the previous text, with a graceful feminine style.</p><p></p><p>"And... the same as the inscription on the stone tablet at the Sunset Cliff."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to encounter such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"It's just... most of the words are not visible."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan carefully examined it, and could only make out the eight characters "Clouds have rain", "Thunder and lightning without sound".</p><p></p><p>As for the rest, he could not see them clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Clouds, rain, thunder... is this a forging technique?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the eight-door forging technique given to him by the blind woman.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... the game is about to be completed, if I can't find you again, I may not be able to help you make eyes."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He was a person who valued favors deeply.</p><p></p><p>What he promised, he would do.</p><p></p><p>Now, the game in this world was also about to end.</p><p></p><p>The character he was playing would also soon come to a complete end.</p><p></p><p>When it ends, that will be the day he leaves.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... giving him all seven pieces of the Qi Qi Light... isn't that too bold?"</p><p></p><p>The burly bearded man was somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Qi Light had consumed the lifeblood of the Shenmu Universe.</p><p></p><p>It was also the only reliance of the Qi Qi Meeting in the fight against Black Sky and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>Although Qi Yuan was the Jiemaster, he was also a person of this world, but the members of the Qi Qi Meeting were not familiar with him.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, he might be another "One" (YÄ«)?</p><p></p><p>"Jiemaster wants it, why haven't you given it to him yet?" The white-haired old man said.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Qi Qi Light, most people did not want to give it to Qi Yuan right after meeting him.</p><p></p><p>But since Qi Yuan's strength was so powerful, reaching the Jiemaster realm, they had no choice.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan acted alone, perhaps their combined forces would not be his match.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that giving it to him so easily, we can't help but have some worries." The burly bearded man said.</p><p></p><p>"The saying goes, 'Doubt those you use, use those you don't doubt.' Since the Qi Qi Light is in Jiemaster's hands, what we need to do now is to trust him." The Sheng woman said.</p><p></p><p>The others nodded, since it had come to this, what else could they do besides trust?</p><p>"Yes, instead of getting caught up in these things, it's better to think about how to deal with Black Sky and Black Earth?"</p><p></p><p>The many ancestral gods discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Black Sky and Black Earth were coming with overwhelming force, even greater than the previous attack.</p><p></p><p>The line drawn by the Radiant Dao Master still existed, and according to the rate of disappearance, the Shenmu Universe still had ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But this invasion of Black Sky and Black Earth was still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps... it would be like the last time, with half the domain falling.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Jiemaster should be the main force... we... will provide intelligence support for him." Said one of the ancestral gods.</p><p></p><p>Since Qi Yuan controlled all the Qi Qi Light, they could not enter the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>They could only provide intelligence support for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this battle will pass smoothly, without any unexpected events!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, after this battle is over, it will give us more breathing room, and the other seeds can also grow, and the Qi Qi Light... will also be forged in greater numbers." Someone said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, back then with only half a piece of the Qi Qi Light, Yuan was able to resist the Void Sea, now... with seven pieces, and Jiemaster taking action, what unexpected things could happen?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's appearance had given the citizens of the Imperial Star a shot of adrenaline.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, everywhere was discussing Qi Yuan, discussing this Jiemaster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the moonlight was so bright, and the surroundings were silent.</p><p></p><p>The old man had changed into his mansion, the table was filled with immortal wine, and the old man was drinking his little wine, his expression hazy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that guy, how come he suddenly became enlightened? Tomorrow he will head to the battlefield, I don't know if he will get injured or not," the old man was somewhat worried about Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was even afraid that Qi Yuan would perish in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>But these words cannot be spoken out, it's inauspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Liu, don't worry, the Realm Lord should be fine this time," Ancestor God Qin said.</p><p></p><p>The secrets regarding the lines drawn by the Radiant Dao Master cannot be told to the lower-level people, otherwise it will cause panic and create trouble.</p><p></p><p>But Qin can reveal a thing or two in secret.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ancestor God Qin speak so firmly, Old Man Liu heaved a sigh of relief: "It's good if there's no trouble."</p><p></p><p>Long Qi sat beside them, carefully drinking, but the radiant light in his eyes could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Little Qi's sudden rise to become the Realm Lord has had a huge impact on Old Man Liu and him.</p><p></p><p>The house has been replaced by a grand mansion.</p><p></p><p>Every day, there are God-level experts, even Ancestor Gods, coming to visit.</p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable in the past.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Qi Yuan even came back once, leaving everyone deeply sighing.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this time Brother Qi can display his divine might and completely defeat the Black Heavens and Black Earths!" Long Qi gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Realm Lord!" Ancestor God Qin raised his cup and said.</p><p></p><p>The entire Imperial Star, all the citizens, had tense expressions.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow will be the day Qi Yuan rushes to the frontline, and also the day the war officially begins.</p><p></p><p>Some are worried, some are excited, and some are perplexed, with varying thoughts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>Majestic warships were patrolling, ancient and solemn, stained with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord's expression was indecipherable: "I've heard that this time, it will be that Realm Lord who will go to the Void Sea to deal with us?"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Black Earth clan members all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Realm Lord from the Chaotic Star Domain, he has killed many of our strong ones," a Great Dao Celestial God said with apprehension.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord actually appeared in the Divine Wood Universe, this person is quite strange," the Void Realm Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in this battle, the one who ignites the light can go back, but this Qi Yuan must remain in the Void Sea!" At this time, a man whose entire body was on fire said, his voice full of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Flame Realm Lord, are you doing this to avenge your nephew?" The Void Realm Lord glanced at the Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord had a nephew named Qi Huang. He loved him dearly, even arranging for Qi Huang to be stationed safely in the Chaotic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, Qi Huang died, killed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could the Flame Realm Lord not be enraged? "He is a Realm Lord, not that easy to kill," the Void Realm Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>They are all at the Realm Lord realm, with similar strengths, how difficult would it be to slay him? "Even if it costs me this life, I must kill him!" The Flame Realm Lord said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Gods present were all somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>Although the Anomaly Source is enough to revive them.</p><p></p><p>But at their level, they try to avoid using the Anomaly Source for resurrection as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knows... will the revived self still be the same self?</p><p></p><p>"It seems this nephew was very important to you," the Void Realm Lord smiled.</p><p></p><p>He also thought of some rumors.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang had many uncles.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these so-called uncles... were all manifestations of the Flame Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>And Qi Huang was the key for the Flame Realm Lord to step into the Myriad Dao Realm?</p><p></p><p>Now, he was slain by Qi Yuan, his anger is understandable.</p><p></p><p>This is a resentment that obstructs the Dao!</p><p></p><p>It's just that... exchanging life for life, in the Void Realm Lord's eyes, is unwise.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord, help me slay Qi Yuan!" The Flame Realm Lord looked at the Void Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord hesitated: "This lord does not want to risk his life."</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was willing to exchange his life, but he would not do it.</p><p></p><p>"You assist me from the side, and after the task is accomplished, I will open my Divine Sea and let you comprehend my Flame Dao!" The Flame Realm Lord said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord heard this and was somewhat surprised: "Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>For a Realm Lord at the Dao Realm, the most important thing is the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Each Realm Lord's comprehended Dao is their trump card, their greatest reliance.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord opening his Divine Sea, allowing the Void Realm Lord to comprehend his Dao, is a very dangerous thing.</p><p></p><p>During this period, if the Void Realm Lord suddenly harbors evil intentions, the Flame Realm Lord will immediately perish.</p><p></p><p>However... with the Anomaly Source, even if he perishes, he can be revived.</p><p></p><p>But for the Void Realm Lord, the revived self may no longer be the same, this is something he also needs to avoid.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Flame Realm Lord, in order to hunt down Qi Yuan, has put forth such a reward, how could the Void Realm Lord not be tempted?</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll help with this task." The Void Realm Lord's thoughts were burning hot.</p><p></p><p>If he can grasp another Dao, it will be a great advancement for him.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he may even have the possibility of breaking through to the Myriad Dao Realm, or even the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Black Heavens and Black Earths have Realm Lords at the Myriad Dao Realm, but not a single one at the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he breaks through to the Primordial Realm, he will become the first among the Black Heavens and Black Earths.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case... then our battle plan needs to be adjusted this time." The Void Realm Lord lowered his head in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens and Black Earths invading the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>For the Divine Wood Universe, the war is extremely brutal and intense.</p><p></p><p>But for the Black Heavens and Black Earths, without receiving the highest order from the Black Heavens, everything is just... probing and playing around.</p><p></p><p>So last time, Yuan led half of the Qi Guangming into the Void Sea to resist the Black Heavens and Black Earths' army.</p><p></p><p>They had a thousand ways to slay Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, no one made a move.</p><p></p><p>Because, with half of the Qi Guangming, it was enough to exchange for a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>No Realm Lord is willing to die, even if they can be revived by the Anomaly Source.</p><p></p><p>But this time is different, the Flame Realm Lord is willing to pay the price, willing to use the Anomaly Source to revive.</p><p></p><p>Since someone is willing to pay the price, leaving Qi Yuan behind... is as simple as can be.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Void Sea?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan entered the Void Sea alone, feeling as if he was entering a muddy swamp.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea... is a special space created by the collision of two universes.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Celestial Gods find it very difficult to walk in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>It's as if they are constrained everywhere, every step is arduous.</p><p></p><p>Only Realm Lords and above, will this constraint be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if one wields the Qi Guangming Treasure, then... even ordinary God-level, or even Heavenly-level, can enter the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Half a day's journey ahead is the Black Heavens and Black Earths' fleet," Yuan's voice came from the communication talisman, "Realm Lord, you just need to hold the Qi Guangming and obstruct the fleet's advance!"</p><p></p><p>Last time, Yuan did just that, confronting the Black Heavens and Black Earths for more than ten years.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the fleet retreated, not advancing a single step further.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qi Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the seven pieces of Qi Guangming, he also had five special communication talismans.</p><p></p><p>These communication talismans, relying on the Qi Guangming, allow Qi Yuan to still receive news from the Divine Wood Universe even in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"What if they attack me?" Qi Yuan asked, "Can I retaliate?"</p><p></p><p>"Normally, the Black Heavens and Black Earths won't rashly attack you in the Void Sea," Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>Those Realm Lords of the Black Heavens and Black Earths are all cherishing their lives, no one wants a one-for-one exchange.</p><p></p><p>"But if someone does attack you, the Realm Lord can naturally strike back," Yuan answered seriously.</p><p></p><p>"What if I want to take the initiative to attack?" Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

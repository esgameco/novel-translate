        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The vast scroll gradually unfurled.</p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful existences and ultimate beings stood outside the scroll, carefully observing every detail of the enormous scroll. </p><p></p><p>Ever since that 'blank paper' squeezed into this universe, and was fixed here in the form of a 'scroll', all the twelfth-rank experts in the universe had descended upon this place.</p><p></p><p>This 'blank paper' was too mysterious, too inconceivable, containing an entire two-dimensional world within.</p><p></p><p>Any existence below the twelfth rank would automatically be reduced in dimension upon approaching it.</p><p></p><p>"There's no way around it."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we join forces and refine it for millions or billions of years, we still cannot refine this 'scroll'."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this scroll gives me a feeling as vast as the boundless universe, how can we refine it?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps we cannot refine it from the outside, but if we descend into the 'scroll', there may be an opportunity to refine it?"</p><p></p><p>The ultimate beings rapidly exchanged thoughts. During this time, they had basically used all the means at their disposal. Not to mention refining the 'scroll', they could not even shake it.</p><p></p><p>The main reason the 'scroll' could finally settle down was not because the supremely powerful beings intervened, but because the 'scroll' itself had grown weary from flying.</p><p></p><p>"Descend into the 'scroll'?"</p><p></p><p>That singular supreme being glanced at the other supreme beings. Indeed, this was the most promising approach among all the possibilities they had deduced.</p><p></p><p>But none of the supreme beings were willing to try it. Supreme beings could resist the 'scroll's' automatic dimension reduction.</p><p></p><p>But if they gave up resisting, they would naturally fall into the two-dimensional world inside the 'scroll' as well.</p><p></p><p>Descending was easy, but getting out again would not be so simple.</p><p></p><p>If any accident occurred inside leading to the demise of the descended avatar, the root source of the supreme being would still suffer corresponding damage.</p><p></p><p>For those tenth or eleventh rank experts who fell into the scroll, even if their avatars died inside, it would not have much impact on their backing forces - the apex clan alliance would definitely not be shaken at its roots by the loss of a few eleventh rank lives.</p><p></p><p>But it was different for the supreme beings. If they experienced a drastic power drop or were severely injured, the impact would be extremely far-reaching, potentially even causing changes in the current state of affairs among the myriad races of the starry river.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait and see."</p><p></p><p>"So many powerful experts from my clan have fallen in."  </p><p></p><p>"Wait until the next celestial gate opens to see if they can come out."</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings and ultimate existences were all very cautious. They were aware that this 'scroll' was extremely important. Whoever could refine it would gain power equivalent to two or three additional supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>But for now, they could not be hasty.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, at the Dongxuan City's Bloodrain Tavern, a hunchbacked elder was dozing off. Suddenly, as if sensing something, the hunchbacked elder abruptly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a young man was sitting at a table, though the elder didn't know when he had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Great One," the hunchbacked elder's mind trembled as he immediately stood up respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to make a deal with your Bloodrain Tavern," Lin Yuan spoke calmly without any fluctuation in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few years, he had purchased many cultivation resources through the Bloodrain Tavern, so the two were quite familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>Although the Bloodrain Tavern originated from the Bloodrain Ancient Nation, it operated independently with branches across the twelve ancient nations and had an excellent reputation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to be absolutely certain, Lin Yuan would use the bronze compass to check if there were any dangers in the area before coming each time.</p><p></p><p>After descending into this two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan did not fully trust anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Please state your request, Great One," the hunchbacked elder said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The more he interacted with Lin Yuan, the more he sensed Lin Yuan's terrifying power. Initially, the hunchbacked elder thought Lin Yuan was an expert approaching the Shaman Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>But today, the hunchbacked elder realized how laughable his initial thought was - approaching the Shaman Emperor realm? With Lin Yuan's strength, he would be considered exceptionally powerful even among Shaman Emperors.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's youthful appearance, in this world, there were some miraculous objects like the Bloodrain Tea Tree of the Bloodrain Ancient Nation and other artifacts that could maintain eternal youth.</p><p></p><p>In the hunchbacked elder's mind, Lin Yuan must be some ancient monster who had been in seclusion for unknown years, with his youthful appearance merely an outer facade.</p><p></p><p>"I want some cultivation methods, Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods," Lin Yuan stated directly.</p><p></p><p>"Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods?" The hunchbacked elder was inwardly startled, yet also felt it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, it was understandable that only the Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods representing the highest realm of this world would catch his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Great One, any Shaman Ancestor cultivation method has an extremely significant origin, either originating from one of the ancient nations or from some transcendent power," the hunchbacked elder said with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>With the Bloodrain Tavern's influence, they could indeed obtain Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods. However, daring to sell them externally was another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods had very obvious characteristics and were monopolized by the great ancient nations. Without the ancient nations' permission, anyone who privately spread Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods would be hunted down by the twelve ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods I obtain will have nothing to do with the Bloodrain Tavern," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Great One says so, it would be improper for me to refuse further," the hunchbacked elder's tone relaxed.</p><p></p><p>There were some things he dared not say outright, but Lin Yuan understood the implication and promptly gave his assurance, making it easy for the elder to proceed.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, my Bloodrain Tavern has collected a total of eight Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods. Does the Great One wish to have them all?" the hunchbacked elder asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"All of them," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The greatest significance of the Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods for him was not for cultivation, but to glimpse the essence of cultivation in this realm based on their principles.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Lin Yuan, who had only descended into this world for over twenty years, had already surpassed all previous Shaman Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Very well," the hunchbacked elder respectfully turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he returned carrying a box. "Great One, all eight Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods are inside."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder used a special technique to open the box, which was neatly arranged with volumes of books inside. Without specific methods, even if outsiders obtained this box, it would be useless - forcibly opening it would only trigger the self-destruction mechanism within.</p><p></p><p>"How many Spirit Crystals?" Lin Yuan glanced over and casually inquired.</p><p></p><p>"One Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation method costs ten billion Spirit Crystals. For all eight Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods, it's a total of eighty billion Spirit Crystals," the hunchbacked elder immediately stated.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Tavern had paid a considerable price to obtain these Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods. More importantly, by selling these methods, the Bloodrain Tavern had to bear the risk of leakage.</p><p></p><p>"Put it on my tab," Lin Yuan casually picked up a Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation method and finished reading it with just a few glances before moving on to the next one.</p><p></p><p>With the thought processing speed of an external tenth-rank expert, memorizing these brief textual descriptions of cultivation methods was effortless.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the hunchbacked elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>After years of interaction, he had developed a certain level of trust in Lin Yuan. Such a Shaman Emperor-level expert would not balk at owing less than a hundred billion Spirit Crystals.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Great One," the hunchbacked elder seemed to recall something and immediately spoke up. "The Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods my Bloodrain Tavern obtained are not complete - the core essential parts are only passed down orally, making them very difficult to acquire."</p><p></p><p>Without the crucial core components, these Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods could hardly be practiced to the depths, and lacking certain key information could even lead to 'deviation and demonic cultivation'.</p><p></p><p>"I know," Lin Yuan continued rapidly flipping through the volumes.</p><p></p><p>He was observing these Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods not for the purpose of cultivation, but merely to draw insights.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to grasp the overall principles of each Shaman Ancestor cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, after Lin Yuan had finished reviewing all the Shaman Ancestor-level cultivation methods, he stood up and left.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder bowed and saw him off. After Lin Yuan disappeared, the hunchbacked elder's expression became contemplative. "The Great One purchased so many Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder gulped, vaguely guessing at something.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of a mountain, Lin Yuan's figure appeared as he sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The eight Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods' explanations of the essence of power are still not perfect enough, but the direction they represent has many commendable aspects."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Especially the 'Evergreen' Shaman Ancestor cultivation method originating from the mysterious Evergreen Ancient Nation - this method gave Lin Yuan the greatest insight into longevity. Experts who crossed into the Shaman Ancestor realm through this method had lifespans twice as long as other Shaman Ancestors of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 'Evergreen' cultivation method also had its flaws - it was unsuitable for direct combat. The Evergreen Shaman Ancestor lived the longest in history, but was considered the weakest in terms of combat power among the Shaman Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>However, with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, he could completely extract the essence and combine the longevity effects with his own...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Dharma body through self-cultivation. </p><p></p><p>It could even greatly enhance the 'longevity' effect, far exceeding the theoretical limits of the 'Evergreen' cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Longevity was far more important than imagined for all the powerful experts who fell into the two-dimensional world, especially for Lin Yuan, it was a way out.</p><p></p><p>If after three hundred years, the Heavenly Gate opened and Lin Yuan could not sweep through the many eleventh-level peak lifeforms to reach the gate, then he could only pin his hopes on the next opening of the Heavenly Gate. </p><p></p><p>And each time the Heavenly Gate opened was separated by ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the worst case scenario. With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, after three hundred years of equal footing cultivation and development, those eleventh-level peak lifeforms would be no match for him.</p><p></p><p>"If I can fully integrate this Evergreen cultivation method into my own, I can at least extend my longevity by twenty to thirty thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself. </p><p></p><p>The longevity referred to here was in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Extending his life by twenty to thirty thousand years meant he could experience three to four openings of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>In such a long time, even if supreme experts descended, Lin Yuan was confident he could crush and overwhelm them.</p><p></p><p>"The other seven ancestral cultivation methods can also enrich my path to the ancestral realm in exploring the essence of power."</p><p></p><p>Details of the ancestral cultivation methods flashed through Lin Yuan's mind, before being integrated into perfecting his own created ancestral realm.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe. </p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Vice Pavilion Master Nalan routinely exchanged intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan and the human evolutionary experts had established a base in the capital of an ancient nation, continuously developing and expanding it.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he was better informed about intelligence than Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, in the two-dimensional world, there are currently ninety-eight powerful experts who have definitively stepped into the ancestral realm. Among them, nine are the strongest ancestral experts, with a clear gap from the other ancestral experts."</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Ninety-eight ancestral experts?" Lin Yuan's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world since ancient times, it was unknown if the total number of ancestral experts born even reached ninety-eight.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these ninety-eight ancestral experts, although in the ancestral realm, their combat power was far beyond the native ancestral experts of history.</p><p></p><p>After all, their true primal selves were at that level.</p><p></p><p>"Here are the combat videos of the strongest nine ancestral experts." Vice Pavilion Master Nalan moved his mind slightly, and illusory images appeared before him, beginning to play the videos.</p><p></p><p>The source of these videos was the memories of powerful experts who had witnessed the nine ancestral experts in battle.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately looked towards the videos.</p><p></p><p>The first video showed a four-armed figure walking across a flat wasteland, with a large number of auras lurking in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"You insignificant insects dare try to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>The four-armed figure said disdainfully. He took a big step forward and stomped his right foot heavily onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power radiated out in all directions. The land was torn apart as if the sky had collapsed. The powerful experts from various races who had been lurking to ambush him were all severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Just one stomp released such terrifying power that the surrounding powerful experts suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>The four-armed figure took another step forward to a powerful expert with sixteen pairs of wings on his back. </p><p></p><p>This sixteen-winged powerful expert was also in the ancestral realm, and tried his best to resist the four-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, the four-armed figure merely stretched out his four arms and tore him apart with ease, his blood spilling across the land.</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan explained, "This battle arose from the Feather Race's plan to kill that expert. The one being surrounded was one of the 'Four Divine Kings' of the Stellar Alliance, a unique special lifeform at the sixth level of the eleventh stage, on par with the 'Mother of the Tree Realm'."</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of amazement in Vice Pavilion Master Nalan's tone.</p><p></p><p>Although he was also an eleventh stage expert, he was still far below perfected eleventh stage experts like the 'Four Divine Kings'.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed very powerful," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This Four Divine King had clearly been in the ancestral realm for some time and had mastered the application of his power to an unimaginable degree.</p><p></p><p>"This Four Divine King is currently the strongest among the powerful experts who have descended into this world," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He then played the second video.</p><p></p><p>This showed the battle between two ancestral experts.</p><p></p><p>The auras of both sides were terrifyingly powerful. One had a huge, mountain-like body, while the other was slender but wielded a blood-red long sword.</p><p></p><p>Based on their auras, the huge figure was clearly stronger, but the actual battle was extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they clashed, the slender figure flashed his blood-red sword, and the huge figure was instantly cut in two.</p><p></p><p>"This...?" Lin Yuan's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill? How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Four Divine King had taken a few moves to kill that Feather Race ancestral expert.</p><p></p><p>But this slender figure had instantly killed his opponent?</p><p></p><p>"The sword?" Lin Yuan immediately noticed the blood-red long sword wielded by the slender figure.</p><p></p><p>The sword was razor-sharp, as if it could tear through the void itself.</p><p></p><p>"An artifact? Supreme weapon?" Lin Yuan associated it with the bronze compass he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Although separated by the video, this sword gave off a similar aura to his bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it's the sword," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan nodded. "The sword wielder is called 'Hou Zhu' of the Prison Race, an eleventh stage expert around the fourth level before falling into this two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>"Hou Zhu's strength is not particularly outstanding among the eleventh stage experts, but because of this sword, he has become second only to the Four Divine King."</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan paused, then continued, "In the two-dimensional world, there are many artifacts that should be from the twelfth stellar realm. Under the suppression here, they can unleash a fraction of their extraordinary power."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>He had known about the existence of artifacts and even had one in his possession now.</p><p></p><p>"These artifacts have various effects, but they are all very useful. Many ancestral experts are now searching everywhere for them," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan said.</p><p></p><p>Just look at Hou Zhu of the Prison Race - relying on the blood-red sword, he had soared in strength.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan watched the third, fourth, and fifth videos.</p><p></p><p>Of the currently recognized nine strongest ancestral experts in the two-dimensional world, six were special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three were one from the Prison Race, one from the Universe Race, and one from the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Universe Race was among the most powerful apex races, comparable to the human civilization which had nine supreme experts presiding over it. However, the Universe Race's history and lineage was far more ancient than humanity's.</p><p></p><p>They were a terrifying race born at the very beginning of the universe's creation.</p><p></p><p>"The human ancestral expert barely ranks ninth," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This was still not bad, as other apex races like the Insect Race and Feather Race did not even have one expert in the top nine.</p><p></p><p>"Are there more videos?" Lin Yuan wanted to see the battle videos of the other ancestral experts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued watching for a while.</p><p></p><p>As expected, starting from the tenth ancestral expert, there was a significant gap in strength compared to the top nine.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba Gunshen?" Lin Yuan looked at the twelfth video.</p><p></p><p>Meaning this video featured the expert ranked twelfth among all the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba Gunshen is also a special lifeform with great innate talent," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan commented.</p><p></p><p>This two-dimensional world was undoubtedly the home court for these special lifeforms. In terms of innate talent, the special lifeforms were unmatched.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Galactic Sovereign, what realm have you cultivated to now?" Vice Pavilion Master Nalan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Initial Ancestral Emperor," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"That's still very impressive," Vice Pavilion Master Nalan praised.</p><p></p><p>Although renowned as humanity's most talented evolutionary genius in history, Lin Yuan had just entered the tenth stage, far below those eleventh stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Even so, having reached the Ancestral Emperor realm in just over twenty years since descending was keeping pace with ordinary eleventh stage lifeforms' cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan himself had only recently entered the Ancestral Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, among the over three hundred eleventh stage lifeforms who fell into this two-dimensional world, most were still stuck at the Ancestral Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>What Vice Pavilion Master Nalan did not know was that Lin Yuan's so-called initial Ancestral Emperor realm could already match an ancestral expert.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in terms of potential, even the strongest Four Divine King was far inferior to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine King had already become an ancestral expert, so his future cultivation speed would definitely slow down significantly. But Lin Yuan had just become an Ancestral Emperor with immense room for growth.</p><p></p><p>And the closer he got to the limit, the greater Lin Yuan's advantage would become.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging information with Vice Pavilion Master Nalan, Lin Yuan continued to immerse himself in perfecting and pioneering the ancestral cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in the blink of an eye, a hundred years went by.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

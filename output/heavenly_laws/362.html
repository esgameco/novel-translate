        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 362: The Cycle of Life and Death Never Ends (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The commotion of the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign successfully breaking through immediately caught the attention of the many powerful experts on the main star. </p><p></p><p>The various Peak Masters sensed it right away and hurried towards the position of the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Leviathan lineage had thirteen Peak Masters in total, with the Grand Peak Master and the Thirteen Peak Masters stationed in other star domains. </p><p></p><p>Only eleven Peak Masters remained on the main star.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, accompanying the spread of the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's powerful aura, ten Peak Masters rapidly approached.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p>"Master, you broke through?"</p><p>"Congratulations Master on advancing to the ninth stage!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Peak Masters saw the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign standing with his hands behind his back and eyes closed, and they offered their congratulations.</p><p></p><p>As disciples of the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign, the stronger their master became, the more they as disciples would naturally benefit.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, the closeness of the master-disciple relationship even surpassed that of close relatives, because to become master and disciple, their levels of life generally would not differ too much.</p><p></p><p>They could experience the long passage of years together.</p><p></p><p>But close relatives? How many of the close relatives of those tenth stage, eleventh stage evolved beings were still alive?</p><p></p><p>Even the close relatives of the most powerful had basically all died. The most powerful could go against the flow and revive past living beings.</p><p></p><p>But if they died due to reaching their life's limit, even if forcibly revived, they would die again when their lifespan ended.</p><p></p><p>To achieve eternity, one had to become a twelfth stage life form and transcend the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"You all have come." The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign glanced at the many Peak Masters and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was churning with turbulent waves. Just now when he connected his consciousness to the virtual world, he received information on the many events that had occurred over the past hundred-plus years.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the most dazzling was the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, he went on a killing rampage, using his own power to force the peak ninth stage experts of the major hostile factions against human civilization, causing nearly ten thousand ninth stage aliens to die voluntarily within the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, a few years ago, he advanced to the tenth stage, placing one foot under the pinnacle position below the Paramount level.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple of mine..." The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had only suggested that Lin Yuan explore the opened Xuan Huang Secret Realm to see if he could figure out the connection between the Xuan Huang evolutionary path and the secret realm itself.</p><p></p><p>Who could have foreseen that Lin Yuan would cause such a huge commotion?</p><p></p><p>When the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign entered the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, he was extremely cautious, because the eighth stage was invincible, belonging to the lower levels of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's performance in the Xuan Huang Secret Realm was so overwhelmingly domineering. Those lofty special ninth stage experts had no choice but to flee with their tails between their legs. If they were too slow, they would die.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan advancing to the tenth stage, the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's heart was complex, but he felt a sense of liberation.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan crossed into the ninth stage, the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign was an eighth stage invincible, with hope of breaking into the ninth stage and becoming an evolved being at the same level as his junior disciple.</p><p></p><p>If not for Lin Yuan's provocation, the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign might have continued brewing for thousands of years more.</p><p></p><p>He would naturally reach the pinnacle and then consider crossing into the ninth stage when the time came.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had a very long lifespan left. As one with a supreme bloodline of the Starry Sea Leviathans, the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's lifespan far exceeded that of evolved beings at the same level.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had advanced to the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign actually felt a sense of relief, because the tenth stage was not something he could achieve just by secluding himself.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Starry Sea Leviathan's great assistance in cultivation at the ninth stage, opening up countless layers of space, for such a favored child of the spatial origin, it would still be much easier.</p><p></p><p>But to fully complete the ninth stage and open up millions upon millions of spatial layers?</p><p></p><p>Without a hundred thousand years of time, don't even think about it.</p><p></p><p>And that was under ideal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>If things didn't go smoothly and he encountered a few bottlenecks, the time would be greatly extended.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's thoughts rose and fell, and he felt a sense of emotion.</p><p></p><p>When the gap was not large, there was still the idea of catching up.</p><p></p><p>But when the gap was like a vast chasm, the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign completely lost such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Junior Brother, Junior Brother has stepped into the tenth stage," the Tenth Peak Master immediately said, sharing this good news with the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign glanced at the Tenth Peak Master. "In the future, you all should learn more from the Thirteenth."</p><p></p><p>Upon these words, the ten Peak Masters looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Learn from their junior brother? What could they learn from their junior brother?</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the starry cosmos, within a certain secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"That little Milky Way Sovereign brat has advanced to the tenth stage?" Tuo Ba the Primordial God had just finished a short period of secluded cultivation when he received this news from human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Ba." A domineering consciousness descended, coalescing into a towering illusory figure - it was Si Zhong the Primordial God.</p><p></p><p>"Back then when I had you return the Milky Way Sovereign's friend, look what happened. Not only did you fail to gain any advantage, you even offended the Milky Way Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Si Zhong the Primordial God looked at Tuo Ba the Primordial God and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So I offended him, so what?" Tuo Ba the Primordial God was completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>Given the talent and aptitude the Milky Way Sovereign displayed, his advancement to the tenth stage was only normal.</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba the Primordial God did not worry about this at all. Even if the Milky Way Sovereign crossed into the eleventh stage in the future, so what?</p><p></p><p>For a Primordial God like himself standing at the pinnacle of the eleventh stage, unless the Milky Way Sovereign became a Paramount, he would be powerless against Tuo Ba.</p><p></p><p>But becoming a Paramount was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>"You may not care about the Milky Way Sovereign, but what about that eleventh stage human evolved being who comprehended the laws of time from human civilization? You're saying he won't care either?"</p><p></p><p>"This human evolved being has great hope of becoming a Paramount. When that happens, human civilization will give birth to the tenth Paramount, which will have profound impacts on the state of affairs between the various major powers in the cosmos."</p><p></p><p>"Can you still not care then?"</p><p></p><p>Si Zhong the Primordial God spoke.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, that anomaly which triggered the infusion of chaotic primordial origin, after being revealed by the alien Paramounts, the various Primordial Gods also learned it came from human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, human civilization also publicly announced that a secluded tenth stage evolved being had broken through to the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>Matching the speculations of the alien Paramounts.</p><p></p><p>"A tenth stage who comprehended the laws of time..." Tuo Ba the Primordial God fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He could not care about the Milky Way Sovereign, because no matter how deviant his talent, it provided no direct help in assaulting the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>But a tenth stage who comprehended the laws of time? This provided no small assistance towards the ultimate, allowing one more chance than a normal eleventh stage peak expert to withstand the infusion of the chaotic primordial origin.</p><p></p><p>The world within would receive great benefits, making the future ultimate metamorphosis into an inner universe much easier.</p><p></p><p>"It has no impact on me." Tuo Ba the Primordial God looked at Si Zhong the Primordial God. "Even if human civilization produces another Paramount, it will only affect the state of affairs between the various peak powers. At most I'll defect to the Insectoid race."</p><p></p><p>Human civilization producing another Paramount would only increase their foundational strength slightly, far from allowing them to run rampant without restraint.</p><p></p><p>"You plan to assault the ultimate within the next million years, and in the meantime defect to the Insectoid race. Are you really saying it won't have any impact at all?" Si Zhong the Primordial God smiled.</p><p></p><p>He also felt a tinge of regret now. Who could have foreseen the Milky Way Sovereign being so unaffected by threats?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the foundations of human civilization were too terrifying. It had only just given birth to nine Paramounts, yet there was already hope for the birth of the tenth so soon?</p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier, he definitely should have decisively returned the Milky Way Sovereign's friend. That would have been the best choice.</p><p></p><p>At least he wouldn't have offended the Milky Way Sovereign to the death, offended human civilization to the death.</p><p></p><p>At the Milky Way Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master broke through to the ninth stage?" Upon receiving this news, a smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Although breaking through to the ninth stage was insignificant to the current Lin Yuan, for the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign, it was a long-cherished wish of many years.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go congratulate Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan connected his consciousness to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>In his personal space, Lin Yuan and the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Master on breaking through to the ninth stage," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Are you mocking me?" The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign rolled his eyes. He hadn't even mentioned Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the tenth stage yet.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the birth of a tenth stage evolved being, what was an eighth stage breaking through to the ninth?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, master and disciple chatted idly for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign could sense that even though this disciple of his had completely surpassed him, there was not the slightest air of a tenth stage evolved being. It was as if he was still that little disciple from before.</p><p></p><p>This warmed the Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's heart.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, about the connection between the Xuan Huang evolutionary path and the Xuan Huang Secret Realm..." The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about the relationship between the two.</p><p></p><p>"This exploration of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm did not reveal any connection to the Xuan Huang evolutionary path," Lin Yuan did not tell the full truth.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the Xuan Huang Secret Realm was truly...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>It was too important. In the future, when Lin Yuan was called the strongest and feared nothing, he might reveal this matter. </p><p></p><p>But now? </p><p></p><p>It was naturally better to keep it hidden.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Koi Star Master quickly understood. </p><p></p><p>Obtaining the Xuanhuang evolutionary path was not very difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanhuang evolutionary path was truly crucially linked to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, how could he, a mere eighth-level invincible, bring it out?</p><p></p><p>What the Crimson Koi Star Master did not know was that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm's spirit had almost half-gifted this evolutionary path outwards, so that the Xuanhuang evolutionary path could be better transmitted to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>However, most experts, upon obtaining this evolutionary path, tried repeatedly but found they could not cultivate it at all, so they gradually gave up and stopped paying attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, there were lifeforms that met the requirements of the Xuanhuang evolutionary path, but they often fell midway, failing to reach the prerequisite of triggering the summons of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, regarding the Xuanhuang evolutionary path, I plan to make it public and find a few evolvers in the human civilization who can cultivate this evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan spoke. This was also something he had promised the Xuanhuang Secret Realm's spirit before.</p><p></p><p>As for whether other evolvers cultivating the Xuanhuang evolutionary path would shake Lin Yuan's control over the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?</p><p></p><p>That possibility no longer existed. Now that Lin Yuan had refined the secret realm's core, becoming the indisputable master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, even if someone cultivated the Xuanhuang evolutionary path to the tenth or eleventh level, it would have no impact on the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Koi Star Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>At the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan successfully uploaded the first to seventh levels of the Xuanhuang evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>As for the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and even twelfth levels? If one could not even enter through the first to seventh levels, naturally there was no need to cultivate the later levels.</p><p></p><p>"The three Goddesses did not evaluate the Xuanhuang evolutionary path highly," Lin Yuan received the Wisdom Goddess's assessment of the Xuanhuang evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>The most important standard for the human civilization to evaluate evolutionary paths was its popularity - the number of people who could cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>No matter how supreme an evolutionary path was, if the threshold was extremely high such that no one could enter it, then its value would not be that great either.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was not to the point where no one could enter it, it was still not easy to cultivate this evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>On Battlefield No. A098.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization had opened up to two million alien battlefields, most of which were small-scale.</p><p></p><p>There were 860,000 medium-scale alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>As for large-scale alien battlefields? Currently there were only 135 of them.</p><p></p><p>Each large-scale alien battlefield was a slaughterhouse between peak races, where the strongest experts in the starry cosmos gathered the most.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the most powerful were always watching.</p><p></p><p>In an area near the center of Battlefield No. A098.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's solar spiritual body was carefully flying.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a small, medium or large alien battlefield, the space was extremely unstable, and translocation or instantaneous movement would have huge "deviations".</p><p></p><p>These deviations appearing in the starry cosmos were not very dangerous, but on the battlefield?</p><p></p><p>If one accidentally translocated into an enemy's nest, wouldn't that be courting death?</p><p></p><p>So normally, no expert dared to translocate or move instantaneously on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was no exception.</p><p></p><p>Although relying on the 'Nine Steps of Space-Time', Lin Yuan could reduce the deviation to the minimum.</p><p></p><p>But the 'Nine Steps of Space-Time' consumed too much, and the display of this secret technique was very conspicuous, erupting numerous spatial ripples.</p><p></p><p>After all, this secret technique was positioned as a last-resort "escape" move.</p><p></p><p>If one had already fallen into such a desperate situation of needing to escape, who would care about being conspicuous or not?</p><p></p><p>"The large alien battlefield is really too huge," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It had only taken him half a year to rush here from the Galactic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>In the following years, he had been "slowly" flying on the battlefield, heading towards that permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's understanding of Battlefield No. A098, this large alien battlefield had a diameter exceeding 500 light-years. Even in the vast cosmic void, it could be considered an enormous entity.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the 135 large battlefields opened by the human civilization were all created by the most powerful experts, refined by the ultimate existences themselves, able to withstand the battles between eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"However, even when I had just entered the battlefield, I sensed the aura of Realm-Breaking Source Power," A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>But in this large alien battlefield? Even at the edge of the battlefield, Lin Yuan detected that the accumulation rate of Realm-Breaking Source Power had increased.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a slight increase compared to small and medium alien battlefields, it was still an increase - a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, when I really get close to that permanent spatial rift, to what extent will the accumulation rate of Realm-Breaking Source Power increase?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt some anticipation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's yin spiritual body hovered in the air.</p><p></p><p>Ever since breaking through to the tenth level, Lin Yuan would occasionally enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to get familiar with his explosive increase in power.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm could even block the gaze of the most powerful, so Lin Yuan could go all-out here without any reservations.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying energy fluctuations almost swept across one-tenth of the secret realm's area. Compared to a normal tenth-level, Lin Yuan's strength foundation was incomparably stronger.</p><p></p><p>After passing through that over 12 light-year gap in the Chaos Void and receiving 333 seconds of Primordial Infusion, Lin Yuan had undergone a complete metamorphosis from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ninth level, Lin Yuan had become much, much stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had transformed from an ant into a divine dragon.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of space was torn apart. The power erupting from Lin Yuan's casual movements was enough to extinguish one tenth-level C-grade after another, tenth-level B-grade.</p><p></p><p>Only tenth-level A-grades who had comprehended the fusion rules of the Pillar realm could persist in the aftershocks of Lin Yuan's unbridled release of power.</p><p></p><p>But they could only persist, like a small boat floating on a vast ocean, liable to sink at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Master, with no Rules Power augmenting you, your current strength has already surpassed the pinnacle of the tenth level," the Xuanhuang Secret Realm's spirit, a six-armed figure, appeared in the distance and gazed at Lin Yuan in the midst of the vast power, utterly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The main cultivation method for tenth-level lifeforms was constantly fusing various rules.</p><p></p><p>And fusing rules was also the most important offensive technique for tenth-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Without relying on any rules, the might Lin Yuan unleashed had exceeded the tenth level realm - this was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Just surpassing the pinnacle of the tenth level?" Lin Yuan restrained his aura, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he had just entered the tenth level, Lin Yuan's strength had increased by a huge margin. He had originally thought he could barely reach the threshold of the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>The tenth and eleventh levels were completely different realms.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that just surpassing the pinnacle of the tenth level meant reaching the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>If the pinnacle of the tenth level was 100, then the eleventh level was 1,000 or 10,000.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the tenth level pinnacle to reach 110 or 120 still left a long distance to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>During the glorious period of the Xuanhuang lineage, there were indeed some monstrous tenth-level lifeforms who could temporarily confront eleventh-level lifeforms for a moment by relying on secret techniques, weapons, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But what Lin Yuan wanted now was to reach the threshold of the eleventh level solely through his own pure strength.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure didn't know what to say for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If one could match the eleventh level by relying solely on one's pure strength, was that still considered a tenth-level lifeform?</p><p></p><p>After multiple attempts in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan had a rough assessment of his current strength.</p><p></p><p>He was basically an invincible tenth-level. Normal tenth-level A-grades simply couldn't last long against him.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan went all-out without holding back, paying a huge price, he might be able to temporarily raise his strength to the threshold of the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>For example, by using the divine ability "Augmentation".</p><p></p><p>Enhancing his physical body, soul, mind, will, inner world, and everything else tenfold would likely increase his strength by a hundred or a thousandfold, allowing him to break into the eleventh level realm.</p><p></p><p>"Fusing rules..."</p><p></p><p>After contemplating for a moment, Lin Yuan continued to cultivate and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"The Rule of Life. The Rule of Death." Lin Yuan raised both hands, his left hand brimming with nurturing life, his right hand shrouded in cold death.</p><p></p><p>"Life and death, an endless cycle?"</p><p></p><p>Numerous insights emerged in Lin Yuan's mind, and the forces of life and death in his hands actually began to slowly fuse together.</p>

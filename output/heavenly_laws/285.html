            <p>Chapter 285 Black Tower Second Floor (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The rules of space are one of the pillars that support the operation of the universe.</p><p></p><p>What are the pillar rules? It means that without the rules of space, the universe would become imperfect or even collapse.</p><p></p><p>Everything that exists, everything that is, must rely on space. It is the foundation of all things.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has completely mastered the rules of space. Even if it's just one aspect, his perception of the outside world is completely different now.</p><p></p><p>Before comprehending the rules of space, Lin Yuan was like a fish in water, seeing and feeling only what was around him. But after comprehending the rules of space, it's as if he has leaped out of the water surface and can see more and look further.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of space may not be as profound as the rules of time, unable to go against the flow and resurrect lives that have died in the past. But its penetration into all things is deeper," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he has only reached the ninth level in all aspects. Without mastering the rules of space, even if Lin Yuan's combat power and destructive power exceed the ninth level threshold, if he were to fight against a ninth level powerhouse, the other party could completely come and go as they please. By utilizing space, they could "play with" Lin Yuan at a higher level.</p><p></p><p>It's like a whale living at the bottom of the ocean. No matter how terrifyingly powerful it is, it still cannot threaten lives on land.</p><p></p><p>"Mastering space is just the beginning. Next, I still need to integrate the Taiji rules and many cosmic forces with the complete rules of space to walk my own path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart surged. The ninth level path was right before his eyes. He only needed to complete the final integration of rules to step into the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad races of the cosmic starry sky, the ninth level can be considered a foundational existence. For many weak races and ordinary races, even their most powerful ancestors are only at this level.</p><p></p><p>"My inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world and discovered that his inner world, which was originally just over a billion miles, had once again begun to expand.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yuan had anticipated this and took out the Taiwei clear crystals he had prepared in advance, fusing them into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In no time, his inner world expanded to a size of 1.31 billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The thick world force circulated. An ordinary invincible eighth level would only be crushed in the face of such a vast world force, unable to even resist.</p><p></p><p>"With my current inner world as support, there should be no difficulty in completely absorbing the mysterious gourd's green liquid," Lin Yuan thought. In recent years, he had tried to absorb the green liquid but always got stuck at the last bit. Now, he estimated that he could easily pass through it.</p><p></p><p>"First, absorb the green liquid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to the outside world. He took out the gray-green gourd and immediately began absorbing with the gourd mouth facing down.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of light-years away from the No. B0001 alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>A black cosmic spaceship emerged after ending its wormhole jump.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the No. B0001 alien battlefield?" Lin Yuan was inside the spaceship, looking at the behemoth thousands of light-years away.</p><p></p><p>The No. B0001 alien battlefield was the first medium-sized alien battlefield opened up by human civilization, about twelve light-years in size.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll just use Great Teleportation to cover the remaining distance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan exited the cosmic spaceship. After comprehending the complete rules of space, any casual Great Teleportation could span hundreds of light-years without a "cooldown time". It was much more efficient than the spaceship's wormhole jump.</p><p></p><p>Of course, using Great Teleportation to travel consumed a lot of mental energy. If not in a hurry, it was still better to use the spaceship for wormhole jumps.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also saw that there were only a few thousand light-years left, so he decided to use Great Teleportation to travel, just wanting to try out the feeling of using it to get around.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of Battlefield No. 0001.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared and looked at the battlefield before him.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial fluctuations are obvious, far more concentrated than the medium-sized alien battlefield where Taiyin Yuanshen is," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations on the alien battlefields originated from the constant battles between countless powerhouses, and whether there were permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>As the oldest alien battlefield, Battlefield No. 0001 often experienced escalations in the intensity of wars in the distant past.</p><p></p><p>Tenth level evolvers personally wielding the strongest weapons would tear open permanent spatial rifts with widths and lengths much greater than other medium-sized alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rifts of ordinary small alien battlefields were about ten to several tens of meters, while the spatial rifts of medium-sized alien battlefields mostly exceeded ten thousand meters, between ten thousand and twenty thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>And the largest permanent spatial rift on Battlefield No. 0001 reached thirty thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>These were not ordinary spatial rifts, but permanent spatial rifts, "wounds" that even the instinctive operation of the universe could not heal.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look at that thirty-thousand-meter-long permanent spatial rift first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan concealed his aura and headed towards the location of his target. Within the alien battlefield, the spatial fluctuations were obvious. Even after mastering the complete rules of space, it was best not to use the Great Teleportation technique.</p><p></p><p>Because it was very easy to be affected by the fluctuating space, leading to deviating from the destination, or even getting briefly lost in the depths of the layered space.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes. The green flames inside his body burned frantically and finally returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally completely absorbed it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness once again descended into his inner world, looking at the vast world that had silently reached 1.332 billion miles in diameter, a satisfied look appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>For a normal human evolver who has mastered the complete rules of space, the limit of their inner world is a billion miles in diameter. For those special lifeforms with peak bloodlines, such as Starry Sea Rocs or other spatially unique lifeforms, the upper limit of their inner worlds is probably also just hundreds of millions of miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The universe is fair. In giving birth to all living things, the stronger the innate talent and bloodline of a lifeform, the lower and more difficult its reproductive ability.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization has a terrifying reproductive ability, but the vast majority have very mediocre talent.</p><p></p><p>Starry Sea Rocs have powerful innate talent and bloodlines, but reproduction is extremely difficult for them. But no matter how difficult, Starry Sea Rocs can still barely form a race.</p><p></p><p>And some special lifeforms are so few in number that they cannot even form a race. The terrifying innate talent of these special lifeforms cannot be discussed with common sense.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky, many "ancient gods" who dominate a region are born in this way.</p><p></p><p>"Next is... the cyan liquid?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand and the mysterious gourd appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the color on the surface of the mysterious gourd began to slowly change, from the previous gray-green to gray-cyan.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inverted the gourd and a drop of profound cyan liquid dripped out.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The cyan liquid entered his throat and turned into pure cyan flames, beginning to burn Lin Yuan's internal organs.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had tried several times, and the world within his body had expanded to a radius of about 145 million miles.</p><p></p><p>"The next upgrade won't be as fast." The ability to increase the base size by more than double in such a short time was entirely due to Lin Yuan reaching the limit of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he would basically have to improve slowly, gradually adapting to the burning of the cyan flames.</p><p></p><p>"In the past few years, the accumulated Breakthrough Source Power has finally reached thirty strands again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into his mind, feeling the amount of Breakthrough Source Power.</p><p></p><p>Before embarking on the eighth crossing, Lin Yuan had accumulated a total of thirty-six strands of Breakthrough Source Power.</p><p></p><p>Descending to the Spirit Realm consumed ten strands, and carrying the mysterious gourd and the Origin Essence Gold consumed two strands.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the eighth crossing, there were still twenty-four strands of Breakthrough Source Power left.</p><p></p><p>And in the past few years, Lin Yuan's Breakthrough Source Power had once again reached thirty strands.</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush for the ninth crossing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face was pensive. He was currently at a critical period of integrating the rules. Crossing at this time would only affect the time it took to enter the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>In any case, for Lin Yuan, cultivation was the same everywhere, whether it was crossing worlds or in the main world, he could quickly improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>The biggest benefit of crossing worlds for Lin Yuan was being able to see cultivation systems outside of the main world, and to take advantage of the differences in dimensional levels.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Spirit Realm had no suppression on cosmic powers, so Lin Yuan took the opportunity to comprehend dozens of cosmic powers, more than a dozen high-level cosmic powers, and one origin-level cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>If this were in the main world, it would basically be impossible to achieve. Even if Lin Yuan forcibly did it by relying on his extraordinary comprehension, it would waste a lot of time and delay his future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, the various powers of creation were placed before Lin Yuan, equivalent to having the correct direction, so naturally it was quick to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>But in the main world, cosmic powers could not be replicated, and Lin Yuan could only comprehend from scratch, and in the end he might even go down the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have thoroughly comprehended the rules of space, I can try to challenge the second floor of the Black Tower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly. In the past few years, he had challenged the second floor of the Black Tower with the purpose of tempering his use of cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>He never really thought about passing through.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan wanted to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Thoroughly comprehending the complete rules of space was a qualitative change for Lin Yuan, and it was an all-round qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>In terms of killing, defense, self-preservation, etc., they all achieved a qualitative improvement.</p><p></p><p>An eighth-stage powerhouse, as long as they thoroughly comprehended the complete rules of space, could make those eighth-stage invincibles suffer. Even if more eighth-stage invincibles surrounded and attacked, they could not possibly deal with an existence that had mastered the complete rules of space.</p><p></p><p>A life that had thoroughly comprehended the rules of space, with a single thought, could roam through countless spatial layers. Those eighth-stage invincibles probably couldn't even touch him.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>A trace of Lin Yuan's mental will descended to the Demon Jade space in an instant through the Demon Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>In front of the majestic nine-story Black Tower, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan with a smile and said, "Here to challenge the second floor again?"</p><p></p><p>In the past few years, every time Lin Yuan rested, he would come to challenge the second floor of the Black Tower. The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>Watching Lin Yuan challenge the second floor was one of the few joys in its long and boring years.</p><p></p><p>It was infinitely better than falling into an almost eternal slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived at the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how long this little fellow plans to temper his cosmic powers."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji silently thought to itself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was using the second floor of the Black Tower to temper his own cosmic powers, which it had long seen through.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan appeared on the second floor of the Black Tower, a heavy pressure came from all directions.</p><p></p><p>If it were before, Lin Yuan would definitely use various cosmic powers to resist at the first opportunity. The pressure from the second floor could not be blocked by a trace of mental will.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After mastering the complete rules of space.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, Lin Yuan formed an "Absolute Space" around himself.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Space was a high-end application of spatial power, eliminating the enveloping pressure from the spatial level. The area around Lin Yuan seemed to be only a few feet, but in essence, it was separated by countless spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary eighth-stage evolved beings, when facing Absolute Space, let alone approaching, all attacks would be trapped in layers of space.</p><p></p><p>An eighth-stage life that had mastered the complete rules of space might not be able to kill an eighth-stage invincible, but it could definitely make an eighth-stage invincible very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>For example, banishing an eighth-stage invincible into the depths of the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>There was no distinction between up, down, left and right, and it was not an easy thing for an eighth-stage invincible to break free. They might even be trapped for decades.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to even use cosmic powers?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows. At this moment, he was standing on the second floor, and the surrounding space was slightly distorted, dissipating all the enveloping pressure.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was also clear that he was currently at the starting position of the second floor. As he got closer and closer to the central staircase, the pressure around him would become greater and greater.</p><p></p><p>At that time, relying solely on Absolute Space would make it difficult to perfectly resist all the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Especially when entering the middle area, endless pressure would condense into illusory creatures and attack Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how far I can go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't have much confidence in passing through the second floor of the Black Tower. The main reason was that after thoroughly comprehending the complete rules of space, his strength had greatly increased, so he wanted to come and try.</p><p></p><p>It would be better if he succeeded, and even if he failed, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pretty much used the second floor of the Black Tower as a standard to test his own strength.</p><p></p><p>According to the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, the cultivators who could pass through the second floor of the Black Tower were basically the strong among the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Although the various means of ninth-stage lives were not only about mastering various rules and cosmic powers, it was also a very important aspect.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could pass through the second floor of the Black Tower, even if he couldn't be considered a powerhouse among the ninth stage, he would still be stronger than more than half of the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Outside the nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was watching Lin Yuan's performance with great interest.</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan came to challenge the second floor of the Black Tower, it would pay close attention. It could pass the boring time.</p><p></p><p>However, when it saw that Lin Yuan was able to easily resist the heavy pressure from the second floor of the Black Tower just by standing there, without relying on cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>It was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji carefully observed Lin Yuan, especially the slightly distorted space around him.</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow has comprehended the complete rules of space?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue was a little dazed. It remembered that a few years ago, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules of space was not ordinary, but there was definitely still a long way to go before fully mastering it.</p><p></p><p>How did he suddenly comprehend it now?</p>

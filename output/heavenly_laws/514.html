        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for the time rivers of the hundreds of surrounding universes? Just a slight tremor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, every time a new 12th level being ascends, it causes similar phenomena, but far less intense than Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance caused by Lin Yuan's ascension exceeded the limits of his universe's time river, radiating to affect hundreds of nearby universes. </p><p></p><p>That's why the 12th level ultimates in hundreds of universes were shocked. They hadn't observed anyone ascending on the banks of their own universe's time river.</p><p></p><p>But such tremors and shaking coming from the banks of the time river? This was a sign of a new ultimate ascending! The 12th level ultimates in the hundreds of surrounding universes were puzzled, as they had no idea of the source of the tremors on the shore.</p><p></p><p>But for the many alien 12th level beings waiting on the shore for the Milky Way Star Lord to ascend, their minds were in a muddle.</p><p></p><p>They had hoped to observe some of the Milky Way Star Lord's background from his ascension, to determine how to deal with human civilization and the Milky Way Star Lord in the future.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they did see some of the Milky Way Star Lord's background, but it terrified all the 12th level ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"Such an enormous body? How incredibly robust must the Milky Way Star Lord's life essence be..." The ultimate of the Starry Sky Alliance was inwardly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The size of the body manifested on the banks of the time river wasn't simply a matter of multiples.</p><p></p><p>For example, if my life essence is twice as strong as yours, my body on the time river bank wouldn't simply be twice your size. </p><p></p><p>It's not calculated that way.</p><p></p><p>The rules on the banks of the time river are extremely strict. Even doubling one's life essence would at most result in being slightly taller here.</p><p></p><p>So among the many 12th level ultimates on the shore, except for those two peak Realm-Breaking stage beings from the Calamity Race, they were basically all similar in size.</p><p></p><p>Even 12th level beings like the Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the Queen Mother of Myriad Transformations, who were close to the peak of the Realm-Breaking stage, appeared the same size as other 12th level ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The height of these 12th level beings only reached his knees.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if Lin Yuan casually walked by and accidentally kicked them, it would be enough to severely injure these 12th level ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"Even at the peak of the Realm-Breaking stage, one shouldn't have such an enormous body, right?" The minds of the 12th level ultimates trembled one after another.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan had even entered the 12th level, they had anticipated that the Milky Way Star Lord's combat power would be terrifying once he attained the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>But who could have imagined it would be this terrifying? Peak of the Realm-Breaking stage? Those two ultimates from the Calamity Race were also at the peak of the Realm-Breaking stage, but their height on the banks of the time river only reached the Milky Way Star Lord's waist.</p><p></p><p>These 12th level ultimates, in front of Lin Yuan, were like children playing house - he could take them out with one kick each.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Realm? Could it be that the Milky Way Star Lord is already at the Sovereign Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how could he enter the Sovereign Realm right after reaching the Realm-Breaking stage? What logic is this?"</p><p></p><p>The many 12th level beings gazed at the slowly ascending Milky Way Star Lord, their expressions terrified as they quickly communicated.</p><p></p><p>They had previously obtained information from outside the universe, and knew the divisions within the 12th level. They understood that above the Realm-Breaking stage were the Sovereign and Chaos Realms.</p><p></p><p>And now, given the Milky Way Star Lord's body size, which already exceeded their understanding of the Realm-Breaking stage, they instinctively speculated whether he might be at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of what realm the Milky Way Star Lord is in now, it's beyond what we can resist."</p><p></p><p>The Universe Race ultimate steadied himself and looked at the other 12th level ultimates, saying: "From now on, my Universe Race will contract our territory as much as possible. You all can decide what to do."</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Lord's dominance was already established. He was now invincible within this universe. Even if all these 12th level ultimates joined forces, they couldn't resist him.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Universe Race ultimate made this decision.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice.</p><p></p><p>The importance of territory to a peak race goes without saying. Vast territories can nurture more life, and more life can give birth to many powerful beings. From these powerful beings emerge even stronger ones, until finally new 12th level ultimates are born.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer, territory is the foundation of all races.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the twelve peak races had been at war for years, and wasn't it all for universal territory? But as important as territory is, it's not as important as the survival of the race.</p><p></p><p>After the Milky Way Star Lord's ascension, he would sweep across the universe in his strongest form. If the Universe Race still occupied large swaths of territory at this time, wouldn't that be seeking death?</p><p></p><p>"Our race should contract as well."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, the times ahead will likely be very difficult to endure."</p><p></p><p>The many 12th level ultimates looked at each other, their expressions gloomy.</p><p></p><p>By contracting their racial forces and retreating to within the range covered by their race's guardian weapons, thus concentrating all their power, they might have a chance to barely survive.</p><p></p><p>The two ultimates of the Calamity Race were also observing Lin Yuan's ascension from afar.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of incredibly powerful physique and soul could nurture such an enormous life essence?" One of the Calamity Race ultimates sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although life essence isn't directly related to combat power, the stronger the life essence, the more it enhances both attack and defense.</p><p></p><p>The saying "one force overwhelming ten" isn't for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the minds of the two Calamity Race ultimates, they had almost concluded that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of some great saint. The reincarnation of a great saint basically meant invincibility at the same level, and with such an enormous life essence, fighting across realms would also be normal.</p><p></p><p>"Our race should also contract its territory."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Race ultimate on the right pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"I was thinking the same thing."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Race ultimate on the left nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the Calamity Race hadn't participated in the encirclement and assassination attempt against the Milky Way Star Lord, and had even tipped him off, which should count as a merit.</p><p></p><p>But if they relied on this merit and didn't retreat at all, if it happened to displease the Milky Way Star Lord, that would be trouble.</p><p></p><p>The two Calamity Race ultimates naturally didn't want to take this risk. They had ways to survive this cosmic era, and there was no need to quibble over gains and losses in a single cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Calamity Race had a small population. Even if they contracted 90% of their territory, it would be more than enough and wouldn't have much impact.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan crossed onto the banks of the time river in just a few steps.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what it feels like on the shore?" Lin Yuan looked around. The dozens of 12th level ultimates were now trying to stay as far away from him as possible.</p><p></p><p>"They're all tiny." Lin Yuan towered over them all, looking down at the 12th level ultimates who only reached his knees.</p><p></p><p>"My life essence indeed surpasses the peak of the Realm-Breaking stage." Lin Yuan also glanced at those two ultimates from the Calamity Race, estimating inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In terms of combat power, he had thoroughly reached the Sovereign Realm, but his level was still at the Realm-Breaking stage. His life essence similarly surpassed the peak of the Realm-Breaking stage.</p><p></p><p>"I can't be arrogant. In this universe, I am indeed standing at the highest point, but on the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent? In the Chaos Void? I'm still far from it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts, having a clear understanding of himself. On the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent, he had</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A manifestation avatar was stationed there, having observed the river of time in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The river of time in the chaotic void was the main channel, its vastness countless times greater than the tributaries of time within the universe. On its banks stood terrifyingly immense figures.</p><p></p><p>Many of these figures were as tall as heaven and earth. Even the slightest movement from them could affect the main channel of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic void is the source of the path of evolution. The evolutionary paths and pursuits of the many Chaos Venerables and Great Saints far surpass what life forms within the universe can comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. </p><p></p><p>The chaotic void had given birth to countless universes. Compared to the cruel chaotic void, universes were more like cradles, protecting the level 12 life forms inside from harm.</p><p></p><p>Although the great destruction of a universe meant over a 50% death rate for level 12 life forms.</p><p></p><p>But in the chaotic void? The death rate for level 12 Path-Breaking Realm life forms was far higher than 50%. Those passing Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm beings, or some unknown dangerous places, were all threats to level 12 Path-Breaking Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>Even the peak Sovereign Realm 'Cang Wei Yang' had perished in the Tai Yuan Ruins, let alone those in the Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, only Chaos Realm beings could say they were unlikely to die. Below the Chaos Realm, many crises left beings unable to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The aura on the banks"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked in all directions. After successfully reaching the shore, his level 12 life essence allowed Lin Yuan's senses to improve immensely.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the special environment on the banks of the river of time, as soon as he settled down, Lin Yuan once again entered a state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Sensing your environment, you gain enlightenment of the Great Dao of Life]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Sensing your environment, you gain enlightenment of the Great Dao of Matter]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Sensing your environment, you gain enlightenment of the Great Dao of Cause and Effect]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Sensing your environment, your understanding of space-time deepens.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Sensing your environment, your understanding of chaos deepens.]</p><p></p><p>All at once, unprecedented inspiration flooded Lin Yuan's mind. Various pillar-level rules underwent qualitative changes, becoming Great Dao level insights.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao transcended rules of the same level. When Lin Yuan comprehended the rules of chaos before, he had incidentally enlightened to some Great Daos, but altogether they numbered only a few dozen.</p><p></p><p>But now, having just entered level 12 not long ago, he had already enlightened to over a hundred Great Daos. The transformation brought by his increased life level not only elevated Lin Yuan's perspective, but also caused a terrifying improvement in his extraordinary comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>"Seven levels of space-time" Lin Yuan's understanding of space-time was rapidly improving.</p><p></p><p>If he had remained only within the universe, even after entering level 12, even with his extraordinary comprehension, Lin Yuan's understanding of space-time would not have improved so quickly.</p><p></p><p>But with an avatar constantly stationed on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, able to observe the space-time of the chaotic void at any time, where space-time was more complete and profound, the benefits to Lin Yuan were that much greater.</p><p></p><p>"And then there's the rules of chaos." Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded, his gaze faintly penetrating the barriers of the universe to look toward the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>As the fundamental rules of all things, one can imagine how difficult and obscure the rules of chaos were.</p><p></p><p>Normally, only Chaos Venerables were qualified to deeply comprehend the rules of chaos, but Lin Yuan's comprehension was extraordinary, and he had already begun to gradually grasp the essence of the chaos rules.</p><p></p><p>At level 11, it was already Lin Yuan's limit to barely comprehend the rules of chaos, with no way to gain deeper insights. But now it was different - the leap in his life level allowed Lin Yuan to see more of the mysteries of chaos.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the ultimate level had an enormous impact on human civilization and the myriad races of the stars, drawing the attention of countless powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight Supreme Beings returned, they officially announced that the Milky Way Star Lord had successfully entered level 12.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord has entered level 12, hahaha, after 2 million years, our human civilization has finally produced a tenth Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord is not just a simple Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord is too amazing."</p><p></p><p>Countless evolvers and citizens of human civilization were excitedly discussing. The addition of another Supreme Being would have an incomparably profound and far-reaching impact on the entire human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"I, Chi Kun, have taught a Supreme Being?" Chi Kun Star Lord looked at the numerous congratulatory messages flooding in, countless thoughts arising in his mind. He felt as if he were floating on air, like it wasn't real.</p><p></p><p>Although he had long known that the Milky Way Star Lord had a great chance of becoming a Supreme Being, when the day actually arrived, Chi Kun Star Lord still felt incredibly dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Chi Kun Star Lord had sensed the space-time fluctuations and was extremely worried, deeply afraid that Lin Yuan might encounter some accident in his breakthrough to the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>Now that the dust had settled, Chi Kun Star Lord wondered if he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother has become a Supreme Being?"</p><p></p><p>The several peak masters of the Chi Kun lineage beside him were filled with mixed emotions. That once naive little junior brother had now become an invincible powerhouse overlooking the starry universe?</p><p></p><p>"In the future, never address him like that again." The Great Peak Master seemed to think of something and looked toward the many peak masters with a warning.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The Chi Kun lineage peak masters were startled and immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Chi Kun Star Lord, as senior brothers of the Chi Kun lineage, they had not provided any substantial help to Lin Yuan. Continuing to call him "little junior brother" would be somewhat presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization had always respected the strong. When latecomers rose to high positions, forms of address naturally needed to change. Lin Yuan had a very good temperament - when he reached levels 8, 9, 10, and 11, he had allowed the Chi Kun lineage peak masters to address each other as before.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Milky Way Star Lord had entered level 12 and become a Supreme Being, even if he was still willing to let them maintain their original forms of address, the peak masters wouldn't dare to do so.</p><p></p><p>Deep in space.</p><p></p><p>Inside a secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The massive Ma Duo Traveler was elated. Looking at the seated Si Zhong Ancient God not far away, he said excitedly: "Ancestor, your insight was truly unique. Back then you told me not to offend the Milky Way Star Lord, and now it's clear that was the correct decision."</p><p></p><p>Ma Duo Traveler felt extremely fortunate. In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he had had a conflict with the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Later, on his ancestor's orders, he had risked offending the Tianyu Clan to forcefully befriend the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Looking back now, how could that decision be merely wise? Ma Duo Traveler could already imagine how terrified he would be now, hearing that the Milky Way Star Lord had entered level 12, if he hadn't mended his relationship with him back then.</p><p></p><p>"Your ancestor's insight naturally needs no explanation." Si Zhong Ancient God let out a light breath, suppressing the shock in his heart and forcing himself to speak calmly.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Si Zhong Ancient God's shock was no less than Ma Duo Traveler's. He had indeed predicted that the Milky Way Star Lord had the potential to enter level 12, but he never imagined it would happen so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Star Sea Calendar year 2,609,782, human civilization gave birth to its tenth Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

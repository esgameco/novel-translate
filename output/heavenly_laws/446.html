            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 446 In the Palm of One's Hand (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>As the greatest genius in the history of human civilization, Lin Yuan knew many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts from other races all yearned to establish a relationship with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because of human civilization, but also Lin Yuan's own potential.</p><p></p><p>Given the cultivation speed Lin Yuan had displayed, he was the most promising candidate to break through to the ultimate realm and ascend to the 11th Realm in the current era.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord was absolutely among them.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't want to have a good relationship with a future 12th Realm Ultimate?</p><p></p><p>Why did the Ancient God of the Central Realm have such a lofty status in the cosmic starry sky? Even the peak force groups did not dare to provoke him too much?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it because this Ancient God had "sponsored" and supported him when he had not yet reached the 12th Realm?</p><p></p><p>But being acquainted was one thing, being considered a "close friend", especially with an alien race, was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept towards the fierce battle raging tens of millions of miles away, between two groups of powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>One side was from the Insect Clan, the other was from the Nether Clan.</p><p></p><p>Both were peak force groups, and although the Insect Clan only had four experts here, three of them were Insect Clan Matriarchs who had summoned a large number of 11th Realm Insect Clan warriors, engaging the five Nether Clan experts in a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>In terms of momentum, the Insect Clan, although outnumbered, was pressing the Nether Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba Ancient God."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recognized one of the figures among the Insect Clan, blending in with the swarm of Insect Clan warriors, exerting pressure on the besieged five Nether Clan experts.</p><p></p><p>It was Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a strong impression of this Cosmic Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had taken away his friend Fang Qing's spiritual will, attempting to "blackmail" Lin Yuan in hopes of obtaining resources to break through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Later, in the 2D world, Lin Yuan had seized the opportunity to kill Tuoba Ancient God once, though only his clone had died.</p><p></p><p>Now, shortly after entering the core battlefield, he had encountered this Cosmic Ancient God again.</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental, then I'll kill him again."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan could never be successfully "blackmailed" by Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>But the feeling of being threatened made him very uncomfortable, and now that he had encountered him again, he naturally wouldn't let him go.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Tuoba Ancient God belonged to the Insect Clan Alliance, which was already hostile to the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Even if Tuoba Ancient God wasn't there, Lin Yuan would have casually crushed him.</p><p></p><p>In the vast mountain range, the spatial rules were in turmoil. The five Nether Clan 11th Realm experts frowned, while fending off the endless waves of Insect Clan warriors and resisting the soul attacks from the three Insect Clan Matriarchs, as well as Tuoba Ancient God's sneak attacks.</p><p></p><p>"These insects are so annoying."</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, let's use the ultimate weapon."</p><p></p><p>One Nether Clan expert with twin horns on his head transmitted a message.</p><p></p><p>"Use the ultimate weapon?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Nether Clan experts hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate weapon was a devastating trump card.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be used lightly, and activating the ultimate weapon would also consume a lot.</p><p></p><p>But in the current situation, if they continued to stalemate, it would be meaningless. They had to use the ultimate weapon to break out of the Insect Clan warriors' encirclement.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba, they are going to activate the ultimate weapon."</p><p></p><p>On the Insect Clan side, one of the Insect Clan Matriarchs seemed to sense something, immediately transmitting a message to Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God's expression became grave, ready to activate his own ultimate weapon at any moment.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the opportunity, Tuoba Ancient God quickly thought, "The Galactic Overlord, how can his strength be so powerful? He was actually able to kill Mingche?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God was now filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that with his own strength, combined with the ultimate weapon bestowed by the Insect Clan, he would have no problem surviving on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that so many peak force groups would use all their trump cards for the control of this super-large-scale battlefield. The Insect Clan Alliance, as the dominant force on this battlefield, absolutely had the ability to suppress even those wielding 11th Realm ultimate weapons.</p><p></p><p>This was something the Insect Clan Matriarchs had not told Tuoba Ancient God before he entered the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As a special life form compared to the Insect Clan members, Tuoba Ancient God was an outsider, and many battle secrets were unknown to him.</p><p></p><p>Even if the intensity of the super-large-scale battle was unimaginable, with Tuoba Ancient God's own strength plus the ultimate weapon, he still had a good chance of surviving.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God was only at the 5th level of the 11th Realm, but he was the true body, much stronger than a clone. Especially some of his trump cards, which could be comparable to the 11th Realm Perfected.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Overlord's strength was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God had no doubt that if he encountered the Galactic Overlord on the battlefield, the latter would not hesitate to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm in my true body, I can't take any risks. I'll hide in the Insect Clan Alliance's war base and not come out."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God had already made up his mind, even if it meant losing a lot of merit, his life was the most important.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after learning of the Galactic Overlord's strength, Tuoba Ancient God had the idea of withdrawing from the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But once he entered the battlefield, there was no turning back, unless he could hold out until certain key points in the war, otherwise there was no possibility of withdrawing midway.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>On the Nether Clan side, a terrifying aura emerged, and the leader of the Nether Clan experts held a "pagoda" weapon, the golden energy beginning to permeate in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God also quickly activated his gray "bell", a defensive ultimate weapon, but it also had the ability to suppress.</p><p></p><p>Just as the auras of the two ultimate weapons were about to collide...</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The figure of a young man materialized between the two groups of powerful experts in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The young man's sleeves fluttered, and a golden-yellow force field descended, in just an instant, suppressing the ultimate weapons of the Nether Clan and Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>The five Nether Clan experts were the first to look up at the young man. "It's the Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>"Trouble."</p><p></p><p>The five Nether Clan experts immediately became nervous.</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew very well about the Galactic Overlord's battle achievements, killing the Mingche who possessed an ultimate weapon, directly placing the Galactic Overlord at the top of the tens of thousands of 11th Realm experts on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>The four Insect Clan Matriarchs had grim expressions, as the Human Civilization and the Insect Clan were originally enemies. Now that the Galactic Overlord had suddenly descended, his intentions were clear.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat."</p><p></p><p>Three Insect Clan Matriarchs unhesitatingly abandoned the large number of Insect Clan warriors and fled as streaks of light towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the many 11th Realm experts of the Insect Clan Alliance, unless they were the strongest few, they would absolutely not dare to resist the Galactic Overlord alone.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God, who was in the midst of activating the "bell" ultimate weapon, was in a panic.</p><p></p><p>The core battlefield was vast and boundless, and even though Tuoba Ancient God knew the Galactic Overlord's strength, he was still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was once enough to just hide in the war base to preserve one's life.</p><p></p><p>But now? Even before reaching the war base, he had encountered the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Can you escape?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the frantically fleeing three Insect Clan mother nests, his mind stirring, as the Xuanhuang force field crushed down, two of the three Insect Clan mother nests were directly blown apart, leaving only one Insect Clan mother nest, its surface faintly glowing with a crystalline light.</p><p></p><p>"An ultimate weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at it again.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even the passive Xuanhuang force field could resist very few Eleventh Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang force field, vast as the ocean, once again enveloped the Tuoba Ancient God who was also planning to flee.</p><p></p><p>The bell-shaped ultimate weapon's aura spread, briefly resisting the Xuanhuang force field, but the Tuoba Ancient God felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>According to the Insect Clan powerhouse's judgment of the Galactic Overlord's killing of Mingche, as long as one was enveloped by the Galactic Overlord's released Xuanhuang-colored ultimate weapon, it would be difficult to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord, your enmity with the Insect Clan, the Diyu Clan does not want to get involved. Feel free to deal with the Insect Clan, we'll take our leave first."</p><p></p><p>The five Diyu Clan powerhouses also took the opportunity to flee into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"You all stay as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at them, not intending to let the Diyu Clan go.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were also in possession of an ultimate weapon, how could he let them go.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang force field, tangible as substance, pinned down the three ultimate weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord, could it be that you think you can outlast us three?"</p><p></p><p>The five Diyu Clan powerhouses were filled with shock and anger, trapped within the Xuanhuang force field, they could hardly move, as if sinking into a muddy swamp.</p><p></p><p>Ultimate weapons cannot be destroyed, the only way to kill the Eleventh Realm wielders of ultimate weapons is to exhaust them.</p><p></p><p>Exhaust the Eleventh Realm wielders of ultimate weapons until they can no longer activate the ultimate weapons.</p><p></p><p>"You can try."</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan used his full strength, the Insect Clan and Diyu Clan powerhouses would not be able to hold out for long.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>Since they had already fallen into the trap, their life and death were in Lin Yuan's hands, there was no need to expose more.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In just over an hour, the Tuoba Ancient God could no longer hold out.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord, as long as you spare me, any condition is acceptable." The Tuoba Ancient God transmitted.</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to try to break through to the ultimate, even though the chances were not high, but he had to try, just in case? Stepping into the Twelfth Realm, shaking the cosmic starry sky, even becoming one of the peak power's wielders.</p><p></p><p>But now, all of this was extremely distant from the Tuoba Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head, with his current strength, the Tuoba Ancient God was useless, not even worth keeping as a slave.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>A resolute expression appeared on the Tuoba Ancient God's face, he began to burn everything, trying his best to activate the ultimate weapon, wanting to break free from the confinement of the Xuanhuang force field.</p><p></p><p>But alas, it was all in vain, in the end, the aura of the bell-shaped ultimate weapon quickly faded, and the Tuoba Ancient God, under the all-encompassing Xuanhuang force field, was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The vast blood, spirit, and soul power, refined by the primordial force, turned into the most fundamental essence, and was absorbed by Lin Yuan into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the bell-shaped ultimate weapon, casually glanced at it, and then stored it in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow suddenly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Tuoba Ancient God died within the Xuanhuang force field, Lin Yuan clearly felt the causal connection between himself and the Tuoba Ancient God disappear.</p><p></p><p>For such a situation to occur, there were only two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One was that the Tuoba Ancient God's comprehension of the causal rules far surpassed Lin Yuan's, so he could easily conceal his own causal line.</p><p></p><p>But this possibility was almost zero, comprehension of the rules was not something that could be achieved overnight, the previous moment Lin Yuan could still easily sense the Tuoba Ancient God's causal line, and the next moment he could no longer sense it? The Tuoba Ancient God's comprehension of the causal rules had suddenly surpassed Lin Yuan's by leaps and bounds? That was too unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>The second possibility was that the Tuoba Ancient God had completely perished.</p><p></p><p>The deceased Tuoba Ancient God, naturally had all his causality disappear, so Lin Yuan could no longer sense the connection between himself and the other party, which was very normal.</p><p></p><p>"This Tuoba Ancient God, the one that entered the battlefield was actually his true body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Only when the true body perished would all the projections also perish, and the causal line would directly disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that's right, the two-dimensional world just ended not long ago, the Tuoba Ancient God didn't have time to refine new projections, and with the ultimate weapon protecting him, sending his true body into the battlefield was very possible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instantly figured it out.</p><p></p><p>Although sending the true body into the battlefield required taking great risks.</p><p></p><p>But risks also meant opportunities, the true body's strength was superior to the projections, and with many trump cards, its final explosive power would also be far beyond the projections.</p><p></p><p>With the true body entering the battlefield, combined with the ultimate weapon, the Tuoba Ancient God's ability to preserve his life was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>"It was indeed the true body, carrying many treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a look at the Tuoba Ancient God's spatial bracelet, where a large amount of resource treasures were stored.</p><p></p><p>Since the Tuoba Ancient God had decided to enter the battlefield with his true body, he naturally brought all the accumulated treasures with him, after all, if the true body perished, these treasure resources would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>As a solitary special life form, the Tuoba Ancient God also had no clan ties, and did not have the idea of leaving the treasures for his descendants.</p><p></p><p>"This is a windfall."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, not to mention the harvest from killing the Tuoba Ancient God, completely eliminating a Eleventh Realm Fifth Rank powerhouse, in the human civilization's judgment, meant a huge amount of merit points.</p><p></p><p>After the Tuoba Ancient God's death.</p><p></p><p>That Insect Clan mother nest and the five Diyu Clan powerhouses also could not hold out, dying within Lin Yuan's Xuanhuang force field, all of it turning into the purest primordial force, becoming the nourishment for Lin Yuan's cultivation of the "Xuanhuang Body".</p><p></p><p>Putting away the two ultimate weapons, and taking stock of the other gains as well.</p><p></p><p>A sense of awe welled up in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>"When I faced the Tuoba Ancient God before, I could only rely on the deterrence of human civilization to suppress him, but in reality, the Tuoba Ancient God didn't even consider me worthy of his attention, otherwise he wouldn't have dared to 'extort' me."</p><p></p><p>"As an Eleventh Realm Ancient God, when I was only at the Ninth Realm, if it weren't for human civilization, the Tuoba Ancient God wouldn't have even spared me a glance. But now, even with an ultimate weapon, the Tuoba Ancient God died at my hands, killing him was no different from stepping on an ant."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself: "Strength, this is absolute strength."</p><p></p><p>A strong desire to become stronger surged in Lin Yuan's heart, now he could kill the Tuoba Ancient God, but the Twelfth Realm ultimate powerhouses, he estimated, could also kill him.</p><p></p><p>In the face of ultimate powerhouses, he was completely unable to resist, could only hide in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and barely protect himself.</p><p></p><p>"I must become an ultimate powerhouse."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was resolute, only by becoming an ultimate powerhouse could he have the capital to freely roam this universe, not just an ant in the eyes of the ultimate existences.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 701</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Vast, desolate void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan drifted along with the thin primordial chaos energy. </p><p></p><p>Except for entities like the Eye of All Laws that had deep karmic connections with Lin Yuan, other powerful beings wouldn't be able to detect even a trace of Lin Yuan's aura even if they passed by nearby.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit and form seemed to have merged with the infinite chaos energy and vast void.</p><p></p><p>"That dimensional rift?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually glanced in a certain direction. He had already sent out an avatar to go there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still quite cautious about dimensional rifts. </p><p></p><p>The 13th-tier weapon Heavenly Void Cauldron that Emperor Xuan obtained came from a dimensional rift. </p><p></p><p>In that dimensional rift, even Emperor Xuan with his invincible Great Saint realm strength almost suffered severe injuries. This showed how dangerous dimensional rifts could be.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's current strength far surpassed Emperor Xuan back then, he still wouldn't be careless.</p><p></p><p>Sending only an avatar showed confidence in himself, but was also mainly for probing first.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were hidden dangers in that dimensional rift that the Eye of All Laws hadn't detected,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would at most lose one avatar.</p><p></p><p>He could reform it with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>There would be no impact on himself.</p><p></p><p>"Hope everything goes smoothly," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Eye of All Laws guaranteed that as long as Lin Yuan made an attempt, their karmic debt would be cleared even if he didn't retrieve that Law Source Fruit in the end.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan naturally hoped things would go smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Eye of All Laws did save him a lot of trouble back then.</p><p></p><p>Without the Eye of All Laws, even with Lin Yuan's current strength, if he wanted to spread the branch path of martial arts evolution,</p><p></p><p>He would need to invest a great deal of effort and time, and might not even do as good a job as the Eye of All Laws in the end.</p><p></p><p>Even an invincible Great Saint could only oversee a certain era, and would ultimately still need to break through to the 13th tier.</p><p></p><p>But special existences like the Eye of All Laws were nearly eternal. As long as the primordial chaos void didn't collapse, it could continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The fourth level of 'Infinite Void' is about to be completed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly. He sent out a consciousness avatar to descend into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>The vast inner universe was boundless and endless. At this moment, it was about to complete a certain transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Stop."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately halted the final transformation of 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Infinite Void' inheritance I'm cultivating was created by a time lifeform of the primordial chaos void, with the primordial chaos void as the ultimate goal. Theoretically, when cultivated to the seventh level, the inner universe can transform into an existence equivalent to the scale of the primordial chaos void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even the time lifeform who created this inheritance hadn't cultivated to the so-called seventh level.</p><p></p><p>If one could truly cultivate the seventh level, they would be considered formidable even among 13th tier beings.</p><p></p><p>Even if they hadn't become a Time Lord, they probably wouldn't be far off.</p><p></p><p>In the second Source World, Master Wu Shan's pursuit was to paint a 'Source World'.</p><p></p><p>Once he achieved that, he would be able to join the ranks of Time Lords.</p><p></p><p>The 'Infinite Void' inheritance, on the other hand, was about nurturing a primordial chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Though the processes were different, their ultimate goals were similar.</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't descended to the first and second Source Worlds, I probably would have thought this inheritance was flawless. After all, it came from the hand of a great time lifeform. How could their insights and perspectives be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing two Source Worlds, Lin Yuan realized that even time lifeforms might not always be right.</p><p></p><p>For example, this 'Infinite Void' inheritance wasn't necessarily wrong, but was the inner universe it nurtured, comparable to the primordial chaos void, really perfect?</p><p></p><p>Even the primordial chaos void itself wasn't perfect and needed various time lifeforms to open up special places to make up for its deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>How could an inner universe nurtured based on the primordial chaos void be perfect?</p><p></p><p>It's just that.</p><p></p><p>The time lifeform who created this inheritance could only access the primordial chaos void dimension.</p><p></p><p>Without other more perfect dimensional spaces for reference, they couldn't realize this.</p><p></p><p>Even though time lifeforms could roam dimensional gaps, it was very difficult for them to contact and explore other dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, they couldn't find them.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, even if they found them, they would face strong rejection from the dimensional space itself.</p><p></p><p>As well as obstruction from the 13th tier time lifeforms born in that dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>For example, if time lifeforms from other dimensions tried to approach the primordial chaos void, they would naturally be stopped by the time lifeforms born from the primordial chaos void.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>Using the Gate of All Worlds, he could silently integrate into worlds within various dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>He even had two Source Worlds more perfect than the primordial chaos void.</p><p></p><p>In the first Source World, Lin Yuan observed the operation of the Source World's origin, as well as the miniature Source World nurtured within the Abyss Dragon's Heart.</p><p></p><p>His understanding and insights into that Source World even surpassed those of the primordial chaos void.</p><p></p><p>In the second Source World, Lin Yuan comprehended the half-finished Eternal Painting drawn by Master Wu Shan. This Eternal Painting depicted that Source World.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was Lord Tianguang's understanding of the rune 'Omnipotence'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also gained deep insights from this. While he may not have fully grasped the basic operation and essence of the second Source World, he certainly surpassed any Carefree Realm expert in that world.</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate transformation direction my inner universe pursues cannot be the primordial chaos void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself. With the primordial chaos void as the ultimate pursuit, it was uncertain whether one could even become a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Using all heavens and worlds, infinite dimensions and planes as the foundation - this should be the direction my inner universe will transform towards."</p><p></p><p>Flashes of the first and second Source Worlds appeared in Lin Yuan's mind, especially their essential operations. He began to slowly integrate them into his own inner universe.</p><p></p><p>These things had to be completed before finishing the fourth level of 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could he lay the foundation before his inner universe's base was set, in order to continuously integrate the essence of more Source Worlds in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The reason Source Worlds are called Source Worlds is because they are more perfect than other worlds of the same level, closer to true perfection. My inner universe absorbing the essential operations of Source Worlds will also be closer to perfection, and ultimately may have hope of becoming perfect."</p><p></p><p>"A perfect world? That's a world that only 14th tier perfect time lifeforms can create. Once my inner universe transforms to true perfection, I probably won't be far from becoming a 14th tier perfect time lifeform."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Lin Yuan's speculation. As for truly becoming a 14th tier perfect time lifeform? Lin Yuan didn't have much of a clue.</p><p></p><p>Perfect time lifeforms could freely roam timelines, existing in the past, present and future. They could even create the future they wanted. Such level of lifeforms were simply unimaginable to ordinary beings.</p><p></p><p>Master Wu Shan's ultimate pursuit was only to paint a Source World and join the ranks of Time Lords.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming a perfect time lifeform? The only thing Lin Yuan knew was that the prerequisite for a perfect time lifeform was perfection.</p><p></p><p>If his inner universe truly reached perfection, then perhaps he would be very close to becoming a perfect time lifeform?</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to integrate the operational essence of the two Source Worlds into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>For now, perfect time lifeforms were still too distant for him. He wasn't even a time lifeform yet.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The universe within his body continued to rumble.</p><p></p><p>His essence was being changed.</p><p></p><p>This change was different from the reconstruction and reorganization of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>It was the most fundamental existence being altered.</p><p></p><p>Like an iron knife becoming a golden knife.</p><p></p><p>In just a few hundred breaths,</p><p></p><p>The fundamental operations of the two source worlds were completely integrated into the universe within his body.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had long been preparing for this perfect integration of the advantages of the two source worlds into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was actually doing it, it naturally happened very quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's enter the fifth level of 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully felt for a while, then began the final transformation of his internal universe. The fifth level of "Infinite Void" was a turning point.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when a supreme saint cultivates to the fifth level of this inheritance, they would possess the strength of an invincible great saint.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan integrated the advantages of the two source worlds' fundamental operations before completing the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Along with the final transformation of the internal universe,</p><p></p><p>An intangible aura began to sweep through.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>The internal universe completed its transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The internal universe after fusion, and entering the fifth level of 'Infinite Void'"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again felt his strength increase.</p><p></p><p>"Now, even if it's just an avatar, I should be able to match Abyss Dragon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the avatar hadn't been nurtured,</p><p></p><p>The internal universe had still opened up normally.</p><p></p><p>It was just not as vast and boundless as the true body's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>With the internal universe perfectly integrating the advantages of two source worlds, plus entering the fifth level of "Infinite Void",</p><p></p><p>It naturally caused the avatar's strength to surge, thoroughly reaching the level of Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"One avatar is equivalent to an Abyss Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. When the first source world was initially opened, it gathered countless karmic forces of creation to give birth to an Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Now, an avatar he casually condensed could reach this realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is good, the hope of retrieving the Law Source Fruit is even greater."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Next to the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl was swinging her legs back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>A mysterious wave swept through.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl immediately jumped up.</p><p></p><p>"Entered the fifth level of 'Infinite Void'?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl's eyes widened, full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Although she had long known that Lin Yuan reaching this level was only a matter of time,</p><p></p><p>When the day actually came, it was still unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed was simply too fast.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Void" was a 13th-rank inheritance, not everyone could practice to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Even if they passed the initial test and were very compatible with this inheritance, those who could enter the fifth level were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Generally, only one in several hundred inheritance cultivators would reach the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, it wasn't a question of whether he could enter the fifth level or not.</p><p></p><p>It was that the speed at which he entered the fifth level was unbelievably fast.</p><p></p><p>It made the red-robed girl's understanding begin to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"No, wait!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the red-robed girl's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Although the aura sweeping through the internal universe was very similar to entering the fifth level of "Infinite Void",</p><p></p><p>After careful sensing, the red-robed girl was certain that this was different from the normal fifth level of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>Similar yet different.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form condensed not far away, smiling as he looked at the red-robed girl, "I just modified the 'Infinite Void' inheritance a bit."</p><p></p><p>Originally, "Infinite Void" pursued chaos void as its ultimate goal, but now the ultimate pursuit had changed to a higher, more perfect world, so naturally the intermediate cultivation methods needed to be modified.</p><p></p><p>"Modified?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl became even more silent.</p><p></p><p>Such a grand 13th-rank inheritance, the life's work of a Temporal Life, had basically reached the extreme in all aspects. Even other Temporal Lives might not be able to modify it, yet Lin Yuan directly modified it? What made the red-robed girl even more incredulous was that after modification, the fifth level of "Infinite Void" vaguely gave her an even more magnificent and profound feeling.</p><p></p><p>This was different from Lin Yuan's previous integration of other 13th-rank techniques.</p><p></p><p>This kind of modification was a change from the root of the inheritance, the two were completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the current 'Infinite Void' is more suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said with a smile. Only secret techniques and inheritances created by oneself could perfectly match oneself.</p><p></p><p>As for secret techniques and inheritances created by other beings? Even the great 13th-rank lives couldn't achieve perfect compatibility with every life.</p><p></p><p>They could only be relatively compatible.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl felt a bit confused in her heart, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>In front of a constantly shrinking dimensional rift.</p><p></p><p>More than ten figures stood not far away, gazing at the distant dimensional rift.</p><p></p><p>These more than ten figures were all supreme saints, strong beings invited by the Eye of Myriad Laws to enter the dimensional rift and retrieve the Law Source Fruit.</p><p></p><p>However now,</p><p></p><p>The expressions of all ten-plus supreme saints were extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift was rapidly shrinking, and their main battle bodies had not yet retreated, still fighting with the dimensional life on that small continent inside the rift.</p><p></p><p>The environment in the dimensional gap was completely different from that inside the chaos void. Even supreme saints would be greatly suppressed in such an unfamiliar environment.</p><p></p><p>"This dimensional rift will close completely in at most three days. If our main battle bodies can't make it back within three days..." One of the supreme saints couldn't help but speak.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the chaos void, the dimensional gap was extremely dangerous. Lives below the 13th rank were at risk of death at any time in the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>Once this dimensional rift closed, it would be equivalent to the main battle bodies of the ten-plus supreme saints present being completely trapped outside the chaos void, which was no different from perishing completely.</p><p></p><p>It was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Even for supreme saints, cultivating a main battle body was not easy and required dedication.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Zhu, have you told Elder Wan Fa? That Law Source Fruit is very difficult to retrieve now, we might as well retreat." A second supreme saint spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift would close within three days, and the hope of retrieving the Law Source Fruit within these three days was nearly zero.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the supreme saints naturally didn't want to continue fighting on that small continent, but wanted to retreat their main battle bodies.</p><p></p><p>This way, the losses would be less.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wan Fa said he has already requested support from other great saints, there is still hope."</p><p></p><p>Great Saint Feng Zhu said. He had the closest relationship with the Eye of Myriad Laws and knew many things in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Other great saints? The native creatures on that small continent outside the rift are extremely fierce. No matter how many more great saints are invited, it would be very difficult to retrieve the Law Source Fruit within three days."</p><p></p><p>The first supreme saint who spoke said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Zhu, which great saint exactly did Elder Wan Fa invite?"</p><p></p><p>A third supreme saint inquired, feeling that the Eye of Myriad Laws must have confidence since he hadn't given up.</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>The other supreme saints all looked towards Great Saint Feng Zhu.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wan Fa said he invited..."</p><p></p><p>Great Saint Feng Zhu swept his gaze over the many great saints and said slowly: "Great Saint Milky Way!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

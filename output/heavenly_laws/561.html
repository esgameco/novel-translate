        <h1>Chapter 561</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Kuijin Realm, Qi Yuan, dressed in a black robe with flowing white hair, had his avatar in the Qingshan Realm dissipate into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... Cultivating diligently... How can it compare to the speed of plundering?" </p><p></p><p>With just a single strike, he had slain countless demonic gods, not just tens of thousands, but an entire world domain.</p><p></p><p>The massive influx of experience was far quicker than slow cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao looked at Qi Yuan with astonishment, their hearts filled with unspoken words, as they could not yet comprehend what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the two of them and casually asked, "Do you know what exactly is in the Shenmu Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>The blind woman in the Shenmu Abyss had once given him eight wooden tablets containing forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>The wooden tablets had long since disappeared, but the eight forging techniques remained in his mind - metal, wood, water, fire, earth, cloud, rain, and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng was surprised that Qi Yuan would ask about this. He furrowed his brow and thoughtfully replied, "The Shenmu Abyss is a realm of nothingness, with no living beings. Ancient ancestral gods have said that the Shenmu Abyss may be the origin of the Shenmu Universe."</p><p></p><p>"The origin of the universe?" Qi Yuan murmured, "And there are no living beings inside?"</p><p></p><p>"No," Shangguan Qingteng said, "Throughout history, many ancestral gods have explored the Shenmu Abyss, but none have found any living beings."</p><p></p><p>In the Shenmu Universe, nearly all worlds had a Shenmu Abyss. Qi Yuan had just manifested into countless forms and entered most of the Shenmu Universes, but had found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"If the senior wishes to know more about the Shenmu Abyss, you can go to the Taixing Realm, where the original copy of the 'Origin Esoterica' is kept," Shangguan Qingteng said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strange or mysterious Qi Yuan's appearance was, he was still a part of the Shenmu Universe, and had just acted against the demonic gods, making him worthy of their recruitment.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had hoped that when Qi Yuan reached the Primal level, he could be nurtured as a seed to guide the Shenmu Universe towards the light.</p><p></p><p>But now... how could he be a mere seed?</p><p></p><p>"The Taixing Realm?" Qi Yuan's gaze was deep and thoughtful, "I will go there, but not now... Once I have completed my 'Becoming Mortal' journey, I will go to the Taixing Realm and also visit the Sheng Nü."</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his sleeve, his figure vanished once more, leaving Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>"We must report this to the Primal as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"As for this 'Becoming Mortal', it means experiencing the ways of the mundane world..."</p><p></p><p>In an unknown world, Qi Yuan was fishing alone in the desert.</p><p></p><p>His fishing line had sunk deep into the sand, over a hundred meters down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan sat quietly fishing, his mind at peace.</p><p></p><p>"For the white-haired Qi Yuan, 'Becoming Mortal' is a breakthrough beyond the Ancestral God realm. </p><p></p><p>But for me... 'Becoming Mortal' is a means to comprehend the rules of the world."</p><p></p><p>The myriad things in the world operate in an orderly manner, hiding the true principles of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Dao requires a balance of tension and relaxation, of tightness and looseness.</p><p></p><p>The 'tightness' refers to slaying demonic spirits to increase experience.</p><p>The 'looseness' refers to comprehending the rules of the Dao, understanding all things.</p><p></p><p>"So... why am I fishing for sand?"</p><p></p><p>"What can I catch?"</p><p></p><p>"I can catch... a single grain of sand."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan's fishing line trembled.</p><p></p><p>A single grain of sand was lifted up.</p><p></p><p>This ordinary grain of sand was no different from the others.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the sand grain and extended his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally found you, or rather... found myself."</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a Realm Lord, he no longer needed to play a role.</p><p>He only needed to find himself.</p><p></p><p>This self, was the one he had invested his own blood into when the game collapsed.</p><p>His blood had merged into the Shenmu Universe, becoming a part of all things.</p><p>This grain of sand was one of them.</p><p></p><p>As the sand touched Qi Yuan's arm, it vanished.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze was calm, timeless.</p><p></p><p>The life and memories of the sand flowed through his mind.</p><p>It had once been buried deep in the seabed, shrouded in darkness. It had seen a fish grow legs and crawl onto the land; it had also seen a white, jade-like finger bone sink into the ocean depths.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators and experts had fought to find this finger bone.</p><p></p><p>Later, the sea dried up, and the land turned to desert.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the life of the sand, or rather... my life?"</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked up, his gaze deep and distant: "It is time for the battle flag."</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, appearing in the gaps between worlds.</p><p>The void was filled with chaotic currents, extremely dangerous, where ordinary people could not survive even a moment.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan grasped the tattered corner of a flag.</p><p></p><p>【The broken battle flag of the Hongxing Realm, over three thousand years, the war in the Taixing Realm was fierce, the Hongxing Realm sent a great army to support, carrying the Hongxing flag.</p><p>The great battle lasted thirty-six years, the Hongxing army was besieged in the city, defending for seven years, until the battle flag fell.】</p><p></p><p>The fragment in his hand was the battle flag of the Hongxing Realm, and also a part of Qi Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>A flood of memories poured in, and Qi Yuan's gaze grew profound.</p><p>He seemed to see the joy of an elderly man forging the battle flag, and the weaving woman, her eyes dimming, still embroidering under the dim lamp.</p><p></p><p>The battle flag fluttered in the wind, the army cheered and drank their parting wine, rushing to the frontlines.</p><p>In the end, the flag was stained with blood, and the once unbreakable battle flag was finally cut down and torn to shreds.</p><p></p><p>"This is the battle flag, and also myself."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan seemed to have become the battle flag, witnessing history as an observer, quietly watching this world.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I now?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p>He had once shed his blood into the Shenmu, manifesting into countless forms.</p><p>The 'self' he needed to find... was too much, too many.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Qi Yuan's figure disappeared, becoming a mystery.</p><p>There were many who wanted to find him, but could never succeed.</p><p>Only occasionally, some passersby would claim to have seen a white-haired man, his eyes hollow and dazed, muttering something to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Taixing Realm.</p><p>In the grand palace, Primal sat on the main seat, wearing tattered armor stained with blood that could not be washed off, constantly corroding the armor.</p><p></p><p>The hall was filled with nearly all the powerful experts of the Taixing Realm. </p><p>Their expressions were grave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a bearded man angrily said, "Hundreds of years ago, when we only had half a Luminous Treasure, Primal dared to go to the Void Sea alone to block the Hei Tian and Hei Di. Now we have seven Luminous Treasures, why don't we dare to attack?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the Hei Tian and Hei Di had again massed their troops at the Void Sea. Their forces were much stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>There were many different voices in the Taixing Realm regarding how to deal with the Hei Tian and Hei Di.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... the Hei Tian and Hei Di are just probing. If we gather all our forces and rashly go to war, the fragile balance maintained for millions of years may be shattered in an instant," said an elder with white brows, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>"What fragile balance? It's just barely surviving," the bearded man retorted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What, are we still hoping that the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth will have a change of heart?" the irritable big-bearded man said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"The seeds of the Luminous Treasures have not yet fully grown, and this old man only wishes to give them a little more time to grow." The white-browed elder said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"Whether we fight or not, it does not actually depend on us." A Confucian-robed woman said, "Every time the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth invade, we may... be destroyed. Whether we resist or flatter them, the outcome will not change.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth have not destroyed the Divine Wood Universe yet is because... the limit has not been reached."</p><p></p><p>The Confucian-robed woman spoke in riddles.</p><p></p><p>But everyone present could understand.</p><p></p><p>When the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth first invaded, the Radiant Dao Master, across the endless universe and endless void, drew a line in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>At first, the people of the Humanity Awakening did not know what that line meant.</p><p></p><p>Later, they gradually understood that this line was also called the timeline.</p><p></p><p>The timeline is constantly shrinking and collapsing.</p><p></p><p>When the timeline completely disappears, becoming a single point, that will be the time when the Divine Wood Universe is completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the timeline is less than a hundred thousand years away.</p><p></p><p>For an individual, a hundred thousand years is a long time, but on the scale of the universe, a hundred thousand years is just a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>"So the outcome of this battle does not affect the result... so this old man feels... it's better not to interfere, just to avoid dying in vain. It's better to accumulate strength and wait for the ultimate battle, to the utmost brilliance." The white-browed elder said.</p><p></p><p>"Retreating a step today, retreating ten steps tomorrow, the ultimate battle... Isn't it going to retreat a million steps?" the irritable big-bearded man said.</p><p></p><p>The people in the hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Heavens are too mysterious, too powerful, making people desperate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the seated leader, Yuan, spoke: "Which six people will go with me to the Void Sea this time?"</p><p></p><p>He made the decision with a single strike of the gavel.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yuan's words, the rest of the people, even if they were unwilling in their hearts, did not say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Yuan, the leader, had a majestic presence as deep as the sea, and no one objected to his decision.</p><p></p><p>He had contributed too much to the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Count me in." At this time, a tall man said, "My Sky Clan has no Luminous Treasures, and has been swallowed by the Dark Heavens, barely surviving to the Divine Wood Universe. This time, this old man will wield the Luminous Treasures to fight the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth!"</p><p></p><p>The tall man's eyes were filled with a resolute expression.</p><p></p><p>He was originally a member of the Sky Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Clan had also encountered the invasion of the Dark Heavens and Dark Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Clan's King was a Realm Lord-level powerhouse, and might even have the potential to transcend to an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Clan's King wanted to forge Luminous Treasures to fight the Dark Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he ultimately failed, and the Luminous Treasures were never forged.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Clan was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The civilization of the Sky Clan was thus severed, and only a few people escaped.</p><p></p><p>Some came to the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The forging techniques of the Divine Wood Universe came from the people of the Sky Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Who else?" Yuan asked again, agreeing to this Sky Clan member.</p><p></p><p>"I have already stepped into the Second Realm of the Ancestral God, so I can also go." Sheng Nü said, her expression as cold as the moon.</p><p></p><p>She was the one who presided over the Humanity Awakening's Luminous Seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Yuan nodded, sweeping his gaze across the rest, "Anyone else?"</p><p></p><p>The rest remained silent.</p><p></p><p>They felt their strength was not enough, and were afraid of sullying the Luminous Treasures.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Divine Wood Universe, seven Luminous Treasures had been forged, but they could not find seven powerful experts to wield them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, if only Qi Yuan were here, he would be the most qualified to wield the Humanity Awakening's Luminous Treasures." Shangguan Qingmiao said.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, when he saw Qi Yuan, he had regarded him as a celestial being.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had reached the Realm Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lord realm had already reached a level of unfathomable, incomprehensible power.</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü heard this and her expression slightly changed: "Perhaps he alone would be qualified to wield two, or even three, Luminous Treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this great man's whereabouts are uncertain, and we cannot find him at all." The white-browed elder sighed.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Taistar Domain had been trying to find Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But they simply could not find him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Yuan swept his gaze across the crowd, his voice neither sorrowful nor joyful: "There are five days left, select the remaining four people, and dismiss."</p><p></p><p>Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The rest left in twos and threes.</p><p></p><p>The vast palace became empty and quiet.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, a group of three people, heads bowed, entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>These three people all held brooms, and the leader was an old man with white hair and beard.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the palace, they did not look around, but instead opened up and began cleaning.</p><p></p><p>This so-called cleaning was not to sweep away the dust, but to cleanse the aura of the Ominous Spirits.</p><p></p><p>These Ancestral Gods had been fighting on the frontlines for years, and their bodies were stained with the aura of the Ominous Spirits.</p><p></p><p>As they gathered here, the residual aura of the Ominous Spirits could potentially give birth to Ominous Deities if not cleaned for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The three people quietly cleaned, without a word.</p><p></p><p>The palace was vast, and the cleaning and sweeping took a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>The old man wiped a table clean, his gaze falling on a thin figure, his brow slightly furrowed: "Hey, Xiao Qi, why aren't you cleaning? Sitting here doing nothing?"</p><p></p><p>The handsome young man named Xiao Qi was actually sitting in the Sun God's seat, his eyes with a mysterious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder if I'll have the chance to see those Sun Gods. I have so many questions I want to ask them." Xiao Qi's gaze was hazy and confused.</p><p></p><p>"Those great figures, do you think we can just casually ask them questions?" The old man laughed, thinking Xiao Qi was being unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Qi was the orphan of a frontline soldier, and the old man had been taking care of him.</p><p></p><p>"And those questions of yours are really strange!" Thinking of something, the old man said.</p><p></p><p>"How are they strange? I just want to ask them what is a mountain, what is a shoe, what is an insect." Xiao Qi said casually, his gaze a bit scattered and confused.</p><p></p><p>"Dad's right, your questions are too strange." The remaining man said with a smile, "Instead of asking that, why not ask how to become a god?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Qi shook his head: "Life is difficult, there are too many unknowns, it's too hard, too hard."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you write a book called 'Ten Thousand Whys'?" the old man said.</p><p></p><p>This world also had the legend of the 'Ten Thousand Whys'.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Qi, what's the use of thinking about these things? It's better to earn more money and buy dad some wine to drink." The other man said.</p><p></p><p>"What is wine?" Xiao Qi blinked, "Isn't there a lot of it here?"</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed a wine jar, shaking it, his face showing a disgusted expression.</p><p></p><p>"Which stingy person took all the wine!"</p><p></p><p>"You're too bold!" The old man was relieved that the wine was gone.</p><p></p><p>This was the wine of the Ancestral Gods, and even if there were leftovers, it was not something they could touch.</p><p></p><p>Since half a jar of wine had been taken by the other lords, Xiao Qi would not make the mistake of trying to drink it.</p><p></p><p>"Stop daydreaming, just focus on earning money to buy dad some wine!" The other tall man said.</p><p></p><p>"This is not daydreaming, I just want to understand what these things are?" Xiao Qi murmured to himself, "If I understand them, maybe I can brew wine for dad to drink every day."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, dad is waiting for that day." The old man said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

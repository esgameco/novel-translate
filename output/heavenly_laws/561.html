        <h1>Chapter 561</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The force that drives the martial arts of life and death to extend and spread in different directions is the power of time.</p><p></p><p>As the foundation of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion, the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws can clearly see the 'future' of the evolutionary paths, existing in the many timelines of the future.</p><p></p><p>Although it is far from encompassing all timelines, it is more than enough to determine the potential of an evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>For a new evolutionary path, especially one without an ultimate existence, who dares to determine how far it can go? Even the most experienced experts can only speculate and guess if they have not personally cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>But the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws dares, because it can see the potential of this evolutionary path from the futures of many timelines.</p><p></p><p>"This evolutionary path has the potential to barely enter the Chaotic Realm, but I feel something is not right."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws constantly observes the many futures of the martial arts of life and death, and a small portion of the timelines will give birth to Chaotic Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"No, this evolutionary path is more like a branch of a main path."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws finally confirms its own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void, a vast expanse of void domains, the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion does not know how many evolutionary paths it has collected, and naturally knows that some evolutionary paths with great potential have the ability to develop branch evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the evolutionary paths that can develop branch paths are necessarily stronger than those that cannot, but the former's potential is definitely higher.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, the seller wants to use my influence in the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion to spread his evolutionary path?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws thought to itself, it has seen too much and experienced too much, and many things can be seen through at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"But the evolutionary path that can develop branch paths is also qualified to do so."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws nodded slightly, the evolutionary paths that can develop branch paths generally have the potential to cultivate to the Great Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord of the Ten Thousand Laws, I don't know about this evolutionary path." The old man holding the wine gourd next to him tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>He summoned the projection of the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws to descend because he was not sure whether the martial arts of life and death were an evolutionary path of the Sovereign Realm or the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the difference between the two is very large.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Chaotic Realm evolutionary path, I suppose."</p><p></p><p>The timelines of the martial arts of life and death on the pupils of the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"A Chaotic Realm evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded, which was roughly in line with his feeling.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it to him then."</p><p></p><p>The old man holding the wine gourd was about to reply to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws that had condensed from the void vortex did not disappear, but said, "I want to see the seller in person."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Lord of the Ten Thousand Laws wants to see the seller in person?"</p><p></p><p>The old man holding the wine gourd was stunned. The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws was the actual controller of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion, and it generally only summoned a projection to descend and discern an uncertain evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>As for seeing the seller in person? Very, very rare.</p><p></p><p>Given the lofty status of the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws, it is usually too lazy to see the seller.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The old man's thoughts quickly turned, and he immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the independent space, Lin Yuan stood quietly on the platform made of black stone, waiting for the response from the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The reputation of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion has no problems, and there will be no situation where they won't recognize the evolutionary path." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion didn't recognize the account, he wouldn't mind, after all, the purpose of his coming here this time was to spread the branch of the martial arts evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>If the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion didn't recognize the account and secretly took this martial arts of life and death evolutionary path to spread it, it would be exactly what Lin Yuan wanted.</p><p></p><p>However, this possibility is very low, as the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion has always adhered to fair trade since the beginning of the universe, otherwise it would not have such a great influence.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on the strength of the experts? At most, it can only make people intimidated and fearful.</p><p></p><p>But the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion is adored by countless lives, and even the Mysterious Emperor and the Lord of the Demon Jade Pavilion have not found any 'dirt' on it, so it should be trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth suddenly changed, and Lin Yuan was directly moved to another space.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed, the mysterious runes floating in the void slowly rotated, and here, Lin Yuan felt completely isolated from the outside world, and even the connection with his true self was forcibly weakened.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>A voice came.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked over and saw an old man holding a wine gourd, who was looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recognized the identity of this old man, who was one of the strongest figures that could not be provoked on the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the old man's side, where there was a vague vortex, and a huge eye was also examining him.</p><p></p><p>The pupil of the huge eye was golden.</p><p></p><p>"The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled, the outside world knows little about this actual controller of the Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion, but the Mysterious Emperor and the Lord of the Demon Jade Pavilion are very clear, and have even left a reminder.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you know me?" </p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws looked at Lin Yuan and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I've met the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even the Mysterious Emperor and the Lord of the Demon Jade Pavilion had to greet the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws in this way, so Lin Yuan naturally would not be arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the evolutionary path that can develop branch paths must have a remarkable origin, so it's normal for you to know me."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws continued to look at Lin Yuan, talking to itself.</p><p></p><p>Its reputation, to Transcendent Realm and Sovereign Realm experts, is slightly unfamiliar, but to Chaotic Realm Lords and Great Saints, the stronger the power and the higher the realm, the more awe-inspiring it is.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan's mind was stirred.</p><p></p><p>Develop branch evolutionary paths?</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws knows that the martial arts of life and death is a branch of the martial arts evolutionary path?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts surged, quickly accepting it. According to the speculation of the Mysterious Emperor, the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws is related to the Thirteenth Realm of Time Life, and has the ability to see through the Ten Thousand Laws and Ten Thousand Ways, so it is not surprising that it now knows the true essence of the martial arts of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"You want to use my Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion to spread your own evolutionary path?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws directly said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of such an ancient existence as the Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws, there was no need to hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"Over the course of countless universe cycles and Chaotic Eras, there have indeed been many lives, just like you, who want to use the power of my Ten Thousand Dao Pavilion to spread their own evolutionary paths, and many of them have now cultivated to the Chaotic Realm Perfection."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Realm Perfection?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Realm Perfection is Great Saints, and as for Peerless Great Saints, they are also Chaotic Realm Perfection, only their combat power is much stronger than Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Chaotic Realm Perfection that Lin Yuan has encountered are only two, one is the Lord of the Demon Jade Pavilion, and the other is the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>These two are not only Chaotic Realm Perfection, but are above Great Saints, reaching the level of Peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Even Chaotic Lords can only flee in panic before Chaotic Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Demon Sage Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint are also Chaotic Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan has not had any substantial contact with these two Great Saints, only being affected by their battles.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there are also some who are trapped in time loops, neither born nor dead, suffering torment."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws continued.</p><p></p><p>"Trapped in time loops?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"To cross from the Twelfth Realm to the Thirteenth Realm, one must break free from the time loop that binds oneself."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws casually said.</p><p></p><p>"Break free from the time loop?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard of the information about breaking through from the Twelfth Realm to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Time loop?</p><p></p><p>Break free?</p><p></p><p>To enter the Thirteenth Realm, one must break free from the time loop? "What if they can't break free?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"If they can't break free, then they can't break free, they will be trapped in the time loop forever." The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, being trapped in the time loop is not painful, within the time loop, everything is a predetermined trajectory, there are no accidents, no other possibilities, just endless repetition."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed not painful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>But for those who have reached Chaotic Realm Perfection, such a state would be worse than death.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence are Chaotic Realm Perfection, they look down upon everything, whether it's the Chaotic Void or the Source World that Lin Yuan has descended upon, Chaotic Realm Perfection, Great Saint Sovereigns, which one is not high above?</p><p></p><p>"You just need to know a little, no need to understand in detail, each Chaotic Realm Perfection faces a different time loop when trying to cross into the Thirteenth Realm, knowing it in advance is of no benefit."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Ten Thousand Laws said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I see," said the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was enlightened.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Xuanhuang lineage and the Moyu Tower had not left any information about crossing from the 12th to the 13th realm.</p><p></p><p>Because without reaching the 12th realm perfection, knowing the information in advance would be useless. Once reaching the 12th realm perfection, even without inquiring, one would know this information.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that Emperor Xuanhuang and the Master of the Moyu Tower have suddenly disappeared, trapped in a time loop?" Lin Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang evolution path has not yet produced a single 12th realm cultivator so far, but Emperor Xuanhuang has disappeared without a trace, which is very similar to being trapped in a time loop.</p><p></p><p>According to the description of the Mirror of All Laws, after being trapped in a time loop, one neither lives nor dies, not considered dead, nor alive.</p><p></p><p>"Does spreading one's own evolutionary path help to break free from the time loop?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come here, why are you still asking?" The Eyes of All Laws re-examined Lin Yuan and explained, "The hope of breaking free from the time loop by relying solely on oneself is too slim. Relying on external 'path markers' or 'anchors' can increase the possibility of breaking free."</p><p></p><p>"So many Chaos Realm beings have laid the groundwork in advance, hoping to leverage the influence of my Wanfa Pavilion to spread their own evolutionary paths and increase their chances of breaking through to the 13th realm."</p><p></p><p>As the Eyes of All Laws said this, it glanced at Lin Yuan with a slightly strange look. "But for someone like you, who is merely at the Pili Dao Realm, to come and spread your own evolutionary path is quite rare."</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why the Eyes of All Laws was willing to talk to Lin Yuan until now.</p><p></p><p>A Pili Dao Realm being doesn't even know where the endpoint of their path is, and is uncertain whether they will switch to other evolutionary paths in the future, so the possibility of them spreading their own evolutionary path is almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>Even if they have a powerful background and their elders are Chaos Realm perfected, they still wouldn't do that. Otherwise, if they spread it halfway and then find that this evolutionary path is not suitable for them and "scatter the Dao" to switch to other evolutionary paths, wouldn't all the previous spreading be in vain?</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan dares to come and spread his own evolutionary path, there can only be one possibility.</p><p></p><p>That is, he is absolutely certain that the evolutionary path he is walking is suitable for him, and this is usually the case when the evolutionary path is one that he has opened up himself.</p><p></p><p>Only by personally opening and perfecting an evolutionary path can one be perfectly suited to it. As for choosing the evolutionary paths opened up by others?</p><p></p><p>One can only be sure whether it is suitable or not after reaching the Chaos Realm, as the uncertainty is too great at the Pili Dao Realm or Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>And if Lin Yuan has created his own evolutionary path, to have opened up a branching path capable of being explored at just the Pili Dao Realm? </p><p></p><p>The Eyes of All Laws has a very high opinion of Lin Yuan's potential, so it actively engaged in conversation and even "enlightened" Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It was just luck," Lin Yuan said, hearing the tone in the Eyes of All Laws' voice, indicating that it had seen through something.</p><p></p><p>"Opening up an evolutionary path is not just luck, especially the evolutionary path you have opened up, whose branches all have Chaos Realm potential," the Eyes of All Laws said.</p><p></p><p>Branches with Chaos Realm potential? Then the potential of Lin Yuan's main path can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>In the face of an existence like the Eyes of All Laws, there's no need to be too humble. If it can recognize and praise you, it means you are worthy of the praise.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get to the main point," the Eyes of All Laws looked at Lin Yuan. "You want to use my Wanfa Pavilion to spread your own evolutionary path, no problem, but there's a condition."</p><p></p><p>"Please state it," Lin Yuan was not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>During the human civilization era in the universe, relying on the power of human civilization to spread one's own evolutionary path was because Lin Yuan himself was a human citizen.</p><p></p><p>But outside of human civilization, those ancient gods in the depths of the starry sky, if they want to spread their own evolutionary path within human civilization, they will undoubtedly be suppressed and constrained.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has no connection with the Wanfa Pavilion, and if he wants to use its power to spread the branches of his own evolutionary path to prepare for the future breakthrough to the 13th realm, he must certainly pay a price.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple," the Eyes of All Laws said. "You don't need to consider this now. Wait until you cross into the Chaos Realm perfection, and every ten universal cycles, do one thing for my Wanfa Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"Every ten universal cycles, do one thing?" Lin Yuan also looked at the Eyes of All Laws.</p><p></p><p>The premise of this condition is that Lin Yuan reaches Chaos Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>If it were other Pili Dao Realm beings, or even Mastery Realm or Chaos Venerable, they would definitely agree without even thinking.</p><p></p><p>After all, even for a Chaos Venerable, there is no guarantee that they can cultivate to Chaos Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>The condition proposed by the Eyes of All Laws is actually not very restrictive.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Relying on his extraordinary perceptiveness and the Gate of All Worlds, Lin Yuan dares not guarantee that he can break through to the 13th realm, but he has a certain degree of confidence in reaching Chaos Realm perfection, it's just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan only needs to wait for his body and soul to grow to the extreme to break through to the Mastery Realm. And the many requirements for breaking through from the Mastery Realm to the Chaos Realm, Lin Yuan has already completed most of them, plus the boost in the understanding of the rules from that Source World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the Chaos Realm also doesn't have much difficulty. As for the final Chaos Realm perfection? It's just a matter of taking the Chaos Rules as the foundation and evolving the corresponding Great Dao, and Lin Yuan has found the specific direction in that Source World.</p><p></p><p>In short, Lin Yuan can basically see the path from the Pili Dao Realm to Chaos Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the condition proposed by the Eyes of All Laws is not actually very beneficial to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Every ten universal cycles, do one thing for the Wanfa Pavilion? What kind of thing?" Lin Yuan asked. "What if they want me to go to my death or actively enter dangerous places, and I have to obey?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't let you do anything that you have no chance of succeeding in, and there will be corresponding rewards," the Eyes of All Laws said. "And even if you fail the task, I won't force you to continue doing it."</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan really grows to Chaos Realm perfection, the Eyes of All Laws also doesn't want to be too coercive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan began to weigh the pros and cons.</p><p></p><p>First of all, there will be rewards for the tasks, which makes Lin Yuan somewhat satisfied, as he is not afraid of putting in the effort, but just doesn't want to work in vain.</p><p></p><p>And once a task fails, if it is determined that he cannot complete it, he will not be forced, which also puts Lin Yuan at ease.</p><p></p><p>The worst-case scenario of a task failure is just the destruction of one divine soul, which is a cost Lin Yuan can completely accept.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, the requirement from the Eyes of All Laws is to do one thing every ten universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>From his birth to now, even if all the time he spent traversing worlds is added together, it's not even a million years. Ten universal cycles are too long for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan thought it over and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," the Eyes of All Laws nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just helping Lin Yuan spread the evolutionary path can gain the promise of his future Chaos Realm perfection, and this transaction is not a losing one for the Wanfa Pavilion no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin," the Eyes of All Laws said, and a golden scroll materialized in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Characters appeared on the scroll, and although Lin Yuan didn't recognize them, a glance revealed the meaning contained within - the requirements the Eyes of All Laws had just proposed.</p><p></p><p>The Wanfa Pavilion will help Lin Yuan spread his evolutionary path, but in return, after Lin Yuan reaches Chaos Realm perfection, he must do one thing for the Wanfa Pavilion every ten universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>The scroll contained various restrictions, mentioning that he cannot be forced and that rewards must be paid, etc.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully read through it several times.</p><p></p><p>"If you have no objections, just release a wisp of your soul aura to imprint it on the scroll," the Eyes of All Laws said.</p><p></p><p>The requirements on the golden scroll cannot be violated. Even if one reaches Chaos Realm perfection, daring to violate it will result in severe consequences, directly severing the possibility of breaking through to the 13th realm.</p><p></p><p>So as long as Lin Yuan is willing to imprint a wisp of his soul aura on it, the Eyes of All Laws will naturally feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Wait," Lin Yuan thought for a moment. "What is the limitation on the Wanfa Pavilion helping me spread my evolutionary path branches? Is it just one type?"</p><p></p><p>If they only help Lin Yuan spread the Life and Death Martial Dao evolutionary path, then the requirements on the scroll would be somewhat unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>One martial dao branch can at most produce a single 12th realm ultimate, and the effect of fixing his own Dao marker and anchor point wouldn't be very significant.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not just one type," the Eyes of All Laws shook its head. If it were just one, it would have already marked it on the scroll.</p><p></p><p>"If you open up other evolutionary path branches in your future cultivation, the Wanfa Pavilion can also help spread them," the Eyes of All Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," Lin Yuan's heart settled. "No need to wait for the future, I already have some other evolutionary path branches."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The Eyes of All Laws looked at Lin Yuan upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Other evolutionary path branches? </p><p></p><p>Some? (Chapter end)</p>

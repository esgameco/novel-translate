        <h1>Chapter 497</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All the Twelve Tribulation Realm experts from the various alien races fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Overlord was just an ordinary Eleven Tribulation Realm cultivator, the Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates would have many methods they could use against him.</p><p></p><p>However, on this grand cosmic battlefield, the Galactic Overlord's strength completely surpassed that of a normal Eleven Tribulation Realm cultivator, and could be considered the mightiest Eleven Tribulation Realm being since the dawn of the universe.</p><p></p><p>As such, dealing with the Galactic Overlord would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not just facing the Galactic Overlord, but also an entire human civilization and nine other Realm-level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"If the rules and models of the Martial Dao Eleven Tribulation Realm are true, it means the Galactic Overlord has reached an inconceivable level of insight into the laws and principles," the Nether Realm Ultimate said.</p><p></p><p>"Such a being, once they successfully advance to the Twelve Tribulation Realm, will rapidly rise to the peak of the Paragon Realm."</p><p></p><p>"At that point, it will no longer be a matter of how we deal with the Galactic Overlord, but how the Galactic Overlord will deal with us."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Realm Ultimate spoke slowly.</p><p></p><p>Truthfully, if their race produced a peak Paragon Realm expert, the first thing they would do is sweep across the major forces in the universe.</p><p></p><p>However, reaching the peak of the Paragon Realm was extremely difficult, and it was rare for even one to appear in dozens or hundreds of universes.</p><p></p><p>The two Paragon Realm Ultimates of the Calamity Tribe were also at the peak, but they were suppressed by the will of the universe and dared not act with full force, so they could not be considered normal peak Paragon Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"The Paragon Realm? The human civilization?" The Insect Empress' expression darkened further.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Insect Tribe would certainly be subjected to the full force of the human civilization. The thought of a peak Paragon Realm expert wielding a tribal treasure, in their prime, filled her with dread.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord has already reached the pinnacle of the Eleven Tribulation Realm. His true self and main body are surely under the protection of the human civilization. How should we proceed?" the Void Tribe Ultimate said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even if they wanted to deal with the Galactic Overlord, they were unsure if they had the capability to do so.</p><p></p><p>Curse-killing? Even if a Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimate personally acted, they could only curse and kill Nine and Ten Tribulation Realm experts' clones and main bodies, but the Galactic Overlord had already reached the Eleven Tribulation Realm, so even if the Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates paid a heavy price, they could not kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there may be a way," the Nether Realm Ultimate suddenly said, looking at the Insect Empress. "If I remember correctly, back when a mysterious being fell into the universe from the outside, Wanhua took a drop of its fresh blood?"</p><p></p><p>In the early days of the universe, a mysterious being fell into the universe, nearly causing a great extinction of all life. In the end, many Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates joined forces to barely drive it out.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious being was not a normal life form, possessing only instincts and no consciousness. Ordinary Twelve Tribulation Realm living beings could not enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious being had a terrifying polluting ability, and its fresh blood was something even they did not dare touch. As long as they could target one of the Galactic Overlord's clones or avatars, even if it did not kill him, the Mysterious Blood could severely injure him and affect his potential to break through to the Twelve Tribulation Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Nether Realm Ultimate looked towards the Insect Empress.</p><p></p><p>The other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates were slightly shaken upon hearing this. They did not know about this matter, but since the Nether Realm Ultimate was so certain, it must be true.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Blood?" The Insect Empress furrowed her brows. "I need to discuss this with Wanhua."</p><p></p><p>Among the Insect Empress's group, Wanhua was the strongest and most ancient, with the highest status.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Wanhua can consider the bigger picture," the Nether Realm Ultimate nodded and spoke.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Empress looked at the other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates around her. "Wanhua is willing to provide that drop of blood."</p><p></p><p>"That's excellent." The Nether Realm Ultimate let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious being had fallen into the universe before the human civilization was born, so the strongest experts of the human civilization did not know about this.</p><p></p><p>The Nether Realm Ultimate was able to glimpse Wanhua's actions due to his own abilities, which is why he brought it up today.</p><p></p><p>"But that drop of Mysterious Blood is the source of endless chaos and pollution. Wanhua considers it a precious treasure, so she is willing to provide it, but not without conditions."</p><p></p><p>The Insect Empress suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever Wanhua requires, we will provide it," the Nether Realm Ultimate nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, whatever Wanhua needs, our tribe will offer it," the other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates one by one guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates reached an agreement on the conditions.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we only need to locate one of the Galactic Overlord's clones or avatars, then unleash our full force to suppress him, and then use that drop of Mysterious Blood," the Insect Empress spoke.</p><p></p><p>"That is natural," the other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the silent Calamity Tribe Ultimate said, "My Calamity Tribe has no interest in the Galactic Overlord of the human civilization. We will withdraw from this operation."</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity Tribe is withdrawing?" </p><p></p><p>The other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates were somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>If the human civilization produced a Paragon Realm Ultimate, the Calamity Tribe would certainly be affected as well.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization would not specifically spare the Calamity Tribe, after all, a Paragon Realm peak expert in the universe meant invincibility, and the other Twelve Tribulation Realm Ultimates could only avoid them.</p><p></p><p>"No need to say more."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Tribe Ultimate's figure directly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Those two old fellows, with their Paragon Realm peak cultivation, yet their courage is so small," the Nether Realm Ultimate frowned.</p><p></p><p>"But dealing with a single Galactic Overlord..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord, joining forces with us would be enough." The Insect Clan Queen shook her head.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was observing the eighteen Sovereign Realm Extraordinary Trees, observing how they absorbed the Chaotic Qi and how they transformed the turbulent and unstable Chaotic Qi into the energy they needed.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>A surge of spiritual enlightenment flooded Lin Yuan's mind, and he grasped the Chaotic Rules, his understanding of Chaotic Qi already very high. Now, observing the essence of the eighteen Extraordinary Trees, he vaguely grasped the means of perfectly absorbing and exhaling Chaotic Qi.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Void has the most Chaotic Qi, and if one masters the direct method of swallowing and absorbing Chaotic Qi, the dependence on cultivation resources will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Even Chaotic Realm powerhouses cannot directly absorb Chaotic Qi, they need to refine and purify the original Chaotic Qi to the level contained in Chaotic Stones before they can smoothly absorb it.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign Realm, or even Dao-Splitting Realm powerhouses, want to comprehend Chaotic Qi and then realize the Chaotic Rules, can only do so through Chaotic Stones, because the Chaotic Qi in Chaotic Stones is stable and the easiest to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>To directly comprehend the Chaotic Rules from the original Chaotic Qi? The difficulty is too high, and it is filled with disorderly and turbulent energy.</p><p></p><p>The clone that Lin Yuan manifested, condensing a body with Chaotic Qi, was just a way of using Chaotic Qi.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the essence of the original Chaotic Qi is a different concept from directly absorbing the original Chaotic Qi.</p><p></p><p>The essence of absorbing the original Chaotic Qi is to transform the original Chaotic Qi into one's own energy, while condensing a clone with the original Chaotic Qi is just the clone.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it on the World Tree."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred as he looked towards the World Tree in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the Chaotic Rules, Lin Yuan could now draw in some Chaotic Qi from outside the universe to nourish the World Tree.</p><p></p><p>But it was only nourishment, the Eleventh-Grade Extraordinary World Tree could not directly absorb Chaotic Qi, and as for using Chaotic Stones to infuse it? That would be too extravagant, and Lin Yuan naturally couldn't bear to do it.</p><p></p><p>If the World Tree could have the ability to directly absorb Chaotic Qi, it would probably be greatly beneficial for it to evolve into a Chaotic Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Supremely Strong Xia Qin is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression suddenly changed, and the Solar Spiritual Consciousness outside the Mysterious Yellow Realm immediately manifested a thread of spiritual will to connect to the Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's personal world.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Supremely Strong One." Lin Yuan slightly bowed to show respect.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan." Xia Qin's face showed a smile, and then his expression became slightly solemn. "The matter of you being the founder of the Martial Dao Evolution Path, it seems it can no longer be hidden."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan was the founder of the Martial Dao Evolution Path, the news had been circulating for hundreds of years, but at the time the voice was still small, and there was no substantial evidence.</p><p></p><p>But recently, the appearance of the Eleventh-Grade Martial Dao Chapters has caused this rumor to reach its peak.</p><p></p><p>"I know." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>When he was at the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Grades, Lin Yuan was worried that the identity of the Martial Dao founder would be leaked, attracting the attention and even the attacks of the Twelfth-Grade Ultimates from other races.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not weaker than the Twelfth-Grade, so naturally he had no fear of them.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin smiled and said, "Your strength, even if those fellows want to curse and attack you, it would be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin paused for a moment, then continued, "But 'better safe than sorry', with the potential of the Martial Dao Evolution Path, I don't even need to guess, I know those fellows are now hiding somewhere, thinking of how to deal with you."</p><p></p><p>"What does the Supremely Strong One mean?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you come to the Central Star Realm with your true body? That is the safest place in human civilization, even if all the dozen or so Twelfth-Grade Ultimates from other races unite to attack, they can be held back."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although the nine Supremely Strong Ones of human civilization are constantly monitoring the Galactic Main Star, and the moment there is any disturbance, they can directly intervene.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Main Star, after all, is not the core of the human civilization domain.</p><p></p><p>And the Galactic Main Star is located on the edge of the domain, which Xia Qin sees as having some hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"True body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it for a while.</p><p></p><p>Now his true body is in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, which is absolutely safer than the Central Star Realm of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Supremely Strong One, where do you think my true body is?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Your true body? Isn't it on the Galactic Main Star?" Xia Qin asked, sensing the causal connection.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Main Star only has one of my clones." Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>After the true body master settled in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, the Solar Spiritual Consciousness and Lunar Spiritual Consciousness have been taking turns guarding the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Main Star is just a clone?" Xia Qin's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"My true body is now in the Mysterious Yellow Realm." Lin Yuan did not hide it and said it directly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no need to hide or conceal anything anymore. With his current strength, protecting the Mysterious Yellow Realm was as simple as could be.</p><p></p><p>"Your true body is in the Mysterious Yellow Realm?" The first thought in Xia Qin's mind was that no wonder he couldn't sense it, the Mysterious Yellow Realm isolates causality and space-time, which is recognized among the Twelfth-Grade Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But immediately, Xia Qin reacted, the Mysterious Yellow Realm has already been closed, how did Lin Yuan's true body get in?</p><p></p><p>"I have already refined the core of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, and I am now the master of the Mysterious Yellow Realm." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The master of the Mysterious Yellow Realm?" Xia Qin was a bit dazed, and a surge of joy also arose in his heart. The Mysterious Yellow Realm, which dozens of Twelfth-Grade Ultimates in the universe have been seeking but cannot obtain, has actually fallen into Lin Yuan's hands?</p><p></p><p>"You..." Countless thoughts flashed through Xia Qin's mind, and finally, after repeatedly scrutinizing Lin Yuan, he couldn't help but say, "You almost scared me."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The reason was likely due to the old owner of the jade gourd, who was a 13th level time being.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed understanding. A 13th level time being could observe many future timelines.</p><p></p><p>However, different timelines involved the wills of various 13th level beings.</p><p></p><p>Once intersections of time beings occurred in future timelines,</p><p></p><p>The choices of each 13th level being would create different futures.</p><p></p><p>For example, the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After realizing he would soon have contact with a 13th level being,</p><p></p><p>He could choose to meet them.</p><p></p><p>Or choose not to meet them. </p><p></p><p>The result was up to Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's meet," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the desolate void.</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of hiding from the 13th level time being of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had taken notice of him, they must have also seen his past and future.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Lin Yuan's current strength and combat power,</p><p></p><p>At full power, he was no weaker than an ordinary 13th level time being.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention he had many methods to preserve his life.</p><p></p><p>Especially his true bodies in the other two origin worlds.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic energy drifted about.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat there quietly.</p><p></p><p>Different feelings welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the second origin world, thirteen Eternal Lords had sought him out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no prior knowledge of it.</p><p></p><p>In the first origin world, various Ancestors had visited.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Blazing Sun Ancestor informing him,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would not have known either.</p><p></p><p>However this time,</p><p></p><p>He knew in advance that a 13th level time being was coming to see him.</p><p></p><p>He waited here early.</p><p></p><p>This sense of being in control, of choosing his own future, moved Lin Yuan deeply.</p><p></p><p>A moment later,</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space-time subtly solidified.</p><p></p><p>Seven figures silently appeared not far from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy," the leader 'Mo Xu Jun' spoke, greeting him in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>The six time beings behind him also had friendly smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Upon realizing Lin Yuan's limitless future potential, that he was almost certain to become a Time Lord,</p><p></p><p>The first thought of these time beings was naturally to take the initiative to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming enemies? The consequences of that in future timelines were utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>No time being had the courage to be enemies with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At the 13th level, there was no meaningless fighting and killing between time beings.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, great time beings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan steadied himself inwardly and immediately stood up to speak.</p><p></p><p>The seven figures before him were indeed the seven time beings of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Great?"</p><p></p><p>"In front of you, Galaxy, we cannot be called great."</p><p></p><p>The time being with a human head and snake body smiled and said, speaking from the heart.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of beings below the 13th level, time beings were incomparably great, but for Lin Yuan? The time beings had seen the results of fighting Lin Yuan themselves, as well as the consequences of facing Lin Yuan's reckoning tens of thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>"How fortunate our dimensional space is to have given birth to you, Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>The leader 'Mo Xu Jun' looked at Lin Yuan and said with a smile: "Come to think of it, Galaxy, you and I have a connection - that 'Infinite Void' technique you practiced in your early years."</p><p></p><p>The other six time beings' expressions changed slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Mo Xu Jun's words were clearly trying to establish a relationship with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"'Infinite Void' is profound and extensive. It has helped me greatly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded in agreement. </p><p></p><p>At least before and after leaving his home universe, the 13th level inheritance 'Infinite Void' had been of great help to him.</p><p></p><p>Until ten thousand years ago, when 'Infinite Void' was about to enter the fifth level, Lin Yuan fused the perfect aspects of the other two origin worlds within his inner universe, finally allowing this inheritance to completely transcend its original form.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it was helpful."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on 'Mo Xu Jun's' face. Then his right hand flipped over, and six other special objects appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"These are six other ultimate inheritances I created when establishing the 'Infinite Void' inheritance. I hope they will be useful to you, Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>'Mo Xu Jun' said.</p><p></p><p>"Six other inheritances?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six special floating objects, his heart stirring slightly.</p><p></p><p>Including 'Infinite Void', there were seven inheritances representing seven aspects of the ultimate 13th level, which was the path 'Mo Xu Jun' had taken.</p><p></p><p>Each inheritance was divided into seven levels, with the seventh level being theoretical.</p><p></p><p>Once all seven inheritances were cultivated to the seventh level, that would be when 'Mo Xu Jun' became a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not decline, and directly accepted all six special objects.</p><p></p><p>These could indeed be of some help to him, at least providing some reference effect.</p><p></p><p>In terms of foundation, he had long transcended 'Infinite Void' itself, but he could take a look at the other ultimate aspects.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p></p><p>'Mo Xu Jun' smiled. After that,</p><p></p><p>The other six time beings each gifted some treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven time beings, Lin Yuan quickly found the owner of the Tianxu Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>And he casually returned the Tianxu Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Now this 13th level weapon was not of much use to him.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing the Tianxu Cauldron's full power attack versus Lin Yuan's own full power attack, the difference in might was not too great.</p><p></p><p>This was while Lin Yuan had yet to cross</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the 13th level, once one becomes a Time Life, the Heavenly Void Cauldron would likely become useless.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even for the owner of the Heavenly Void Cauldron, its usefulness was not that great, otherwise they would not have allowed it to be lost outside.</p><p></p><p>After becoming familiar with Lin Yuan, the seven Time Lives visibly relaxed their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, when you advance to the 13th level, you can explore that dimensional space with us," Moxu Jun said to Lin Yuan with a smile. "That dimensional space is incredibly vast, even beyond the Chaos Void, but it's also very chaotic. Its operating dao consciousness is nearing collapse, so it doesn't reject our entry."</p><p></p><p>"However, because of this, many Time Lives are fighting in that dimensional space. The dao operations there are rare and very helpful for our cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The other six Time Lives looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That extremely chaotic dimensional space had traces of many Time Lives' arrangements. The seven Time Lives of the Chaos Void formed a group there, belonging to a very formidable force.</p><p></p><p>"A dimensional space that doesn't reject outsiders?" Lin Yuan was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>In the endless dimensions, there exist numerous dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Dimensional spaces instinctively reject outside life, but if this rejection instinct is erased, then naturally there would be no rejection.</p><p></p><p>However, achieving this is extremely difficult. Besides requiring the dimensional space itself to not resist, it would take at least a Time Lord's full effort and enormous sacrifice to possibly accomplish it.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see when I reach the 13th level," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat interested in dimensional spaces that didn't reject outsiders.</p><p></p><p>But it was only interest, not a very strong attraction.</p><p></p><p>A dimensional space that didn't reject outsiders meant many Time Lives had already entered before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The benefits inside had likely been mostly scavenged, so it was better to continue exploring the source worlds behind.</p><p></p><p>Only at this moment did Lin Yuan realize how immensely valuable the coordinates of those 33 source worlds deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds were.</p><p></p><p>A dimensional space that had been explored many times by numerous Time Lives was still considered a great opportunity in the eyes of the seven Time Lives of the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan possessed a full 33 such spaces, all of which he could perfectly integrate into.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"We'll see then."</p><p></p><p>"We'll wait for you to reach the 13th level, Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Moxu Jun had some confidence in inviting Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That dimensional space was extremely chaotic. Ordinary Time Lives entering for the first time would definitely be suppressed by other Time Lives, but the six of them had been operating there for a long time.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan went there, he could enjoy various benefits.</p><p></p><p>They continued chatting for a while.</p><p></p><p>The seven Time Lives then successively bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>The void where Lin Yuan was quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>No one knew that just now, seven Time Lives had descended upon this ordinary and desolate void.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Two-Lives Flower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as he looked towards the mysterious dimensional gap outside. His Taiji Primordial Spirit was now close to the location of the Yin-Yang Two-Lives Flower.</p><p></p><p>As long as he obtained this dimensional treasure, Lin Yuan's Chaos Taiji Dao could advance to the third level in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The second source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic qi?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the demonic qi of this source world with part of his mental power.</p><p></p><p>The so-called demonic qi was one of the Lord of Heavenly Light's fundamental powers, belonging to the foundation of the Black Demon Body.</p><p></p><p>"Demon God?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the specific location of the Demon God. It existed in the origin of this source world, striving to suppress the source world's consciousness, wanting to assimilate it with demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Heavenly Light... impressive."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan increasingly realized the methods of this Time Lord, the Lord of Heavenly Light.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness operation of a source world was something ordinary Time Lives couldn't even shake, let alone suppress.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Demon Body of the Lord of Heavenly Light had nearly accomplished this feat relying solely on its own instincts, although it was still far from completely suppressing the source world's will.</p><p></p><p>But at least there was hope.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan continued observing the demonic qi of the entire source world.</p><p></p><p>His heart suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>He saw deep within his bloodline, strands of fundamental power constantly interweaving and colliding, seemingly reaching the final stage. All the fundamental powers rapidly fused, ultimately forming an extremely complex imprint that seemed to contain countless time and space.</p><p></p><p>"Divine ability imprint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He immediately understood that his eighth physical divine ability had finally been nurtured and awakened.</p><p></p><p>The nurturing and awakening of the eighth physical divine ability had taken Lin Yuan over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that when the Lord of Heavenly Light had attempted that step back then, even though he ultimately failed, his mental will had burned to the extreme, breaking through some kind of limit.</p><p></p><p>This caused the physical potential of life in this source world to greatly increase afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The physical body Lin Yuan descended into also benefited from this. The bloodline fundamental power tempered by the martial dao evolution path also came into contact with higher-level bloodline fundamental power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the final condensed divine ability imprint took such a long time.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how this physical divine ability will be?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was expectant as his consciousness merged into that divine ability imprint.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Cosmic Universe Within the Taiyin Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyin Qi permeates everywhere, this is a universe based on the Taiyin principles, with the main melody being the icy cold chill.</p><p></p><p>Normally speaking, </p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Pili Dao Realm have already nurtured their own inner cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>The internal rules are perfected and balanced, independent from the true universe.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, all the inner cosmic universes that are nurtured, are based on the realm insights of the Pili Dao Realm cultivators themselves.</p><p></p><p>And each Pili Dao Realm cultivator has different understandings of the rules.</p><p></p><p>They all have their own focuses.</p><p></p><p>This then affects their inner cosmic universes.</p><p></p><p>The inner cosmic universe of the Taiyin Primordial Spirit is just like this.</p><p></p><p>It is very clear that Taiyin is the main focus.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyang Primordial Spirit is the same, with Taiyang as the main focus.</p><p></p><p>As for the True Body Venerable? The fusion of Taiyin and Taiyang, transforming into the Taiji, giving birth to the myriad things, there is almost no specific focus.</p><p></p><p>The inner cosmic universe of the True Body Venerable is the most similar to the true universe, with the myriad rules operating in balance.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment,</p><p></p><p>In the endless icy cold Taiyin universe,</p><p></p><p>A flame burns rapidly, illuminating everything it touches.</p><p></p><p>The light and heat continuously spread, dispersing the icy cold chill.</p><p></p><p>The entire Taiyin universe begins to undergo some mysterious transformation.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of transformation?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Taiyin universe's origin and the source of the Scorching Yang forming a balance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanshen's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Taiyin and Taiyang can easily form a balance, this is the two major foundations of Lin Yuan's Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>But Taiyin and Scorching Yang? What Taiyang and Scorching Yang represent are fundamentally not the same great Dao, although they are both 'Yang' attributes, they are completely different directions.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the ubiquitous Taiyin origin in the Taiyin universe is mutually transforming with the Scorching Yang source, forming a relatively complete cycle.</p><p></p><p>And this cycle has caused the fundamental metamorphosis of the Taiyin universe's structure, with its stability and origin density suddenly surging by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment divine ability's Scorching Yang source was condensed by me, so the heavens and earth it opens up are also mine."</p><p></p><p>"But the Taiyin universe was also nurtured by me, and it is essentially my heavens and earth as well."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Scorching Yang source is continuously transforming the Taiyin universe very smoothly, without any rejection occurring."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched the flames of the Scorching Yang source spreading and expanding in the Taiyin universe, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The physical body divine ability 'Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment' is an extremely consuming divine ability, this is something Lin Yuan was very certain of when he just awakened this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even if he exhausts his origin source, he would not be able to maintain this divine ability for long.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason is that the essence of 'Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment' is to forcefully transform the ownership of the surrounding heavens and earth into Lin Yuan's own.</p><p></p><p>The 'resistance' and 'rejection' that occur as a result are the root causes of the consumption.</p><p></p><p>But in the Taiyin universe, the surrounding heavens and earth are already Lin Yuan's, so the Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment continuously opening up the heavens and earth basically does not encounter any 'resistance' or 'rejection'.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan even feels that as long as he wills it, this Scorching Yang source can be maintained indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>"Fusion, the Scorching Yang source is starting to fuse with the Taiyin universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observes carefully and perceives this trend.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Scorching Yang source itself is gradually beginning to integrate into the Taiyin universe.</p><p></p><p>The deeper the fusion, the more complete the cycle between the Scorching Yang source and the Taiyin universe, and the greater the enhancement to the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful."</p><p></p><p>As the creator of the universe, Lin Yuan can clearly feel the many changes and transformations occurring during the fusion of the Scorching Yang source and the Taiyin universe.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that the Scorching Yang source can fuse with the Taiyin universe is essentially because the Taiyin universe has also cultivated the 'Infinite Void', allowing it to bear the Scorching Yang source."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had condensed the Scorching Yang source within his incarnation's inner cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>But unsurprisingly, the inner cosmic universe of the incarnation directly collapsed, unable to contain the power of the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Yang source comes from the physical body divine ability Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment, and this divine ability is a certain ability method of the Scorching Yang Ancestor of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>Only the 'Infinite Void' created by the Tenth Heavenly Rank existence can reach the threshold to contain the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>It's like trying to use a piece of tofu to hold a steel needle, the tofu will be pierced through.</p><p></p><p>But if you use an iron box to hold a steel needle, there won't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyin universe that has cultivated the 'Infinite Void' is like the iron box, possessing the qualification to contain the steel needle.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>While observing the changes in the Taiyin universe, Lin Yuan was also constantly maintaining the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Scorching Yang source burned fiercely, and the balance was slightly disrupted during the fusion with the Taiyin origin.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Taiyin universe began to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion has failed?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even for the innately related Taiyin and Taiyang, when Lin Yuan first started to fuse them, there were often situations where the balance could not be maintained, and the two would mutually collapse.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Taiyin and Scorching Yang? "In fact, it's not fusion, but devouring, the Taiyin universe origin is slowly devouring the Scorching Yang source."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and a new Taiyin Primordial Spirit was condensed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the incarnations of other Tenth Heavenly Rank experts, the cultivation of the two major Primordial Spirits is much simpler for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Recondensing them does not require much time at all.</p><p></p><p>This is also one of the advantages of the Martial Dao evolution path, the Chaotic Void has endless evolution paths, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>But a path like the Martial Dao, where one can easily condense multiple Primordial Spirits, is quite rare.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan begins to re-condense the Taiyin source within the Taiyin universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is very clear that the fusion of the Taiyin universe and the Scorching Yang will be a great opportunity for him, as it is a Tenth Heavenly Rank method from two different dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for Lin Yuan, the two would not even have the chance to make contact, let alone fusion and devouring?</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, cultivators generally have weak foundations, most of them don't even have the concept of an inner cosmic universe, and even if they have something similar to 'Scorching Yang Heavenly Enlightenment', they can only use it as a personal trump card or the like.</p><p></p><p>As for using such methods to thoroughly enhance their own foundation and roots? It is basically impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Even the extremely rare powerful experts in the Source World who have opened up something similar to an inner cosmic universe, without the 'Infinite Void' support, they cannot withstand the existence of the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that what Lin Yuan is doing now is fusing the Tenth Heavenly Rank methods of two major dimensional spaces, and the transformation it will bring to himself is something that even the Tenth Heavenly Rank lifeforms themselves cannot foresee.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I need to lower the illumination intensity of the Scorching Yang source."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan begins to adjust himself, the previous collapse of the Taiyin universe and the loss of balance with the Scorching Yang source was mainly due to the slightly high illumination intensity of the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has learned from the failure, and is now even closer to the complete fusion.</p><p></p><p>Day after day passes in the Chaotic Void, the majority of Lin Yuan's true body venerable's energy is focused on the fusion of the Taiyin universe and the Scorching Yang source.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the accelerating fusion progress, the speed of the Taiyin universe's enhancement makes Lin Yuan amazed.</p><p></p><p>The area of the Taiyin universe is expanding madly, and its temporal-spatial stability is also soaring.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time has passed, the Taiyin universe and the Scorching Yang...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The source finally merged completely together.</p><p></p><p>To be precise,</p><p></p><p>it was the Blazing Sun Source becoming a part of the Yin Universe.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth formed by the Blazing Sun's creation merged with the Yin Universe's own heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The Star Tear Fragment World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Yin Primal Spirit sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>Most of their spiritual consciousness had gathered within the Yin Primal Spirit's internal universe. "This is unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the current Yin Universe, where coldness and scorching heat coexisted. In the center of the universe, a blazing sun constantly radiated boundless light and heat.</p><p></p><p>Compared to an ordinary star, this blazing sun was incomparably more powerful - it was the core of the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"The current Yin Universe exceeds a hundred billion light-years in diameter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan overlooked the entire Yin Universe, his gaze slightly awestruck.</p><p></p><p>In terms of size and area, the current Yin Universe was no smaller than the internal universe of his true body.</p><p></p><p>After all, the internal universe of Lin Yuan's true body, even excluding all other external factors like the infusion of the Chaos Primal Source and the suppression of the Chaos Tree, was already far stronger than the simple Yin Universe, just by having a more perfect foundation for the Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe of his true body could be accurately described as the Taiji Universe.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of power..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it, and soon reached a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>It was no weaker than the Taiji Universe of his true body.</p><p></p><p>"Just a single Blazing Sun Source brought about such a massive enhancement?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan found it somewhat unbelievable. The gap was equivalent to forcibly elevating an initial Sovereign Realm expert to the level of a Chaos Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Universe nurtured by his true body over the years, and the abyss formed between it and the single Primal Spirit's internal universe, had been so easily erased?</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Universe has been enhanced to such a degree. If I let the Taiji Universe of my true body also devour the Blazing Sun Source, the resulting enhancement..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heartbeat quickened.</p><p></p><p>In terms of solidity, the Taiji Universe was far superior to the original Yin Universe.</p><p></p><p>If the Yin Universe could devour and assimilate the Blazing Sun Source, the Taiji Universe would naturally be able to as well.</p><p></p><p>"I won't rush to try it on the Taiji Universe of my true body yet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, remaining exceptionally calm, and planned to try the Sun Primal Spirit's Solar Universe next.</p><p></p><p>Through the Yin Universe's fusion and devouring, Lin Yuan was well aware that there would be failures, leading to the collapse of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the collapse of the internal universes of the two great universes, the collapse of the Taiji Universe of his true body would be a much greater cost for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Without being certain, Lin Yuan would not attempt it in the Taiji Universe of his true body.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The next moment,</p><p></p><p>the Sun Primal Spirit appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness directly descended into the Solar Universe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the icy cold of the Yin Universe, the Solar Universe presented the completely opposite scene - everywhere was filled with the power of the sun.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin Universe was able to fuse and devour the Blazing Sun Source because their attributes were somewhat opposed, but the Solar Universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a while, and immediately condensed the Blazing Sun Source within the Solar Universe.</p><p></p><p>Radiance and heat.</p><p></p><p>Endless light and heat.</p><p></p><p>As the Solar Universe continuously fused and devoured the Blazing Sun Source, Lin Yuan clearly felt the changes in the Solar Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Dao path Lin Yuan walked was more complete than the single-extreme Yin-Yang paths, but that didn't mean the latter were weak.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the single-extreme paths could also reach unimaginable heights.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Blazing Sun Ancestor's Blazing Sun Dao directly entered the Thirteenth Realm, and the power paths evolved by other great Venerable Celestial Emperors from the Chaos were similar.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao has a myriad of variations, and different paths can lead to the same destination - there is no absolute strong or weak.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The sun and the blazing sun intertwined and collided, giving birth to even more scorching power.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Lin Yuan tried more than ten times, and the Sun Primal Spirit was destroyed more than ten times, before finally completely fusing and devouring the Blazing Sun Source.</p><p></p><p>"The current Solar Universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind. Even though he had been prepared earlier, the might of the Solar Universe now was in no way inferior to the Taiji Universe of his true body.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of Yin and Yang."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and the Yin Primal Spirit and the Sun Primal Spirit began to fuse.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji is formed by the fusion of Yin and Yang, and can naturally be differentiated into Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the Yin Primal Spirit and the Sun Primal Spirit would form the Taiji Primal Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a single Primal Spirit, the Taiji Primal Spirit would be stronger, and this was not just due to the Yin and Yang, but also because the powers of the two great Primal Spirits were fusing, so their final strength being greater was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>As the Yin Primal Spirit and the Sun Primal Spirit fused, their internal universes also began to fuse.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched with a grave expression. If the fusion failed now, the loss would be the two Primal Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze,</p><p></p><p>the Taiji Primal Spirit quickly took form.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A faint pressure emanated, and the formed Taiji Primal Spirit even brought a certain pressure to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiji Universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hesitate, directly descending his consciousness into the Taiji Primal Spirit's Taiji Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Universe of his true body was also a Taiji Universe, but it was far stronger than the Taiji Universe of the Taiji Primal Spirit, after all, it had so much more foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Overlooking the unprecedented Taiji Universe, Lin Yuan couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>After the fusion of the Yin Primal Spirit and the Sun Primal Spirit, the diameter of the resulting Taiji Universe was close to 900 billion light-years.</p><p></p><p>In addition, an invisible pressure permeated throughout the universe, and a blazing sun still shone in the center.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at that blazing sun, vaguely feeling as if he was looking at the eternal blazing sun of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only a slight resemblance, as the power of the blazing sun in the Taiji Universe was far from the eternal blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>"This Taiji Universe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed every detail of the Taiji Universe. "It is far stronger than the Taiji Universe of my true body."</p><p></p><p>As for exactly how much stronger, Lin Yuan could not determine, as he had no specific reference. He couldn't just have the two great Taiji Universes clash, could he? In the depths of the internal universe of his true body,</p><p></p><p>by the Jade Gourd, the red-robed girl was lazily kicking her legs.</p><p></p><p>"The master must have been a bit disappointed, leaving only a ten-centimeter mark on the Eternal Primal Gold."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl could sense that Lin Yuan had been a little disappointed at the time.</p><p></p><p>"I should comfort the master when I have the chance. That was Eternal Primal Gold, and a ten-centimeter mark is already quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yuan appeared beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl immediately jumped up.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Eternal Primal Gold?" Lin Yuan looked at the red-robed girl and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Primal Gold?" The red-robed girl blinked in slight confusion. "Master, what do you want the Eternal Primal Gold for?"</p><p></p><p>"I plan to try it again," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>the red-robed girl blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Try it again? Did the master feel he had not fully unleashed his power before? "Master, you are already very powerful, being able to leave a ten-centimeter mark on the Eternal Primal Gold."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl couldn't help but say, the enhancement of the internal universe was not something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl hadn't even sensed how long Lin Yuan had been cultivating the "Infinite Void" for the second layer.</p><p></p><p>At this point, to try the Eternal Primal Gold again? It didn't really serve any purpose, other than maybe leaving another ten-centimeter mark?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

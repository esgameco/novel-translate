            <p>Chapter 256: Is This the Peerless Genius You Speak Of? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Gourd."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the grayish-yellow gourd in his palm. </p><p></p><p>The moment it touched Lin Yuan's palm, the originally grayish-yellow gourd instantly lost its yellow color, turning into an ordinary-looking gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually sense whether I've absorbed the liquid inside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised. </p><p></p><p>Based on his experience using the gourd, the color of its surface depended on the user's absorption level of the liquid inside.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the main world, when Lin Yuan absorbed the orange-yellow liquid, the gourd's surface color also changed from gray to grayish-yellow. </p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The gray liquid inside the gourd provided an immense boost to his combat power. </p><p></p><p>Especially for his inner world, Lin Yuan's current inner world had reached a size of 4 million li (1 li â‰ˆ 0.5 km). As long as Lin Yuan recovered to the amplification level of the main world,</p><p></p><p>his inner world would surge to 20 million li.</p><p></p><p>This was just the amplification from the orange-yellow liquid. There were five more differently colored liquids to absorb later on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't dare imagine how much his inner world would grow once he fully absorbed all seven colored liquids.</p><p></p><p>"First, confirm qualification with a drop of blood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts and dripped a drop of fresh blood onto the gourd's surface. </p><p></p><p>Only creatures with the "Rebirth Power" in their bloodline could activate the gourd.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the so-called "Rebirth Power" was the aura of the divine ability "Rebirth by Blood".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long comprehended the imprint of this divine ability and replicated it in this body over the past hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>The blood verification passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately noticed the gourd starting to change.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson red liquid."</p><p></p><p>Turning the gourd upside down, he quickly saw the crimson red liquid condensing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began absorbing it without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Several years went by in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous hundred years, a few years felt like an instant.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple cave abode.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the upper limit shackles for human civilization evolvers was only around 10 million li for their inner worlds. This was a racial limitation that was nearly impossible to break through.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan's inner world had now easily reached 26 million li. If this were to spread to the main world's Human Civilization Alliance, it would likely cause the strongest experts to take action.</p><p></p><p>Such a method that could surpass the upper limits of higher races, even for the strongest, required paying a tragic price. But the liquid in the gourd could easily achieve it?</p><p></p><p>Inside the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure condensed.</p><p></p><p>"Such vast world power..."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Lin Yuan was a bit intoxicated. In the main world, Lin Yuan's inner world had barely reached 10 million li, still within the upper limit shackles of human evolvers' inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>But now, with an inner world of 26 million li, containing surging world power, it made Lin Yuan's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>The difference between 10 million li and 20 million li was absolutely more than double.</p><p></p><p>"Invincible at the 8th stage. With my current strength, even without using the 'Enhancement' divine ability, I should have reached the invincible level of the 8th stage." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, only inner worlds of tens of millions of li had the possibility of rivaling invincible experts at the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>But that was only in the case of having an inner world of tens of millions of li. Relying solely on the extremely vast world power was enough to contend with the cosmic power comprehended by 8th stage invincible experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current inner world, although only over 20 million li, still had many other means.</p><p></p><p>His overall combat power was already no weaker than a normal 8th stage invincible expert.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly raised his head and looked towards the sky above.</p><p></p><p>There, a sphere of light completely composed of Yin and Yang powers was suspended.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan re-entered the 7th stage and opened up his inner world, after the complete Yin and Yang laws manifested and began fusing in his inner world,</p><p></p><p>this scene appeared.</p><p></p><p>A sphere of light formed purely from Yin and Yang hung there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could feel that inside the sphere of light, after the Yin and Yang laws fused, they began evolving and advancing.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't interfere too much.</p><p></p><p>"It should be almost done evolving."</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing it, every bit of evolution of the Yin and Yang laws inside the sphere of light was completed naturally. Although Lin Yuan could intervene, he also understood that it was best to observe its changes at this time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Taiji was a Dao founded by Lin Yuan. Unlike the powers and laws of metal, wood, water, fire, earth, light, and lightning that had long existed in the universe,</p><p></p><p>the Dao of Taiji and Taiji Laws had never appeared before Lin Yuan established them, whether in the main world or other traversed worlds.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>A luxurious manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared here.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you're here!" Shen Zhen, who was watering flowers in the manor, immediately called out in joyful surprise upon seeing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping, who was cultivating, heard Shen Zhen's excited voice and immediately exited his seclusion. Pushing the door open, he also saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you haven't come for a long time." Lin Jianping said with a smile, "What's the matter? Are you busy with matters at the Martial Temple?"</p><p></p><p>"It's alright." Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Martial Temple were not managed by him. Even the few Grand Elders wouldn't interfere with the trivial matters of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>But during cultivation, occasionally going into seclusion for a few years was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Every time after ending his seclusion, Lin Yuan would usually visit his parents.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you work too hard. Whether it's cultivation or doing other things, you must pay attention to rest. Maybe it will have better results," Shen Zhen hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping also said with a chuckle, "That's right, son. Look at us, we've long been enjoying life. The matters of the business association have all been handed over to subordinates. With you as our backing, who would dare not take their work seriously?"</p><p></p><p>In recent years, Lin Jianping had been living quite comfortably. His son had become a big shot in the Martial Temple, and the major clans in Xiaoyao City were practically fighting to send him money and gifts.</p><p></p><p>"Those two fruits I sent you last time, have you eaten them?" Lin Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Those two fruits could prolong life and improve physique. Naturally, they had no effect on Lin Yuan, but for low-level cultivators like his parents, they still had an effect close to metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"I ate that fruit and felt decades younger. Son, do you still have that kind of fruit now?" Lin Jianping became interested.</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense are you talking about? Such immortal fruits would be treasures even in the Martial Temple. You old fellow, do you want to make things difficult for our son? Wasn't eating one enough?" Shen Zhen immediately became dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Until now, they still didn't know Lin Yuan's specific identity in the Martial Temple, only knowing that his status wasn't low.</p><p></p><p>So before Lin Yuan fully grew up, information about him would be sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"I was just asking." Lin Jianping also knew the preciousness of that kind of immortal fruit.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to eat it, next time I'll..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It still has a bit." Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>With his current nearly invincible eighth-stage strength, picking a few spirit fruits for prolonging life and strengthening the foundation was a breeze.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Xuan Wang Domain.</p><p></p><p>The three seventh-stage martial artists gathered together once again.</p><p></p><p>"This battle is almost over, and the three of us can finally return," one of the seventh-stage martial artists spoke.</p><p></p><p>His name was Shan Yang. Born in the Spirit Realm, he was fortunate to be accepted into the Martial Temple. Later, under the cultivation of the Martial Temple, he spent nearly 100,000 years crossing into the seventh stage of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang was very grateful to the Martial Temple. With his aptitude, if it weren't for the Martial Temple, he might have only been able to live for a hundred years like those mortals before returning to dust.</p><p></p><p>How could he have the current terrifying strength comparable to the means of true immortals?</p><p></p><p>"This time when we return, we can have a good rest," another seventh-stage martial artist said with a tone of emotion.</p><p></p><p>During the period of fighting for the Daode Immortal Sect, they had to fight against those Unified Dao true immortals almost every other period of time. Even for seventh-stage martial artists, this frequent fighting and killing was very exhausting.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't they say that the Martial Temple accepted a rare genius? This time when we return, the three of us should each take some time to guide him, striving to cultivate another seventh-stage for our martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing spoke.</p><p></p><p>As a living being who had ascended from the lower realm, he had received personal guidance from the legendary Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's strength had already reached the peak of the seventh stage. If it weren't for the lack of a way forward, he would have probably started attempting the ultimate eighth stage long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I dare not forget about this matter."</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang said with a smile, "This time when I return to the Martial Temple, I plan to take that little fellow to roam the Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm and comprehend the vast aura of the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Taking the Spirit Realm as the teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Not a bad method."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not clear about what kind of rare genius the Martial Temple had, taking the Spirit Realm as the teacher definitely wouldn't be wrong. The vast Spirit Realm had nurtured countless powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Roaming the Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm, even for them seventh-stage martial artists, occasionally they would gain some insight.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang thought again.</p><p></p><p>"If he can't bear it, take it slowly."</p><p></p><p>"Don't disregard his feelings either."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Ancestor Li, I know the limits."</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Once he discovered that the little fellow showed signs of being unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>He would immediately stop the roaming.</p><p></p><p>"I prepared three Qingtian Spirit Pills." Another seventh-stage martial artist spoke.</p><p></p><p>His name was Nie Yun, also a living being from the Spirit Realm. He entered the seventh stage of martial arts 20,000 years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Qingtian Spirit Pills? This is a foundation-building divine pill below the sixth stage. It shouldn't be easy to refine a furnace, right?" Shan Yang asked with slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's not easy, I must refine it."</p><p></p><p>"For the prosperity of our martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Although the current martial arts cultivation system already had three seventh-stage patriarchs presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those behemoths with a heritage of thousands and tens of thousands of years, it was still far inferior.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention others, just the Daode Immortal Sect alone could crush the current Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Daode Immortal Sect had dozens of Unified Dao true immortals presiding over it, and more than five true immortals at the peak of the Unified Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the immortal cultivation path taken by the Daode Immortal Sect had the potential for advancement to the Tribulation Transcendence stage.</p><p></p><p>Just this point alone was something the martial arts cultivation system could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>"For the prosperity of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's expression became solemn as she spoke word by word.</p><p></p><p>She vaguely remembered that it was Lin Yuan who had saved her in the East Sea back then and imparted martial arts to her.</p><p></p><p>So Li Qing had long regarded what Lin Yuan wanted to do as what she herself wanted to do, which was to spread the martial arts cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Now in the vast Spirit Realm, Li Qing still regarded this as her lifelong goal.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to attempt to absorb the orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying flames burned inside his body, mutually offsetting the rebirth power produced by the Dripping Blood Rebirth, and finally Lin Yuan's figure collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan used Dripping Blood Rebirth and returned once again.</p><p></p><p>"To completely absorb the orange-yellow liquid, it is estimated that there is still some time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed himself and slowly recovered from the pain experienced when absorbing the orange-yellow liquid earlier.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan's inner world had received a 5.2 times base amplification. If the orange-yellow liquid was fully absorbed, it would reach a 6.66 times amplification.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the size of the inner world would approach 26 million li.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a break first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not immediately start absorbing the orange-yellow liquid again.</p><p></p><p>Although the liquid inside the mysterious gourd could continuously enhance the physical body strength and inner world.</p><p></p><p>The destruction and suppression it brought to the mind and will was also getting heavier and heavier. Lin Yuan had to rest for at least a few hours after each absorption.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Elder is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>"The three patriarchs have returned?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly received a message from the Supreme Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>"The three seventh-stage martial artists, Li Qing." The image of Li Qing appeared in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>At that time, when his Sun Primordial Spirit was traveling in the East Sea, he saw a village on a small island being slaughtered by demon beasts, so Lin Yuan casually saved them.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing was from that village.</p><p></p><p>Later, Lin Yuan discovered that Li Qing had a not-low aptitude for martial arts cultivation, so he conveniently brought her back to White Jade Island.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and walked out of the cave abode, heading towards the main hall of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>At this time, inside the main hall of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Several Supreme Elders stood there respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Three figures sat in the main seat.</p><p></p><p>They were the three seventh-stage patriarchs of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Respectively - Li Qing, Shan Yang, Nie Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarchs, we have already informed Lin Chang to come over," the Supreme Grand Elder said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I know."</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang nodded, "After meeting later, I will directly take him to roam the Nine Heavens."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm, strictly speaking, were located in different spatial layers. Each heaven had unimaginable scenes, either the externalization of rules or the revelation of the essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>For low-stage cultivators, going to the Nine Heavens to observe was equivalent to a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Nine Heavens were not so easy to enter. Generally speaking, only Unified Dao true immortals could enter and roam.</p><p></p><p>As for bringing someone? Whether it was a true immortal or a seventh-stage, wanting to bring juniors into the Nine Heavens required paying a not-low price.</p><p></p><p>And the duration was limited.</p><p></p><p>Very soon.</p><p></p><p>Under the waiting of the three seventh-stage patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared and walked into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy."</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang carefully sized up Lin Yuan a few times and laughed loudly, "This patriarch will give you a great opportunity. Follow me to roam the Nine Heavens."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Shan Yang's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared again, he was already standing beside Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang grabbed Lin Yuan's shoulder, wanting to soar straight up to the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang's expression froze.</p><p></p><p>His right hand pressing on Lin Yuan's shoulder trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As if seeing a ghost, he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>How could it be so heavy?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

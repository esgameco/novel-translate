            <p>Chapter 291: Level 8 Citizen (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Battlefield B0001 is the battleground where the two apex races, human civilization and the Tianyu race, clash. üç≠üíò‚ùªÔºô—ï–Ω‚ìä·ô≠.ùêú·µí–ºüêíüç©</p><p></p><p>Although the scale of forces invested by both sides is not considered large compared to major battlefields, the total merit points earned from a single war on this entire battlefield, even if only one-tenth, is still a huge number.</p><p></p><p>It is enough for those high and mighty evolved scholars to "risk their lives" for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"27 million merit points."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan confirmed the latest amount of merit points received and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>This number completely met Lin Yuan's mental expectations, and even exceeded them by a lot.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that when Lin Yuan developed the complete Martial Dao Eighth Stage Chapter, it was judged by the three goddesses to be worth 22 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, whether it is the Martial Dao Eighth Stage Chapter, or the First and Second Stage Chapters...</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan uploads them, the ownership still belongs to him.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization officials act as an "intermediary", and in the end, they still need to give Lin Yuan a share.</p><p></p><p>However, an income of nearly 30 million merit points is definitely considered a big win.</p><p></p><p>"This is the wealth of war," Lin Yuan thought to himself. In times of peace, it would be hard to know how much effort it would take to accumulate so many merit points.</p><p></p><p>But now, it has been achieved in just a single war.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan is also aware that even on the alien battlefield, it is a rare opportunity to obtain so many merit points.</p><p></p><p>First, there must be a war of sufficient intensity, and victory must be achieved.</p><p></p><p>If the war against the Tianyu race this time ended in defeat or a draw for the humans, the merit points Lin Yuan would receive would be far less than 27 million.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it is like Lin Yuan directly sharing from the total merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has this treatment, but other invincible beings at the Eighth Stage do not have this qualification. The vast majority of invincible Eighth Stage beings in this war would obtain 100,000 to 200,000 merit points at most.</p><p></p><p>A war of sufficient intensity often lasts for decades or even hundreds of years. Before launching the all-out war, the Tianyu race had already been fighting against human evolvers for more than a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Only when they finally realized that human civilization was unable to take care of other matters did they decide to start an all-out war.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the merit points, there are also those eight Ninth Stage secret treasures and one spatial secret treasure." Lin Yuan raised his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Nine palm-sized weapons were suspended in front of him, slowly rotating and emitting a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actively suppressed his strength to lure the Tianyu race to send out one Eighth Stage life after another wielding Ninth Stage secret treasures, making the Tianyu race look exceptionally foolish.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, this was based on not knowing Lin Yuan's true strength.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan broke through the battlefield, even the apex races would not have thought that there would be such a powerful Eighth Stage life.</p><p></p><p>Killing invincible Eighth Stage beings like killing chickens.</p><p></p><p>Possessing battle power beyond ordinary Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>As for why they were not sent out together?</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan made a move, the advantage he displayed was not very big. Who would reveal all their cards from the start?</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if they were sent out together, it would not affect the outcome. With Lin Yuan's current strength, even if it was just a single avatar, it would be an unsolvable existence at the Eighth Stage level.</p><p></p><p>"These nine secret treasures, on average, are worth between 500,000 to 1 million cubic universes each. Added together, it will not be less than 4.5 million cubic universes, and at the high end, they are worth 9 million cubic universes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a rough estimate, and the smile on his face could not be stopped.</p><p></p><p>Just after ending the eighth crossing, Lin Yuan was still reluctant to part with the Taiwei Clear Crystal Heart worth 80,000 cubic universes, but soon after, he possessed a wealth of several million to tens of millions of cubic universes.</p><p></p><p>With such an amount of cubic universes, one can be considered wealthy even among Ninth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"My current merit points should be enough to upgrade to a Level 8 Citizen," Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>To upgrade from a Level 7 Citizen to a Level 8 Citizen requires 50 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan uploaded the Martial Dao Eighth Stage Chapter and received a reward of 22 million merit points. Adding the remaining from before, he had a total of 26 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the newly received 27 million merit points added in, Lin Yuan's total merit points reached an astonishing 53 million.</p><p></p><p>"I'll directly upgrade to a Level 8 Citizen," Lin Yuan did not hesitate and contacted the Wisdom Goddess to upgrade his citizen level.</p><p></p><p>Each time a citizen level is upgraded, it must be under the attention of the Wisdom Goddess, mainly to determine that the channels through which the citizen obtained the merit points are legal and compliant.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Great Scholar Lin Yuan, your citizen level has been upgraded to Level 8," the solemn and cold voice of the Wisdom Goddess came.</p><p></p><p>"Level 8 Citizen." Lin Yuan glanced at the citizen level column, which had changed from "7" to "8".</p><p></p><p>Level 8 Citizens represent a qualitative change. Usually, a star alliance that governs hundreds or thousands of star domains only has three or four Level 8 Citizens in the same era.</p><p></p><p>Even many evolved scholars have never reached the citizen level of Stage 8. 50 million merit points are too difficult to obtain, requiring evolved scholars to continuously develop achievements that promote human development.</p><p></p><p>Even if not limited to the path of evolution, with the trailblazing of one evolved scholar after another over more than 2 million years, this type of method for obtaining merit points has become increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>"The privileges of a Level 8 Citizen."</p><p></p><p>"Emails" were sent from the central star domain of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In addition to congratulations, they introduced the benefits and privileges of Level 8 Citizens.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Level 7 Citizens, the various benefits and privileges of Level 8 Citizens have undoubtedly been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The first is the Stage 8 evolution potion, which can forcibly promote a Stage 7 evolver to Stage 8, although it only has the basic destructive power of Stage 8 and is far inferior to Stage 8 evolvers who have developed an inner world and experienced the tribulation of the heart demon.</p><p></p><p>This type of forcibly promoted Stage 8 evolver may not even be able to defeat some peak Stage 7 evolvers.</p><p></p><p>But at least in terms of lifespan, they are not inferior to normal Stage 8 evolvers.</p><p></p><p>This is also what the human civilization officials are looking forward to. As long as a Level 8 Citizen is alive, there is a possibility of creating great value for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As for combat power? Human civilization has not declined to the point of needing Level 8 Citizens to defend the continuation of the race.</p><p></p><p>What are so many evolvers and star lords there for?</p><p></p><p>"Automatically becoming the Chief Councilor of the North Cold Star Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at one of the privileges of Level 8 Citizens.</p><p></p><p>The North Cold Star Alliance is the star alliance where the current Milky Way Star Domain is located. It is a newly developed star alliance, encompassing 1,335 star domains.</p><p></p><p>The Chief Councilor is the highest-ranking person in a star alliance. Although they cannot directly command the various star lords within the star alliance, they have a great influence on the star domains within the alliance.</p><p></p><p>They can even dismiss or reassign a star lord based on their actions.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the North Cold Star Alliance, being a newly formed star alliance, has not yet produced a Chief Councilor. Lin Yuan now counts as the first Chief Councilor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan now undoubtedly held the highest position in the North Cold Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this peripheral star domain alliance, where the divisions of the major star domains had not yet stabilized, the power of the Chief Speaker was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 8 Citizen and Great Scholar Lin Yuan, do you wish to conceal your Chief Speaker identity?" </p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom rang out.</p><p></p><p>The names of council members from the major star alliances would be listed on the council member list, and the name of the Chief Speaker would similarly be listed on a higher-level list.</p><p></p><p>"Conceal it," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Exposing his Chief Speaker identity would only bring him disadvantages and no benefits. Anyway, he could still enjoy all the privileges belonging to the Chief Speaker.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued browsing the rights of Level 8 Citizens and was suddenly startled upon seeing this clause.</p><p></p><p>There were countless evolving families in human civilization, with a large number of them being established and perishing every day.</p><p></p><p>However, evolving families that could add the prefix "Human" before their family name were extremely rare and almost never perished.</p><p></p><p>Evolving families using "Human" as a prefix were protected by the entire human civilization. Unless they committed acts of "betrayal", such families coexisted with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>All evolving families took the "Human" prefix as their highest goal, as it was an unprecedented honor.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that becoming a Level 8 Citizen would grant such qualifications," Lin Yuan marveled inwardly. The numerous privileges and benefits of high-level citizens at Level 8 were all protected by secret-level seals.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching that level, one simply wouldn't know what special privileges and treatments existed.</p><p></p><p>"Human prefix evolving families," Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>For example, if he were to establish an evolving family now, he could name it "Human Lin Family".</p><p></p><p>Members of evolving families with the "Human" prefix could enjoy the favor and a certain degree of resource allocation from the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"Other privileges..." Lin Yuan composed himself and continued reading.</p><p></p><p>Many of the privileges and benefits enjoyed by Level 8 Citizens were upgraded versions of those for Level 7 Citizens. For instance, Level 7 Citizens were entitled to a guard squad composed entirely of Level 7 Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>Level 8 Citizens, on the other hand, were entitled to a guard squad composed of Level 8 Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>However, this aspect was not very meaningful to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A guard squad composed of Level 8 Evolvers? With Lin Yuan's current strength, he could easily kill Level 8 invincibles, let alone ordinary Level 8 Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>The majestic figures of five Supreme Beings, including Supreme Being Xia Qin, Supreme Being Guli, Supreme Being Yu Die, and others, appeared and sat on tall thrones.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, those trash from the Feather Tribe still want to take advantage of the situation and make a move against our humans," Supreme Being Xia Qin sneered.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization and the Feather Tribe were both peak races. The Supreme Beings and Ancestors of both sides had clashed before, and Supreme Being Xia Qin looked down on the Ancestors of the Feather Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Because those bird people never dared to fight him head-on and always used the "authority" of their own evolution path to hide and attack.</p><p></p><p>"The Feather Tribe indeed suffered a loss this time," Supreme Being Yu Die chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan deliberately showed weakness, allowing the few geniuses of the Feather Tribe to take the initiative to send themselves to their deaths. Even if these geniuses were only avatars, they had completely lost face.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Supreme Beings, who overlooked the universe and starry sky, fearless and invincible, there were few things they cared about, but they definitely valued their own reputation.</p><p></p><p>The younger members of their race being pressed to the ground and slaughtered by a human junior - if this wasn't humiliating, what was?</p><p></p><p>"However, speaking of which, that little fellow, the Galaxy Star Lord, is indeed unreasonably strong. Apart from those extremely rare and even unique special lifeforms, can the evolvers of our human civilization also achieve Level 8 suppressing Level 9?" Supreme Being Guli couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a Supreme Being, he had to admit that when he was at Level 8, he was far from possessing the terrifying combat power Lin Yuan had.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look." Supreme Being Xia Qin looked ahead, and scenes of Lin Yuan's actions on the battlefield appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the complete spatial laws and completing half of the process in fusing laws. The power after fusion is indeed excessively strong," Supreme Being Xia Qin nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew that Lin Yuan had comprehended three kinds of high-level cosmic powers and complete spatial laws, and the fusion of the two would certainly have extraordinary power, this was still too extraordinary, right?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this little fellow's evolution path is special?" Supreme Being Yu Die said with a smile, "But the stronger this little fellow becomes, isn't it a good thing? Our human civilization being able to give birth to such a genius will only make us stronger and stronger in the future."</p><p></p><p>"That's true," Supreme Beings Xia Qin and Guli nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could human civilization continue to prosper forever.</p><p></p><p>"By the way," Supreme Being Yu Die suddenly said, "If I remember correctly, that cosmic secret realm is about to open, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That cosmic secret realm..." Supreme Being Xia Qin frowned.</p><p></p><p>The so-called cosmic secret realms were small worlds that relied on the main world.</p><p></p><p>They were originally hidden deep within layers of space, but for some reason, they formed a connection with the main spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Abyss Clan within the Insect Race Grand Alliance was the native race of the Dark Abyss Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The spatial layer where the Dark Abyss Secret Realm was located formed a passage with the main space of the universe. The Supreme Beings of the Insect Race joined forces to forcibly drag the Dark Abyss Secret Realm into the main space.</p><p></p><p>This gave rise to the Dark Abyss Clan.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Guli said.</p><p></p><p>"But we also gained quite a bit," Supreme Being Yu Die replied.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was fully comprehending the "Chaos Crystal".</p><p></p><p>This treasure, which the owner of the Magic Jade Tower had obtained by chance, had great indicative significance for Lin Yuan's law fusion.</p><p></p><p>Although the Chaos Crystal did not contain specific "demonstrations" of the fusion between spatial laws, Taiji laws, and various cosmic powers, observing the fusion of other laws, especially the fusion between basic laws and pillar laws, gave Lin Yuan a great sense of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Drawing inferences from one example.</p><p></p><p>Drawing inferences from a hundred examples.</p><p></p><p>"Once the spatial laws fully fuse with the Taiji laws and the numerous cosmic powers, there will definitely be a great transformation. At that time, the power of the fused force will definitely be incomparable to just fusing halfway," Lin Yuan thought to himself while comprehending.</p><p></p><p>After the fusion progress exceeded halfway, Lin Yuan clearly sensed that it was becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, with his heaven-defying comprehension ability, coupled with the "Chaos Crystal" and occasionally reviewing the "Void Interpretation", Lin Yuan's fusion speed still progressed at a pace that ordinary peak Level 8 Evolvers could hardly catch up to.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Lin Yuan was constantly attempting to fuse laws.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, split off a thread of consciousness, connected to the virtual world, and went to meet Star Lord Chi Kun.</p>

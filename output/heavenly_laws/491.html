        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After uploading the Eleventh Stage Scriptures, the Martial Dao became the Eleventh Stage evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>It was also the highest level evolutionary path under the Strongest Evolution Path.</p><p></p><p>"The latest ranking of the Martial Dao evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately looked at the 'Martial Dao' column in his personal information.</p><p></p><p>As the founder of the Martial Dao, Lin Yuan had the authority to view the latest rankings of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for other people, they could only see the updated evolution rankings after midnight.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even after uploading the Eleventh Stage Scriptures, Lin Yuan had already anticipated the ranking of the Martial Dao evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>It was still tenth.</p><p></p><p>After all, the nine major evolutionary paths before it were all Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>No matter how great the potential of the Eleventh Stage Scriptures of the Martial Dao was, it was ultimately not a Strongest Evolution Path and could not be compared to the Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>Howeverâ€”</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan saw the latest ranking of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, he couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao evolutionary path is ranked fifth in the human civilization evolution ranking!"</p><p></p><p>"Fifth?" Lin Yuan's expression was inevitably astonished.</p><p></p><p>Although it had only risen five places, from tenth to fifth, the Martial Dao evolutionary path had surpassed the Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the three Goddesses did not place much weight on the Strongest Evolution Paths in the evolution path ranking algorithm." Lin Yuan concluded.</p><p></p><p>If it was purely based on potential, the Martial Dao evolutionary path would definitely not be a Strongest Evolution Path. After all, the potential of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, no matter how high, could only possibly advance to the Strongest Evolution Path, but the Strongest Evolution Paths were already the Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the fact that the Martial Dao evolutionary path had entered the top five of human civilization meant that there must be other factors influencing it.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the Space-Time Fusion Rule Model."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the Space-Time Fusion Rule Model from the First Realm to the Fifth Realm had directly reduced the cultivation difficulty of the Eleventh Stage Evolution Cultivators of human civilization by several levels.</p><p></p><p>This influence was likely to exceed that of the Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan determined in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao evolutionary path becoming the fifth evolutionary path of human civilization would definitely cause the number of Martial Dao evolutionary cultivators to surge again.</p><p></p><p>This would also be helpful for Lin Yuan's upcoming assault on the Ultimate Path.</p><p></p><p>Although after the trip to the Immortal Realm, the number of Martial Dao evolutionary cultivators had already surpassed the total number of cultivators of the nine Strongest Evolution Paths, Lin Yuan was definitely not averse to having more Martial Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan continued to ponder and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the main universe, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the possibility of further advancement in the Seventh Realm of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was not from the Seventh Realm of Space-Time to the Eighth Realm, as the Seventh Realm of Space-Time was already the limit for Lin Yuan's level of existence.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eighth Realm of Space-Time? Even if he could comprehend it, he would be instantly overwhelmed by the vast amount of Space-Time Fusion Rule information.</p><p></p><p>But at least he could further advance within the Seventh Realm of Space-Time, such as reaching the middle stage of the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>The next day at dawn, the various evolution path rankings in the virtual world were updated.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao, the Martial Dao evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>"What happened to the Martial Dao? Could it be that the Eleventh Stage Scriptures have been updated?"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, whether the Martial Dao has updated the Eleventh Stage Scriptures or not, it doesn't have much impact on us. After all, the ranking won't change, and we don't know the specific potential of the Martial Dao's Eleventh Stage Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, many evolution cultivators and high-level citizens were not particularly concerned at first.</p><p></p><p>When the Martial Dao evolutionary path uploaded the Ninth Stage Scriptures and Tenth Stage Scriptures, its ranking rose significantly, piquing their curiosity, so they had rushed to purchase the latest Martial Dao scriptures to explore.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao evolutionary path had already become the tenth evolutionary path of humanity, and above it were the Strongest Evolution Paths. The gap between them was too large.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial Dao's Eleventh Stage Scriptures were exceptionally and miraculously outstanding, could it really surpass the Strongest Evolution Paths?</p><p></p><p>"Fifth, the Martial Dao evolutionary path has become the fifth evolutionary path of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"What? Could it be that the Martial Dao evolutionary path has continuously updated the Eleventh Stage Scriptures and Twelfth Stage Scriptures?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the Martial Dao evolutionary path has only updated the Eleventh Stage Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>"Just by updating the Eleventh Stage Scriptures, it has ranked fifth in the evolutionary paths of human civilization? Surpassing the five major Strongest Evolution Paths?"</p><p></p><p>Countless evolution cultivators and high-level citizens of human civilization were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, the nine Strongest Ones reigned supreme, and the nine Strongest Evolution Paths corresponded to them.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was an exceptionally talented genius or a remarkably outstanding evolutionary path, unless it could also enter the Strongest Evolution Paths, it would be impossible to compare with those nine Strongest Evolution Paths.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Martial Dao evolutionary path does have great potential and may become a Strongest Evolution Path, but how could it surpass the Strongest Evolution Paths?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it may have the potential to become a Strongest Evolution Path, but it is ultimately not a Strongest Evolution Path."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Stage Evolution Cultivators of human civilization were also shaken. Even those hidden Eleventh Stage Evolution Cultivators who had not revealed themselves to the alien races since the Star Sea Era were equally stunned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was almost unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh-Stage Cultivation Path had surpassed the Five Great Strongest Cultivation Paths, becoming the Fifth Cultivation Path of human civilization?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Three Goddesses made a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"The Three Goddesses made a mistake? The ranking changes among the Strongest Cultivation Paths could not have been decided by the Three Goddesses alone. The Nine Strongest Ones must have known about it long ago."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Cultivation Path being ranked fifth was likely approved by the Nine Strongest Ones."</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of incredulity, the ancient Eleventh-Stage cultivators of human civilization quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Doubting that the Three Goddesses made a mistake was unrealistic. Even if the Three Goddesses had made a mistake, could it be that the Nine Strongest Ones of human civilization had also made a mistake? After all this time, the ranking of the Martial Dao Cultivation Path had not changed, indicating that there was no error or mistake in this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Strongest Ones have placed the Martial Dao Cultivation Path in the fifth rank, the Eleventh-Stage Scriptures must contain some information of great significance?"</p><p></p><p>"I will purchase the Eleventh-Stage Scriptures and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh-Stage cultivators of human civilization immediately began purchasing the scriptures. They were too curious about what profound mysteries were contained within the Martial Dao Cultivation Path that had risen to the fifth rank among the Cultivation Paths.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a rule model?"</p><p></p><p>"So many rule models of pillar-level fusion rules?"</p><p></p><p>"And a rule model of space-time fusion rules?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, no wonder!"</p><p></p><p>The many Eleventh-Stage cultivators who had purchased the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures with various emotions immediately fell silent and began to frenziedly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>The numerous rule models of pillar-level fusion rules and space-time fusion rules were equivalent to a grand dao that reached the heavens. Even those Eleventh-Stage cultivators who had already attained the fifth realm of space-time comprehension were greatly impacted and immediately began to seclude themselves in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space within the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Strongest Ones of human civilization sat on their thrones.</p><p></p><p>"You five have no objections to letting the Martial Dao Cultivation Path rise to the fifth rank, right?" The Xuanyuan Strongest One swept his gaze across the five Strongest Ones.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom had specifically asked him whether the ranking was based on the final assessment of merit points, which was out of consideration for preserving the face of the Strongest Ones.</p><p></p><p>After all, having the Eleventh-Stage Martial Dao Cultivation Path surpass the Five Great Strongest Cultivation Paths might cause some emotional reactions from the corresponding five Strongest Ones.</p><p></p><p>"No objections."</p><p></p><p>The five Strongest Ones shook their heads and said, "The influence of the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures on human civilization is indeed greater than that of a single Strongest Cultivation Path."</p><p></p><p>Those who could advance to the Twelfth Stage naturally had an accurate judgment of the Martial Dao Cultivation Path.</p><p></p><p>The ranking of human civilization's cultivation paths only considered the influence of the paths themselves, but the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures would have a far-reaching impact on all cultivators of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This was something that some of the Strongest Cultivation Paths could not match.</p><p></p><p>"But we must be careful of other alien races."</p><p></p><p>The Virtuoso Strongest One suddenly said that the numerous rule models contained in the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures would be of great benefit to any evolving life, not just the cultivators of human civilization. The strong ones of other alien races would also benefit from them.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have reinforced the transmission channels through the Ancestral Martial Weapons several times."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Strongest One nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>To purchase the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures and obtain the various rule models within, one could only do so through the official virtual world of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Strongest One had reinforced this purchase channel repeatedly, ensuring that it would not leak out.</p><p></p><p>As for whether one could transmit it out after purchasing it, even if one fully comprehended all the rule models in the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures, they would not be able to transmit them.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending is one thing, but being able to express and transmit it is another.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the Nine Strongest Ones of human civilization all had space-time sixth-realm comprehension, but they could not perfect the rule models from space-time first-realm to space-time fifth-realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless one could reach the realm of Lin Yuan, even if they had observed all the rule models, they would not be able to express them, at most only knowing them themselves.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the only channel for other alien races to obtain the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures was to infiltrate human civilization, disguise themselves as human cultivators, and purchase them in the official virtual world.</p><p></p><p>But the risk was too great. The virtual world of human civilization was extremely strict in identifying alien identities. Out of a hundred infiltrating alien spies and assassins, perhaps not even one would survive the initial screening.</p><p></p><p>Those alien spies and assassins who managed to infiltrate were essentially "suicide squads," already prepared to have their avatar bodies completely destroyed and their true selves annihilated at any moment when discovered by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures would be most useful for Eleventh-Stage cultivators, but for an Eleventh-Stage alien to infiltrate human civilization? Every Eleventh-Stage cultivator in human civilization was accounted for and under the attention of the Strongest Ones. It would be impossible for a new Eleventh-Stage alien to sneak in unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>As for those alien geniuses? The alien races would not allow their own prodigies to risk the annihilation of their avatar bodies by infiltrating human civilization to obtain the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>"The completion and perfection of the Martial Dao Eleventh-Stage Scriptures indicates that the Galactic Lord is not far from breaking through to the Twelfth Stage."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Strongest One spoke with anticipation, smiling.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

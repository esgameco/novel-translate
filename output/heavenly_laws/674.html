        <h1>Chapter 674</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of Scorching Sun glanced at the burly and big-eyed Progenitor of Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Still speaking as equals? He himself was standing here, and if the Progenitor of Wilderness spoke as an equal with the Celestial Overlord of the Galaxy, where would that leave him?</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Progenitor of Dark Yin changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>That old fellow from the Wilderness, was he now currying favor? The mighty Progenitor of Time and Life, actually being so shameless!</p><p></p><p>"I think the Progenitor of Wilderness' proposal is very good," the Progenitor of Great Spirit nodded. "I also feel an instant connection with Elder Brother Galaxy, as if I've known him for a long time. After all, the Cyan Burning Domain where Galaxy first appeared is adjacent to my Great Spirit domain, so we are quite fated."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of Dark Yin looked at the Progenitor of Great Spirit, as if seeing him anew.</p><p></p><p>"I am still far behind the esteemed Progenitors," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was far inferior to the Thirteenth-Tier Progenitors. If the Progenitors harbored the intent to kill him, Lin Yuan would be utterly powerless to resist, and could only abandon everything in this source world, waiting until he broke through to the Thirteenth-Tier before making any plans.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the age of his experiences, Lin Yuan was also far behind the Progenitors. Even the youngest Progenitor of Wilderness was incomparably ancient, and when converted to the timescale of the Chaotic Void, it was billions upon billions of universes ago.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan regarded the Progenitors with great reverence. This was a respect for the pioneers on the path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Come in and we'll discuss it slowly," the Progenitor of Scorching Sun spoke. Having six Progenitors, plus Lin Yuan the future Progenitor, standing outside was not ideal, so they naturally had to go inside the palace to converse.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the Progenitor of Scorching Sun led the five Progenitors and Lin Yuan into a grand hall within the imperial palace. This grand hall was the highest-ranking hall in the capital's rules, where even the emperor was normally not allowed to enter - only the Progenitors could use it. Now that the five Progenitors had come to pay their respects, they would naturally discuss matters in this grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Before entering this grand hall, the Progenitor of Scorching Sun had already prepared everything, having already instructed his subordinates to bring in precious delicacies and fine wines.</p><p></p><p>The six Progenitors, along with Lin Yuan, walked into the grand hall and sat down in seven seats arranged in a circle. These seven seats were on the same level, with no hierarchy, an arrangement specially made by the Progenitor of Scorching Sun, and the other five Progenitors had no objections.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Lin Yuan would eventually become a Progenitor like them, and the "speaking as equals" mentioned by the Progenitor of Wilderness, while having an element of flattery, was nonetheless the truth. </p><p></p><p>None of the Progenitors dared to put on airs in front of Lin Yuan, not even the mightiest Progenitor of Great Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I've long wanted to savor this bottle of Scorching Divine Wine, but you've always been so stingy, Scorching Sun," the Progenitor of Great Spirit chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also sat down, eyeing the "Scorching Divine Wine" mentioned by the Progenitor of Great Spirit. He had never heard of this name before, but judging from the Progenitor's expression, it was clearly a fine wine greatly coveted by the Progenitors of Time and Life.</p><p></p><p>Attendants continuously brought out delicacies and fine wines. The attendants able to enter and exit this grand hall were all Celestial Overlord-level beings - such an opportunity to be so close to the Progenitors was something even the pinnacle Supremacy Celestial Overlords could rarely encounter.</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen all five Progenitors visit together before."</p><p></p><p>The attendants entering and exiting the hall held their breath, extremely careful.</p><p></p><p>In the long past eras, there would occasionally be a single Progenitor visiting the Progenitor of Scorching Sun, but five Progenitors gathered together? That had never happened before. </p><p></p><p>Especially the most ancient Progenitor of Great Abyss - to get this Progenitor to visit was incredibly difficult, as it was usually the Progenitor of Scorching Sun visiting the Progenitor of Great Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"And this Galaxy Celestial Overlord, how is he also sitting beside the six Progenitors?"</p><p></p><p>Some attendants recognized Lin Yuan. In fact, any powerful expert in the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom would know of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled the attendants was, how could a Celestial Overlord, no matter how powerful, sit alongside the Progenitors? Celestial Overlord-level strength was nothing in the face of the Progenitors - they were mere ants.</p><p></p><p>Although the attendants were puzzled in their hearts, with Lin Yuan sitting there and the Progenitors accepting it, they naturally did not dare voice any opinions, only filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hall, the Progenitor of Wilderness tasted the "Scorching Divine Wine" and smiled at Lin Yuan: "Galaxy Elder Brother, you have reached such battle prowess without even breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier yet. I reckon even that 'Abyss Dragon' from the dawn of the heavens and earth was no greater than you."</p><p></p><p>"That 'Abyss Dragon' had such power because it took advantage of the opportunity of the heavens and earth's creation, but you have reached this level through your own efforts. When you eventually succeed in your breakthrough, remember to take us under your wing."</p><p></p><p>The attending servants heard these words and their minds went completely blank.</p><p></p><p>Take them under his wing? Take the Progenitor of Wilderness, a Thirteenth-Tier expert, under his wing? Even if Galaxy Celestial Overlord could break through to the Thirteenth-Tier, to say he would take them under his wing might be a bit inappropriate. The servants were greatly shocked, sensing that the other Progenitors showed no objection, but instead sat there smiling at the Galaxy Celestial Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Taking you under my wing is undeserved," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized that the five Progenitors must have foreseen certain aspects of his future, and thus came to visit and curry his favor in advance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally would not refuse such goodwill from a Progenitor of Time and Life. Even if he faced the killing intent of the Progenitors, he could at least survive by abandoning everything in this source world, waiting until he broke through to the Thirteenth-Tier before making any plans.</p><p></p><p>But if he could grow peacefully, there was no need to increase the difficulty for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Galaxy Elder Brother, this is a gift I've prepared for your first visit," the Progenitor of Wilderness took out a jade axe the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Emanating a fierce and destructive aura.</p><p></p><p>This jade axe gave Lin Yuan a feeling even more powerful than the crimson spear in the ancient treasure vault of the Scorching Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Lin Yuan looked at the jade axe in front of the Primordial Ancestor, his expression slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>A Tier 13 weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Ancestor just gave it to him? Lin Yuan thought of the Chaotic Void Cauldron, the Mysterious Emperor had paid a heavy price and made great sacrifices just to temporarily hold that Tier 13 weapon. </p><p></p><p>As soon as the true owner of this Tier 13 weapon wanted it back, it would be gone in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had obtained a Tier 13 weapon so easily, without any strings attached?</p><p></p><p>"This axe is called the Ancient Source Axe. I discovered a special material called Ancient Source Essence while wandering between dimensions, and it took me three trillion years to forge this. Its offensive power is unparalleled," the Primordial Ancestor said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Brother, you cannot unleash the full power of this axe yet, but in the future, you should be able to make use of it."</p><p></p><p>"This is too precious." Lin Yuan looked at the Ancient Source Axe.</p><p></p><p>Although the Primordial Ancestor spoke casually, Lin Yuan could tell that this jade axe was more precious than ordinary Tier 13 weapons.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." The Primordial Ancestor shook his head. "I've found a weapon more suitable for me, so keeping this Ancient Source Axe is meaningless. It would be better to find a more appropriate owner for it."</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Ancestor, if you think it's meaningless, you can give it to me," the Mysterious Yin Ancestor couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Give it to you?" The Primordial Ancestor glared. "You're not suited for it."</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Brother, please don't refuse it." The Primordial Ancestor turned to look at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Silver River, just take it, it's a precious treasure," the Scorching Sun Ancestor smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, take it," the Primordial Ancestor nodded, then pushed the palm-sized jade axe towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Lin Yuan didn't refuse, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Brother."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Abyss Ancestor smiled at Lin Yuan: "Earlier, Silver River Brother, you specifically asked for a hundred catties of 'Abyss Dragon's Blood'. I suppose you're quite curious about that 'Abyss Dragon'."</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancestor continued, "After much thought, I've prepared this for Silver River Brother."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a pulsing heart appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>With each heartbeat, an invisible force permeated the layers of space-time. This heart was like a miniature Source World, emanating a terrifying aura with every pulsation.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The heart of the Abyss Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who had refined a lot of 'Abyss Dragon's Blood', immediately recognized the source of this heart.</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancestor nodded: "That Abyss Dragon was the first life form created at the dawn of this world, carrying countless fortunes and opportunities. After I slew it, the remnant essence and blood formed the treasure land of the Abyss Dragon Valley, but the most precious part of that Abyss Dragon was refined into this heart."</p><p></p><p>"By comprehending this heart, you can sense many secrets of that Abyss Dragon, especially regarding the creation of this world."</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancestor spoke briefly.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the heart before the Great Abyss Ancestor, aware of its priceless value.</p><p></p><p>Although the Abyss Dragon was not a Tier 13 time life, it was the first life form nurtured by the Source World and had an extraordinary connection to it. Refining and comprehending the heart it left behind would allow him to inherit some of the Abyss Dragon's essential nature.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Lin Yuan could sense the aura of a miniature Source World from this heart.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Dragon, favored by heaven and earth, had every particle containing a vast world. The world nurtured by its heart was even a miniature Source World.</p><p></p><p>Its value was even greater than a Tier 13 weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Brother, don't refuse it. For me, this heart is of no more use," the Great Abyss Ancestor said, placing the Abyss Dragon's heart in front of Lin Yuan without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the other Ancestors also brought gifts to visit, either Tier 13 weapons or rare treasures from between dimensions, things Lin Yuan had never even heard of before.</p><p></p><p>The attending servants were all stunned, watching as the Ancestors gave Lin Yuan one precious treasure and rare weapon after another, especially the Ancestors' unusually warm and affectionate attitudes towards him.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if the servants were seeing an illusion. Weren't the Ancestors supposed to be aloof and indifferent, viewing all beings as ants?</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Abyss Ancestor, who was most fond of his descendants, didn't usually pay so much attention to individual descendants.</p><p></p><p>But now, all the servants felt that the Ancestors were extremely friendly and amiable towards the Silver River Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Like benevolent elders, far from the cold and heartless rumors.</p>

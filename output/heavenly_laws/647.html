        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden mist appeared like clouds, able to be captured and contained, but Lin Yuan could not touch it.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to touch it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was strange, the divine ability 'World' constantly operating, with the countless dimensions all under his control, yet he could not truly make contact with the golden mist.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand, prepared to collect all the golden mist in the valley.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the golden mist would not be damaged, Lin Yuan moved the entire valley into his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>"It should be related to time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden mist, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>He could faintly sense temporal fluctuations from the golden mist, combined with the time reversal region outside the blessed land, he could basically confirm this newly born first-grade blessed land was inclined towards the attribute of time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the many conjectures of the ancient nations regarding this blessed land also believed the rare treasures it nurtured would be related to time.</p><p></p><p>"Should I try a spiritual soul inquiry?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Many rare treasures nurtured in blessed lands must be absorbed and refined using special methods.</p><p></p><p>For example, the black jade nurtured in the Black Jade Nest could only be refined by the will of the spirit and soul. As for other methods? They would have no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's too risky."</p><p></p><p>After brief consideration, Lin Yuan abandoned this idea.</p><p></p><p>The spirit and soul were too important. What if this golden rare treasure had some side effect or harm to the spirit and soul? Wouldn't that be courting disaster?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan dared to refine the black jade with the will of his spirit and soul because the Black Jade Nest had existed for countless billions of years, and the refinement method of the black jade nurtured within had been verified by countless Supremes, without any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>But this golden mist? Who knows what effects it might have.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no need to be too impatient.</p><p></p><p>He could obtain the golden mist in this valley, and the Supremes of the other ancient nations could certainly also obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the experienced Supremes of the six ancient nations, Lin Yuan felt he should wait a bit longer, until the proper usage method of the golden mist was explored, before attempting it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Continue searching for the core celestial pillar."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not linger too long in the valley, and after collecting all the golden mist, he continued to search in the direction.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Nation, an independent space.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme opened his eyes again: "I have found another core celestial pillar."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other Supremes around him turned to look at him.</p><p></p><p>Searching for the core celestial pillars within the blessed land was truly a matter of luck.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme's exploration methods were not the strongest among the twelve Supremes, but the number of core celestial pillars he had found ranked among the top five, or even top three.</p><p></p><p>"In what location?"</p><p></p><p>"You refine the outer part first."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme said.</p><p></p><p>Although the core celestial pillars were generally left to the top Supremes to refine, before the top Supremes arrived, the Supreme who first discovered the pillar would certainly be allowed to refine a portion.</p><p></p><p>"It's here."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme immediately provided the coordinates, and his expression suddenly changed: "Other Supremes from ancient nations have arrived, it's a Supreme from the Great Submersion Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme from the Great Submersion Ancient Nation?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme frowned and quickly asked, "Which Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>If it was a top Supreme, the Crimson Flame Supreme would suggest the Scarlet Lotus Supreme yield that core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>It was not out of fear of the Great Submersion Ancient Nation, but because with the Scarlet Lotus Supreme's strength, he would not be able to hold out for long against a top Supreme from the Great Submersion Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Scarlet Lotus Supreme had hidden his true strength like Lin Yuan, but the possibility of that was too low.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Submergence Sway Supreme."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme said quickly.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew all twelve Supremes of the Great Submersion Ancient Nation, even if he had not fought them, he had seen their detailed information.</p><p></p><p>"The Submergence Sway Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Among the twelve Supremes of the Great Submersion Ancient Nation, the Submergence Sway Supreme was of medium strength, approaching the level of the top Supremes, stronger than the Scarlet Lotus Supreme, but not by too much.</p><p></p><p>"Defend the core celestial pillar."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme said.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Submersion Ancient Nation was powerful, it did not mean the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation was afraid of them. As long as it was not the Submergence Void Supreme and those few top Supremes, the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation had no need to retreat.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the ownership of this first-grade blessed land, as long as there was a chance to win, they must fight for it.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the Submergence Sway Supreme was stronger than him, it was not a matter of winning or losing against the Submergence Sway Supreme, only to hold him off, and the Scarlet Lotus Supreme was confident in that.</p><p></p><p>"This location."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme looked at Lin Yuan: "Silver River, among the four of us, you are closest to this position, so I'll leave it to you next."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>As one of the four top Supremes of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, Lin Yuan also had the task of refining the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>If the core celestial pillars discovered by the other Supremes of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation were closest to him, Lin Yuan would need to go there.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Scarlet Lotus?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan stopped in the blessed land and looked towards another direction.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The next moment, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared, and the space-time only rippled after a while.</p><p></p><p>Normally, searching for the core celestial pillars would require slowly flying and searching.</p><p></p><p>But to quickly reach a certain coordinate, he could directly teleport through the void.</p><p></p><p>The majestic celestial pillar seemed illusory.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme stood before the pillar, his expression grave, with blooming scarlet lotus flames burning around his body.</p><p></p><p>"Scarlet Lotus, step away from this core celestial pillar."</p><p></p><p>A cold voice echoed through the void.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a towering figure stood, his skin covered in purple scales - the Submergence Sway Supreme of the Great Submersion Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Among the twelve Supremes sent by the Great Submersion Ancient Nation, the strongest was the Submergence Void Supreme, one of the most powerful Supremes in the history of the six ancient nations, having mastered a certain supreme legacy.</p><p></p><p>Below the Submergence Void Supreme were four top Supremes, and the Submergence Sway Supreme was the third tier of Supremes after them.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Submergence Sway, do you think you are a top Supreme? Or the Submergence Void Supreme?" The Scarlet Lotus Supreme sneered.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also stalling for time.</p><p></p><p>"Dealing with you is enough."</p><p></p><p>The Submergence Sway Supreme's gaze was icy, and he immediately waved his right hand, striking towards the Scarlet Lotus Supreme from afar.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme was on high alert, not underestimating him at all, directly activating his defensive killing move, with blooming scarlet lotus flames beginning to boil and rotate around his body.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle~ The next moment, the Scarlet Lotus Supreme's protective scarlet lotus began to collapse, quickly dissipating under the Submergence Sway Supreme's strike.</p><p></p><p>"So strong?"</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme felt the pressure, as his protective scarlet lotus had been destroyed by more than half just from the initial exchange, making him doubt whether he could hold out until Lin Yuan arrived.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, this core celestial pillar must be defended."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Supreme steeled his heart, as the ownership of this blessed land was at stake, and perhaps the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation was only missing one core celestial pillar to claim this land?</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>The Submergence Sway Supreme continued to attack, each strike causing the Scarlet Lotus Supreme's protective scarlet lotus to be destroyed by more than half, but more lotus flames quickly coalesced.</p><p></p><p>"These scarlet lotus are..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fight to the death with me." The Fudang Heavenly Venerable naturally understood that the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable had quickly gathered his annihilating protective Hongmian lotus, and he could not avoid paying a price.</p><p></p><p>"What does fighting to the death matter?" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable's eyes were filled with purple, and the power of each strike he unleashed was rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Originally, a single strike could destroy more than half of the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable's protective Hongmian lotus, but now it directly destroyed half, or even more.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold out much longer," the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable sighed inwardly. In terms of strength, he was indeed no match for the Fudang Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now, in order to defend the core celestial pillar behind him, he was like a target allowing the Fudang Heavenly Venerable to attack him.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, holding out until now was already remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's strike annihilates all my protective Hongmian lotus, that will be the moment my main combat physical body perishes," the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it were a normal confrontation, he would naturally have the confidence to escape unharmed from the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's hands.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was not a normal confrontation, but the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable being hit one-sidedly, and it was a fight to the death without retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable's aura burst forth, and the purple energy swirled around him, about to unleash a heaven-shaking strike.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the space-time slightly distorted, and a figure silently emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The Yinhe Heavenly Venerable has arrived?" The Hongmian Heavenly Venerable's heart rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>"The Yinhe Heavenly Venerable?" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>He had certainly heard of the reputation of the Yinhe Heavenly Venerable, who had destroyed an entire Lingyu Heavenly Venerable's Lingyu, possessing the strength of a top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Yinhe Heavenly Venerable has arrived, you still have to die." The Fudang Heavenly Venerable also unleashed his true fire. If it weren't for the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable fighting to the death without retreat, he probably would have already taken this core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" As Lin Yuan just arrived nearby, he saw the Fudang Heavenly Venerable pressing the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Hongmian Heavenly Venerable was like a rickety boat about to capsize at any moment under the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's strike.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the divine abilities world began to operate, and the external universe instantly expanded, encompassing the area within a billion li in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Fudang Heavenly Venerable was quickly suppressed by the vast external universe, and the purple energy world spinning around him constantly shrank.</p><p></p><p>"This?" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable's pupils contracted, as he had completely lost control of the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>"The Yinhe Heavenly Venerable's domain suppression technique is so strong?" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable was completely panicked.</p><p></p><p>The Great Ling Ancient Country had indeed spread some intelligence information about Lin Yuan, such as an introduction to this Yinhe Heavenly Venerable, mentioning that his domain suppression technique was quite strong.</p><p></p><p>But the Fudang Heavenly Venerable never imagined it would be this powerful, as the moment he appeared, he was already suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Since you, the Yinhe Heavenly Venerable, have arrived, this core celestial pillar, the Great Fu Ancient Country will cede it to you." The Fudang Heavenly Venerable immediately shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt an unprecedented pressure from Lin Yuan. Even among the four top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerables of the Great Fu Ancient Country, only two could exert this kind of pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Fu Ancient Country occupied the most first-class blessed lands and enjoyed the best resources of the six ancient countries. Among the experts at the same level, the Great Fu Ancient Country's powerhouses would surpass those of the other five ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after confirming the current situation, the only thought that surfaced in the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's mind was to retreat immediately.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's words were not even finished when he activated the purple energy world, fleeing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's suppression of the external universe, the Fudang Heavenly Venerable could not perform any void traversal.</p><p></p><p>"You want to leave?" Lin Yuan looked at him from afar, immediately seeing through the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's intention.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingyu could leave because I didn't want to kill him too much trouble, but you?" Lin Yuan's gaze fell on the purple energy world, and his heart slightly moved: "It's just right for me to try out the killing technique I just comprehended."</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>High in the external universe, a series of blazing suns coalesced.</p><p></p><p>These blazing suns slowly floated, and suddenly one of the blazing suns slowly fell, heading towards the fleeing purple energy world.</p><p></p><p>As the first blazing sun fell, the second, third, and fourth blazing suns followed suit.</p><p></p><p>This killing technique was called the "Descent of the Blazing Suns", and it was one of Lin Yuan's most powerful killing techniques, second only to detonating the external universe.</p><p></p><p>Detonating the external universe was indeed terrifyingly powerful, but it required Lin Yuan to pay the price of temporary weakness. This "Descent of the Blazing Suns" technique, however, had no such hidden danger. Although its power was slightly lower than the external universe detonation, it made up for it by being continuous.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!!! When the first blazing sun hit the Fudang Heavenly Venerable, this supreme Heavenly Venerable could still withstand it.</p><p></p><p>But when the two hundredth, three hundredth, and four hundredth blazing suns continued to descend, the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's purple energy world quickly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe Heavenly Venerable!" The Fudang Heavenly Venerable suddenly turned around, staring intently at Lin Yuan, and his physical body and soul were completely annihilated under the bombardment of the two thousandth and three thousandth blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>"He could only last until the three thousandth?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Theoretically, his killing technique would continue to descend until it reached thirty-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>"I'm too late." After dealing with the Fudang Heavenly Venerable, Lin Yuan collected his remains and flew in front of the Hongmian Heavenly Venerable, saying, "Not too late."</p><p></p><p>The Hongmian Heavenly Venerable was a bit dazed. He had persisted with great difficulty under the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's attacks, but the Fudang Heavenly Venerable's time of persistence in front of the Yinhe Heavenly Venerable was even less than his own.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it couldn't even be called persistence. The Fudang Heavenly Venerable never intended to persist, he wanted to flee first, but failed to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Then Venerable, you can go ahead and refine the celestial pillar." The Hongmian Heavenly Venerable immediately yielded his position, as the core celestial pillar was behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lin Yuan did not decline, as this was the main task.</p><p></p><p>In the independent space, the Qiyan Heavenly Venerable was surprised to see Lin Yuan: "Yinhe, you have killed that Fudang Heavenly Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>As an expert close to the top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerable level, even when facing a top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerable, the Fudang Heavenly Venerable would have a chance to save his life, unless he was determined to fight to the death with the top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I comprehended a killing technique that is somewhat effective against him," Lin Yuan explained.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the "Descent of the Blazing Suns" killing technique was effective against any Heavenly Venerable below the top-tier supreme level.</p><p></p><p>Unless one could completely block the power of the endless descending blazing suns, no Heavenly Venerable would be able to withstand tens of thousands of blazing suns falling.</p><p></p><p>Even for a top-tier supreme Heavenly Venerable, facing tens of thousands of blazing suns, they would have to divert some of their mental focus to defend against it.</p><p></p><p>"Effective?" The Qiyan Heavenly Venerable looked deeply at Lin Yuan. As a supreme Heavenly Venerable, their techniques and abilities were already quite perfect, and there was almost no way to counter them.</p><p></p><p>Later, Lin Yuan continued to compete for the core celestial pillars in the blessed lands, and the reputation of the Yinhe Heavenly Venerable spread far and wide after a few conflicts with other ancient country powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>One day, in the independent space of the Yeli Country.</p><p></p><p>The Qiyan Heavenly Venerable suddenly looked at the other eleven supreme Heavenly Venerables, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Venerables," the Qiyan Heavenly Venerable smiled, "We have finally figured out how to use and absorb the golden mist that has been produced in the blessed lands."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

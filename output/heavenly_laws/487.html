            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 487 - Returning (End of this Volume, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the Immortal Realm can easily mobilize the power of the entire Immortal Realm. Even the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, who is at the Twelfth Realm, has to retreat in the face of the boundless power of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Immortal Realm is like the body of the Immortal Realm consciousness. Even if Lin Yuan enters the core of the source, he cannot mobilize the power of the Immortal Realm here.</p><p></p><p>However, the Immortal Realm consciousness can still control the myriad rules themselves and contend with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the core of the source is where the myriad rules exist, and the Immortal Realm consciousness also has control over the myriad rules themselves.</p><p></p><p>But after Lin Yuan nurtured the Chaos Rule, it naturally suppresses the myriad rules, and the Immortal Realm consciousness realized that even if it controls the myriad rules, it cannot deal with Lin Yuan, so it naturally began to fear him.</p><p></p><p>After all, at this moment, as long as Lin Yuan wishes, he can forcibly erase the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Immortal Realm consciousness still has the ability to resist, which is to actively initiate the Great Destruction, guiding the collapse of the Immortal Realm, so that the myriad rules of the Immortal Realm will actively condense into the Chaos Rule to resist Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But in this way, the Immortal Realm consciousness will also collapse. Although the Immortal Realm will be reborn after the destruction, the new Immortal Realm consciousness will not be the same as the current one.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Immortal Realm consciousness will absolutely not actively initiate the Great Destruction unless it is absolutely necessary, as this is not much better than being erased.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't erase you," Lin Yuan said casually, as erasing the Immortal Realm consciousness is of no great benefit to him.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has basically comprehended the rules in the core of the Immortal Realm source, erasing the Immortal Realm consciousness will not be of much help to him.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, Lin Yuan has already obtained what he could get from the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Realm consciousness is really pushed to the brink and initiates the Great Destruction, leading to their mutual destruction, Lin Yuan doesn't mind, as he can always return to the main universe at any time. But the past thousand years of promoting the spread of the Martial Dao in the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Realm is gone, the Martial Dao cultivators will naturally be gone as well.</p><p></p><p>"However, since the Chaos Rule can suppress the World Consciousness, I wonder about the consciousness of the main universe..." Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Realm and the main universe are roughly on the same level, the essence of the rules contained in the main universe is definitely much higher than that of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the core of the Immortal Realm source, comprehending a pillar-level fusion rule to the Seventh Realm is the limit. But in the core of the main universe source, the limit may be raised to the Eighth Realm or even the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I guess I can't even enter the source of the main universe," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>His ability to enter this core was not due to his own strength, but rather the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal Cultivation that transcends the spatial-temporal rules of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for forcibly entering? The boundless power of the Immortal Realm is enough to suppress ordinary Twelfth Realm Ultimates, as exemplified by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>And the spatial-temporal of the main universe is even more boundless than that of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>To transcend the spatial-temporal of the main universe, Lin Yuan's Spatial-Temporal Cultivation would need to reach the Eighth Realm or even the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Eighth Realm, Ninth Realm Spatial-Temporal Cultivation? Even for Lin Yuan, he would need to at least cross into the Twelfth Realm before he could have the confidence to touch this realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, one of the most prized techniques of Emperor Xuan is the Ninth Realm Spatial-Temporal Cultivation. Even Chaos Realm Peak experts with Spatial-Temporal Cultivation reaching the Ninth Realm are few and far between.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving now," Lin Yuan glanced at the Immortal Realm consciousness and disappeared from the core.</p><p></p><p>After nurturing the Chaos Rule, Lin Yuan has reached the limit in all aspects. At least there is nothing more for him here.</p><p></p><p>"He's leaving?" The Immortal Realm consciousness was slightly taken aback, repeatedly probing the surroundings, confirming that Lin Yuan was no longer here, and immediately began to mobilize the power of the entire Immortal Realm to heavily guard the core.</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Realm consciousness does not have specific thoughts, it has developed a strong instinct - it does not want to see Lin Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>After all, no one wants to coexist with an existence that can completely erase them.</p><p></p><p>On the Dao Ancestor Continent, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was still paying attention to the rule fluctuations permeating the source.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"It has stabilized again?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao raised his brows, feeling a little relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although the chaotic and disordered rule fluctuations could not have any impact on him, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao still preferred 'order'.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, a figure silently condensed in front of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao changed drastically. This was his Dao Realm, equivalent to his domain, where the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao controlled everything. Yet, there was an existence that had silently entered without being detected until it appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao gazed at the figure in the distance, recognizing that it was the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Immortal Dao," Lin Yuan smiled slightly, "I've come to bid you farewell today."</p><p></p><p>That's right, after nurturing the Chaos Rule, the source no longer holds any meaning for Lin Yuan. For the remaining decades of his stay, Lin Yuan plans to wander around.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, Lin Yuan's incarnations have traversed almost every corner of the Immortal Realm. But outside the Immortal Realm, in the boundless void, Lin Yuan has not explored much.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that the void is too boundless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hao, even with Lin Yuan's perception of time and space, after a long time, he would find it dull and boring.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different. After realizing the rules of chaos, the desolate void has become slightly more interesting in Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan plans to leave the Origin Realm, and there is only one reason for that - the manifestation of the rules in the Origin Realm is no longer of much help to him.</p><p></p><p>But how is that possible? The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao has been secluded in the Origin Realm for billions of years, and even now, he still feels that the manifestation of the rules in the Origin Realm can affect him.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan only stayed for a thousand years before wanting to leave?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you broken through?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the feeling Lin Yuan gives him is far beyond what he felt a thousand years ago, and the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao was under a lot of pressure back then. Plus, Lin Yuan was able to appear in front of him silently.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao can almost be certain that the rule anomaly that just affected the entire Immortal Realm came from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The improvement brought to him by the birth of the Chaos Rules is not much different from the impact of the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>If not for the assault on the Ultimate in the main universe, with the infusion of the Chaos Void Origin, it would be almost equivalent to the benefits of assaulting the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's thoughts were somewhat complex. He didn't know exactly what Lin Yuan had broken through, at least he didn't feel the aura of a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lin Yuan is indeed posing a huge threat to the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao, a threat that belongs to the same level of strength.</p><p></p><p>"After I leave, I hope the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao will take care of the Martial Dao lineage and the many Martial Dao cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>This sentence can be a request or a warning.</p><p></p><p>As the time of his stay is about to end, Lin Yuan will completely leave the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>So now Lin Yuan specifically reminds the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I will do my best for the fellow Daoist's lineage."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan had not broken through, the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao would not dare to do anything to the Martial Dao lineage, let alone now that Lin Yuan has broken through.</p><p></p><p>Before the breakthrough, although the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao could not harm Lin Yuan, Lin Yuan could not harm the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao either.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao still cannot harm Lin Yuan, but Lin Yuan can still pose a threat and cause harm to the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Even after this journey, Lin Yuan will be able to keep an eye on the changes in the Martial Dao of the Immortal Realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, Lin Yuan's control over the Gates of the Myriad Realms has improved by a level. Even without the information transmitted by the Demonic Vine Tree, he can still vaguely sense it.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao wanted to ask Lin Yuan more about the details of his breakthrough, but found that the other party had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's gaze was slightly complex.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Martial Dao Ancestor was extremely short, only a little over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But the impact on the Immortal Realm and even on him, the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao, is unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"Could the breakthrough of the Martial Dao Ancestor be related to the consciousness of the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao was moved, as he also longed for a breakthrough, especially the kind of great improvement that the Martial Dao Ancestor had.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's figure disappeared and soon appeared outside the core of the Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Before the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao could react, he sensed the vast Immortal Realm force sweeping towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Get out!"</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the Immortal Realm sent out fluctuations, and the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao retreated without hesitation, moving away from this place.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao's expression looked unpleasant. He didn't expect the consciousness of the Immortal Realm to react so strongly. He just came to probe a little, but was directly driven out.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>After more than ninety years.</p><p></p><p>In a distant void far from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure stopped.</p><p></p><p>"The time of my stay is almost up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around at the vast void.</p><p></p><p>In these more than ninety years, after constant exploration, he actually discovered four worlds that were slightly weaker than the Immortal Realm, but surpassed the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually spread the Martial Dao in these four worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao has no major problems in the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Even separated by boundless time and space, Lin Yuan could clearly sense the situation in the Immortal Realm, as he had left a clone there.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and a profound aura "bell-shaped" weapon appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan's Origin Bell.</p><p></p><p>This Origin Bell had been with Lin Yuan since he was in the sixth or seventh realm, and has now reached the pinnacle of the eleventh realm.</p><p></p><p>"I will convert all the power of this physical body into the Origin, and infuse it into the Origin Bell. Even if I can't transform it into a twelfth-realm weapon, it won't be much different."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>The aura in Lin Yuan's body began to gradually collapse.</p><p></p><p>With the current strength of his physical body, if he were to bring it back to the main universe, it would consume an unknown amount of Dimensional Source Power. So he might as well turn it into the nourishment for the transformation of the Origin Bell.</p><p></p><p>A year later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body and soul were completely transformed into the most original primal force, and merged into the "bell-shaped" weapon.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will was drawn and surged into the majestic and grand Gates of the Myriad Realms in the depths of his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 675</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six Patriarchs, including the Patriarch of the Blazing Sun, and all the Patriarchs had sent him gifts.</p><p></p><p>The preciousness of the gifts was rare even at the Thirteenth Realm, showing that each Patriarch had put in a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>"I just want to know why the Patriarchs have done this? Is it because of my future?" Lin Yuan asked his own doubts.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that the six Patriarchs were simply visiting him, but the Patriarch of the Savage Wilderness directly proposed a peer-to-peer exchange, a peer-to-peer exchange? This has almost treated Lin Yuan as a Thirteenth Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The other Patriarchs, including the Great Progenitor, also presented precious gifts. Such treatment made Lin Yuan puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Even though his future potential is very high, there is no need for several Patriarchs to treat him this way. After all, the future is full of countless variables and infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The future that the Patriarchs saw may not necessarily happen for sure.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan directly asked, wanting to find out the reason why the Patriarchs did this.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Silver River brother, you speak frankly." The Patriarch of the Savage Wilderness looked at Lin Yuan, while also glancing at the servants constantly coming and going around them.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Blazing Sun waved his hand, and all these servants were moved out of the main hall. What they were going to discuss next belonged to the Thirteenth Realm level of time and life.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple," said the Patriarch of the Dark Yin, looking at Lin Yuan. "Because your future is almost certain to reach the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Certain to reach the Thirteenth Realm?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"At least in the future timelines we have observed, Silver River, you will eventually cross into the Thirteenth Realm, it's just a matter of time, whether it's tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, or even millions or tens of millions of years, you will eventually cross into the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the Great Progenitor nodded. "Silver River brother, don't mind, I specifically observed some timelines to try to stop and suppress your rise, but it was useless, at most I could only delay the time when Silver River brother crosses into the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I did the same, but in the end, Silver River brother, you returned, and I was directly suppressed," the Great Spirit Patriarch nodded.</p><p></p><p>Time Realm cultivators at the Thirteenth Realm can observe many future timelines, but in all the timelines they observed, they were suppressed, without any chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>As long as there is one timeline where they can escape the suppression, the Time Realm cultivators will choose that timeline as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Returned?" Lin Yuan's thoughts were stirred.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no doubts about this, he had the Gate of Myriad Realms, and his means of self-preservation encompassed different dimensional spaces, which was an area that even Time Realm cultivators found difficult to involve themselves in.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was the six Patriarchs, at most they could only erase all his traces in this Source World, but they could not completely kill him.</p><p></p><p>And according to Lin Yuan's character, if the Patriarchs really tried to attack him, in the future when he crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, he would definitely come back to "settle the score."</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal coordinates of this Source World have been recorded by the Gate of Myriad Realms, and he can return at any time.</p><p></p><p>The future timelines that the Patriarchs saw only knew that Lin Yuan could not be killed no matter what, but they could not determine the reason, which was normal, after all, it involved the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>But his near-certain future of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm?</p><p></p><p>"We don't know the exact reason, even the Time Lords who wander between different dimensions have only just begun to converge their own timelines, and have never heard of a fixed future?"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Thunder looked at Lin Yuan and continued, "But no matter what, Silver River brother, you will definitely cross into the Thirteenth Realm, and in the distant future, you will rise to the highest levels of the Thirteenth Realm. If we don't come to make friends with you now, it will be too late in the future."</p><p></p><p>The other Patriarchs nodded slightly. They did not hide anything, had no ill intentions, and were completely motivated by the desire to make friends.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most correct approach in the future timelines they saw. If they had hidden something at this time, taking advantage of the information gap between the two sides, they might have wanted Lin Yuan to bear greater karmic consequences.</p><p></p><p>But in the future, when Silver Venerable crossed into the Thirteenth Realm and understood everything, he would certainly not have a good impression of them.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs observed one timeline after another, and once they confirmed that they could not be enemies with Silver Venerable, they naturally would put in their utmost effort to befriend Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We have no other demands, Silver River brother, and you don't need to feel any burden or pressure, we just want to be friends."</p><p></p><p>The Great Spirit Patriarch spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and he didn't have any other thoughts about the Patriarchs' friendship.</p><p></p><p>They took the initiative to send gifts, cleared obstacles for his cultivation, and told the truth, regardless of their motives, Lin Yuan would accept this.</p><p></p><p>"The predetermined future is not absolutely certain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a while and said.</p><p></p><p>The future timelines seen by the six Patriarchs were only partial, not all-encompassing.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that the possibility of him crossing into the Thirteenth Realm is a bit higher than other beings.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs looked at each other and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>So their explanation to Lin Yuan was that he was almost certain to cross into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Why did they use the word "almost"? It was because they were not Fourteenth Realm perfect Time Realm cultivators, and could not see all the timelines, so they could not be sure that in the timelines they had never observed, Silver Venerable could still maintain this definite future.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, thank you, Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Patriarchs, "If I really do cross into the Thirteenth Realm in the future, I will definitely not forget all of you."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha." The Patriarchs looked at each other and smiled.</p><p></p><p>They came together, didn't they? It was just to establish a good relationship with Silver Venerable. All they wanted was for Silver Venerable to remember this favor in the future and not attack them.</p><p></p><p>"Almost certain to cross into the Thirteenth Realm"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought a lot about this. At least it meant that the path he was currently walking was not problematic, and the backup plans he had laid out, such as spreading the evolutionary path of the Martial Dao, were correct.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River brother, if there's anything you need, just say it." The Patriarch of the Savage Wilderness said.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has not yet crossed into the Thirteenth Realm, any requests he makes, these Patriarchs can at least fulfill. And once Lin Yuan takes the initiative to make a request, and they fulfill it, it will also deepen the karmic relationship between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>This is practically a free opportunity. If they wait until Lin Yuan also crosses into the Thirteenth Realm before making requests, these Patriarchs may not be able to provide assistance anymore.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are unwilling to provide assistance, but that they simply cannot do it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Silver River brother, just say it directly." The Patriarch of the Dark Yin also said the same.</p><p></p><p>"I want to comprehend more of the supreme inheritances and guidance." Lin Yuan looked at the five Patriarchs and said.</p><p></p><p>"More supreme inheritances and guidance?" The Great Progenitor and the other four Patriarchs immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The treasuries of the major ancient nations contained many supreme inheritances and guidance, and to obtain them, one must render great service to the ancient nations, and even after comprehending and cultivating them, they are forbidden to be transmitted externally. This is something that requires an oath in the name of the Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>If violated, it will lead to the Patriarchs taking action.</p><p></p><p>So, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wants to comprehend the supreme inheritances and guidance of the other five ancient nations, he must obtain the consent of the five Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" The Patriarch of the Savage Wilderness...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor made a grand gesture, and a jade slip appeared before them, containing all the supreme inheritances and guidance of the Savage Ancient Kingdoms. The supreme inheritances and guidance, whether important or not, were still very significant, as they could not be widely disseminated, and the paths to obtain them were limited, essentially monopolized by the various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But it's not that they were unimportant either, as the inheritances and guidance could be replicated, except for the initial establishment, with almost no subsequent costs.</p><p></p><p>The other four Ancestors also took out the supreme inheritances and guidance of their respective ancient kingdoms, and even specially annotated some content, adding their own insights.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile, as he had long been interested in the supreme inheritances of the various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Even when he first took over the Black Jade Nest and left the two Celestial Emperors of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom, he had noticed the traces of cultivating the supreme inheritance "Mysterious Yin Classics" from them, and wanted to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing," Lin Yuan put away the numerous supreme inheritances and guidance, looking at the Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Speak quickly, Silver River brother," the Savage Ancestor immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The more requests Lin Yuan made, the more pleased the Ancestor became.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to spread the martial dao cultivation inheritance I have established in the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Spreading the branch of the martial dao evolution path was something Lin Yuan had been doing all along, even though he had learned from the Ancestors that he had entered the Thirteen Realms with absolute certainty.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, perhaps the "absolute certainty" they saw did not include the merits of the martial dao evolution path? And the timeline they observed was limited, so the so-called "absolute certainty" still had variables, so he naturally tried to do everything to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Spread the martial dao cultivation inheritance? No problem."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give the order right away."</p><p></p><p>The Great Primal Ancestor and the other five Ancestors nodded, as through observing the future timelines, they also knew that the martial dao cultivation inheritance was an inheritance no less terrifying than what the Ancestors themselves cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In many future timelines, the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River had been spreading the martial dao cultivation inheritance.</p><p></p><p>The Great Primal Ancestor, the Great Spirit Ancestor, and the other three Ancestors continued to chat casually with Lin Yuan for a while, and after confirming that the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River had no other needs, they stood up and took their leave.</p><p></p><p>After the five Ancestors returned to their respective ancient kingdoms, a series of orders related to the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River began to be fully implemented.</p><p></p><p>The most important point was that they absolutely must not provoke the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, especially the existence at the level of the Celestial Emperors of the various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the various ancient kingdoms began to promote the spread of the martial dao cultivation inheritance established by the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>This left many powerhouses of the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Not offend the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River? A direct order from the Ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would the lofty Ancestors care about the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>"And the martial dao cultivation inheritance? It's understandable that the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is spreading it, after all, the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River comes from there, but the other five ancient kingdoms?"</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the orders issued by the Ancestors are because that Celestial Emperor of the Silver River is too incredible."</p><p></p><p>"The five Ancestors treat the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River in such a peculiar way, just what kind of abilities does the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River have?"</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses of the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms were full of incredulity, the Ancestors' bizarre attitude made many powerhouses unable to understand, the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River's strength was indeed very strong, being the first invincible Celestial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But even if he was strong, could he be stronger than the Ancestors? It's just that, not understanding aside, the Ancestors didn't want to offend the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, and even these great Celestial Emperors, even if they had ten times the courage, would not dare to provoke the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if there were no orders from the Ancestors, there would be no great Celestial Emperors who would dare to provoke the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, the title of "Invincible Celestial Emperor" was not for nothing, even the strongest Celestial Emperor of the Great Primal Ancient Kingdom, when facing the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, could only be described as utterly hopeless, and could only try to cultivate the forbidden supreme inheritance to contend against him.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver River Palace, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and before him was a heart that pulsed like an abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was the Heart of the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>As the first life born in this source world, the Abyss Dragon, even without crossing the Thirteen Realms, its special qualities were not much weaker than the Time Life.</p><p></p><p>The first thing the Great Primal Ancestor did after crossing the Thirteen Realms was to kill the other, not only because of the hatred between the two, but also because the Abyss Dragon was simply too special.</p><p></p><p>This time, if it wasn't for the purpose of pleasing Lin Yuan, the Great Primal Ancestor wouldn't have taken out this Abyss Dragon Heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's too perfect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the miniature source world within the heart, his expression somewhat obsessed.</p><p></p><p>Through observing the source world within the heart, Lin Yuan vaguely knew why this world was called a source world, and why the Chaotic Void, an existence no less than the source world, was not within the thirty-three source worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The most fundamental point of the source world is 'perfection'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>The boundless Chaotic Void had many flaws and hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>The special place established by the Thirteen Realm Time Life was precisely to cover up and compensate for the corresponding hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>But this source world did not have that, at least through the miniature source world within the Abyss Dragon's heart, Lin Yuan had not yet discovered any hidden dangers or flaws.</p><p></p><p>The overall feeling the source world gave Lin Yuan was one of perfection.</p><p></p><p>Even though there would still be a great destruction one day, its existence time would be far beyond the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Silver River Chaotic Continent, in the Chaotic Void, two figures suddenly appeared. The one on the left was a bald man, and the figure on the right was rather thin.</p><p></p><p>The auras emanating from these two figures were extremely terrifying, and the Dao rules of the Chaotic Void were constantly retreating, revealing that they were two supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>"During this period, we have gone through the enmities of the Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix two great saints, but we haven't found anything special, only this Silver River Great Saint is left," the thin figure on the right spoke in a low voice. They, the two supreme great saints, were acting on the orders of the Great Saint Rahu to investigate the complete disappearance of the causes and effects of the Yin Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Silver River Great Saint's origins were mysterious, but in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he was the only one who had killed the Yin Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint, which made the two supreme great saints judge that the former must have some unknown enmities with Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and confirm it, then go back and report," the bald figure said. He did not believe that the Silver River Great Saint had anything to do with the complete disappearance of Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix, as the Silver River Great Saint's strength, no matter how strong, was not at the level of the supreme great saints according to his performance in the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>To be able to silently and completely erase Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix, two great saints? It was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>This time they came over, it was just to do their duty, at least to show Rahu the Great Saint that they had tried their best, and they had looked at all the many enemies of Yin Demon and Nine Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The thin figure on the right nodded, then took a step forward, overlooking the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, come out quickly to meet us!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sound waves penetrated through the layers of space and time, instantly reaching every corner of the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

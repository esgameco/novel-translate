            <p>Chapter 269: The Strongest Living Being Since the Birth of the Spiritual Realm (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In Xiaoyao City, at the Lin Residence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat facing Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen, chatting while enjoying spiritual food.</p><p></p><p>For five hundred years, the prestige of the Martial Ancestor has spread throughout the three thousand Daozhu, even the strongest Immortal King of the prehistoric era, the Rebellious Immortal King, voluntarily submitted.</p><p></p><p>However, very few people knew about the Martial Ancestor's parents, which was the result of Lin Yuan's intentional suppression.</p><p></p><p>His time in the spiritual realm was limited, and he could not always protect Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen, so he could only try his best to "separate" the two from the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, try this spiritual dish," Shen Zhen said with a smile, and Lin Jianping beside her was also in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>The three finished eating.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was silent for a while, then took the initiative to say, "I may not come back for a long time."</p><p></p><p>There were only a dozen years left until the time limit for his stay. According to Lin Yuan's plan, this should be the last time he saw Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"A long time?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen looked a little disappointed, but they had expected it. Lin Yuan was too dazzling, overlooking the three thousand Daozhu, and was regarded as the strongest in the era.</p><p></p><p>Such a great existence must have more important things to do.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, don't worry, go do your things. The two of us are very satisfied with our current life," Lin Jianping said.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan, the Lin family would still be a small family in Xiaoyao City, how could they compare to today's transcendent status?</p><p></p><p>"If you need help with anything, go to Li Qing, she will arrange it." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Lin Residence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked on the streets of Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>After five hundred years, Xiaoyao City had long become the most prosperous center of Dongyun Daozhou.</p><p></p><p>The city had expanded dozens of times, covering an area of millions of square li.</p><p></p><p>Every day, a large number of true immortals and half-step immortal kings came and went, and there were even traces of tribulation immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivation system had spread throughout the three thousand Daozhu, no less than the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Even in the dozens of Daozhu centered on Xiaoyao City, the martial cultivation system could still surpass the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the prosperity of the martial cultivation system had reached its peak, and even those tribulation immortal kings and supreme immortal kings did not dare to shake it.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength has reached a certain limit," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As early as more than two hundred years ago, Lin Yuan had thoroughly perfected the fourth stage of the Martial Dao Eight Realms.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Eight Realms could be considered as being opened up. As for the later Nine Realms, Lin Yuan also began to try to integrate the Taiji rules into the spatial rules, making some progress. The current degree of integration had reached two or three tenths.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan had already comprehended more than 5,500 core spatial models for the core spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>In five hundred years, Lin Yuan had comprehended more than 900 core spatial models, which was incomparable to the efficiency of comprehending 1,600 core spatial models in the previous three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>But it should be known that among the 7,782 core spatial models, the later the comprehension, the higher the difficulty. Many extreme eight-realm evolutionaries were stuck on a certain spatial model for thousands or even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"There are still more than 2,000 core spatial models left to fully grasp the complete spatial rules," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Spatial rules were the pillar rules of the main world, and many nine-realm experts had not yet mastered them. Although the eight realms theoretically had the possibility of mastering the complete spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>But that was theory.</p><p></p><p>In the long history of the main world universe, which eight-realm expert had realized this kind of theory?</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough from the eight realms to the nine realms required the integration of rules, but the spatial rules, as the pillar rules, did not need to be fully mastered to be integrated.</p><p></p><p>At the eight-realm level, trying to comprehend the spatial rules and comprehend more universal forces were both extremely time-wasting actions, and it might delay the breakthrough to the nine realms.</p><p></p><p>"5,500 kinds of core spatial rules are enough to support a 7.5 million square li internal world, plus the thirteen-fold basic multiplier from absorbing the mysterious gourd liquid."</p><p></p><p>"Now the size of my internal world has exceeded 97.5 million square li, approaching a billion square li."</p><p></p><p>The green liquid in the mysterious gourd was far more difficult to absorb than the previous three kinds. In five hundred years, Lin Yuan had only absorbed about 99% of the green liquid.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, after absorbing the first four kinds of liquids in the mysterious gourd, the amplification effect on the internal world would reach 13.32 times.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan had already reached 13 times, which could be considered not far from completely absorbing the green liquid.</p><p></p><p>"The power of creation," Lin Yuan thought of the biggest gain from this crossing.</p><p></p><p>The previous many gains, for Lin Yuan, could be completed anywhere, not necessarily in the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>But the power of creation, only the spiritual realm loosened the suppression of such universal power, and with the cooperation of the immortal kings, Lin Yuan's understanding of the power of creation could be said to have made leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>"So far, I have mastered twelve kinds of advanced powers of creation and more than sixty kinds of ordinary powers of creation."</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the recent three or four hundred years, Lin Yuan had basically given up on comprehending the ordinary powers of creation.</p><p></p><p>Because the advanced powers of creation more or less encompassed the essence of the ordinary powers of creation, comprehending a certain advanced power of creation was completely equivalent to several or more than a dozen ordinary powers of creation.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve kinds of advanced powers of creation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were slightly hot, and his attention was not on these twelve kinds of advanced powers of creation, but on the strand of power of creation emanating from the primordial aura in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power of creation was precisely what Lin Yuan had comprehended from the treasure that fell from the ninth heaven of the Rebellious Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The end of the prehistoric era was related to this stone-like treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Rebellious Immortal King speculated that this treasure contained a mysterious power beyond the advanced power of creation, but the Rebellious Immortal King spent an unknown amount of time and even occupied the eighth heaven, but did not comprehend a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Power." Lin Yuan's heart was hot. Relying on his rebellious comprehension ability, he took a full four hundred years to comprehend it from that treasure.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan named this kind of power of creation Primordial Power, symbolizing the primordial power of all things.</p><p></p><p>"There are still more than ten years left in the stay... It's time to venture into the legendary ninth heaven." Lin Yuan made up his mind, which was also the reason why he said goodbye to his parents.</p><p></p><p>Even if he continued to retreat for more than ten years, it would not help him much. Rather than doing so, it was better to enter the legendary ninth heaven and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the main seat, and dozens of powerful figures from the Martial Temple stood respectfully below.</p><p></p><p>In five hundred years, plus the previous three hundred years, under Lin Yuan's intentional cultivation, the martial cultivation system gave birth to eight seven-realms.</p><p></p><p>And Li Qing, Lin Yuan's personal disciple in the Zhongtu Shenzhou of the lower realm, had even opened up an inner world and stepped into the eight realm of the martial way.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of powerful figures from the Martial Temple bowed to Lin Yuan with a fanatical tone.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Over the past several hundred years, martial arts practitioners have emerged in an endless stream, often suppressing those who cultivate the immortal way. But after today, you all need to restrain yourselves a bit more," Lin Yuan said calmly as he swept his gaze over the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor is the strongest in the Three Thousand Dao Realms. Even those Tribulation Immortal Kings are respectful towards you, Martial Ancestor. Why should we restrain ourselves?" a young Martial Dao Seventh Stage practitioner asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at him. This Martial Dao Seventh Stage had a rare martial arts aptitude, walking the path of thunderbolts, comprehending the Dao of world-destroying lightning, extremely skilled in attacking.</p><p></p><p>"After today, I will no longer return to the Three Thousand Dao Realms. From now on, you can only rely on yourselves. If you don't restrain yourselves, you will suffer." Lin Yuan's eyes were indifferent. </p><p></p><p>With an Eighth Stage martial arts practitioner like Li Qing holding the fort, plus the might that Lin Yuan left behind, even if he truly disappeared, the martial arts cultivation system would not encounter any problems for at least millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan said this was to remind these powerful figures of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Martial Ancestor going?" The other powerful figures of the Martial Temple changed their expressions. What did Martial Ancestor mean by saying he wouldn't return to the Three Thousand Dao Realms?</p><p></p><p>"In any case, you should take care of yourselves." Lin Yuan did not explain further. Although consuming ten strands of boundary-breaking primal force could allow him to descend into the Spirit Realm again, Lin Yuan would not do so unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial Temple was destroyed in the future, as long as the martial arts cultivation system was still being spread, Lin Yuan would be too lazy to intervene.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King, Primordial Immortal King, Supreme Immortal Kings and others gathered at the entrance leading to the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he wants to break into the Ninth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"With Martial Ancestor's strength, unparalleled in heaven and earth, he might really have the ability to enter the Ninth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>"The entrance to the Ninth Heaven bears the imprints of the ten strongest living beings since the birth of the Spirit Realm. Martial Ancestor is indeed very powerful, but compared to the ten strongest throughout history..."</p><p></p><p>The peerless Immortal Kings discussed in low voices. The history of the Spirit Realm was untraceable, but in the first few ancient eras, there were even terrifying existences born together with the Spirit Realm's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if Martial Ancestor was extraordinarily heaven-defying, compared to those beings born alongside heaven and earth, he would likely pale in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yuan's figure appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King and other peerless Immortal Kings immediately stopped their discussion and bowed slightly towards Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"I want to enter the Ninth Heaven. If you want to watch, then watch from here." Lin Yuan glanced at the many peerless Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lin Yuan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He reappeared inside the entrance passage leading to the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Is Martial Ancestor really going to challenge the Ninth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and watch, this is something that might not even happen once in an era."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many levels Martial Ancestor can reach."</p><p></p><p>The many peerless Immortal Kings perked up and quickly started discussing.</p><p></p><p>Inside the entrance passage to the Ninth Heaven, there were a total of ten levels.</p><p></p><p>Each level had a life imprint, totaling ten life imprints.</p><p></p><p>These ten life imprints came from the ten most powerful living beings since the birth of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have the strength of the strongest Immortal King from a prehistoric era, facing the life imprint of the first level, I have no power to resist. Can Martial Ancestor defeat the life imprint of the first level?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King was somewhat expectant.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King only knew that Martial Ancestor was very strong, but didn't know exactly how strong. Now he could take the opportunity of Martial Ancestor challenging the Ninth Heaven to see just what kind of strength he possessed.</p><p></p><p>"First Level Life Being"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered the passage entrance. In front of him, misty clouds swirled and quickly condensed into a human-shaped figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure wore red armor and stood there as if the great sun of the Spirit Realm was shining, filled with endless light and heat.</p><p></p><p>The life imprint of the first level in the entrance passage to the Ninth Heaven, although the weakest among the ten levels of life imprints, was still an existence ranking in the top ten among countless powerhouses since the birth of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest figures of certain eras like the Chaotic Immortal King had no ability to resist before it and would be utterly crushed.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The figure in red armor looked down at Lin Yuan. Revived as a life imprint, it only had battle instincts and no emotions.</p><p></p><p>Outside the passage, the Chaotic Immortal King and other peerless Immortal Kings widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>From Martial Ancestor's battle with the first level life imprint, they could roughly see Martial Ancestor's true combat strength.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many moves Martial Ancestor can last..." The Chaotic Immortal King observed carefully. In his view, what followed should be a stalemate. Even if Martial Ancestor could win, it would be a hard-fought victory, let alone the high possibility of not winning.</p><p></p><p>Inside the entrance passage, Lin Yuan also sized up his opponent.</p><p></p><p>"I don't recognize it." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The Spirit Realm had gone through era after era, countless powerhouses vanishing into history.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan at most had some understanding of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era and knew a bit about prehistoric eras. As for the powerhouses from even more ancient eras, he knew very little.</p><p></p><p>"I've already comprehended all the Dao-transforming powers it possesses..." Lin Yuan immediately lost some interest and decided to quickly end the battle.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and pressed forward.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying world power surged forth. The figure in red armor only resisted for an instant before being crushed into dust by the vast world power.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's inner world of nearly a billion miles in radius, the extended world power, plus the amplification of various Dao-transforming powers, had already reached a terrifying extreme. He didn't need any fancy moves or secret techniques, just the overwhelming momentum to crush all.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over already?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the passage, the many peerless Immortal Kings were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They had originally been guessing how many moves Martial Ancestor could last without losing, but unexpectedly, the reality was completely opposite. That living being ranked tenth in the Spirit Realm's history couldn't even take one move from Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor..." The Chaotic Immortal King also couldn't believe it. He had tried to challenge the first level and knew the terrifying degree of this level's life imprint.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the powerhouse transformed from this level's life imprint was as fragile as an infant before Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Inside the entrance passage, Lin Yuan broke through the first level and quickly arrived at the second level.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the third level, fourth level, fifth level...</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses transformed from these life imprints were no longer limited to the human race, including true dragons, celestial phoenixes, qilins and many other terrifying lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>These lives completely surpassed the peerless Immortal Kings, but before Lin Yuan, they were still as fragile as ants, no different from the red-armored figure of the first level.</p><p></p><p>One move to pierce through.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Lin Yuan arrived at the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>The living being of this level was the strongest since the birth of the Spirit Realm, bar none.</p><p></p><p>Misty clouds swirled as Lin Yuan stood in place waiting.</p><p></p><p>Before long, from the depths of the misty clouds, a tall figure slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>This tall figure had a youthful appearance, boundless blood qi circulating in his body, vast and unending.</p>

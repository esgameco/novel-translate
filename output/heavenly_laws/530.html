        <h1>Chapter 530</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Deep within Lin Yuan's body, another Sun Seed condensed, resonating with the previous 3,699 Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the four directions of heaven and earth fluctuated, surging like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>"This is too exaggerated," Lin Yuan marveled.</p><p></p><p>Even a pig, under such intense rule fluctuations, would have hope of comprehending the sixth level of space-time.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a complete path, it could even impact the ultimate twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad rule fluctuations, Lin Yuan prioritized comprehending the fusion rules of space-time. As for the chaos rules?</p><p></p><p>The chaos rules themselves were born from countless other rules. To enhance chaos rules required increasing comprehension of many rules.</p><p></p><p>"The use of Sun Seeds is not as simple as just enhancing rule comprehension," Lin Yuan thought to himself, his expression turning slightly serious.</p><p></p><p>When condensing 3,333 Sun Seeds, all the Sun Seeds in his body seemed to form a cycle, causing Lin Yuan's physical body to undergo a certain transformation.</p><p></p><p>This transformation was not simply a strengthening or enhancement, but leaned more towards a transformation in terms of rules.</p><p></p><p>"3,333 Sun Seeds is some kind of major threshold!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan concluded. The vast majority of life forms in the Qingfen Domain knew about the thresholds for Sun Seeds - one seed, ten seeds, a hundred seeds... But whether it was ten seeds or a hundred seeds, or even a thousand seeds, it only increased the degree of comprehension of rules.</p><p></p><p>But with 3,333 Sun Seeds, Lin Yuan's physical body was faintly transforming towards the direction of ultimate rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not know what the end point of this transformation was, but it was certainly not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>"Setting aside the physical transformation for now, my current comprehension of space-time fusion rules has entered the peak of the seventh level. It will take at most one year to cross over."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Originally, without the aid of Sun Seeds, it would have taken tens of thousands of years to have a chance of reaching the peak of the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>After condensing ten seeds, it could be achieved in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>As for now? With the boost of 3,700 Sun Seeds, Lin Yuan was very certain he could reach the peak of the seventh level of space-time in at most one year.</p><p></p><p>He even had hope of touching the eighth level of space-time in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that condensing new Sun Seeds now is clearly much more difficult than at the beginning," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the 3,334th Sun Seed, the difficulty increased sharply with each new seed Lin Yuan condensed.</p><p></p><p>Before, Lin Yuan could condense a Sun Seed with each breath, but now it took ten breaths, or even a hundred breaths to do so.</p><p></p><p>"The next major threshold for Sun Seeds should be 33,333 seeds. I wonder what ability that will bring."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his mind. From the current situation, 3,333 Sun Seeds could form a small cycle.</p><p></p><p>And 33,333 Sun Seeds would be able to form a large cycle.</p><p></p><p>The condensation of Sun Seeds mainly tested one's comprehension ability. Each Sun Seed was extremely complex, and to condense one required first fully comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>"However, the 'Sun Essence Cultivation Method' can only be practiced in this source world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>His avatar in the chaos void had also tried to condense Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>But the result was failure without suspense.</p><p></p><p>Actually it wasn't really a failure, as Sun Seeds were eventually condensed, but they were very different from the Sun Seeds he was condensing now, and did not have the effect of enhancing rule comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Sun Progenitor? Or that eternal sun?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the sun in the sky that radiated endless light and heat, his thoughts churning.</p><p></p><p>The sun of this source world was not like the stars in the universe. They were completely different concepts. The eternal sun in the sky had almost become rule-ified, omnipresent and impenetrable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's condense more Sun Seeds first before thinking further."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts. Over these past few months, he had been re-cultivating his martial arts while condensing Sun Seeds, and also comprehending the unique rule fluctuations of this source world.</p><p></p><p>The rule fluctuations of this source world were different from those of the chaos void. Re-integrating martial arts required some thought, but it wasn't a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The universe within his body had undergone earth-shaking changes after over a hundred years of adjustment.</p><p></p><p>Several months had passed in the source world, which equated to over a hundred years in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The universe within his body.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, over ten million light years across.</p><p></p><p>Now every inch of space in his inner universe carried extremely heavy spatial and temporal pressure.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, eleventh level life forms who had comprehended time rules could freely manipulate the flow of time, achieving the feat of thousands or tens of thousands of years passing outside while only an instant passed for themselves.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to an alternative form of longevity and immortality.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Forget about eleventh level life forms who had comprehended time rules. Even those at the peak of the eleventh level with space-time fusion rules at the fifth level had much less influence over the flow of time, able to control at most a few dozen times the normal flow.</p><p></p><p>It was the same for space. In the main universe, ninth level evolvers could easily occupy tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of layers of space.</p><p></p><p>But here, it wasn't so easy. Ninth level life forms were also called multi-space life forms, but the number of space layers they could occupy in this inner universe was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the time and space in Lin Yuan's current inner universe were extremely rigorous, even somewhat harsh.</p><p></p><p>"My current inner universe..."</p><p></p><p>An avatar of Lin Yuan's consciousness constantly observed.</p><p></p><p>Before beginning to reconstruct the universe, Lin Yuan's inner universe was close to 8 million light years across.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the current 10 million light year inner universe, the increase wasn't actually that much, only about 20-30% in size.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, the current inner universe had improved by far more than a hundred or thousand times compared to before, whether in terms of foundation or other aspects.</p><p></p><p>The difference between an ordinary 10 million light year inner universe and Lin Yuan's inner universe was like the difference between tofu and diamond - one would crumble at a touch.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the beginning. Once you fully refine the jade gourd, and once you enter the inheritance left by the old master, your inner universe will undergo another transformation. At that time it will directly rival the inner universe of a Chaos Realm being."</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the red-robed girl sat with her legs crossed, unable to resist saying.</p><p></p><p>"Rival a Chaos Realm inner universe? Just by entering the inheritance?" Lin Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>According to what the red-robed girl said, after he integrated all the universe structures contained in the runes into his inner universe, he would reach a level close to a Chaos Realm inner universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, just entering the inheritance would allow him to rival a Chaos Realm inner universe?</p><p></p><p>That was the inner universe of a Chaos Lord! Vast and mighty, on par with the innate universes born from the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>"The greatness of the old master far exceeds your imagination."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl said proudly, finally regaining some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, the efficiency with which Lin Yuan had reconstructed his inner universe had made the red-robed girl</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tong once fell into self-doubt, feeling that his role as the spirit of the jade gourd might be superfluous.</p><p></p><p>The creator of the jade gourd left a universal restriction for future worthy individuals to comprehend all the runes, but did not set any standards for modifying the universe.</p><p></p><p>This was because specific modifications to the internal universe were very time-consuming. But Lin Yuan? He had completed over 90% in just over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"So how many lives can I bring through the great destruction of the universe now?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred years ago, during casual conversations with the girl in red, they had also discussed the predicament of this universe, which was about to enter premature destruction due to the impending battle between two Chaos Saints.</p><p></p><p>"About 80-90%," the girl in red said lazily. "If you could cultivate the legacy left by the old master to the entry level, you could completely ignore the backlash from this universe and bring out as many lives as you want."</p><p></p><p>If the internal universe rivaled that of a Chaos Venerable, it would be equivalent to the main universe. Facing backlash from an equivalent universe, even at full force, while not completely negligible, could still be defended against.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirits lifted slightly as he continued modifying the structure of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Domain.</p><p></p><p>East Sun Clan.</p><p></p><p>East Sun Meng sat cross-legged, attempting to condense the tenth Blazing Sun Seed within her body.</p><p></p><p>This was not East Sun Meng's first attempt. Each previous attempt had ended in failure. Ten Blazing Sun Seeds would allow her to directly become a disciple under the Qingfen Marquis, without any competition.</p><p></p><p>Even though the East Sun Clan had schemed to eliminate Yu Yan of the Yu family, a competitor, becoming a disciple of the Qingfen Marquis with nine Blazing Sun Seeds was completely different from doing so with ten.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat appeared on East Sun Meng's fair forehead, clearly showing the immense pressure of condensing the tenth Blazing Sun Seed.</p><p></p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of scorching energy from all directions fused into East Sun Meng's body. The tenth Blazing Sun Seed slowly took shape and finally stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Blazing Sun Seeds?"</p><p></p><p>"I finally condensed it?"</p><p></p><p>East Sun Meng was a bit dazed. She didn't know how many times she had attempted to condense the tenth Blazing Sun Seed, but this time she actually succeeded?</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented joy welled up in East Sun Meng's heart.</p><p></p><p>Condensing ten Blazing Sun Seeds before the age of 500 meant unimaginable glory and status. It could easily create a first-rate clan from nothing.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The news of East Sun Meng condensing the tenth Blazing Sun Seed reached the ears of the East Sun Clan's patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"What? Meng'er condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed?" The East Sun patriarch could hardly believe it. For many years, he too had longed for the East Sun Clan to produce a disciple with ten Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>But it had only been a longing. There were some East Sun Clan disciples who had condensed nine Blazing Sun Seeds by the age of 500, but ten? Not a single one.</p><p></p><p>The leap from the ninth Blazing Sun Seed to the tenth was a qualitative change, with incomparable difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p></p><p>The East Sun patriarch was overjoyed. He quickly found East Sun Meng and, after repeated confirmations, brought her to the several Self-Dao Realm elders of the East Sun Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although Blazing Sun Seeds were condensed within the body, outsiders could not sense them. Only through certain methods bestowed by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country could they be confirmed.</p><p></p><p>So the East Sun patriarch could only confirm verbally through East Sun Meng. As for verification? The East Sun Clan did not have that capability.</p><p></p><p>"Condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed?"</p><p></p><p>The several Self-Dao Realm elders of the East Sun Clan were ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>"Meng'er, you are our clan's genius. This matter absolutely cannot have any concealment. Otherwise, when the Qing Envoy arrives, everything will be revealed."</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan elders spoke seriously. This was no joking matter.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, I really have condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed," East Sun Meng said with absolute certainty.</p><p></p><p>The ten Blazing Sun Seeds floating within her body, bringing her a huge increase in rule comprehension, could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>The gap between ten Blazing Sun Seeds and nine was even greater than the gap between nine and one.</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the faces of the East Sun Clan elders. "Our East Sun Clan will soar because of you, Meng'er."</p><p></p><p>"Without the clan's nurturing, there would be no East Sun Meng today," East Sun Meng immediately said. She was indeed grateful to the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you go rest now. The Qing Envoy will arrive in a few months. During this time, focus on stabilizing your ten Blazing Sun Seeds."</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan elders spoke gently.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Envoy was a messenger under the Qingfen Marquis, who traveled throughout the Qingfen Domain.</p><p></p><p>For the East Sun Clan and Yu family to become disciples under the Qingfen Marquis, they needed the Qing Envoy's confirmation. Only if they met the requirements would they be taken away by the Qing Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>East Sun Meng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although she had condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed, she still needed time to stabilize it.</p><p></p><p>After East Sun Meng left.</p><p></p><p>The several East Sun Clan elders looked at each other, relaxed smiles spreading across their faces.</p><p></p><p>"The rise of our East Sun Clan is now certain."</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan elders spoke excitedly. If East Sun Meng with nine Blazing Sun Seeds becoming a disciple under the Qingfen Marquis could barely bring the East Sun Clan to the threshold of a first-rate clan,</p><p></p><p>Then now, with East Sun Meng condensing ten Blazing Sun Seeds, she could completely elevate the East Sun Clan to the pinnacle of first-rate clans.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, what should we do now? Should we make public that Meng'er has condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed?" The East Sun Clan patriarch was equally excited.</p><p></p><p>With the East Sun Clan becoming a first-rate clan, his position as patriarch would naturally rise with the tide.</p><p></p><p>"Make it public? Why should we make it public?"</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan elders' gazes were profound as they asked in return.</p><p></p><p>"Not make it public?"</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan patriarch was slightly stunned, but quickly understood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a genius who had condensed ten Blazing Sun Seeds would be untouchable in the Qingfen Domain.</p><p></p><p>But it was better to be safe than sorry.</p><p></p><p>Their East Sun Clan had no need to take this risk.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family was watching from the sidelines. Who knew if they might do something rash out of desperation upon learning that the East Sun Clan had produced a peerless genius with ten Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Now, our East Sun Clan only needs to quietly wait for the Qing Envoy to arrive."</p><p></p><p>"We don't need to do anything else."</p><p></p><p>The East Sun Clan elders were very cautious, unwilling to create any complications.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a year went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>On this day, three figures appeared silently outside the East Sun Clan.</p><p></p><p>The three figures - one tall and two short - had concealed their auras, but the time and space around them seemed subtly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"In this area, I remember the East Sun Clan and Yu family produced two youngsters with decent aptitude, barely meeting the requirements to become disciples of the Marquis," </p><p></p><p>Said the short figure on the left, gazing towards the distant East Sun Clan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

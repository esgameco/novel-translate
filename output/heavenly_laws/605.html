        <h1>Chapter 605</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again unleashed his physical divine abilities - the 'World'. There were no longer any restrictions.</p><p></p><p>There was no concept of duration.</p><p></p><p>As long as the source was sufficient, it could be maintained indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, Lin Yuan's divine ability 'World' has now become more than just a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>It has integrated with the 'Infinite Void' and the 'Scorching Sun Parting the Heavens', forming a brand-new technique.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually a Great Sage? And one who is not weaker than us?" </p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Great Sage, the Dual Source Great Sage, and the Fierce Barbarian Great Sage immediately stopped their conflict and turned their targets towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The three Great Sages attacked each other, while also keeping an eye on the surrounding situation. At their level of cultivation, they naturally did not want to be taken advantage of by other 'fishermen'.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Sage struck first, with his gray-blue energy spreading and forcibly penetrating the scope of Lin Yuan's outer universe, disrupting the space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already torn open a space-time passage leading into the Mysterious Yellow Universe, with one foot already stepping in, but he then withdrew it.</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Great Sage did not want to take the risk of forcibly passing through, as that might result in him being the last to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe. Lin Yuan was also unwilling to do so at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He held a map of the interior of the Mysterious Yellow Universe. As long as he could be among the first to enter, the harvest would far surpass the other Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>"You took the opportunity while we were fighting to make your move, that was a good plan."</p><p></p><p>The Black Obsidian Great Sage also activated his Black Obsidian Domain. Previously, 99% of the power of the Black Obsidian Domain was concentrated on the Dual Source Great Sage and the Fierce Barbarian Great Sage, which was why it was easily expelled by Lin Yuan's outer universe.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Black Obsidian Great Sage had regained his composure, the Black Obsidian Domain surged back, constantly colliding with Lin Yuan's outer universe, turning the edge areas into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellencies' strength is indeed formidable, I do not consider myself your match." Lin Yuan turned to look at the three Great Sages and smiled: "That's why I did this, please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>"Not your match?" The Fierce Barbarian Great Sage's eyes faintly revealed a murderous aura. Apart from other things, the fact that Lin Yuan easily passed through their territory and reached the position closest to the Mysterious Yellow Universe alone showed that his strength was not inferior to theirs.</p><p></p><p>Not their match? If it were not for the Dual Source Great Sage's timely reaction, Lin Yuan might have already slipped into the Mysterious Yellow Universe first.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the fact that Lin Yuan could withstand the gray-blue energy of the Dual Source Great Sage and the Black Obsidian Domain of the Black Obsidian Great Sage was proof of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>How could he not be their match? "Who are you, exactly? Why have I never heard of you before?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Sage's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>From the time Lin Yuan erupted until now, although it was brief, they had already collided tens of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled the Dual Source Great Sage was that he was actually so unfamiliar with Lin Yuan? It should be known that among the Chaos Lords, there might be cases where they had not heard of each other due to being too far apart in their void domains.</p><p></p><p>But for a Chaos Great Sage? The appearance of a Chaos Great Sage would quickly spread throughout the Chaotic Void, and the many Lords in various void domains would know of them.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Nine Phoenix Great Sage and the Shadow Demon Great Sage, although they were newly ascended Great Sages, the Dual Source Great Sage had already heard of them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's strength surpassed the Nine Phoenix Great Sage and the Shadow Demon Great Sage by a large margin, and this powerful Great Sage, his reputation and cultivation path should have long since spread throughout the Chaotic Void, shouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>"The Tenth Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>"There is actually another Great Sage hidden away?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Great Sage that dares to intervene in the battle between the Dual Source Great Sage and the others, and yet does not fall behind?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Lords hiding in the distance were trembling in their hearts. The collision between the four Great Sages, even a tiny backlash could severely injure or even annihilate a large group of Lords.</p><p></p><p>"The Dual Source Great Sage, the Black Obsidian Great Sage, they all have far-reaching reputations, but this newly appeared Great Sage, why has he never shown up before?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a Great Sage from the ancient, distant eras?"</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Lords speculated. The reputation of a Great Sage would not be limited by space, but it could gradually be forgotten over the long passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Even a peerless Great Sage, if they disappeared for too long, ten thousand universe cycles? A hundred thousand universe cycles? A million universe cycles? They would still be forgotten, and the traces of their existence would be gradually erased.</p><p></p><p>For example, the former Emperor Xuan, who was undefeatable in his era, and even other supreme Great Sages had to avoid his might, but now, those who know of Emperor Xuan are very few, mostly beings like the All-Seeing Eye and the Altar Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"A Great Sage from the distant past eras? It seems this post-Heavenly Universe is quite remarkable, to have attracted such a powerful being."</p><p></p><p>Those Chaos Lords gazed at the revealed corner of the post-Heavenly Universe. At the Great Sage level, their lifespans were infinite, and as long as they did not court death, it would be very difficult for them to die.</p><p></p><p>But most Chaos Great Sages would eventually choose to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, for Great Sages, living too long did not have much meaning, only by reaching the Thirteenth Realm could they attain the ultimate freedom.</p><p></p><p>"The Dual Source Great Sage's Chaotic Evolution Dao Path energy can destroy the foundation of space-time, yet this newly appeared Great Sage can actually withstand such destructive power. So strong."</p><p></p><p>"Not only the Dual Source Great Sage, the Black Obsidian Great Sage's Black Obsidian Domain is also suppressing the opponent. Facing the combined might of the Dual Source Great Sage and the Black Obsidian Great Sage, yet still able to hold on without showing any signs of decline. Incredible."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prosperity Great Sage and a few other Great Sages were also secretly observing.</p><p></p><p>They had long since given up the idea of rushing into the Mysterious Yellow Universe first, as the Dual Source Great Sage and the others were not easy opponents to deal with. However, Lin Yuan forcibly inserted himself, revealing a strength that truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>"How can this newly appeared Great Sage have a slight karmic connection with me?" The Shadow Demon Great Sage and the Nine Phoenix Great Sage were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>As Chaos Great Sages, even if they did nothing, their influence would still permeate through numerous void domains, and the newly ascended Chaos Realm Perfected Great Sages like the Shadow Demon and the Nine Phoenix were even more so.</p><p></p><p>The beings with karmic connections to them were countless.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the ancient, peerless Great Sages who had attained Chaos Realm Perfection long ago, their karmic connections would be much simpler.</p><p></p><p>But even for a newly ascended Chaos Great Sage, for their karmic connections to be related to a Great Sage of Lin Yuan's strength, it still left the Shadow Demon Great Sage and the Nine Phoenix Great Sage feeling uneasy and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"That person... is he a Great Sage? Or a Great Sage that can match the Dual Source Great Sage and the others?" Compared to the surrounding Chaos Lords who were in awe, the Spiritual Wind Lord and a few other Lords were filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>The other Lords, when facing a Great Sage of Lin Yuan's strength, at most would only feel fear. But they had previously interacted with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even when Lin Yuan rejected their invitation, the Spiritual Wind Lord had subtly threatened him.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Wind, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The two Chaos Lords following behind the Spiritual Wind Lord immediately transmitted a message. Chaos Lords could indeed survive in the presence of a Great Sage, but unless they had no other choice, Chaos Lords would absolutely not dare to offend a Chaos Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>Especially one as powerful as Lin Yuan, who could contend with the Dual Source Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sage? Even if the Chaos Sovereign had a way to save his life, if a true Sage were to deal with a Sovereign, he wouldn't even need to act himself. Just by making a statement, it would be enough to make the Chaos Sovereign hide in the darkness and never dare to show his face again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, let's retreat first." </p><p></p><p>The Divine Wind Sovereign was panicked in his heart, but he didn't dare to show it. At times like this, he had to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>Just as the various Chaos Sovereigns were discussing.</p><p></p><p>In the area closest to the entrance of the Xuanhuang Universe, the collision between Lin Yuan and the Twin Source Sage and others had gradually intensified.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan was currently closest to the entrance of the Xuanhuang Universe, he naturally became the target of the Twin Source Sage, the Black Brilliance Sage, and the Savage Sage.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying clash of power caused many spatial-temporal realms to be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed an invisible permeating force that penetrated through the outer universes he controlled, landed on the secret treasure guarding the Chaos Realm, and then seeped into his physical body, finally being dispersed by the inner universe within him.</p><p></p><p>Now, the inner universe within Lin Yuan's body far exceeded that of a normal Chaos Sage. His terrifying foundation made his resistance very strong. Even if the external force was horrifying, after penetrating his physical body, it would be diluted by his inner universe, leaving little behind.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of power is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Twin Source Sage and the Black Brilliance Sage were slightly uncomfortable. Their attacks had penetrated into Lin Yuan's body, but Lin Yuan's outer universe and the blazing sun's primal power had also greatly affected them.</p><p></p><p>The all-pervasive universe-suppressing force and the radiance of the blazing sun had caused the Twin Source Sage and the Black Brilliance Sage some headaches, especially the latter. The overwhelming power of the blazing sun had even begun to distort and transform the exclusive Chaos evolution power of the two Sages.</p><p></p><p>"You three are really slippery." </p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage was the angriest. Whether it was Lin Yuan, the Twin Source, or the Black Brilliance, they were all relying on their mastery of space-time, controlling it, distorting it, or even destroying it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Savage Sage? His methods were more direct. Compared to the previous three, he felt powerless no matter how he tried.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, I should be the first to enter the Xuanhuang Universe."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan fought with the other three Sages, they were all approaching the entrance of the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>The four powerful figures were restraining each other. Even though Lin Yuan was being targeted by the Black Brilliance Sage and the others, as long as he could block them, he would definitely be the first to enter the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Black Brilliance, this new Sage that has appeared is probably an ancient immortal from the distant past, which is why we haven't heard of him before."</p><p></p><p>The Twin Source Sage's gaze was cold as he secretly transmitted to the Black Brilliance Sage: "Although we are all fighting for the treasures in this primordial universe, you and I are Sages of a similar era. We absolutely cannot let this ancient immortal seize the most precious treasures."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" The Black Brilliance Sage's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"We must join hands to ensure he doesn't enter the universe first." The Twin Source Sage spoke.</p><p></p><p>Currently, they were still colliding with each other while also targeting Lin Yuan. The "join hands" the Twin Source Sage mentioned should be to completely set aside their previous conflicts and focus solely on dealing with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Go on."</p><p>The Black Brilliance Sage transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"I have a killer move that can definitely hold him back, but the prerequisite is that I can't be interfered with at all."</p><p>The Twin Source Sage said.</p><p></p><p>"So you mean I'll be the one to deal with him, and you won't attack me?"</p><p>The Black Brilliance Sage glanced at the Twin Source Sage, pondering for a while, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>According to the current situation, it was certain that Lin Yuan would be the first to enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for who would be the second to enter, it would likely be between him and the Twin Source.</p><p></p><p>That meant the Black Brilliance Sage would be the second or third to enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>And according to the Twin Source Sage's suggestion, if he was given the opportunity, he could completely hold back Lin Yuan, and either he or the Twin Source would be the first to enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Sage securing the second spot was obviously more in line with his own interests than the third.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll start preparing."</p><p>The Twin Source Sage immediately closed his eyes, and the surrounding space-time was suddenly filled with gray and blue colors.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>The Black Brilliance's domain rapidly expanded, covering Lin Yuan, but was blocked by his outer universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Twin Source Sage..."</p><p>Lin Yuan, who was at the forefront, seemed to sense something and glanced back.</p><p>He could feel that the Twin Source Sage had given up on attacking him, but this Chaos Sage's surrounding space-time was in chaos, and Lin Yuan couldn't discern anything for the moment.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was extremely close to the entrance of the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A mysterious aura rapidly approached.</p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed as he looked behind him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the space-time around the Twin Source Sage had become clear again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Lin Yuan saw the two gray-blue horns growing on the Twin Source Sage's head, and his spiritual will was struck, causing him to start falling.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p>Lin Yuan immediately realized something was wrong and quickly dispersed the influence by rapidly spreading the power of his inner universe throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, excuse me, gentlemen."</p><p>At this time, the Twin Source Sage transformed into a gray-blue light and, with an unimaginable speed, surpassed Lin Yuan and rushed into the Xuanhuang Universe first.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Black Brilliance Sage, immediately deducing that these two Sages must have completely joined forces. Otherwise, when the space-time around the Twin Source Sage was in complete chaos just now, the Black Brilliance Sage would have had the ability to intervene and disrupt it.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't the Twin Source say he could hold him back?"</p><p>The Black Brilliance Sage's face looked unsightly. The Twin Source Sage had indeed held back Lin Yuan, but for how long? In such a short time, the Twin Source Sage had already rushed into the Xuanhuang Universe, and what about him?</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Black Brilliance Sage, and the boundless power of his outer universe, the terrifying universe-suppressing force, and the radiance of the blazing sun all converged towards the Black Brilliance Sage.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p>The Black Brilliance Sage's expression changed slightly, and he immediately activated his Black Brilliance domain to resist.</p><p></p><p>But the universe-suppressing force and the radiant power of the blazing sun were even stronger, and the Black Brilliance Sage clearly felt a bit strained.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't use his full strength just now?" The Black Brilliance Sage frowned, and when facing Lin Yuan alone, he immediately felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and slapped towards the Black Brilliance Sage with great force.</p><p>This slap was like heaven and earth collapsing. The Black Brilliance Sage immediately felt an unparalleled impact force that penetrated his entire body. The Black Brilliance domain, like an iron ball protecting him, was then sent flying far away by this impact force, along with the Black Brilliance Sage himself.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage at the back saw this and was delighted. Under Lin Yuan's slap, the Black Brilliance Sage had fallen behind him.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan slapped the Black Brilliance Sage away without even looking, and directly stepped into the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

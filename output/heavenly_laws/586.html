        <h1>Chapter 586</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Deity King?"</p><p></p><p>"The youngest core royal member of my great Linggu Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Purple Dream and other great experts were slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Celestial Exalted, no one would underestimate the core royal members at the Great Exalted realm.</p><p></p><p>In the vast majority of local battlefields, the core royal members at the Great Exalted realm represented the pinnacle of combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Deity," Crimson Jade King calmly looked at the Spiritual Deity King, "You are the junior, I will let you take the first move."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I shall make my move." </p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King did not show any modesty, raising his right hand and unleashing a punch forward.</p><p></p><p>This punch contained fully internalized power, but wherever it went, the space-time seemed to retreat, and an aura of deathly silence was emanated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Crimson Jade King's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had allowed the Spiritual Deity King to take the first move, not out of carelessness, but because he was adept at defensive techniques. </p><p></p><p>By letting the opponent initiate the attack, he would not be at much of a disadvantage, and could instead test the true strength of the opponent.</p><p></p><p>However, this punch from the Spiritual Deity King made Crimson Jade King feel pressured. Even this first move, without the Spiritual Deity King going all-out, already possessed such might?</p><p></p><p>Crimson Jade King secretly sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Around Crimson Jade King, lotus flowers of flames bloomed one after another. The punch unleashed by the Spiritual Deity King shattered over 90,000 of these flaming lotus flowers, before its power finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, how refreshing," the Spiritual Deity King laughed heartily, "Crimson Jade, let's go up above to fight, there are too many restrictions here."</p><p></p><p>The clash between the two core royal members would affect the battles between the peak Great Exalted experts below, causing indiscriminate interference. </p><p></p><p>Fighting here would only hamper the two core royal members.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Crimson Jade King nodded.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Crimson Jade King and the Spiritual Deity King vanished from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, two terrifying fluctuations collided violently in the higher spatial-temporal realm.</p><p></p><p>Below, the peak Great Exalted experts also divided their attention to observe, but the collision between the two core royal members exceeded the intensity of over a dozen peak Great Exalted experts combined.</p><p></p><p>"No need to focus on Prince Crimson Jade anymore," Azure Blazing Lord immediately transmitted a message to the other peak Great Exalted experts.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, the battle between Crimson Jade King and the Spiritual Deity King would likely drag on for a long time without a clear victor. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, the outcome of this war would mainly depend on the victory or defeat between them at the peak Great Exalted realm.</p><p></p><p>"Red Leaf, can you hold back that one?" Azure Blazing Lord looked towards the burly peak Great Exalted expert.</p><p></p><p>It was this peak Great Exalted expert who had almost completely suppressed their side earlier, if not for Crimson Jade King's timely support, the situation would have been dire.</p><p></p><p>"Leave it to me," Red Leaf Great Exalted nodded.</p><p></p><p>The reason the burly Great Exalted expert was able to succeed was because they had not been prepared. </p><p></p><p>If Red Leaf Great Exalted focused on guarding against him, the burly Great Exalted expert would find it difficult to use that killing move again.</p><p></p><p>"Third Brother," </p><p></p><p>At the rear of the battlefield, Crimson Pine King was also observing the situation.</p><p></p><p>As the commander of this war, Crimson Pine King had a keen grasp of the battlefield situation, and knew that as long as they did not let the Spiritual Deity King free his hands, their side would likely be able to hold on.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Might, I wonder how long you can persist if this war reaches a stalemate."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Pine King thought to himself. Spiritual Might King had initiated this war that affected dozens of major domains, and had also borne no small cost. If there was no major victory, the war definitely could not last long.</p><p></p><p>The candidates for the throne of the Great Linggu Kingdom certainly did not want another competitor, and if Spiritual Might King was stuck at the frontlines without any progress, it would be an opportunity for those candidates.</p><p></p><p>At the Line Thirteen Defense Battlefield,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also paying attention to the core battlefield. Especially after the appearance of the Spiritual Deity King and Crimson Jade King, the terrifying fluctuations generated by their clash had greatly benefited Lin Yuan's harvesting.</p><p></p><p>"They are indeed very strong, surpassing the peak Great Exalted realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, finding that the battle methods of the experts in this source world were vastly different from those in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Especially the clash between the core royal members, which was mainly a collision of their bloodline talents, unleashing the powerful forces deep within their bloodlines, to the point of rivaling or even exceeding the Chaotic Evolution powers.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it is said that the core royal members can almost never break through to the Celestial Exalted realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, because he now realized that whether it was the Spiritual Deity King or Crimson Jade King, they were not walking the path of Chaotic Evolution at all.</p><p></p><p>Their strength was completely dependent on the power of their own bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of the bloodline has its limits. Without comprehending the Chaotic Principles and the Chaotic Evolution power path, they could never cross into the Celestial Exalted realm.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, the so-called core royal members at the Great Exalted realm were not true Great Exalted, but had merely developed their bloodline power to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"So that's why the Celestial Exalted look down on the royal members, is that the meaning?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. To the Celestial Exalted who had reached the deepest levels of the Chaotic Evolution path, every core royal member was just a reckless person, with only superficial understanding of the principles, relying solely on their bloodline talents to possess such formidable combat power.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the core royal members can also comprehend the principles and the Chaotic Evolution path, but compared to developing their bloodline power, it is truly too slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the battlefield from afar.</p><p></p><p>Even the ordinary royal members would still comprehend the principles, because their bloodline power alone could not support them in continuing to make breakthroughs after the Great Exalted realm.</p><p></p><p>But the core royal members?</p><p></p><p>With the time they had, they could develop more of their bloodline power, gaining greater improvements.</p><p></p><p>Even with the abundant Blazing Sun Seeds to aid them, compared to the bloodline power, it was still too slow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Deity King's utilization of the bloodline seems to be stronger than Crimson Jade King's?"</p><p></p><p>Although this was Lin Yuan's first time witnessing a battle between core royal members, he immediately noticed the difference.</p><p></p><p>In the higher spatial-temporal battlefield,</p><p></p><p>Crimson Jade King's expression was grave, as he stood within a massive flaming lotus flower, with petal-like lotus flower barriers floating around him.</p><p></p><p>While the Spiritual Deity King seemed like...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The massive hammer-like blows kept pounding at the Crimson Jade King, causing the gigantic flaming lotus to tremble slightly, hinting that it might not be able to withstand much longer.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Deity, have you reached your limit of growth?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King's expression revealed a hint of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The strength hierarchy among the core royal clans is measured by the extent to which they can unlock the power of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The higher the unlocked bloodline power, the stronger the combat prowess. Unlocking one's ancestral bloodline to the utmost is reaching the limit of one's growth.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, the core royal clans have reached their personal peaks and can contend with the Celestial Sages.</p><p></p><p>Of course, contending with the Celestial Sages does not mean being on par with or comparable to them, but it is still unprecedented in its strength.</p><p></p><p>The next step for the core royal clans is to earnestly comprehend the Dao, and transcend to the realm of the Grand Sages and Celestial Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, reaching the limit of growth, is that difficult?" </p><p></p><p>The Spirit Deity King showed no intention of holding back, continuously bombarding the Crimson Jade King's protective flaming lotus.</p><p></p><p>From the Spirit Deity King's perspective at the moment, the Crimson Jade King posed no threat, and it was just a matter of how long it would take to tear apart the other's turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome," the Crimson Jade King said grimly.</p><p></p><p>Given the Spirit Deity King's current strength, he could not hold out against the other.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, it would have a devastating impact on the standoff between the peak Grand Sages below.</p><p></p><p>If he could not hold back the Spirit Deity King, the latter would easily deal with those peak Grand Sages.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Crimson Jade King's urgent voice reached Crimson Pine King's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Pine, the Spirit Deity King has reached his limit of growth, I am no match for him. Now, try your best to delay him, and quickly arrange for all the Grand Sages to retreat."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Crimson Pine King's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Deity King has reached his limit of growth?"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Pine King immediately understood the implication.</p><p></p><p>He must have all the Grand Sages retreat to the interior of the Azure Burning City, and then rely on the city's defensive formation to hold out until the core royal clans of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom can provide reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>Against a core royal clan that has reached its limit, the Crimson Pine King's side had no chance of prevailing in a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>The only option was to defend behind the Azure Burning City's full defensive might, and hold out until the ancient kingdom's reinforcements arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat."</p><p></p><p>"All Grand Sages, retreat immediately."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Pine King transmitted the order to all the Grand Sages simultaneously, as the battlefield commander, he had the means to instantly contact all of them.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat immediately?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Crimson Pine is asking us to retreat immediately?"</p><p></p><p>The peak Grand Sages like Azure Marquis were momentarily dazed upon receiving the order. </p><p></p><p>However, no one dared to disobey Lord Crimson Pine's instructions, and all the Grand Sage-level experts began retreating to the formations on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>These battlefield formations, though hastily set up, could still block for a few breaths of time even against peak Grand Sages.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the peak Grand Sages and numerous Grand Sages gathered in front of the spatial passageway at the rear of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The spatial passageway was immediately activated.</p><p></p><p>During the brief waiting period, all the Grand Sages were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Lord Crimson Pine order us to retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't make sense, we're not even in a disadvantageous position?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if we were in a disadvantage, it doesn't mean we all have to retreat?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Sages were somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Lin Yuan understood the reason behind Crimson Pine King's order.</p><p></p><p>In his field of vision at a higher spatial plane, the Crimson Jade King was already teetering under the attacks of the Spirit Deity King.</p><p></p><p>At the higher spatial plane,</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Crimson Jade, you've fallen for the trap."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Deity King looked down at the battlefield, seeing all the Grand Sages of the Azure Burning Domain gathered in front of the spatial passageway, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen for a trap?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can delay me?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Deity King sneered, then suddenly slammed his right hand down, completely suppressing the Crimson Jade King.</p><p></p><p>Then the Spirit Deity King stretched out his right hand towards the spatial passageway on the battlefield, grasping dozens of Grand Sage-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Given the situation on the battlefield, even if the Spirit Deity King had reached his limit of growth as a core royal clan, Crimson Pine King's side was not necessarily doomed to lose.</p><p></p><p>As long as all the Grand Sages could safely retreat to the Azure Burning City, and rely on the defensive formation, they could still hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, within the Azure Burning City, there was not only the defensive formation, but also a teleportation formation connected to the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could buy some time, the ancient kingdom could send another core royal clan that had also reached its limit of growth to reinforce them.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite was that all the Grand Sages must safely reach the Azure Burning City.</p><p></p><p>Only with dozens of Grand Sages jointly maintaining the Azure Burning City's defensive formation could they barely withstand the Spirit Deity King's attack in the short term.</p><p></p><p>If there were no dozens of Grand Sages guarding the Azure Burning City, even with the city's powerful defensive formation, it would be like water without a source, unable to withstand the Spirit Deity King.</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Burning City fell, the Azure Burning Domain would likely also fall, and the surrounding dozens of major domains would be in danger as well.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>In front of the spatial passageway, </p><p></p><p>The dozens of Grand Sages who were about to return to the Azure Burning City through the spatial passageway suddenly felt the heavens and earth change, the surroundings growing dim, with five massive celestial pillars standing tall.</p><p></p><p>At the higher spatial plane,</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Deity King looked at his retrieved right hand, with the dozens of Grand Sages trapped within his palm, like insignificant ants.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Jade, in this war, you have lost."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Deity King laughed recklessly, then under the Crimson Jade King's despairing gaze, gently clenched his right hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>Within the palm, the dozens of Grand Sages felt the five massive celestial pillars collapsing, the myriad spatial dimensions crumbling.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Just as the Spirit Deity King gripped halfway, his smile suddenly froze, filled with doubt and uncertainty as he stared at his half-clenched right hand.</p><p></p><p>Why is it so hard?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter

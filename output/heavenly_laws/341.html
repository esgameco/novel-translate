        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 341 "Rival"? (5,200 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>When these words came out, the many 9th-level experts present felt slightly relieved in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>Don't look at the fact that there were only a few hundred 9th-level experts gathered here at the moment.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the 9th-level experts in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm who were being surrounded and attacked by human civilization, when added together, amounted to at least thousands.</p><p></p><p>The total number was even close to ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>The major peak race alliances that entered the secret realm accounted for most of the 9th-level experts.</p><p></p><p>The remaining were some lone cultivators who had grievances against human civilization.</p><p></p><p>With thousands or nearly ten thousand 9th-level experts, even if facing the pursuit and killing by 10th-level experts, as long as they scattered and fled, some would be able to survive, not to mention against a Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the special environment suppressed many spatial means, making it impossible to teleport or shift locations instantly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the human cultivator named Xiran, who had only opened tens of millions of spatial layers, was able to persist for three years under the pursuit of Hunyi, who had opened over thirty million spatial layers - this alone could explain the situation.</p><p></p><p>It's true that Xiran's cultivation path was special and particularly adept at escaping.</p><p></p><p>But right now, didn't these numerous 9th-level experts also have powerful cultivation paths? Which of the major peak races didn't have supreme cultivation paths?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Galactic Star Master is indeed formidable, but it doesn't mean we have to let the humans slaughter us," said a 9th-level insect race expert as he stood up. "My race has paid a price to invite the Son of the Tree Realm into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to resist that Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"My race has also paid a price to invite the Dragon Scale King into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to resist that Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"My race has also paid..."</p><p></p><p>The 9th-level experts from several major peak races spoke up one after another, announcing things that energized the hearts of the many 9th-level experts present.</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Tree Realm came from the mysterious cosmic secret realm called the "Tree Realm".</p><p></p><p>This cosmic secret realm has a sovereign called the Mother of the Tree Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm is a rare special life form, an 11th-level peak existence. The entire Tree Realm, in the strict sense, is the body of the Mother of the Tree Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm has an offspring called the Son of the Tree Realm. In the vast cosmos, the Mother and Son of the Tree Realm are the only two such special life forms.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whether it is the Mother or the Son of the Tree Realm, they are extremely powerful, with terrifying talents beyond compare.</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm presides over the Tree Realm. Even supreme experts are unwilling to launch a direct attack, mainly because there is no point.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the Mother of the Tree Realm, although she may not be a match for supreme experts, she at least has the means to make the Tree Realm collapse when facing them.</p><p></p><p>So even if supreme experts take action against the Mother of the Tree Realm, they would gain nothing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Mother of the Tree Realm has voluntarily submitted to the insect race and is willing to offer a pound of Tree Realm liquid every ten thousand years, which is why she has been able to exist until now.</p><p></p><p>So normally, the various major races in the cosmos would not categorize special life forms like the Son of the Tree Realm within the scope of 9th-level existences, because they are simply not normal 9th-level beings.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragon Scale King, it is also an existence similar to the Son of the Tree Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Mother of the Tree Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"And the Dragon Scale King too?"</p><p></p><p>"These are said to be legendary 9th-level life forms that are not within the normal scope of 9th-level existences."</p><p></p><p>The 9th-level experts discussed in low voices, their confidence greatly boosted.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Mother of the Tree Realm or the Dragon Scale King, or others, their lifespans were terrifyingly long. The entire life of a normal 9th-level being might not even be as long as their periods of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>So if these beings were counted among normal 9th-level existences, it would be unfair to the other 9th-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"With these reinforcements, what threat does the Galactic Star Master pose?" The 9th-level insect race expert looked towards the many experts and sent out a weighty spiritual ripple.</p><p></p><p>He exchanged glances with the experts from the other major peak races.</p><p></p><p>The reason these races paid such a high price this time was twofold: first, they did not want their entry into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to be fruitless, and second, they wanted to preserve their avatars.</p><p></p><p>Although the avatar technique was a semi-public secret among the major races, the cost of re-condensing an avatar after its death was not small.</p><p></p><p>With so many 9th-level experts, if they all perished in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm at once, even if it was just their avatars, it would still have a significant impact on the major races.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the major peak races wanted to probe the true strength of the Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Galactic Star Master killed Hunyi, it was an instant kill. Apart from knowing that the Galactic Star Master was very powerful and had opened at least billions of spatial layers, nothing else was known.</p><p></p><p>This time, by inviting so many legendary 9th-level experts to take action, they aimed to determine the upper limit of the Galactic Star Master's strength.</p><p></p><p>While the supreme experts might not care much about the Galactic Star Master, the 10th and 11th-level experts were very concerned.</p><p></p><p>Because in the distant future, they might have to fight and battle against the Galactic Star Master on major alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>Since they would inevitably have to fight the Galactic Star Master sooner or later, they naturally wanted to obtain more information about him.</p><p></p><p>In the outer region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, inside a vast canyon, hundreds of human cultivators were sealing off the area.</p><p></p><p>To have hundreds of 9th-level experts seal off thousands or even tens of thousands of 9th-level experts? It seemed like a far-fetched idea - the individual strengths were not much different, and the sealing side was even outnumbered tenfold by the sealed side.</p><p></p><p>But this was the reality.</p><p></p><p>It was due to the deterrence of the Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>None of the 9th-level aliens dared to resist or hesitate.</p><p></p><p>What if their resistance led the Galactic Star Master to come? Wouldn't that be seeking death?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in the hearts of all 9th-level aliens, no matter how strong the Galactic Star Master was, he could not kill all of the thousands or tens of thousands of them.</p><p></p><p>But if the Galactic Star Master was determined to kill, even if he could not finish off thousands or tens of thousands, he would still have a chance to kill hundreds.</p><p></p><p>None of the 9th-level aliens wanted to be among those hundreds.</p><p></p><p>So when faced with the encirclement by the human cultivators, even though their strength was inferior, those 9th-level aliens would run if they could, and would not attempt to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Outside the canyon, Duoke and several other special 9th-level human cultivators were also observing the distant canyon.</p><p></p><p>"This is as far as we can suppress them. Any further and it will force these aliens to retaliate," said a special 9th-level human cultivator.</p><p></p><p>These 9th-level aliens had been pursued until now without daring to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being in awe of the Galactic Star Master, more importantly, they still had an escape route.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>All the aliens had been suppressed into the canyon, with their spatial layers also sealed.</p><p></p><p>These 9th-level aliens had no way out anymore. If they were further suppressed at this point, it would only provoke their will to resist.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Galactic Star Master?"</p><p></p><p>The few special 9th-level human cultivators sounded a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>They had already forced all the 9th-level aliens here, but if the Galactic Star Master still did not appear, it would be the human cultivators' turn to flee next.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master said he would come, so he will definitely come," Duoke said calmly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared above the canyon.</p><p></p><p>The figure was that of a young man wearing a long robe, standing as if connected to millions of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master has arrived."</p><p></p><p>On the human side, upon seeing Lin Yuan appear, they immediately felt energized.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the many 9th-level aliens inside the canyon had solemn expressions, even revealing fear.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the number of spatial layers the Galactic Star Master has opened is at least in the billions?"</p><p></p><p>"Billions of spatial layers? It's unknown if the Son of the Tree Realm and the Dragon Scale King can match up to the Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>The 9th-level aliens' faces were as gloomy as water, feeling immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had trump cards and backup plans, when truly facing the Galactic Star Master, they could not maintain their composure.</p><p></p><p>Although the Son of the Tree Realm and the Dragon Scale King were powerful, they had no record of killing special 9th-level experts, whereas the Galactic Star Master did - he had even killed Hunyi, who had opened over thirty million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't be afraid of that?</p><p></p><p>"You're all here?" Lin Yuan looked down. "Are there any other auras hiding elsewhere?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at a few inconspicuous spots where he sensed a few obscure auras, even stronger than Hunyi's.</p><p></p><p>This was not based on Lin Yuan's perception, but rather on his "special privileges" as the semi-owner of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had not yet fully refined the secret realm's core, having refined 95% of it, his control over the secret realm need not be stated.</p><p></p><p>"Knowing that I have the ability to kill Hunyi, yet you've invited so many reinforcements... Is this to probe my true strength?" </p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan roughly guessed the motives of the major peak alien races.</p><p></p><p>Those few obscure auras were even stronger than Hunyi's...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>They are so powerful, inviting such existences, the price paid must not be small?</p><p></p><p>New69book.com</p><p></p><p>Previously when killing the Hunyi, Lin Yuan had only activated the power of two billion layers of space. </p><p></p><p>Two billion layers of space is still considered unprecedented, but compared to the more than twenty billion space layers that Lin Yuan had truly opened, it was insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Still can't reveal my full strength," Lin Yuan decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan, in the history of the cosmic starry sky, the maximum number of space layers opened at the ninth level did not exceed one billion layers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opening two billion layers of space was indeed unimaginable, but it still did not exceed too much. If he revealed more than twenty billion space layers...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that even the strongest experts would be shocked, and might disregard face to take action.</p><p></p><p>The strongest experts did not care about two billion layers of space, but more than twenty billion layers was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to have a tenfold difference, but the actual difficulty was not just a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand times.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the canyon.</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-level alien tribes were observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the astonished gaze of all the ninth-level alien tribes, the Galaxy Lord standing in the void raised his right hand and pressed down on them.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The power of two billion layers of space crushed down, determined to destroy everything in front of it.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The ninth-level insect tribe's expression changed drastically, and he immediately roared loudly: "Everyone, aren't you going to take action yet?"</p><p></p><p>Shua la la.</p><p></p><p>Four auras suddenly condensed, converging from all directions. One was a tree-shaped life form, its branches swaying, shaking the vast power of space.</p><p></p><p>Another aura's owner was a human-shaped life form with golden dragon scales. His every move exuded a terrifying aura of blood energy.</p><p></p><p>The four experts joined forces against the Galaxy Lord. Each of their strengths far exceeded the Hunyi, having opened space layers numbering in the hundreds of millions, approaching one billion.</p><p></p><p>Far away from the canyon, there were many ninth-level experts watching the show.</p><p></p><p>These ninth-level experts basically had no grievances with human civilization, and were not on the list to be surrounded and eliminated this time, so they could leisurely stay here.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the Galaxy Lord finally appeared."</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Galaxy Lord? The cosmic will really favors humans too much. We special life forms excel in innate talents, but compared to that Galaxy Lord..."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-level experts chatted and laughed with each other, completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>Relaxed? Of course they were relaxed, after all it wasn't them getting beaten up.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Lord took action."</p><p></p><p>"Who are those four powerful beings that suddenly appeared?"</p><p></p><p>"The Son of the Tree Realm? And the Dragon Scale King? The few peak tribes really went all out, even inviting those experts."</p><p></p><p>This group of ninth-level experts watching from afar immediately widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally they thought it would be a one-sided situation, with the Galaxy Lord's strength, the ninth-level alien side would definitely suffer a complete defeat.</p><p></p><p>After all, those ninth-level aliens came from different tribes, they could not truly unite their efforts. Facing the unmatched Galaxy Lord, they must have thought as long as they could run faster than the other experts, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Who would stay behind and desperately try to stall the Galaxy Lord?</p><p></p><p>But the appearance of the four special ninth-level experts like the Son of the Tree Realm and the Dragon Scale King showed the many ninth-level experts another situation.</p><p></p><p>As long as these four special ninth-levels could stall the Galaxy Lord, the remaining human evolutionary experts would find it difficult to deal with the counterattack of those thousands or tens of thousands of ninth-level aliens.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Lord, I didn't expect such an absolute genius like you to appear in this era," the Son of the Tree Realm, maintaining his ancient tree form, sent out a spiritual ripple, looking at Lin Yuan full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>The other three were the same.</p><p></p><p>The reason they agreed to support the ninth-level aliens in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, apart from the hefty price paid by the few peak tribes, was that they also wanted to experience such an opponent like the Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>"You're also here to seek death?" Lin Yuan continued channeling the power of the heavy space layers, and since he knew the purpose of the aliens, he naturally would not reveal more strength.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he controlled the number of space layers within the range of two billion.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to increase the number of space layers did not mean Lin Yuan could not use other means.</p><p></p><p>For example, the 'Xuanhuang Strike'?</p><p></p><p>Practicing the first stage of the 'Xuanhuang Strike' allowed Lin Yuan to unleash double the power with each strike.</p><p></p><p>This power did not come from the power of space layers, but was specially amplified, and just a doubling was not too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The truly monstrous aspect of the 'Xuanhuang Strike' was not the degree of enhancement, even at the strongest perfect realm, the increase was only fivefold.</p><p></p><p>It was the 'constant' state.</p><p></p><p>However, to confirm this point, unless one engaged in years or decades of fierce battle with Lin Yuan, it would be impossible to detect.</p><p></p><p>If it was just one or two strikes, at most one could only deduce that he had used a secret technique to unleash explosive power.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Imbued with the 'Xuanhuang Strike', Lin Yuan's attacks underwent a qualitative change. The four special ninth-level experts like the Son of the Tree Realm immediately had some difficulty withstanding it and began retreating explosively.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Lord wasn't even going all out when he killed the Hunyi before?"</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying, the Son of the Tree Realm and the other three were suppressed by the Galaxy Lord, retreating step by step?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, we probably can't leave alive."</p><p></p><p>Inside the canyon, the many ninth-level aliens immediately realized.</p><p></p><p>"Space layers around two billion, mastering a secret technique that doubles his strength?"  The leading ninth-level insect tribe carefully observed, finally concluding:</p><p></p><p>"This should be the true strength of the Galaxy Lord. As long as we can confirm the Galaxy Lord's specific strength, any price paid is worth it."</p><p></p><p>The ninth-level insect tribe thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Only by confirming the opponent's specific strength could they make targeted preparations in the future.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would repeat the scene from the alien battlefield, with the Feather Tribe repeatedly sending out their own invincible eighth-levels, each delivering ninth-level treasures to that Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>Far away from the canyon.</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-level experts were dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Lord...the Galaxy Lord is too strong."</p><p></p><p>"He actually suppressed the Son of the Tree Realm and Dragon Scale King so badly?"</p><p></p><p>"Inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the ninth-level experts' minds were shaken. They were observing from an extremely distant place, yet could still feel the chilling aftershocks of the battle.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine the immense pressure felt by those on the battlefield around the Galaxy Lord, or even his opponents.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power of the heavy space layers, further imbued with the 'Xuanhuang Strike', transformed into terrifying strike after strike, suppressing the Son of the Tree Realm and the other three experts, who suffered tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what fell were only the avatars that entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Whether the Son of the Tree Realm or the Dragon Scale King, they had only sent avatars.</p><p></p><p>"Can't escape anymore."</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Tree Realm sighed in his heart. The four of them together were still shaking under the Galaxy Lord. Now that one had fallen, they had no hope left.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the canyon.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there was no chance of a reversal, the ninth-level insect tribe turned to look at the many ninth-level aliens behind him and said, "Everyone, the Galaxy Lord is cruel. If we continue to stay, we will eventually die by the Galaxy Lord's hand."</p><p></p><p>After the ninth-level insect tribe finished speaking, he looked at the expressions of the many ninth-level aliens and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, we might as well directly enter the inner area and core area. Those areas are much larger than the outer area. It's basically impossible for the human evolutionary experts to set up a blockade line there."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the many ninth-level aliens on the scene immediately understood the meaning.</p><p></p><p>Rather than die by the Galaxy Lord's hand, or die by the human evolutionary experts' hands...</p><p></p><p>It was better to hide in the inner area and core area. Those areas were far larger than the outer area. The human civilization's evolutionary experts could never carry out another blockade.</p><p></p><p>Even if the secret realm closed in the end and they died from its elimination, it was better than having their personal treasures fall into the hands of the human civilization's evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>Since they were going to die anyway.</p><p></p><p>Why should they "aid the enemy"?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go."  </p><p></p><p>"We're going to the inner area now."</p><p></p><p>"Right, even if it's death, we can't let human civilization gain any benefit."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-level aliens in the canyon immediately fled towards the inner area and core area.</p><p></p><p>In the air above.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slapped away the last Son of the Tree Realm into dust, and saw the many ninth-level aliens fleeing towards the inner area and core area.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Xuanhuang Secret Realm closes, all outside invaders in the inner area and core area will be eliminated. They would rather leave their harvested treasures in the secret realm than let the human evolutionary experts have them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately saw through the intentions of those ninth-level aliens.</p><p></p><p>Then an odd expression appeared on his face. Leaving their harvested treasures in the secret realm, how was that different from giving them to him?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 363 Revisiting the Black Planet (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the tenth rank, for Lin Yuan, aside from the most direct aspect of his power exploding, there was another benefit - his comprehension of the rules became much easier. </p><p></p><p>The ninth and tenth ranks exist at different heights, so naturally the scenery they see is also different. Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension was the same. When he was at the ninth rank, his heaven-defying comprehension made fusing the pillar-level rules seem abstruse and difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>But the tenth rank?</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be said to be easy, but it also wasn't abstruse.</p><p></p><p>In the few years since stepping into the tenth rank, Lin Yuan first deeply comprehended the fusion between the rules of life and death, these two pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of his comprehensions transformed into inspiration, driving Lin Yuan to take that final step.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, by comprehending the rules of life and death, you begin the fusion of rules.]</p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, by comprehending the rules of life and death, you begin the fusion of rules.] </p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, by comprehending the rules of life and death, the fusion succeeds.]</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind rumbled as the rules of life and death thoroughly fused, forming an entirely new rule power. This rule power contained life and death, allowing the two to continuously reincarnate, as if without end.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally comprehended a fused pillar-level rule."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Normally, when a tenth rank cultivator comprehends a fused pillar-level rule, which is at least the fusion of two pillar-level rules into a new rule, they would be ranked in the tenth rank alpha-level.</p><p></p><p>However, it takes a very very long time for tenth rank cultivators to reach this step.</p><p></p><p>It's just that firstly, Lin Yuan's foundation was too powerful - even before stepping into the tenth rank, he had thoroughly comprehended all the major pillar-level rules.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Lin Yuan's comprehension itself defied the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Other tenth rank cultivators, when first entering this realm, couldn't even thoroughly comprehend a few pillar-level rules, let alone comprehend a fused pillar-level rule.</p><p></p><p>The two were simply not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of the rules of life and death, the fused rule I've comprehended should be the rule of life and death reincarnation?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The rule of life and death reincarnation was an extremely powerful fused rule among the many pillar-level rules. The two pillar-level rules it encompassed, life and death, were completely opposite extremes.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of fusing the rules of life and death surpassed the fusion of other pillar-level rules, but once successfully fused, the might of the formed rule of life and death reincarnation was exceptionally terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength, in a normal state, should be able to reach the eleventh rank threshold, right?" Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>For a normal tenth rank expert, comprehending a fused pillar-level rule would lead to a qualitative increase in their strength.</p><p></p><p>There were different types of fused pillar-level rules, with various focuses, but regardless of which fused pillar-level rule, they would allow a tenth rank expert to leap onto the alpha-level threat list.</p><p></p><p>So - </p><p></p><p>Simply put,</p><p></p><p>If the fused pillar-level rule was compared to a sharp blade,</p><p></p><p>In the hands of an ordinary person it could create immense killing power, and in the hands of a cultivator, the killing power would be even stronger and higher.</p><p></p><p>The same level of the rule of life and death reincarnation, activated by Lin Yuan versus activated by a normal alpha-level tenth rank expert, the might unleashed would be worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try again."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, his Yin Yuan Primordial Spirit immediately descended into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, relying on the Xuanhuang Imprint, Lin Yuan could enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm from any position in the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for leaving?</p><p></p><p>Aside from the fixed 333 secret realm exits,</p><p></p><p>He could also establish a "path marker" connecting to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to serve as a guiding pull.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long established this, using his true self as the "path marker" for leaving.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was closed, the reason he left together with the other ninth rank cultivators was to create the scene of himself also leaving the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Yuan Primordial Spirit descended once more.</p><p></p><p>"Master." The six-armed figure appeared, looking at Lin Yuan with slight confusion.</p><p></p><p>"I want to try my strength again," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The six-armed figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although unclear why Lin Yuan wanted to do it again, the six-armed figure would only listen to the master's every command.</p><p></p><p>"What is the endurance limit of this secret realm?" Lin Yuan asked before taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Endurance limit?" The six-armed figure pondered for a moment. "Attacks below the ultimate level basically have no issue."</p><p></p><p>The reason the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could avoid being locked onto by supreme experts was by integrating into the countless interlayer spaces of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xuanhuang Secret Realm itself, it had no ability to block supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I just comprehended a type of fused rule and want to test it out."</p><p></p><p>"Help me see if its might has reached the eleventh rank threshold."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Lin Yuan raised his right hand and gently pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of the fused rules of life and death began erupting. The aura of the two extreme rules seeped into the myriad spatial layers, vaguely starting to affect the stability of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This...?" The six-armed figure's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you can't attack any further.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure hurriedly said, "Yes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also noticed the changes in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>He activated the rules of life and death reincarnation and struck out. It was far from shaking the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, but it continuously impacted the core essence of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the rules of life and death reincarnation," Lin Yuan marveled inwardly. </p><p></p><p>With his current foundation and strength, activating the rules of life and death reincarnation unleashed destructive power that absolutely reached the eleventh-stage threshold.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that previous strike reached the eleventh-stage threshold," the six-armed figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his expression showed a hint of astonishment. Having just entered the tenth stage, to be able to cause such a terrifying strike - was this really a tenth-stage life?</p><p></p><p>"I know," Lin Yuan said in a good mood. "Although this strike reached the eleventh-stage threshold, compared to a true eleventh-stage expert, it is still a bit weaker."</p><p></p><p>The so-called eleventh-stage threshold referred to a casual strike from someone who had just entered the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not feel discouraged. It had not been long since he crossed into the tenth stage, yet he could already reach this level. After a few decades or a few hundred years, it was entirely possible for him to challenge eleventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, after comprehending the rules of life and death reincarnation, Lin Yuan gathered with the Black Star Master and the Liuli Star Master to chat idly.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Galaxy Star Master, your tenth-stage celebration is almost catching up to Deputy Tower Master Nalan's eleventh-stage celebration," the Black Star Master laughed.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect everyone would be so enthusiastic either," Lin Yuan said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the tenth stage, Lin Yuan held a tenth-stage celebration, resulting in congratulations and celebrations pouring in from human civilization's tenth and eleventh-stage evolvers, as well as many other forces sending congratulatory messages.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to the congratulatory messages, the celebratory gifts were also very grand.</p><p></p><p>Just from the celebratory cash gifts alone, Lin Yuan received seven to eight hundred million universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>"This is because the one holding the celebration is the Galaxy Star Master," the Black Star Master shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"When I broke through to the tenth stage and held a celebration, it wasn't on this scale."</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Master's potential was unlimited. With the talent and aptitude he had revealed so far, advancing to the eleventh stage was already considered stable.</p><p></p><p>So it was natural for many evolvers and forces to send celebratory gifts.</p><p></p><p>As for him, the Black Star Master, when he first entered the tenth stage, the celebration was just a bit livelier than a normal tenth-stage celebration. At that time, the Black Star Master's revealed aptitude was far from Lin Yuan's current level.</p><p></p><p>"When you hold your eleventh-stage celebration, it will definitely be grander than mine," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully," the Black Star Master's face showed a smile too.</p><p></p><p>He also yearned to cross into the eleventh stage, but simply accumulating resources was not enough to take that step.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's provocation causing Deputy Tower Master Nalan's mindset to change and desire a breakthrough, Nalan would probably have spent tens of thousands or even millions of years before breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it would have only been a possibility of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly with the Black Star Master and Liuli Star Master for a while, Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've comprehended the rules of life and death reincarnation, I can go explore the Black Planet," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Black Planet was a mysterious planet that Lin Yuan's Yin Yuan Spirit accidentally discovered when returning from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the planet were twelve huge gates. The prerequisite for entering each gate was to comprehend a pillar-level fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered that one of the gates required the pillar-level fusion rule of life and death reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Planet," Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>According to the Goddess of Wisdom's explanation, the Black Planet came from the event of countless treasures descending from outside the universe in the distant past.</p><p></p><p>The rise of human civilization was closely related to this, as they had apparently obtained part of a key inheritance.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan attached great importance to this Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look," Lin Yuan's Yin Yuan Spirit appeared, then vanished, heading towards the star domain where the Black Planet was located.</p><p></p><p>Outside the seemingly ordinary Black Planet, Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Following his usual practice, he left a drop of his essence blood outside.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan descended onto the Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the planet, twelve black gates stood towering, emanating an ancient and mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>After carefully observing for a while, Lin Yuan finally stood before one of the black gates.</p><p></p><p>This was the gate corresponding to comprehending the "rules of life and death reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>Only by comprehending this pillar-level fusion rule could one enter.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now?" Lin Yuan frowned slightly, standing outside the black gate.</p><p></p><p>He then reached out, trying to push open the black gate.</p><p></p><p>But the black gate remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of life and death reincarnation," Lin Yuan looked at the patterns engraved on the surface of the black gate.</p><p></p><p>The patterns were very complex, but Lin Yuan understood their meaning at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the rules of life and death reincarnation allows entry!"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan tried to condense the power of the rules of life and death reincarnation, slowly infusing it into the black gate.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under Lin Yuan's gaze, a low rumbling voice sounded in his ears:</p><p></p><p>"Entry condition met."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the black gate began to shake and opened with a thunderous rumble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hesitate and stepped right through.</p><p></p><p>"What is this place?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he looked around.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the forefront of the attack, the Lingyu Celestial Venerable is not particularly strong, but in terms of suppressing and containing enemies, among the dozens of supreme celestial venerables from the six great ancient nations, the Lingyu Celestial Venerable can definitely be ranked among the top three.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is not a peak supreme celestial venerable, once they fall into his Lingyu, they will be trapped for at least several days to tens of days.</p><p></p><p>Facing a peak supreme celestial venerable? The Lingyu Celestial Venerable will not easily bring such a powerful expert into his sight.</p><p></p><p>First, he cannot contain them for long.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it will divert most of his mental focus to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>The benefits may not outweigh the costs.</p><p></p><p>This is not a problem, after all, among the dozens of supreme celestial venerables from the six great ancient nations, there are not many who can truly be called peak supreme celestial venerables, adding up to only around ten to twenty.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority are still normal supreme celestial venerables.</p><p></p><p>The Guanglie Celestial Venerable can split into thirty-three avatars, and each avatar is equivalent to a relatively powerful supreme celestial venerable, but they will still be suppressed and contained by the Lingyu Celestial Venerable for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only will the Lingyu Celestial Venerable not easily make a move against a certain peak supreme celestial venerable, the other peak supreme celestial venerables among themselves also cannot just meet and engage in battle, even for the sake of a core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Now that many powerful experts have just entered the treasure land, there are still many unoccupied core celestial pillars, and even if the peak supreme celestial venerables encounter each other, in the end, one of them will retreat and seek a new core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>As for fighting over it? Unless it's in the later stage of the competition, when most of the core celestial pillars have already been claimed, the peak supreme celestial venerables will then unleash their full power and fight to determine the outcome.</p><p></p><p>"My eye?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Venerable let out a miserable scream, his right eye exploded, which was equivalent to the disruption of the path of his evolved chaotic power, greatly affecting him.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the dense spatial fluctuations, Lin Yuan slowly walked out, glancing at the Lingyu Celestial Venerable who was covering his right eye.</p><p></p><p>In the Lingyu Celestial Venerable's right eye Lingyu, the space-time had almost solidified, and the moment Lin Yuan fell into it, he actively activated the divine ability 'World', with 33,333 blazing sun seeds in his body forming a great cycle, projecting outwards to the universe, transforming into 33,333 blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>This single move burst open the Lingyu Celestial Venerable's right eye Lingyu.</p><p></p><p>"This Lingyu Celestial Venerable is truly worthy of his reputation," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the blazing sun seeds in his body had not formed a great cycle, then at this moment, trapped inside the other's Lingyu, he would have been suppressed for at least several days or even ten days.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Venerable, do you possess the strength of a peak supreme celestial venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Venerable's figure trembled slightly, but quickly calmed down. Although his right eye was destroyed, he still had his left eye, and his foundation remained, so he was able to stabilize himself quickly.</p><p></p><p>The one who could break through his Lingyu must be a peak supreme celestial venerable, and moreover, one who specializes in killing.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Venerable was reluctant to bring a peak supreme celestial venerable into his sight, and this was precisely the concern he had.</p><p></p><p>The path of chaotic evolution of the peak supreme celestial venerables encompasses everything, and if they encounter one with terrifying killing power, they may very well be able to shatter the Lingyu from within.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was precisely such a case.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding other supreme celestial venerables from the great spiritual ancient nations also had subtle changes in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>A peak supreme celestial venerable? The Silver River Celestial Venerable has just stepped into the celestial venerable realm?</p><p></p><p>"Apologies." Lin Yuan calmly looked at the Lingyu Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Having been trapped in the other's right eye Lingyu, Lin Yuan could only use his full strength, otherwise, if he was trapped inside, the loss would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have crossed into the celestial venerable realm with the bloodline of an ancestor, I don't believe your strength has risen so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Venerable stared at Lin Yuan, and in the depths of his left eye, a vortex was slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the laws of heaven and earth were changing, and a deep and dark prison was forming, seemingly like the Lingyu in the Lingyu Celestial Venerable's left eye, but transferred to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>When facing opponents of different levels, the Lingyu Celestial Venerable has different methods. Against ordinary supreme celestial venerables, he can simply trap them in his Lingyu.</p><p></p><p>But when facing peak supreme celestial venerables of the same level, he has to be much more cautious. He would first use the Lingyu in his eye to probe, and only when he confirms that the opponent has no means to disrupt the foundation of the Lingyu, would he then proceed to trap them.</p><p></p><p>"I see, you think I used external forces?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood, his method of bursting open the Lingyu clearly reached the level of a peak supreme celestial venerable, but this did not mean that Lin Yuan was a peak supreme celestial venerable himself.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he had used some external force?</p><p></p><p>With his right eye destroyed, the Lingyu Celestial Venerable can be considered to have suffered a devastating loss, so he definitely would not let Lin Yuan go easily.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, let me see the strength of a peak supreme celestial venerable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the changing heavens and earth around them. At the peak supreme celestial venerable level, one is already approaching the invincible great saints in the chaotic void. Such an opponent piqued Lin Yuan's interest as well.</p><p></p><p>The previous bursting of the Lingyu was completely due to the Lingyu Celestial Venerable's underestimation, and Lin Yuan had taken advantage of that.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, two completely different spatial-temporal forces began to violently collide, the Lingyu in the Lingyu Celestial Venerable's left eye intertwining with the cosmic power from Lin Yuan's exterior, their terrifying might causing the space-time to be erased in large swaths.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingyu Celestial Venerable has unleashed his true power."</p><p></p><p>The supreme celestial venerables from the great spiritual ancient nations who were about to refine the core celestial pillar immediately retreated far away.</p><p></p><p>Among the celestial venerables of the six great ancient nations, there are four levels:</p><p></p><p>From weak to strong, they are:</p><p></p><p>Ordinary celestial venerables,</p><p>Supreme celestial venerables,</p><p>Peak supreme celestial venerables,</p><p>And the strongest, the Profound Void Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The path of chaotic evolution that the peak supreme celestial venerables cultivate is much stronger than that of the ordinary celestial venerables and supreme celestial venerables, resulting in a huge gap in combat power.</p><p></p><p>As for the Profound Void Celestial Venerables, the strongest? They are essentially on the same level as the peak supreme celestial venerables, as their paths of chaotic evolution are basically at the same tier.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Profound Void Celestial Venerables are above the peak supreme celestial venerables is that they have mastered certain supreme inheritances passed down by the thirteen-tier ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen-tier ancestors of the six great ancient nations have all left related supreme inheritances in their own treasure vaults, and many celestial venerables have tried to cultivate them, but truly succeeding is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating and mastering are two different things.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of a peak supreme celestial venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The several supreme celestial venerables from the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>The collision between Lin Yuan and the Lingyu Celestial Venerable had released shockwaves that were almost equivalent to their full-power attacks as supreme celestial venerables.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Celestial Venerable should be a peak supreme celestial venerable."</p><p></p><p>The several supreme celestial venerables from the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation silently observed, coming to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Celestial Venerable suspected that Lin Yuan had relied on external forces to burst open his right eye Lingyu, and they naturally had similar speculations.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's rise was too fast, even with the bloodline of a celestial venerable ancestor, but his growth and development did not require time? But after this direct confrontation, although the Lingyu Celestial Venerable had lost his right eye, his peak supreme celestial venerable strength remained, and he still could not suppress the Silver River Celestial Venerable in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>This was a genuine, head-on clash.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous collision between the two peak supreme celestial sovereigns caused their mighty power to radiate in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"That is... the peak supreme celestial sovereigns fighting?"</p><p></p><p>The peak supreme celestial sovereign of the Thunder Roar Ancient Country had just refined a core celestial pillar. He looked up in a certain direction, secretly puzzled: "Just after entering the treasure land, the peak supreme celestial sovereigns have already engaged in combat?"</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Great Abyss Ancient Country, the peak supreme celestial sovereigns were essentially the pinnacle of combat power in the other five ancient countries. Even if they encountered each other in the initial stage of contending for the treasure land, they would not easily make a move.</p><p></p><p>"One of the peak supreme celestial sovereigns is the Nether Eternal Sovereign, but who is the other one?"</p><p></p><p>The peak supreme celestial sovereign of the Thunder Roar Ancient Country gazed into the distance, pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, whoever it is, the more ruthless the killing, the better. I can seize the opportunity to refine more core celestial pillars."</p><p></p><p>This peak supreme celestial sovereign immediately flew towards another direction, searching for new core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The various peak supreme celestial sovereigns throughout the treasure land also sensed the fierce battle between the peak supreme celestial sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Nether Eternal Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"Has the Nether Eternal Sovereign encountered an enemy? They've already engaged in combat so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is the other peak supreme celestial sovereign fighting the Nether Eternal Sovereign? I've never felt such an aura before."</p><p></p><p>"However, the scorching and masculine power should belong to the peak supreme celestial sovereign of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, but none of the three peak supreme celestial sovereigns sent by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country - Crimson Flame, Eternal Sun, and Blazing Might - seem to be the one."</p><p></p><p>Many peak supreme celestial sovereigns and even supreme celestial sovereigns also divided their attention to focus on this, but they didn't pay too much heed, still frantically searching for celestial pillar cores in various locations.</p><p></p><p>"Nether Eternal!"</p><p></p><p>The Nether Eternal Sovereign's right eye was hollow, while the left eye was endlessly deep. The surrounding heavens and earth began to subtly rotate and distort.</p><p></p><p>This was one of his killing moves, specially prepared for other peak supreme celestial sovereigns. But now, he used it against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave. The numerous Blazing Sun seeds within him began to glow, and in the universe enveloping the heavens and earth, countless blazing suns rose one after another, quickly amounting to 33,333 blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>As for the more than a hundred Blazing Sun seeds he had further comprehended and condensed, unable to be integrated into the great cycle, Lin Yuan did not manifest them.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The blazing suns hung high.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lin Yuan fully activated the divine ability "World" in front of others. Previously, when he was trapped in the Nether Eternal Sovereign's right eye, there were no other powerful experts observing.</p><p></p><p>"This move again?"</p><p></p><p>The Nether Eternal Sovereign's expression turned ferocious. It was his right eye that had been burst open by the power of these countless blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>The blazing suns rose and fell, and the Nether Eternal Sovereign's Nether Eternal Realm rapidly dissolved, with two-thirds of the area collapsing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"This method has never been used by any of the peak supreme celestial sovereigns born in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country!" The Nether Eternal Sovereign felt strained, and also somewhat disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had already confirmed that the means by which Lin Yuan had burst open his right eye did not come from external forces, but from his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Nether Eternal Sovereign, aren't you going to run?"</p><p></p><p>Blazing suns floated around Lin Yuan, and he himself had transformed into an even larger blazing sun, illuminating the four corners of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Run?"</p><p></p><p>The Nether Eternal Sovereign felt resentful, but he also knew that he should indeed run now. If he continued, he would have to pay a heavy price if he wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Sovereign, you hid your strength and destroyed my Nether Realm in advance. Otherwise, how could I have fallen behind?" The Nether Eternal Sovereign's remaining single eye looked at Lin Yuan, still somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>If his right eye Nether Realm was still intact, even if he couldn't defeat the Silver Galaxy Sovereign, the two peak supreme celestial sovereigns would be evenly matched, rather than him having to flee in defeat.</p><p></p><p>Two Nether Realms and one Nether Realm represented completely different strengths for the Nether Eternal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given Lin Yuan's currently terrifying power, even if the Nether Eternal Sovereign's right eye was still there, it would be difficult for him to do anything. At most, it would be a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down from above. With his current strength, it would be difficult to forcibly keep the Nether Eternal Sovereign here. Even if he used all his trump cards, he would only have a slim chance after expending a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>During that time, various variables could occur, such as the other peak supreme celestial sovereigns from the Great Abyss Ancient Country coming to rescue the Nether Eternal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, it would lead to the Blazing Sun Ancient Country and the Great Abyss Ancient Country exhausting each other, allowing the other four ancient countries to benefit. Lin Yuan naturally did not want to choose that path.</p><p></p><p>Simply driving the Nether Eternal Sovereign away would suffice.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the Nether Eternal Sovereign was not unwilling to admit defeat and wanted to confirm Lin Yuan's true strength, the two of them would not have engaged in such a fierce battle in the first place.</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Eternal Sovereign felt resentful, but he still maintained the remaining Nether Eternal Realm to quickly flee.</p><p></p><p>As for the few supreme celestial sovereigns of the Great Abyss Ancient Country at the beginning, they had long since retreated far away.</p><p></p><p>When they sensed that the situation was not good, they immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not continue to pursue and kill, but instead returned to the core celestial pillar below and began to refine it.</p><p></p><p>"These celestial pillars are the core of the treasure land. By refining the celestial pillars, can I gain some control over the treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>As he continued to refine, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the connection between this celestial pillar and the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>In the independent space of the Blazing Sun Capital.</p><p></p><p>The avatars of the twelve supreme celestial sovereigns, such as Crimson Flame Sovereign and Blazing Might Sovereign, had all gathered here to facilitate constant communication and exchange.</p><p></p><p>The avatars and the main bodies shared consciousness. Now that the twelve sovereigns were scattered throughout the newly born treasure land, this group of twelve avatars was their means of staying connected.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy, why did the waves of the battle between the peak supreme celestial sovereigns come from the celestial pillar you discovered?"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign immediately looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme celestial sovereigns also turned their gazes towards Lin Yuan upon hearing this. The full-force clash between the two peak supreme celestial sovereigns would be sensed across half the treasure land area, and even those who didn't feel it directly would have learned of it from their friends.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy, which peak supreme celestial sovereign was fighting that Nether Eternal one?"</p><p></p><p>Blazing Might Sovereign was also curious. "I can sense that the aura and power of that peak supreme celestial sovereign are scorching and masculine, with the flow of Blazing Sun energy, but all twelve of our Blazing Sun sovereigns are here."</p><p></p><p>Eternal Sun Sovereign also had some speculations as he looked at Lin Yuan, and his gaze held a hint of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"That Nether Eternal Sovereign directly trapped me in his right eye Nether Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hide anything and said truthfully, "I had no choice but to shatter that Nether Realm, and then the Nether Eternal Sovereign engaged in battle with me for a while, before ultimately fleeing. Now, that core celestial pillar is almost completely refined by me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, the surroundings fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Even though the eleven supreme celestial sovereigns had similar guesses in their hearts earlier, now that they heard Lin Yuan openly admit it, they were still filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Galaxy Sovereign, not a supreme celestial sovereign? But a peak supreme celestial sovereign?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

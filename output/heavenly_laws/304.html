        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 304: Goodwill from the "Ancient God" (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"The Door to All Realms"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was focused. </p><p></p><p>The Door to All Realms was Lin Yuan's greatest trump card, unmatched by anything else, even the mysterious gourd had to take a back seat to it.</p><p></p><p>The changes happening to the Door to All Realms drew Lin Yuan's full attention.</p><p></p><p>"This black sphere, could it allow the Door to All Realms to resonate on its own, containing coordinates to another world inside?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly. In the past when he had traversed to other worlds, only by getting close to the coordinates of an otherworld could trigger changes in the Door to All Realms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, other possibilities could not be ruled out either. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true understanding of the Door to All Realms was still too limited.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because his strength was too weak, unable to make the Door to All Realms recognize him as its master.</p><p></p><p>Facing the changes in the Door to All Realms, he could only rely on guesses and speculation.</p><p></p><p>"Can you let me take a look?" Lin Yuan looked towards Xiran and asked.</p><p></p><p>"What's the big deal?" Xiran directly tossed the black sphere to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan's right hand touched the black sphere, a strand of information transmitted through his skin into his body, eventually merging into the Door to All Realms.</p><p></p><p>Behind the nine world coordinate imprints at the bottom of the Door to All Realms, new world coordinate information slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"It really is world coordinates."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit stirred with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be world coordinates from other dimensions?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt even more delighted inwardly.  </p><p></p><p>Relying on the Door to All Realms, world coordinates were an undefended treasure trove for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is a world coordinate the most precious possession for that place of opportunity's owner? Perhaps this world coordinate is the homeland of that place's master?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed silently.</p><p></p><p>According to Xiran, the master of that place of opportunity was a life form from another dimension who had mistakenly entered the interdimensional gap, and later became a follower of the great "Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Trapped in the unfamiliar interdimensional gap, that master must have deeply missed their home world. But different dimensions were like an abyss, even the most powerful could not cross over.</p><p></p><p>Even with the world coordinates of their homeland, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>The master was a follower of the great "Sovereign" of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Based on current information, this "Sovereign" was at least an extremely powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't believe the master had never asked the great "Sovereign" for help.</p><p></p><p>With world coordinates, even the most powerful could lock onto any world on the same plane, but they would be powerless across dimensions.</p><p></p><p>He had already developed an almost blind "adoration" for Lin Yuan. After researching it for so long without figuring it out, he was hoping Lin Yuan could discern something just by taking a glance.</p><p></p><p>"No," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he already knew what this black sphere was, and had replicated the most precious world coordinate inside it into his Door to All Realms.</p><p></p><p>But of course, he couldn't openly say such things.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would never reveal any information about the Door to All Realms.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Xiran sighed. Initially in that place of opportunity, there were many treasures on display. Following the master's intentions, he had only taken the most precious one and escaped.</p><p></p><p>As for the other treasures? The Maduo cultivator was right behind him, Xiran only had time to take one treasure.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought it would be some great opportunity, but now it seemed useless.</p><p></p><p>This left Xiran feeling depressed. He had risked this avatar being destroyed, hunted by the Maduo cultivator for so long, and now it seemed he had been hunted for nothing?</p><p></p><p>"After we return, we can hand it over to the three Goddesses to examine. Maybe they'll know what it is," Lin Yuan returned the black sphere to Xiran.</p><p></p><p>This black sphere no longer held any significance for Lin Yuan, as he had already replicated the most important world coordinate inside.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>"Just because I can't recognize it doesn't mean the three Goddesses can't."</p><p></p><p>Xiran nodded slightly. In the many places of opportunity within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the treasures and wonders contained often had obscure origins.</p><p></p><p>It was normal that he couldn't recognize it now.</p><p></p><p>After examining the black sphere for a while longer, the two discussed the main matter at hand.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, what are your plans next?" Xiran asked.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to go take a look at the core region," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Many experts were very curious about the core region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and wanted to explore it.</p><p></p><p>It was only natural for Lin Yuan to plan on going to the core region, nothing too out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"The core region, huh," Xiran pondered for a moment. "Coincidentally, I was also planning to enter the core region this time."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't we go together?"</p><p></p><p>Xiran suggested.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm had opened many times before.</p><p></p><p>The only place left was the core region they hadn't gone to yet.</p><p></p><p>Now was a good chance to go take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, although my frontal combat strength is far inferior to yours, I'm still quite capable when it comes to escaping and self-preservation," Xiran stated proactively.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had easily escaped from the nearly hundred-thousand-fold cultivator Maduo, which proved his point.</p><p></p><p>At least Lin Yuan didn't have that level of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Facing Maduo's pursuit, Lin Yuan could stand still and fend him off.</p><p></p><p>But using layer upon layer of spatial domains to keep Maduo from touching him would be quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then," Lin Yuan thought it over and didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>They were still far from the core region. To traverse the vast inner region would take at least ten to twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Having a companion for that period wasn't too bad.</p><p></p><p>Once they entered the core region and faced that summoning feeling, Lin Yuan could find some excuse to part ways with Xiran.</p><p></p><p>Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, a joyful expression appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"What a great harvest!" Lin Yuan's mind descended into the depths of his consciousness, gazing at the new world coordinate imprint below the nine others on the Door to All Realms, a smile forming.</p><p></p><p>This time entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan's goal was that "summoning feeling."</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he gained an additional boon by acquiring a world coordinate from another dimension!</p><p></p><p>For any expert, a world coordinate from another dimension was useless, even for the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>Without a way to break through dimensional barriers, a mere world coordinate was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. With the Door to All Realms, he could easily descend upon any world, no matter how many dimensions or planes separated them.</p><p></p><p>Something even the most powerful couldn't do, Lin Yuan only needed to expend a strand of Realm-Breaching Primal Chaos Force.</p><p></p><p>Of course, one strand could only allow Lin Yuan to randomly traverse worlds. As his strength grew, the downsides of random traversal would increase as well.</p><p></p><p>Because his current strength was low, there was still much room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>But worlds at the 5th, 6th, 8th or 9th ranks that could aid Lin Yuan would become fewer and fewer.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely why on his 8th traversal, Lin Yuan chose to go to the "Spirit Realm" directly, instead of randomly traversing again.</p><p></p><p>If it was like his 7th traversal...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Descending to a low-level martial world, unable to even recover to the sixth realm or manifest a physical divine ability, wouldn't that be a waste of the power to break through realms?</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what level the world connected to these coordinates is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the world coordinates at the bottom of the Realm Gate. </p><p></p><p>He had high expectations for the world behind these coordinates. The master of that opportune place in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was a follower of that great "Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>To become a follower of such a supreme expert, how weak could they be?</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be inferred that the homeland of the master of that opportune place could not be too low-level.</p><p></p><p>If too low-level, they would probably be crushed into dust by the aura inside before even crossing the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split off a strand of his mind, following the world coordinates across dimensions to descend beside a vast world.</p><p></p><p>"This world..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed. At this moment, his perspective was that of the Realm Gate, allowing him to see many things invisible to himself.</p><p></p><p>Last time he traveled, when observing the Spirit Realm, he saw the "Immortal Realm" above it.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that the Immortal Realm and Spirit Realm do not exist in the same spatial layer - only the ninth heaven of the Spirit Realm connects to the space where the Immortal Realm resides.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, that strand of Lin Yuan's mind dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"The time flow rate of this world compared to the main world is probably around 1 to 200 or 300?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly. Through the time flow rate, he deduced that this world's level should be far higher than the Spirit Realm, whose time flowed at a 1 to 500 rate compared to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Although using just the time flow rate to determine a world's strength was somewhat rash, it could largely reflect the world's depth.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, that world seems somewhat special," Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>"For the ninth traversal, I can prioritize descending to this world." Lin Yuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the "Dao Ancestor," Lin Yuan didn't know if there were any other great ancestral figures of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The level of the Immortal Realm was a bit too high for Lin Yuan currently. If he crossed into the tenth or eleventh realms in the future, Lin Yuan would consider descending there.</p><p></p><p>But for now at the ninth realm, this newly discovered world was more satisfactory to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Feathered Race's domain, on a massive planet, the strongest ninth-realm life of the Celestial Feathered Race, "Hunyi," opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Just where in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is that Galactic Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>Hunyi frowned slightly. After learning the Galactic Sovereign had also entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he immediately began searching for his trail.</p><p></p><p>In the B0001 battlefield, the Galactic Sovereign slaughtered those invincible eighth-realm experts of the Celestial Feathered Race like chickens, an insult that enraged countless powerful Celestial Feathered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Hunyi was no exception.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, the Galactic Sovereign resided within the human domain, under the watchful eyes of those supreme experts. Hunyi had no opportunity to take action against him.</p><p></p><p>Even if the human civilization was willing to let the Galactic Sovereign participate in major cross-racial battlefields in the future, they would undoubtedly prepare many safeguards and contingencies for him.</p><p></p><p>Hunyi similarly had no confidence in being able to deal with the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>But in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Hunyi didn't believe he would still be unable to handle the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"There are powerful experts who witnessed the Galactic Sovereign clashing with the Wanderer Madu?"</p><p></p><p>Hunyi immediately began contacting the Wanderer Madu.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Feathered Race had a good relationship with that "Ancient God" elder patriarch of the Wanderers, and several Celestial Sovereigns were close friends with him.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Wanderer Madu's illusory form appeared before Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>"Madu."</p><p></p><p>Hunyi looked at Wanderer Madu. "I heard you clashed with the Galactic Sovereign before?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, some time ago I had an encounter with the Galactic Sovereign over a treasure," Madu did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>Hunyi continued asking. Madu had directly clashed with the Galactic Sovereign, generating a massive karmic connection between them. By tracing this connection, he could roughly lock onto the other party's location range.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this kind of lock required comparable realms of power.</p><p></p><p>If those eighth-realm Celestial Feathered experts killed by Lin Yuan tried to lock onto a ninth-realm karmic connection at the eighth realm, not only would they fail, they would suffer a karmic backlash.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Madu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, as long as you tell me the Galactic Sovereign's general location range, I, Hunyi, will certainly reward you greatly," Hunyi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Hunyi, it's not that I don't want to tell you."</p><p></p><p>"It's that I truly don't know. That Galactic Sovereign is also highly skilled in karmic rules. I cannot lock onto him," Madu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"More skilled in karmic rules than you?" Hunyi's tone was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Madu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then never mind," Hunyi didn't doubt him.</p><p></p><p>After cutting off the connection with Madu, Hunyi let out a slight sigh of relief in another part of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Is it really okay for us to deceive Hunyi like this?"</p><p></p><p>Madu looked towards the side, where an even more enormous figure sat.</p><p></p><p>It was Madu's "Ancient God" elder patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt Lin Yuan's talent was too terrifying, even if he revealed information about Hunyi, Madu still didn't feel at ease in his heart and needed his elder patriarch's counsel.</p><p></p><p>Just then, when Hunyi contacted him, Madu was still considering whether to agree to tell Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>After all, Hunyi came from the Celestial Feathered Race and was currently their strongest ninth-realm life, potentially becoming a Celestial Sovereign in the future.</p><p></p><p>But before Madu could decide, the Ancient God elder patriarch beside him signaled for him not to reveal the Galactic Sovereign's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Deceive? What do you mean deceive?" </p><p></p><p>The Ancient God elder glared at Madu. "What has your elder patriarch relied on while walking the universe for so long?"</p><p></p><p>"Discernment!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's expression was solemn. "If the Galactic Sovereign's strength is truly as you described, then his talent and aptitude must exceed even the rumors. He only just crossed into the ninth realm, yet already has the power to force you back?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just Hunyi..."</p><p></p><p>Madu still seemed somewhat worried. He had used the excuse that the Galactic Sovereign was also skilled in karmic rules to refuse Hunyi. This could easily be verified if another ninth-realm expert skilled in karmic rules appeared and clashed with the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Then by tracing the karmic connection, they could confirm whether the Galactic Sovereign truly excelled at karmic rules.</p><p></p><p>Madu was worried that if Hunyi discovered he had just been putting him off...</p><p></p><p>"Just what?" The Ancient God elder rolled his eyes. "At most, that Hunyi will cross into the tenth realm. But the Galactic Sovereign will likely reach the eleventh realm, and given how much importance the human civilization places on him, he may even have a chance at that final step."</p><p></p><p>"If you offend Hunyi, your elder patriarch can still protect you." The elder glanced at Madu. "But if you offend the Galactic Sovereign, your elder patriarch may end up implicated as well in the future."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

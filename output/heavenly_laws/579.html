        <h1>Chapter 579</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the high skies of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Rego looked at the primal thunder he had unleashed with a charged attack, only to see it easily pierced and shredded by the vast hand extended by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His gaze briefly fell into a daze.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Venerable Rego was quite confident in his primal thunder. This primal thunder was a lethal move he had nurtured and condensed over a million years.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the purpose of leaving a good impression on the Sovereign of Spiritual Might and wanting to break through the defensive line as quickly as possible, Venerable Rego would not have used it at all.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not use the primal thunder against Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also a Venerable, and he had concealed his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan, that Class-Epsilon Warbot was clearly much easier to deal with.</p><p></p><p>The Class-Epsilon Warbot could accommodate thousands of Overlord-realm experts, and a single strike from it could indeed threaten Venerable-realm experts.</p><p></p><p>But a Warbot, after all, is just a Warbot, far less agile than a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of a Venerable, the Warbot appears rigid. If there is no external force, and a Venerable fights against a Warbot of the same level, the Venerable will definitely be the victor.</p><p></p><p>The greatest use of a Warbot is on the battlefield, working together with other Warbots and the Venerable-realm experts on their side.</p><p></p><p>So, after careful consideration, Venerable Rego chose to attack the Class-Epsilon Warbot.</p><p></p><p>This was the safest option.</p><p></p><p>What Venerable Rego never expected was that his primal thunder, which he had poured his full strength into, was like thin paper in front of Lin Yuan, and was directly shredded and pierced.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first thought that crossed Venerable Rego's mind - he simply could not believe it.</p><p></p><p>To be able to tear apart his primal thunder so easily, even if it was not a peak Venerable, it could not be too far off.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Silver River? </p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Venerable of the Silver River a newly ascended Venerable from over a thousand years ago? But immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Rego realized that the intelligence he had obtained must have been problematic.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Venerable of the Silver River was a newly ascended Venerable came entirely from the mouth of the Marquis of Azure Flame, and there was no concrete evidence to prove that the Venerable of the Silver River had only broken through a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"That Venerable Rego has no shame."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Class-Epsilon Warbot, the one-horned man 'Luo Peng' also felt the terrifying thunder that was enveloping everything.</p><p></p><p>Although it had not yet approached him, the one-horned man 'Luo Peng' instinctively felt the fear seeping through the spatial thunder.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the protection of the Warbot, he might not even be able to withstand the aura emanating from the thunder.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to block."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the one-horned man 'Luo Peng' inwardly concluded that the Class-Epsilon Warbot itself might not be completely destroyed under the thunder.</p><p></p><p>But the thousands of Overlord-realm experts inside the Warbot, even just a trace of the thunder force, could easily annihilate a large number of Overlord-realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Losing a large number of Overlord-realm experts would render the Warbot like water without roots, unable to play any significant role.</p><p></p><p>And the permeating thunder might even cause the Warbot itself to 'self-destruct'.</p><p></p><p>"Try to resist as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>The one-horned man 'Luo Peng' was filled with despair, but he still did not give up. At least he could occupy some of Venerable Rego's attention, buying some time for the Venerable of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The one-horned man 'Luo Peng' witnessed an unforgettable sight.</p><p></p><p>He saw a vast hand reach in through the boundless and terrifying thunder, and the mighty thunder, which could shake the heavens, appeared utterly weak and unable to even slightly obstruct or delay it.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! After the vast hand entered, it directly scooped up the massive Class-Epsilon Warbot and held it in its palm, shielding it.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable of the Silver River has intervened?"</p><p></p><p>The one-horned man 'Luo Peng' was a bit dazed. From the aura emanating from that vast hand, he could tell it was the Venerable of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>But the Venerable of the Silver River was this strong? Although the one-horned man 'Luo Peng' was only at the peak of the Overlord realm, his position as one of the operators of the Class-Epsilon Warbot meant his status was not ordinary, and he was well aware that even among Venerables, there were differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>Yet the strength of the Venerable of the Silver River seemed excessively powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The Warbot is fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Class-Epsilon Warbot. The profound mystery markings contained within this Warbot were something he had not yet fully comprehended.</p><p></p><p>If it were to be destroyed by Venerable Rego's hand, Lin Yuan could not guarantee that he would be able to obtain a new Class-Epsilon Warbot.</p><p></p><p>And these Warbots were Lin Yuan's hope for reaching the Chaotic Second Realm peak, or even the Third Realm, in the shortest time.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I just wanted to muddle through, as long as I could defend this defensive line, everyone would be safe, mainly depending on the situation at the core battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>Currently, his true strength was approaching that of a peak Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But he had not reached the level to influence or change the tide of the war, so this time when facing Venerable Rego's assault, he only wanted to defend.</p><p></p><p>As for defeating him?</p><p></p><p>Even if he defeated Venerable Rego, what would it change? Lord Qingsan's strategy was to focus on defense, and even if they broke through, it would not significantly impact the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>But Venerable Rego was determined to go all out, with the attitude of risking life and death for the Purple Dream Domain, even planning to destroy the Warbots on the Azure Flame Domain side first.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed this, so he could only reveal his true strength.</p><p></p><p>In the previous situation, if he did not reveal his true strength, it would have been difficult to save the Warbot.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan could bear to watch the Warbot be destroyed, losing a Class-Epsilon Warbot would undoubtedly put the Azure Flame Domain in a disadvantageous position.</p><p></p><p>In order to defend the defensive line, Lin Yuan had to reveal his strength.</p><p></p><p>As for abandoning the defensive line area? That would be letting down Lord Qingsan.</p><p></p><p>"But merely being close to the peak Venerable realm is not that conspicuous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself: "As long as I don't activate the divine ability 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens', it won't be considered a big deal."</p><p></p><p>True Venerable-realm experts or veteran Venerables were indeed extremely rare, but if one looked at a large domain or even dozens of domains, there were still a few.</p><p></p><p>For example, in this war, the number of peak Venerables on both sides exceeded ten, and these were the ones openly known, with other hidden trump cards and backup plans.</p><p></p><p>But the divine ability 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens'? This technique with a connection to the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, its significance was even greater than that of a Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan were to activate 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens', there were only two possibilities:</p><p></p><p>One, he would be taken away and protected.</p><p>Two, he would be taken away and controlled.</p><p></p><p>During this process, he might also face assassination attempts from other ancient power factions.</p><p></p><p>There was no third possibility.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining his current peaceful life would be essentially unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>It might even draw the attention of the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>The risks were too great, the variables too many. If Lin Yuan wasn't careful, he might be forced to return.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've revealed my true strength,"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the wary Venerable Rego with a slightly cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable of the Silver River, just what is your true strength?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Venerable Rego had also regained his composure. As a Venerable-realm expert, despite facing this unexpected situation, he was still able to think clearly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this unbelievable scene, he did not lose his composure. "What power do I have?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and lightly pressed it, "Just try it for yourself and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Terrifying scarlet filled the heavens and the earth, and a world filled with scorching suns formed around Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Divine Body?" </p><p></p><p>Elder Leige's expression became grave, and strands of thunderbolts constantly surged around his body.</p><p></p><p>As the undisputed number one physique of the ancient Blazing Sun Country, the might of the Blazing Sun Divine Body was unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet flames burned furiously, even consuming the space-time as fuel. Elder Leige's expression looked unsightly, as he could feel the chaotic thunder he commanded being rapidly burned away.</p><p></p><p>"This Grand Monarch of the Galaxy truly has the strength close to a peak Monarch."</p><p></p><p>After this encounter, Elder Leige no longer had any doubts. </p><p></p><p>Just now, he had speculated that Lin Yuan might have relied on some kind of one-time trump card to easily tear through his primal thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, at most he would just feel uncomfortable, and even if he couldn't break into the Azure Blazing Realm, he could at least maintain the stalemate on the surface.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems...</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy was simply beyond his ability to contend with.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Leige no longer hesitated and decisively retreated backwards. </p><p></p><p>With his strength, facing a veteran Monarch close to the peak, not to mention contending, he couldn't even hold him back.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to stay, by the time the Blazing Sun World was fully formed, he might be completely trapped.</p><p></p><p>Although Elder Leige had laid down some life-saving measures in other places and wouldn't die completely, if his true body was defeated here, it would still be a heavy loss.</p><p></p><p>And he would also be mocked by other Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>"I originally planned to make a good impression in front of the Spiritual Might King."</p><p></p><p>Elder Leige sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy far exceeded his expectations, his defeat was not undeserved, but he definitely wouldn't leave a good impression with the Spiritual Might King.</p><p></p><p>Below, the countless war machines of the Purple Dream Realm were fiercely clashing with the war machines of the Azure Blazing Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the commanders of the Purple Dream Realm's war machines received an order.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat all forces."</p><p></p><p>This order left many war machine commanders perplexed, as they were fighting fiercely and had not shown any signs of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Why retreat? But on the battlefield, obedience is instinctive, and despite their incomprehension, the war machines of the Purple Dream Realm immediately began to withdraw after receiving the order.</p><p></p><p>"They're fleeing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the retreating Elder Leige, who was rapidly disappearing into the void.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had fully unleashed the Blazing Sun Divine Body and the Blazing Sun World naturally formed around it to suppress, he still couldn't completely block Elder Leige's void traversal.</p><p></p><p>"The war machines are also starting to withdraw?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the battlefield below, and the countless war machines belonging to the Purple Dream Realm were also beginning to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun World formed by Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun Divine Body then covered the area, causing all the war machines of the Purple Dream Realm to be "overturned" and suppressed in place.</p><p></p><p>"These war machines..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze became slightly heated. The chaotic inscriptions contained in the war machines of the Purple Dream Realm were completely different from the ones on his side.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could capture these war machines and continue to study them, it would also bring him great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't capture them, destroying the local war machines could still earn him a lot of merit.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qiaoson King had specially taken out one of his own treasuries to motivate many Monarch-level experts, and the many treasures inside could be exchanged for the merits earned on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is there such a violent spatial disturbance in the edge defense area?"</p><p></p><p>On the core defense battlefield, the peak Monarchs confronting and fighting each other unanimously turned their gaze towards the edge defense area. Just now, the spatial disturbance generated by the battle there exceeded the normal range of a Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"How can the strength of the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Leige actually turned and fled?"</p><p></p><p>"This Grand Monarch of the Galaxy should have the strength of a veteran Monarch, close to that of a peak Monarch."</p><p></p><p>"Why was he assigned to guard the edge defense area?"</p><p></p><p>The peak Monarchs on the Purple Dream Realm side had their expressions change slightly.</p><p></p><p>A veteran Monarch with strength close to a peak Monarch, although unable to influence or change the overall war situation, was still enough to bring them a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingfeng, you've hidden the strength of your disciple from us quite well."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the silence on the Purple Dream Realm side, the Azure Blazing Realm was much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength exceeded expectations, and on the Azure Blazing Realm side, it added another chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Elder Leige had fled in a hurry, which had also dealt a blow to the morale of the Purple Dream Realm side.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Azure Blazing Marquis also had a smile on his face. He had originally been worried that Lin Yuan's strength was not enough, which was why he had specially arranged for him to guard the edge defense area.</p><p></p><p>The edge defense area had low strategic importance, and the Monarchs who came to attack would not be very strong.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, he had completely underestimated this disciple of his.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King was also paying attention to the battlefield and had noticed the encounter between the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy and Elder Leige.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The Spiritual Might King's eyes narrowed slightly. "This Grand Monarch's strength is indeed not weak."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King had a certain impression of Lin Yuan. If it weren't for Lin Yuan, the Azure Blazing Realm should have already been conquered by his side.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King's gaze was profound as he distantly observed Lin Yuan, then no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Although Elder Leige's hasty retreat made the Spiritual Might King slightly dissatisfied, he was also clear that the key factor determining the outcome of the war was on the core defense battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As for the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy? He couldn't change the situation of the war.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention just being close to a peak Monarch, even if he was a peak Monarch, it would be difficult for him to change the direction of the war.</p><p></p><p>Although the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy was currently unstoppable in his own defense area, it was because that was the strategically unimportant edge defense area.</p><p></p><p>If the Grand Monarch of the Galaxy was in the core defense area, facing Monarchs not weaker than him, or even stronger than him, he would be lucky to just barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>"Qiaosong, I want to see what you can use to block me."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King focused on the core defense battlefield, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>At this stage of the war, both sides were still in the phase of mutual exploration, so the fighting was not too cruel, and they had not yet deployed the decisive trump cards and hidden techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the Seventh Defense Line area, Lin Yuan successfully suppressed all the war machines of the Purple Dream Realm, his expression slightly surprised as he looked down at the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 454 Bao Ying's (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Yuzu clan originated from the primordial Yuzhou clan of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzhou clan is the oldest and most mysterious clan.</p><p></p><p>The vast universe, grand through the ages.</p><p></p><p>The only clan that can be ranked alongside the prosperous Yuzhou clan is the suspected Jie clan from the previous universal era.</p><p></p><p>However, the Jie clan was targeted and suppressed by the will of the universe, resulting in an irreparable shortage in their clan population.</p><p></p><p>The 84th treasure in the Yuzu clan's treasury, even when placed among the Yuzhou clan at the height of their power, would still rank among the top hundred precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>In terms of preciousness, it surpasses even the most formidable common weapons.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether it was the previous Yuzhou clan or the current Yuzu clan, the ultimate weapons they have collected number far more than a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fan Gaomo arrived at the Yuzu clan's treasury.</p><p></p><p>"I am here on the order of the 'Emperor' to take the 84th treasure," said Fan Gaomo as he stood before the treasury.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzu clan's treasury is constantly guarded, and even the arrival of a 12th Realm Ultimate being would not allow for the forceful seizure and departure of the treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Permission granted, the 84th treasure is a remnant from the previous universal era, use it with care," a voice came from within the treasury.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, once the universe enters its final stage and completes the full universal cycle, all the laws and principles will collapse.</p><p></p><p>Even if one is a 12th Realm Ultimate, if they do not choose to enter the chaotic void space and remain in the universe, they will ultimately perish in the end.</p><p></p><p>The Jie clan's ability to endure through the previous universal era is an exceptional case, and this is the clan's greatest secret.</p><p></p><p>However, for life forms, it is fundamentally impossible to traverse between two universal eras.</p><p></p><p>But for treasures, especially certain special ones, it is possible for them to carry over from the previous universal era into the next.</p><p></p><p>For treasures without a distinct consciousness, as long as they can withstand the crushing forces of the universe's destruction and collapse, they can survive.</p><p></p><p>But for life forms, they must face the penetration at the level of the soul and the will of the mind.</p><p></p><p>As the earliest born clan, the Yuzhou clan was the first to scavenge the universe, and many of the treasures that remained from the previous universal era have fallen into the hands of the Yuzu clan.</p><p></p><p>Later, the Yuzhou clan split into the Yuzu clan and the Zhouzu clan, with each inheriting a portion of the original Yuzhou clan's legacy.</p><p></p><p>The 84th treasure is one of them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a golden "Balance Scale" appeared before Fan Gaomo.</p><p></p><p>"The Balance Scale!"</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's spirit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Galaxy Master, he probably wouldn't have had the chance to come into contact with this precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Balance Scale's effect is quite simple - "equivalent exchange."</p><p></p><p>As long as something is placed on one end of the scale, it can forcibly exchange the corresponding item of the enemy within a certain time.</p><p></p><p>For example, if one places their main combat weapon on the scale and locks onto the enemy, the enemy's main combat weapon will disappear for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Or it can seal a portion of the enemy's power for a time.</p><p></p><p>The "something" here is not limited to physical objects, but also includes many conceptual things.</p><p></p><p>Such as lifespan?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Balance Scale can only be used between opponents of the same realm, and there will be "consumption" during the exchange period.</p><p></p><p>If one invests their own ten-thousand-year lifespan into the scale, they may only be able to exchange the enemy's lifespan for a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And the item invested by the user will be permanently lost, while the part exchanged from the enemy will only be restricted for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>It may seem a bit unfair.</p><p></p><p>But one must know that the initiative of using the Balance Scale lies in one's own hands, and it can create fatal flaws for the enemy at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>Even a 12th Realm Ultimate being, if forcibly exchanged by the Balance Scale, will lose the corresponding part of their abilities for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>"What do you plan to exchange from the Galaxy Master's abilities?" the voice from the treasury asked, as the guardian was naturally aware of the purpose behind Fan Gaomo taking the 84th treasure, given the massive impact of the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"What abilities?" Fan Gaomo fell into deep thought. The Balance Scale is truly extraordinary, but it must be used appropriately.</p><p></p><p>"Exchange his lifespan?" the treasury guardian inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Lifespan?" </p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"It's not worth it."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo immediately shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If the Galaxy Master was still at the 9th or 10th Realm, this method might be worth a try.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Galaxy Master has already reached the 11th Realm, theoretically without any lifespan limitations. How much lifespan would Fan Gaomo need to invest to reduce the Galaxy Master's lifespan to a critical point?</p><p></p><p>And even if the lifespan is reduced to a critical point, it wouldn't have much impact on the Galaxy Master's actual strength.</p><p></p><p>The key is that the lifespan exchanged from the enemy is only temporary, and will eventually be restored.</p><p></p><p>"Then is it the ultimate foundation in the Galaxy Master's possession?" the treasury guardian continued.</p><p></p><p>"Ultimate foundation?" Fan Gaomo immediately shook his head.</p><p></p><p>To exchange the Galaxy Master's ultimate foundation, he would have to sacrifice one of the Yuzu clan's own ultimate foundations, which is a permanent loss. Fan Gaomo naturally did not want to bear this cost, nor did he have the right to do so, as the Yuzu clan's emperor would not allow it.</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Fan Gaomo solemnly said, "I want to exchange the Galaxy Master's life essence."</p><p></p><p>"A good idea," the treasury guardian nodded, seemingly quite agreeing with it.</p><p></p><p>The life essence is the most fundamental manifestation of life. The size of one's body over the long river of time corresponds to the level of one's life essence.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo did not want to pay the price of one of his clan's ultimate foundations to seal the Galaxy Master's ultimate foundation. </p><p></p><p>But he could completely deprive the Galaxy Master of the ability to activate that ultimate foundation.</p><p></p><p>It's just like a powerful heat weapon that can crush the low-level feudal civilizations on a barbaric planet, but if you lose the strength to pull the trigger, the heat weapon becomes useless.</p><p></p><p>The life essence is the same.</p><p></p><p>Activating an ultimate foundation that far exceeds one's own limits must place extremely harsh demands on the life essence.</p><p></p><p>Once the Galaxy Master's life essence plummets, or even just declines a bit, he would no longer be able to continue activating that ultimate foundation.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the opportunity would come for the peak clan forces' strongest 11th Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the life essence will affect various aspects, and the Galaxy Master's own strength will also decline accordingly.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master, you are indeed quite remarkable to have forced my clan to use this precious treasure," Fan Gaomo thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Yuzu clan had used the Balance Scale a few times, but they were always against 12th Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>And throughout history, those foreign 12th Realm Ultimates never truly understood the true power of the Balance Scale.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Fan Gaomo put away the Balance Scale and headed out of the treasury.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would need to negotiate with other peak clan forces.</p><p></p><p>Since the Yuzu clan has brought out the Balance Scale, those peak clan forces must also pay a price.</p><p></p><p>It can't be that the Yuzu clan alone bears the burden.</p><p></p><p>At the super-large-scale battlefield, in the central position, the Victory Altar.</p><p></p><p>Many human civilization progressors guarded the altar, casually chatting.</p><p></p><p>"How relaxing," someone said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, in the past on the major battlefields, even if we the human civilization occupied the altar of victory, we had to pay great effort to face the counterattacks and offensives from other races."</p><p></p><p>"But now, it's been two or three years already, those peak force factions not only dare not counterattack, they don't even dare to approach."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, isn't it because the Galactic Overlord stepped in and completely wiped out the Eleventh-Tier experts of those peak force factions? Even if they want to counterattack, they need Eleventh-Tier experts to do so."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, without their avatars, for them to re-condense them is not an easy task. At least in the short term, we don't have to worry about those peak force factions counterattacking."</p><p></p><p>"I think even if those Eleventh-Tier experts re-condense their avatars, they won't dare to come. Who would dare to try again against the invincible might of the Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh-Tier experts of the many human civilization alliances all felt that their garrison duty was very easy. At this time in the past, they would have to face the endless attacks and probing from the alien races.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as the Calamity Tribe, after occupying the altar of victory, there were still occasions where they had to retreat under pressure.</p><p></p><p>However, now the Eleventh-Tier experts of the human civilization alliance are living a very comfortable life, the crisis-filled super-large battlefield is almost like a vacation.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think those peak force factions feel that resisting the Galactic Overlord is hopeless, so they simply give up the dominance of this battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>"Very likely, the Galactic Overlord's strength is too powerful. Fortunately, the Galactic Overlord is an evolver of our human civilization. If it was the experts of other peak force factions, that would be utterly hopeless."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the Galactic Overlord will assault the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Galactic Overlord is not even a thousand years old yet. At my age, I haven't even heard of small-scale battlefields."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh-Tier experts of the human civilization alliance sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the altar of victory.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"The experts of the human civilization alliance have become slightly lax recently." Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and he took control of every detail within the altar.</p><p></p><p>"I will immediately remind them." Xuanyuan You respectfully stood by the side and said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what advantages are gained, this is a battlefield. One must never be lax at any time." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You softly said. </p><p></p><p>In fact, he couldn't help but think that it was because the Galactic Overlord had achieved such great and brilliant battle results. Whoever faced the current situation would become lax.</p><p></p><p>Those Eleventh-Tier experts of the peak force factions, in the face of the Galactic Overlord, were like vast swaths of dust falling, who wouldn't feel a sense of ease in their hearts?</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go and remind them now."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You respectfully withdrew, leaving only Lin Yuan sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when the counterattack of the peak force factions will come? And what trump card will they use?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert Xia Qin believed that the Eleven Major Peak Force Factions absolutely would not sit and watch the human civilization gain the first dominance of the battlefield. </p><p></p><p>This was not just about the issue of dominance, but the ownership of hundreds of supreme divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Eleven Major Peak Force Factions could not accept the sudden loss of tens or even hundreds of supreme divine weapons from their own side.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also agreed with this conclusion, so he had long ago transferred all the supreme divine weapons and treasures to the Mysterious Yellow Realm, waiting for the experts of the Eleven Major Peak Force Factions to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In a desolate star domain.</p><p></p><p>More than ten massive wills descended here, which were the strongest Eleventh-Tier experts of the various peak force factions, such as Fan Gaomo and Tian Yu Meng.</p><p></p><p>On the super-large battlefield, these strongest Eleventh-Tier experts, relying on the tribal weapons, were hiding in a corner, trembling in fear of the Galactic Overlord finding them.</p><p></p><p>So to communicate and exchange with each other, they could only choose the starry sky of the universe, where there was no threat from the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"How are you all preparing?" </p><p></p><p>"How to deal with the Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng spoke first, the situation on the super-large battlefield had made the ancestors of the Tian Yu Tribe extremely angry, but they were helpless.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord is not easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we mobilize the ultimate foundation of our tribe, we may not have a hundred percent chance of defeating him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and mobilizing the ultimate foundation will also be an enormous pressure on us, we won't be able to sustain it for long."</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh-Tier experts quickly exchanged, all waiting for the other side's trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo did not want to continue beating around the bush, and directly said: "Our tribe is willing to bring out the precious treasure 'Balance Scale', which can greatly weaken the life essence of the Galactic Overlord, making it unable to continue mobilizing that ultimate foundation."</p><p></p><p>These words caused the entire audience to be shocked.</p><p></p><p>Most of them had never even heard of the precious treasure 'Balance Scale', but the ability to greatly weaken the life essence of the Galactic Overlord was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Balance Scale?" </p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh-Tier expert of the Calamity Tribe's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had heard about this treasure from the strongest experts of his tribe, it was said to be incredibly incredible, containing the balance Dao from the chaotic void within.</p><p></p><p>"How much can it weaken the life essence?" Tian Yu Meng immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"It depends on how many Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts you all can contribute." Fan Gaomo spoke.</p><p></p><p>To weaken the life essence of the Galactic Overlord, they first had to contribute the life essence of their own Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts.</p><p></p><p>Since the life essence contributed by the latter was a permanent loss, they certainly couldn't just take the life essence of a single Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert.</p><p></p><p>According to Fan Gaomo's estimate, if an Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert contributed one-tenth of their life essence, the impact on themselves would not be too great.</p><p></p><p>If ten Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts each contributed one-tenth of their life essence, it would be equivalent to the full life essence of one Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo planned to have the other ten peak force factions gather a hundred Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts. In this way, the contributed life essence would be ten times the full life essence of an Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert.</p><p></p><p>Even with some loss during the exchange process, the impact on the Galactic Overlord would at least be four to five times the full life essence of an Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert.</p><p></p><p>Then, even if the Galactic Overlord's strength was powerful and their life essence was robust, they were ultimately only at the Eleventh-Tier level, and a weak human at that. After being impacted by four to five times the full life essence of an Eleventh-Tier Perfected expert, not to mention completely losing the ability to resist, their strength would at least be greatly reduced, unable to mobilize that ultimate foundation.</p><p></p><p>"How many Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts?" </p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh-Tier experts of the ten peak force factions had a slightly hesitant expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Life essence was no joke, especially the life essence of Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts. Eleventh-Tier Perfected experts were the hopes of the peak force factions to assault the ultimate, rashly losing one-tenth of their life essence, who could endure it?</p><p></p><p>"Fan Gaomo, are you sure this can really deal with the Galactic Overlord?" </p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng thought for a moment and softly asked.</p><p></p><p>If they could successfully deal with the Galactic Overlord and retrieve the supreme divine weapons of the various factions, then this loss would be bearable.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry." </p><p></p><p>"I guarantee it can deal with him." </p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo spoke with confidence.</p>

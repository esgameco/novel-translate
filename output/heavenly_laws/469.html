        <h1>Chapter 469</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 469 Immortal Source (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>It is not entirely accurate to say that it took five hundred years for Lin Yuan to comprehend this divine imprint.</p><p></p><p>It should be four hundred and ninety years, and Lin Yuan did not devote his full effort to the comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Apart from comprehending the rules of time and space, perfecting the Eleven Stages of the Martial Dao, and many other aspects, the true mental and spiritual energy he devoted to comprehending this divine imprint was only about one-fiftieth.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it still shows the extraordinary nature of this divine imprint. Given Lin Yuan's transcendent comprehension abilities, even with only one-fiftieth of his effort, it still took him close to five hundred years to fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Technique: Rend the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the swirling energy between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>The sixth Flesh Body Divine Technique, named "Rend the Heavens", is a pure and extreme offensive divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fifth Flesh Body Divine Technique, named "The World", is also an offensive divine technique, but it also has a suppressive effect. Within the area covered by the external world, all enemies will be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique? It has only one effect - to rend and shatter everything.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure individual killing power, the might of the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique surpasses even the "The World".</p><p></p><p>After all, the offensive power of the "The World" divine technique, even its ultimate self-detonation strike, is still targeted at a group area.</p><p></p><p>While the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique, it is aimed at a single point or line, with the ultimate destructive power, which even makes Lin Yuan feel a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan awakened this Flesh Body Divine Technique, he has not fully utilized it, fearing that the scale of destruction it could cause might attract the attention of the Immortal Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"If measured by the standard of the main world's combat power, the limit of this divine technique's power should be between four hundred thousand to five hundred thousand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the measurement standard here, the Perfected Eleventh Stage, is the basic unit, which is one.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan stepped into the Eleventh Stage, his combat power limit is also ten thousand. Subsequent growth in strength can reach tens of thousands at most.</p><p></p><p>The self-detonation of the external world can unleash a momentary power of around three hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>And the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique, directly unleashing four to five hundred thousand combat power? The ultimate threshold of the Twelfth Stage is a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>"Too extreme." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to observe the essence of the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique. The previous five Flesh Body Divine Techniques all empowered various aspects, but "Rend the Heavens" has only destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, in the short term, I can only unleash one strike of 'Rend the Heavens'." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This is also very normal. The "Rend the Heavens" divine technique grants Lin Yuan a strike far exceeding his own strength, if he could use it freely, Lin Yuan would be afraid.</p><p></p><p>The three great protective secret techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage, the perfected level of the "Xuanhuang Single Strike", can only maintain Lin Yuan's combat power at six times his own, and it is based on a huge consumption.</p><p></p><p>And the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique? Not just sixty times or six hundred times the combat power explosion.</p><p></p><p>From three hundred thousand combat power to four to five hundred thousand, it may seem like less than a doubling, but the gap in between is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Pity, the 'Rend the Heavens' divine technique cannot be combined with the 'The World' divine technique," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>These two divine techniques both belong to the offensive type and cannot be fused together.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan is already very satisfied. After all, whether it's the "The World" divine technique or the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique, their power is not fixed, but depends on Lin Yuan's own strength.</p><p></p><p>The "The World" divine technique depends on Lin Yuan's internal world, while the "Rend the Heavens" divine technique depends on Lin Yuan's life essence.</p><p></p><p>They will increase in power as Lin Yuan grows stronger.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Immortal Transcendence Pavilion visited again.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Yunzhen, have you summoned me because the Nine Revolutions Elixir has been successfully refined?" The Pavilion Master laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Lin Yuan successfully refines the Nine Revolutions Elixir, it will cause celestial anomalies, with dense storm clouds gathering. The Pavilion Master can thus infer the quality of the refined Nine Revolutions Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"I have not failed the task."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan extended his right hand, and a blue gourd appeared in front of the Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master carefully opened the gourd and poured out a golden immortal pill, examining it closely for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"This Nine Revolutions Elixir is definitely the highest quality I have ever seen among all the Nine Revolutions Elixirs." The Pavilion Master was extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He had intentionally offered a half-sale, half-gift arrangement, using three types of immortal sources as remuneration, just to assess Master Yunzhen's alchemy skills, not as simple as it appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems the Pavilion Master's gamble paid off, as this highest quality Nine Revolutions Elixir alone is enough to demonstrate Lin Yuan's alchemy mastery, surpassing even the great alchemists.</p><p></p><p>"The fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs are all inside, I hope the Pavilion Master can count them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The blue gourd contained the fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs that were part of the transaction with the Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>In this batch of refinement, Lin Yuan had successfully refined a total of one hundred and thirty-two elixirs. Apart from these fifty, Lin Yuan had secretly taken eighty-two Nine Revolutions Elixirs for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Yunzhen directly handed over all the Nine Revolutions Elixirs to me, isn't he afraid I'll just leave?" The Pavilion Master's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs would be enough to drive ordinary Jade Immortals mad. Even the Sect Leader of the Azure Dragon Sect...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The jade immortals of that level would likely take a risk for this. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention the fifty nine-cycle elixirs in the gourd, which are all of extremely high quality, equivalent to seventy or eighty ordinary nine-cycle elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"I believe in the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Lin Yuan did not believe in the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace, but in himself.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace wants to take the fifty nine-cycle immortal elixirs from the green gourd with bare hands? Does he really think this Grade-A immortal abode can just be taken away?</p><p></p><p>As the top expert among the jade immortals, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace can also control part of the killing formations of the Immortal City of Cangwu. </p><p></p><p>His strength is enough to sweep away most jade immortals, but against Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>So far in this immortal world, there are only two who can make Lin Yuan wary.</p><p></p><p>One is the Progenitor of the Dao.</p><p>The other is the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable Master Yunzhen, for your trust."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace was in a good mood, not knowing that if he dared to turn and leave, it would be a certain death that even the Dao Ancestor could not save him from.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace thought that Lin Yuan truly trusted him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Three Immortal Origins."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace flipped his hand and took out a black wooden box, which floated in the air and came before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>The moment the wooden box appeared, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed a mysterious aura, as if it was the source of everything, the beginning of all things.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan caught the box, about to open it.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master Yunzhen, don't open it for now," the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace hurriedly reminded. "Once each Immortal Origin is exposed, it will start to dissipate. It's best for Venerable Master Yunzhen to wait until you formally use the Immortal Origin before opening the box, otherwise it will be wasted."</p><p></p><p>Immortal Origins come from the source land of the immortal world. Once they leave the source land, they will irreversibly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The wooden box can help the Immortal Origins isolate the inside from the outside, preventing them from dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded. Although he had the memories of Yunzhen, he was not very familiar with such rare and precious Immortal Origins.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace asked Lin Yuan to refine several immortal elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally agreed, as it was not for free - the Immortal City of Cangwu would pay Lin Yuan a satisfactory reward.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Immortal City's huge demand for immortal elixirs due to the Immortal-Demon War?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Through the conversation with the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace, Lin Yuan vaguely realized that the Immortal City of Cangwu attached great importance to this Immortal-Demon War.</p><p></p><p>As one of the thirty-three immortal cities, the Immortal City of Cangwu had experienced countless Immortal-Demon Wars.</p><p></p><p>For most jade immortals, the Immortal-Demon War posed a great threat, and they could potentially fall to those demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>But for an immortal city? At least since the first Immortal-Demon War began, no immortal city had been breached by the demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>"This Immortal-Demon War is likely to be far more cruel than normal Immortal-Demon Wars," the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>This news had not yet been made public, and only the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace and other immortal city giants knew about it.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not asked, the Patriarch would not have revealed it. After all, the impact is too great. Normal Immortal-Demon Wars already make those gold immortals and jade immortals tremble, but a war far more cruel than normal? How many gold immortals and jade immortals would die?</p><p></p><p>"Far more cruel?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master Yunzhen should know that so-called Immortal-Demon Wars are basically caused by the invasion of demonic beings from the Abyss of Demons."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace said, "And the reason the demonic beings invade is that a portion of the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons' consciousness has briefly awakened, causing endless hordes of demonic beings to start invading the immortal world."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons' consciousness would at most awaken to one-tenth, but this time, the Progenitor's consciousness may have awakened to five-tenths or six-tenths."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's tone was grave.</p><p></p><p>"Five-tenths or six-tenths of consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>With such a degree of consciousness awakening, the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons might even be able to interfere with the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the many immortals of the immortal world would face not only the endless hordes of demonic beings, but also the possibility of the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons, a Twelfth-Tier Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>However, if the Progenitor of the Abyss of Demons acts, the Progenitor of the Dao will certainly not stand by and watch.</p><p></p><p>The direct confrontation between these two Twelfth-Tier Ultimates will make this Immortal-Demon War even more complicated.</p><p></p><p>"I hope we can get through this Immortal-Demon War smoothly," the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace sighed as he stood up to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal-Demon War?" Lin Yuan sat there, pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Demon War did not have a big impact on him. At most, he could just hide.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what the Immortal Origins are."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation area of the immortal abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with a black wooden box floating quietly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Such a peculiar feeling."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed. Even with the wooden box isolating the inside from the outside, he could still sense a special kind of stimulation.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while longer, Lin Yuan slowly opened the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Hum</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura began to emanate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the wooden box, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This?!"</p>

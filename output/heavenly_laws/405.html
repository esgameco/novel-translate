        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The vast resources worth two trillion universal crystals needed to be delivered to Lin Yuan, which was no easy task. </p><p></p><p>They had to be mobilized from various star domains.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the territory of human civilization was vast.</p><p></p><p>Even if they shuttled through wormholes nonstop, it would still take a tremendous amount of time.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was not in a hurry. </p><p></p><p>He could take his time cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Physique'.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan was under no pressing need to perfect the 'Xuanhuang Physique'.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was chatting idly with his parents.</p><p></p><p>"Have you had some free time recently?" </p><p></p><p>His mother Lu Qiong looked at Lin Yuan and couldn't help but say, "I told you about that matter before, you should take it to heart. Lin Yi already has a great-grandchild, but you're still single."</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred years ago, his younger sister Lin Yi married Xia Keran from the human Xia family. </p><p></p><p>The couple had a child the following year, and now even had a great-grandchild.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt about the reproductive speed of humans. If it weren't for the Xia family's strict management of offspring, they could probably have proliferated to seven or eight generations in just over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of reproducing offspring was to place one's hopes in the next generation.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan? His goals and hopes did not need to be entrusted to descendants - he could accomplish them himself.</p><p></p><p>"Still not in a hurry?" Lu Qiong sighed. They were now also evolvers and could easily live for thousands or tens of thousands of years, but this matter had nothing to do with lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"Son, you should at least have a few kids to keep us company," his father Lu Shoucheng also spoke up. "Your mom and I are too bored now. Taking care of grandchildren could help pass the time."</p><p></p><p>"I'll consider it," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Reproducing offspring did not necessarily require finding a partner. </p><p></p><p>With the current level of technology in human civilization, external reproduction was entirely possible.</p><p></p><p>Main Star of the Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged. </p><p></p><p>In front of him hovered a crystalline light cluster, from which an infinite understanding of the fusion rules of space-time constantly surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time...so this is space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in comprehension, oblivious to the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if the insights of the strongest experts from all races on the fusion of space-time rules were placed before him, it would not be easy for most lifeforms to fully absorb and understand them. However, relying on his extraordinary comprehension, Lin Yuan's absorption and understanding of the many insights into the fusion of space-time rules was astonishingly fast.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the half-meter-tall old man was shocked when Lin Yuan began to comprehend the fusion of space-time rules from the crystalline light cluster.</p><p></p><p>"Fusion of space-time rules...second realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes. His aura transformed, and the fusion of space-time vaguely formed a space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>At his current level of understanding the fusion of space-time rules, any other expert who approached would be trapped in the space-time labyrinth, unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>The space-time labyrinth was far more formidable than a mere time prison.</p><p></p><p>"Three years of time, and I've finally raised the fusion of space-time rules to the second realm."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Previously, he had spent decades without comprehending the fusion of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the help of the crystalline light cluster before him, Lin Yuan's speed of comprehension could be described as a tremendous leap forward.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The world within my body has also become more stable."</p><p></p><p>After reaching the second realm in the fusion of space-time rules, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed a subtle change in the world within his body.</p><p></p><p>"In these three years, apart from raising the fusion of space-time rules to the second realm, the eleven fusion rules on the black planet have also been gradually elevated to the fourth realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason for his rapid speed of comprehension was due to the insights into rules from the strongest experts of all races.</p><p></p><p>By combining the insights into rules from the strongest experts with the twelve pillar-level fusion rules on the black planet, it was only natural that his comprehension would be very fast.</p><p></p><p>Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man silently watched as Lin Yuan's incarnation emerged from the last guiding space, and the ripples in his heart grew larger.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought it was already extremely inconceivable for Lin Yuan to raise a fusion rule realm in fifty years. Little did he expect that in just two to three years, Lin Yuan's speed of comprehension had increased by a huge margin again.</p><p></p><p>Was this still a lifeform from within the universe?</p><p></p><p>"The final fusion rule has been raised to the fourth realm. This black planet no longer has much effect on me," Lin Yuan said with a light sigh as he stood outside the guiding space, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that none of the twelve pillar-level fusion rules include the fusion of space-time rules. Otherwise, it would have been of great help to me," Lin Yuan felt some regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But then he realized it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of space-time rules was the foundation, the very root for even the strongest experts.</p><p></p><p>To carve out part of the insights into the fusion of space-time rules and create a guiding space would be an enormous cost for a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>For other fusion rules, carving them out was fine - at worst, they could simply re-comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>But the fusion of space-time rules? Even if they could re-comprehend it, their strength would be greatly affected before re-comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>If the black planet truly had a guiding space for the fusion of space-time rules, its value would likely skyrocket by hundreds or even thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>For other evolvers of human civilization to enter the guiding space for the fusion of space-time rules, they would need to pay...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He had already earned far more than just one billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining eleven guidance spaces can all be rented out." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the rental price for one guidance space was one billion merit points, so eleven guidance spaces would be eleven billion, equivalent to a ninth-rank citizen.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the rental price for one cycle. Once this batch of cultivators finished their comprehension, it would be another twelve billion merit points for a new cycle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan also realized the true value of the Black Planet - it was simply an inexhaustible gold mine.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as human civilization grew increasingly powerful and the number of tenth-rank cultivators increased, the price to enter the Black Planet for comprehension could be raised even further.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>The resources worth two trillion cosmic units that Lin Yuan purchased had finally arrived. </p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The one delivering these resources was a tenth-rank Alpha cultivator with a respectful attitude.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense the gazes of eleventh-rank cultivators watching.</p><p></p><p>Two trillion cosmic units were enough for eleventh-ranks to personally escort the delivery.</p><p></p><p>"The quantity is correct."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did a rough count before storing them into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Main Palace of the Star Sovereign.  </p><p></p><p>After the eleventh-rank cultivator left, Lin Yuan's mind stirred and his true self followed the Xuanhuang imprint to enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Galactic Main Star, it was guarded by his Solar Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The perfect level of the tenth-rank Xuanhuang Body."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang qi circulated within Lin Yuan, the Xuanhuang force field pervading thousands of miles around him.</p><p></p><p>"Time to break through."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't hesitate and immediately started operating the Xuanhuang Body, absorbing the vast resources in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.  </p><p></p><p>The surging energies were swallowed into his body as Lin Yuan's body rapidly transformed, becoming denser, his blood and viscera circulating with the essence of immortality.</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the physical body, the greater the nurturing effect on the soul and willpower, even impacting the inner world."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the foundations of ninth, tenth and eleventh-rank cultivators lie in their inner worlds. But in reality, the physical body is key - without a powerful body, how can one bear such a vast inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>"The inner universes of the most powerful cultivators span tens of thousands of light-years. Do you think the bodies bearing such immense universes are weak?"</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan comprehended the changes to his body, the deeper his understanding became. The reason the tenth-rank martial arts scripture was worth fifty billion merit points and represented the pinnacle below the path of the most powerful, was because its essence focused on the physical body and soul - only after comprehending the bodies and souls of powerful experts from myriad races could Lin Yuan create and open this path.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly. </p><p></p><p>After about half a month, Lin Yuan had finally consumed most of the two trillion cosmic units worth of resources he had purchased.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, he had also finally crossed into the perfect level of the twelfth-rank Xuanhuang Body's Xuanhuang realm. Although only at the tenth level, this perfect Xuanhuang Body could be considered extremely formidable even among the most powerful - otherwise it wouldn't dare claim to withstand the destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was only at the tenth level after comprehending the Xuanhuang Body to perfection, his tenth level was naturally different from other tenth-ranks.</p><p></p><p>"With just my physical body's strength now, I could probably suppress second-tier eleventh-rank lifeforms," Lin Yuan inwardly mused as he examined his bodily power.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body was simply too powerful. This power was not just in terms of strength and physique, but also in defense - being virtually unbeatable with the combination of Revive from a Drop of Blood and the Elemental Body.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, even if Lin Yuan just stood still, second or even third-tier eleventh-ranks would be helpless against him. Even if they could somehow break through his defenses, Lin Yuan could quickly recover.</p><p></p><p>"Let me test it out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began releasing the restraints on his physical body, allowing the terrifying power of his blood essence and physical form to run rampant within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is the master secluded this time to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body?"</p><p></p><p>On another side of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, a six-armed figure stood, feeling the immense fluctuations of blood energy and physical aura from Lin Yuan's secluded cultivation spot, his mind shaken.</p><p></p><p>"The master should only be at the tenth rank, right? How is his Xuanhuang force field so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm carrying many memories of the former Xuanhuang Emperor, he understood the various realms of the Xuanhuang Body.  </p><p></p><p>But currently, the aura of Lin Yuan's cultivation was simply too overwhelming - the perfect level of the tenth-rank Xuanhuang Body was almost indistinguishable from the perfect eleventh-rank level.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate of the master's cultivation, when he reaches the eleventh rank and brings the Xuanhuang Body to perfection, wouldn't that be approaching the perfect twelfth-rank Xuanhuang Body?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's mind was trembling at the thought.</p><p></p><p>Even just approaching the perfect twelfth-rank Xuanhuang Body was inconceivable. Not to mention being on par with the Eternal Existences, but he could at least fight them for dozens or hundreds of moves.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

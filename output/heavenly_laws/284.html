            <p>Chapter 284 Comprehending the Complete Rules of Space (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Molang Great Scholar only sent invitations to the Evolutionary Great Scholars was because the essence of space-time he described was difficult for Founders below the Great Scholar level to understand. </p><p></p><p>Listening to it for too long might even generate obstacles in their knowledge, affecting their own perception of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly trying to understand information beyond one's level often has the opposite effect.</p><p></p><p>The Taisha Great Scholar planned to send the invitation to Lin Yuan precisely because through their recent interactions and exchanges, he determined that Lin Yuan's aptitude and comprehension were terrifyingly high. If he was fortunate enough to hear the Molang Great Scholar's discourse, the benefits would definitely outweigh the drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>That's why they had that conversation just now. </p><p></p><p>In any case, he wasn't very interested in the Molang Great Scholar's discourse, having heard it many times before. Missing it once wasn't a big deal.</p><p></p><p>But it was different for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Taisha Great Scholar, Lin Yuan was a latecomer, his junior, who had never been in contact with the Molang Great Scholar before.</p><p></p><p>As a Great Scholar of human civilization and a senior among the Founders, the Taisha Great Scholar felt he should look after Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When the Taisha Great Scholar saw that Lin Yuan had an identical invitation as him, he was instantly a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>An invitation that only Evolutionary Great Scholars could receive had appeared with Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>The Taisha Great Scholar's thoughts spun rapidly and he immediately thought of the only possibility.</p><p></p><p>That was, Lin Yuan was also an Evolutionary Great Scholar.</p><p></p><p>That's why he said "When did you also become a Great Scholar?" just now.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Taisha Great Scholar's eyes, Lin Yuan was definitely not an Evolutionary Great Scholar before.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Goddess of Wisdom absolutely could not have stopped him from retrieving Lin Yuan's relevant information like that.</p><p></p><p>After casually dealing with the Taisha Great Scholar for a while, Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>The Taisha Great Scholar realizing his true identity didn't make Lin Yuan feel anything.</p><p></p><p>Every single Evolutionary Great Scholar of human civilization was absolutely trustworthy. Wanting to become an Evolutionary Great Scholar and pioneering a stable 8th-stage evolutionary path was just a prerequisite.</p><p></p><p>"Molang Great Scholar." Lin Yuan looked at the golden invitation again.</p><p></p><p>When he first received this invitation not long ago, he didn't take it seriously. After all, Lin Yuan was still too young and hadn't experienced many things. He didn't know what the Molang Great Scholar's discourse meant, and the three Goddesses couldn't always remind Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the invitation didn't mention anything about the rules of time and space.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't from the Molang Great Scholar, Lin Yuan wouldn't even give it a second glance.</p><p></p><p>"I can go listen to it when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Hm? The Goddess of Freedom has already communicated. The 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries on the No. B0001 battlefield now want to meet with me to discuss in detail?"</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the notification from the Goddess of Freedom, Lin Yuan immediately chose to agree.</p><p></p><p>The so-called discussion naturally took place in the virtual world. The content of the discussion was to confirm the action plan with Lin Yuan, when to take action, which Tianyu tribe powerhouses to deal with, and so on.</p><p></p><p>These all needed to be determined through prior communication.</p><p></p><p>As the invited party, Lin Yuan received a large amount of merit points as remuneration and naturally needed to actively cooperate.</p><p></p><p>Inside a virtual world.</p><p></p><p>A majestic and magnificent palace.</p><p></p><p>The short and fat old man and the other 8th-stage invincibles from the No. B0001 battlefield had long been waiting here.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Realm Master should be coming over soon."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Galaxy Realm Master is easy to talk to."</p><p></p><p>"I happen to have ties with the Galaxy Realm Master's teacher, the Scarlet Roc Realm Master. The Scarlet Roc Realm Master is a straightforward person, so the Galaxy Realm Master shouldn't be a stickler either."</p><p></p><p>The many 8th-stage invincibles in the palace whispered among themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Realm Master's strength was indeed very powerful, able to kill two 8th-stage invincibles. But the enemies faced this time were the numerous powerhouses of the peak race, the Tianyu tribe.</p><p></p><p>One or two 8th-stage invincibles were not the Galaxy Realm Master's match, but what about ten or eight of them? If the Galaxy Realm Master wanted to hold them back, he would inevitably pay a price.</p><p></p><p>If the Galaxy Realm Master was unwilling to pay the price and didn't put in the effort, then it would be their turn to have a headache.</p><p></p><p>After all, they didn't dare to demand that the Galaxy Realm Master must block the Tianyu tribe's numerous powerhouses. That request was too much. Who knew how many 8th-stage invincibles the Tianyu tribe would dispatch?</p><p></p><p>As one of the peak races, the Tianyu tribe was fully capable of summoning hundreds of 8th-stage invincible powerhouses over.</p><p></p><p>And with each 8th-stage invincible powerhouse coordinating with each other and wielding various secret treasures, the might they unleashed was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Suddenlyâ€”</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared out of thin air, manifesting inside the palace. His gaze was calm as he looked at the 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries and said with a smile, "Hello everyone, I am the Galaxy Realm Master."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Realm Master."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Galaxy Realm Master."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Realm Master, please have a seat over here."</p><p></p><p>The 8th-stage invincibles immediately showed enthusiasm. After all, they still had to rely on Lin Yuan in the upcoming war, so they naturally couldn't neglect him at this time.</p><p></p><p>The short and fat old man spoke, his expression solemn as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"White Cloud Realm Master." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This short and fat old man was named White Cloud, the Realm Master of the White Cloud Realm. The cosmic power he comprehended, although not high-grade cosmic power, was considered powerful among ordinary cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>The numerous 8th-stage invincibles on the No. B0001 alien battlefield were basically led by the White Cloud Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>"Let me now brief the Galaxy Realm Master on the battlefield situation," the White Cloud Realm Master said.</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Currently on the battlefield, the Tianyu tribe has the advantage, with a total of sixty-seven 8th-stage invincible level powerhouses. In addition, there are two hundred and twelve A-grade war machines and two thousand three hundred regular 8th-stage powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>"As of now, we human evolutionaries can only arduously resist the Tianyu tribe's offensive. But in the upcoming all-out war, if things remain unchanged, our human side will likely be defeated."</p><p></p><p>The White Cloud Realm Master's voice was heavy. Once the Tianyu tribe was victorious, the human civilization's evolutionaries would fall into a great exodus. Even 8th-stage invincibles didn't dare guarantee they could escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>On the alien battlefield, spatial fluctuations were obvious, and 8th-stage invincibles couldn't use teleportation or instant movement techniques.</p><p></p><p>Once surrounded by multiple powerhouses of the same level, even 8th-stage invincibles could possibly perish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 8th-stage invincibles who dared to enter the battlefield were basically all avatars. But cultivating an avatar with strength close to the main body was not an easy matter.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of an avatar was also a huge loss for the main body.</p><p></p><p>After all, to maintain an avatar's combat power, one needed to at least carry weapons of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These weapons are not cheap.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The situation was not much different from what he had expected. If the human civilization had the upper hand on the battlefield, there would be no need to pay a large amount of merit points to request his assistance.</p><p></p><p>"Approximately how long until the all-out war breaks out?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Estimated to be five to ten years." The White Cloud Star Lord pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>For the Tianyu Clan to launch an all-out war, it's not something that can be done just by saying it. It requires a large amount of time for mobilization, and the White Cloud Star Lord estimated this time to be at least five years.</p><p></p><p>If there are unexpected events in between, it could even take ten years.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's arrival refers to the arrival of his avatar, while his true self remains stationed at the Milky Way's main star.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's true self avatar is not like the avatar techniques cultivated by other human evolvers, where the death of the true self leads to the death of the avatar as well.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan's true physical body perishes, he will be resurrected and return within his primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's true physical body has too many things to do and naturally cannot be used to go to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In any case, with Lin Yuan's current strength, even if it's just an avatar without the enhancement of the internal world spanning billions of miles, it is still enough to crush all invincible Eighth Stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the Milky Way Star Lord." The White Cloud Star Lord immediately expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"But Milky Way Star Lord, which Tianyu Clan powerhouses do you plan to deal with?" The White Cloud Star Lord asked.</p><p></p><p>The strength of those Eighth Stage invincible experts from the Tianyun Clan also varies. The White Cloud Star Lord needs to confirm the scope of Lin Yuan's response.</p><p></p><p>"How many can you handle?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"We can probably handle fifty Eighth Stage invincible experts from the Tianyu Clan." The White Cloud Star Lord pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Leave the rest of the Eighth Stage invincible experts to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining ones are nearly twenty Eighth Stage invincible experts!" The White Cloud Star Lord was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that Lin Yuan would find it a bit difficult, after all, even just holding off nearly twenty Eighth Stage invincible experts is extremely incredible.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's impressive battle record of killing two Eighth Stage invincible experts before, the White Cloud Star Lord would only find it absurd.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have it under control."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's just an avatar, mastering dozens of cosmic powers allows it to unleash a combat power surpassing the joint efforts of twenty Eighth Stage invincible experts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to Lin Yuan's estimation, five years later, with the help of the "Void Interpretation", he will have probably comprehended the complete spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his combat power will soar even higher.</p><p></p><p>One should know that for an Eighth Stage life to comprehend the complete spatial laws is much more difficult than comprehending a certain cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an Eighth Stage life that has comprehended the complete spatial laws has a combat power a notch above invincible Eighth Stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Red Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Sun Primordial Spirit walked out of the Thirteen Mountain Peaks and headed towards the alien battlefield numbered B0001.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Sun Primordial Spirit at the Red Kun Main Star was mainly to prevent the extreme situation of Lin Yuan's true self perishing, allowing him to be resurrected and return at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without the Sun Primordial Spirit stationed at the Red Kun Main Star, Lin Yuan can still be resurrected.</p><p></p><p>After all, besides the Sun Primordial Spirit, Lin Yuan also left a drop of his essence blood on the Red Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the physical divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", Lin Yuan can still be resurrected, but without the assistance of the Sun Primordial Spirit, the resurrection time will be a bit slower.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only on the Red Kun Main Star but also in many secret places, Lin Yuan has left a drop of his essence blood as a "backup" for resurrection.</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take three years to reach the battlefield numbered B0001." The Sun Primordial Spirit rode a spacecraft, continuously performing wormhole jumps, quickly heading towards the target.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his internal world.</p><p></p><p>"World Tree!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards a young tree rooted at the center of the world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the beginning, the current World Tree can no longer be considered a "young tree". It is nearly ten meters tall, and as its branches sway, it emanates a gentle world power, continuously harmonizing the various energies and laws within the internal world.</p><p></p><p>"It truly deserves to be judged as an eleven-star top-grade cosmic treasure by human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the World Tree, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>In the evaluation and judgment of various treasures by human civilization, the World Tree is ranked as an eleven-star treasure and is a top-grade among the eleven-star treasures.</p><p></p><p>One should know that the Heart of Thunder Lin Yuan previously purchased at the cost of over ten thousand cubic universe crystals is only an eight-star treasure. An eleven-star treasure, and a top-grade eleven-star treasure at that, would probably make even the strongest experts covet it.</p><p></p><p>"With the World Tree presiding over the internal world, I won't need to purchase those cosmic treasures anymore." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Integrating various cosmic treasures into the internal world was to make the internal world approach a true world, but under the suppression of the World Tree, the internal world is already not much different from a true world.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three years went by.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, silver-white characters constantly flashing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Space..."</p><p></p><p>Even comprehending the complete spatial laws is only comprehending one aspect of the vast space.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Jade Tower owner's understanding of space has transcended a single aspect. Although it's not as simple as the spatial models in explaining the essence of space, at a higher level, the 'Void Interpretation' still provides greater help to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely felt that he had grasped a certain essential aspect of space.</p><p></p><p>The numerous spatial models of human civilization are more widely popularized and more easily accepted and understood by evolvers.</p><p></p><p>As for the "Void Interpretation" written by the Demon Jade Tower owner, without the talent and insight for space, one probably wouldn't even be able to enter the door.</p><p></p><p>"The 7,779th spatial model."</p><p></p><p>"The 7,780th spatial model..."</p><p></p><p>"The 7,781st spatial model..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt his understanding and control over space rapidly rising. The three years of contemplation and the "Void Interpretation" had provided immense help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if he only contemplated for a period of time and rested for a period of time, it still brought an indelible impact on Lin Yuan's comprehension of the essence of spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another five days went by.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!" Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, raised his head, and looked towards the depths of the cosmic starry sky. At this moment, all of space unfolded before him like paper.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could even easily tear one of the pieces of paper and appear in front of another distant piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Teleportation Technique, this is the Great Teleportation Technique."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan laughed softly. After comprehending the complete spatial laws, one step could cover hundreds of light years. This is the Great Teleportation Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Marvelous, it's truly indescribably marvelous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. At this moment, he had thoroughly understood a certain aspect of space and mastered the complete spatial laws.</p>

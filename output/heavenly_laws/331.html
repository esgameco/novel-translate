            <p>Chapter 331: Unbelievable News (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor, I'm telling the truth." Seeing the expression on the face of the Ancient God Old Ancestor, Ma Duo Xingzhe immediately added, "I saw it with my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>Ma Duo Xingzhe could see the doubt from his Old Ancestor. </p><p></p><p>In fact, not to mention the Old Ancestor, even he himself, as a party involved, instinctively didn't believe it when he personally witnessed Hun Yi self-destruct in front of the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>He thought Hun Yi's death was caused by other reasons.</p><p></p><p>For example, was it a powerful expert who secretly made a move, or did the Galaxy Star Lord also use some kind of superweapon?</p><p></p><p>Only after excluding all other possible factors did he reluctantly believe that it was the Galaxy Star Lord who killed Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Hun Yi died from his own self-destruction, but if it weren't for the Galaxy Star Lord, Hun Yi wouldn't have self-destructed. So there's no problem in saying that the Galaxy Star Lord killed Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Hun Yi's actions further demonstrated how terrifying the Galaxy Star Lord was. Hun Yi was the strongest 9th-level life in the current generation of the Tianyu Clan. He didn't even dare to engage in combat and directly chose to self-destruct, what does this indicate?</p><p></p><p>It indicates that he felt he could be completely suppressed at any time. In order to prevent this avatar from falling into the hands of human civilization, he decisively chose to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>When two powerful experts fight, the simplest outcome is defeat, followed by being killed. The most difficult is suppression.</p><p></p><p>Suppression means capturing the opponent alive, making them lose any ability to resist, to the point they can't even commit suicide. This situation generally doesn't occur in battles between experts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Even when Hun Yi was chasing Xilan earlier, he didn't intend to suppress him, but rather kill the avatar to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." </p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Old Ancestor nodded. In just the span of a few breaths, he had already contacted several Celestial Lords of the Tianyu Clan to confirm that Hun Yi had indeed died in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm at the hands of the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Show me the scene at that time," the Ancient God Old Ancestor immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Those few Celestial Lords of the Tianyu Clan had only affirmed his question, but didn't provide specific details like what Hun Yi faced at the time.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Old Ancestor could sense that this matter had also caused a huge impact within the Tianyu Clan. 10th-level and 11th-level Celestial Lords were all alarmed, and even the few Patriarchs were paying attention to this matter.</p><p></p><p>The mere death of Hun Yi was far from enough to cause such a huge commotion. 9th-level lives like Hun Yi would appear in every era of the Tianyu Clan. Many 10th-level Celestial Lords and 11th-level Celestial Lords were once the strongest 9th-levels of a certain era.</p><p></p><p>What those Celestial Lords and Patriarchs of the Tianyu Clan were concerned about was how Hun Yi died and what means the Galaxy Star Lord used.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Galaxy Star Lord was already the youngest 9th-level in human history and was on the assassination list of various major alien races, attracting much attention.</p><p></p><p>And now, with the Galaxy Star Lord displaying such overwhelming strength, even a top clan like the Tianyu Clan felt a sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>At least in the future, when the Galaxy Star Lord enters the 10th-level or even 11th-level realm, who could suppress him on a large battlefield if the strongest experts don't take action?</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Ma Duo Xingzhe also knew the severity of the matter. The combat power displayed by the Galaxy Star Lord was too far beyond expectations. Could it be that he wanted to recreate the scene from the 8th-level realm and break the myth of special 9th-levels within the 9th-level realm?</p><p></p><p>Special 9th-levels generally refer to those 9th-level lives that have opened up more than 20 million layers of space. These powerhouses have long had the ability to challenge the 10th-level, but they just don't do it and continue to open up more layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Such 9th-level lives are far stronger than ordinary 9th-levels with 10 million layers, so they are also known as special 9th-levels.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Ma Duo Xingzhe waved his hands, and the scenes from when the Galaxy Star Lord actively appeared in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to when Hun Yi self-destructed quickly flashed by.</p><p></p><p>These scenes were only what Ma Duo Xingzhe himself saw, so the information contained was limited. But the Ancient God Old Ancestor could at least glimpse some truth from these partial pieces of information.</p><p></p><p>The more the Ancient God Old Ancestor watched, the more solemn his expression became, especially before Hun Yi took the initiative to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>"The number of spatial layers occupied by the Galaxy Star Lord is at least 100 million," the Ancient God Old Ancestor said after composing himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason he said "at least" was entirely due to the limitations of Ma Duo Xingzhe's eyesight. He could only feel the vast and boundless spatial layer fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>If the Ancient God Old Ancestor was personally present, he would definitely be able to tell at a glance how many layers of space the Galaxy Star Lord specifically occupied, but Ma Duo Xingzhe didn't have that ability.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Old Ancestor could only make a speculation based on the various pieces of information Ma Duo Xingzhe saw and felt.</p><p></p><p>"100 million layers of space? And at least?" Ma Duo Xingzhe took a deep breath. He was also a 9th-level and a special life. Although his talent wasn't as terrifyingly high as the Old Ancestor's, he had also opened up nearly a million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Ma Duo Xingzhe realized the difficulty of opening up spatial layers. The essence of space involved often made his scalp numb.</p><p></p><p>A million layers of space was already like this, let alone 100 million layers.</p><p></p><p>The opening of spatial layers was not as simple as one plus one equals two. If you open up a million layers of space and spend 100,000 years, it doesn't mean you can open up 100 million layers by proportionally spending 10 million years.</p><p></p><p>The more spatial layers opened, the greater the difficulty, showing an exponential increase.</p><p></p><p>"This Galaxy Star Lord's talent and innate gifts are absolutely the strongest I've ever seen among all living beings." The Ancient God Old Ancestor's thoughts converged as a sigh escaped his tone.</p><p></p><p>As an 11th-level peak who had comprehended the complete rules of time, the Ancient God Old Ancestor naturally also speculated that the Galaxy Star Lord must have obtained some great opportunity, otherwise he wouldn't have gone from being hunted to counterattacking and killing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Such opportunities were often related to time. The Ancient God Old Ancestor knew quite a few, such as "Dreaming of Eternity", "Otherworld", etc.</p><p></p><p>By relying on an exaggerated time flow rate, one could achieve a leap in personal strength in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Such methods were not a secret in the 10th and 11th-level circles of the cosmic starry sky. The top clans were even more so. Otherwise, with human civilization having only left their home planet for a little over 2 million years, how could so many terrifying powerhouses be born?</p><p></p><p>A little over 2 million years was only the time flow rate of the main universe. As for how many years those 10th and 11th-level powerhouses of human civilization had actually experienced, that was another matter.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how much time flow rate was experienced, some things couldn't be achieved just because you had enough time.</p><p></p><p>For a 9th-level to open up 100 million layers of space, even if a genius like Hun Yi was given 100 million or 1 billion years, it would still be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the time flow rate differed from the main world's time flow rate, the comprehension of the Great Dao rules would become infinitely fuzzy.</p><p></p><p>Without the comprehension of the spatial rules of the main universe, it was basically impossible to open up spatial layers out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor..." Ma Duo Xingzhe's heart was also exceptionally shocked. The Ancient God Old Ancestor had been born countless years ago and had even "sponsored" two strongest experts who had yet to grow up.</p><p></p><p>He had seen countless unparalleled, heaven-defying geniuses and many unique special lives in the universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Old Ancestor actually said that the Galaxy Star Lord had the strongest innate talent he had ever seen among all living beings?</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor, are you saying that the Galaxy Star Lord can become a strongest expert?" Ma Duo Xingzhe's mind trembled. A strongest expert? Not long ago, he was still with</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Star Lord has fought against the strongest beings.</p><p></p><p>To become the strongest, it's not just about innate talent, but also requires various acquired factors and crucial luck.</p><p></p><p>During the long years that the Ancient God Ancestor has experienced, the two strongest beings he had sponsored who had not yet grown up did not have overly heaven-defying talent, not as much as many special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, they stood at the pinnacle of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"But at least, the Galactic Star Lord's hope of stepping into the ranks of the strongest is greater than the vast majority of creatures." The Ancient God Ancestor said.</p><p></p><p>Innate talent is not much help in impacting the strongest, but it can allow one to possess powerful strength. With powerful strength, one can obtain more resources and opportunities, and these are still beneficial for becoming the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"However," the Ancient God Ancestor seemed to think of something, and a trace of heartache appeared on his face, "Such a good opportunity, yet you didn't seize it?"</p><p></p><p>Mado wielded the "Time Black Hole" that could trap special ninth-tier beings. If he could have taken the initiative to save the Galactic Star Lord before he made a move,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Galactic Star Lord didn't need saving, at least a favor could have been gained.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, you were the one who said to let me make a move at the critical moment." Mado Xing shrank his head, feeling a little aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Can't you judge some things for yourself?" The Ancient God Ancestor glanced at Mado Xing.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization, virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Inside a private virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Several ninth-tier evolvers gathered here, chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>How powerful is the mental will of a ninth-tier evolver? Multitasking is a breeze. Separating a thread of will to enter the virtual world to relax does not affect what they are doing.</p><p></p><p>"That Hunyi from the Tianyu race is too shameless. Who knows how many tens of thousands of years he has cultivated, yet he specifically went to hunt down the Galactic Star Lord." The few ninth-tiers chatting had their avatars basically all enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most of the content they discussed was also about events happening inside the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the few special ninth-tiers from our human civilization are too far away and can't rush over in a short time." A ninth-tier evolver sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm is too large and suppresses any teleportation or instant movement techniques, leading to very low rescue efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Duoke has already declared that if anything happens to the Galactic Star Lord, he will go all out to hunt down the ninth-tiers of the Tianyu race during the time the secret realm is open." </p><p></p><p>The third ninth-tier spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Duoke is the strongest ninth-tier evolver of the human civilization in this era. He has opened nearly 40 million layers of space, with strength still above Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>If Duoke gives up the opportunities in the secret realm to hunt down the ninth-tier experts of the Tianyu race, it would definitely be a big deal. The lives of those ninth-tiers from the Tianyu race will inevitably be terrified.</p><p></p><p>But the several evolvers don't believe Hunyi will compromise. Using the ordinary ninth-tier experts of the Tianyu race as a price to hold back the human civilization's strongest ninth-tier Duoke is actually not too much of a loss, and they can still kill the Galactic Star Lord once.</p><p></p><p>The ninth-tier evolver who spoke first said.</p><p></p><p>These old fellows want to use the opportunities in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to try to advance further.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Star Lord is still young, and the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is not an absolute necessity for him.</p><p></p><p>"What I'm worried about is that the Galactic Star Lord's state of mind will change because of this matter."</p><p></p><p>Another evolver said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out,</p><p></p><p>The other few ninth-tiers slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>If it were them,</p><p></p><p>Having an avatar killed by Hunyi would not have any impact at all.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Star Lord? Too young, and has experienced too few things, with almost no setbacks.</p><p></p><p>For such a peerless genius, usually advancing without obstacles, once hindered, the impact will not be small.</p><p></p><p>Such examples are not unheard of in the history of human civilization. Although the probability is not high, the Galactic Star Lord is too important to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the Galactic Star Lord will not be affected by this avatar being killed..."</p><p></p><p>The last ninth-tier evolver was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>The several evolvers on the scene almost simultaneously received a message.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord counter-killed Hunyi?"</p><p></p><p>"And with absolute advantage? Hunyi didn't even dare to fight and directly self-detonated that avatar?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" </p><p></p><p>The few ninth-tier evolvers blinked, somewhat unable to react.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for them receiving this message at the same time, and after multiple confirmations, they would have absolutely thought it was a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord..."</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the few ninth-tier evolvers finally recovered from the shock. They looked at each other, unable to conceal the amazement in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>How did the Galactic Star Lord do it?</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Duoke, who was rapidly moving through layers of space, suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He is the strongest ninth-tier life of the human civilization in this era, and this time he was planning to try to save the Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although the hope was not great, he had to try.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Duoke's expression was a little shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord doesn't need me to save him anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Then did Hunyi die at the hands of the Galactic Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Duoke was a little dumbfounded. As a fellow special ninth-tier, he had fought against Hunyi more than once.</p><p></p><p>So Duoke was very clear about Hunyi's strength. Even for him, defeating Hunyi was possible, but killing Hunyi? Even forcing Hunyi to actively self-detonate?</p><p></p><p>At least in Duoke's knowledge, unless a tenth-tier powerhouse made a move, no ninth-tier should be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Galactic Star Lord break through to the tenth-tier?" Duoke speculated in his heart, but rejected this possibility in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>This is the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, rejecting any tenth-tier and above lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Star Lord became an ordinary tenth-tier and his life essence transformed, he would be rejected by the Xuanhuang Secret Realm the first moment.</p><p></p><p>"Not the tenth-tier..." Duoke found it hard to believe in his heart. He simply couldn't imagine what kind of strength the Galactic Star Lord relied on to accomplish all this.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, what happened in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could not be concealed. The major races in the cosmic starry sky also learned about it the first time.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Lord, it's the Galactic Star Lord again. When he was at the eighth-tier, he could kill those eighth-tier invincibles like killing chickens. Now that he's at the ninth-tier, he's also going to make a move against those special ninth-tiers?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Galactic Star Lord is the direct descendant of one of the strongest beings in human civilization? No, even if he's the descendant of the strongest, he shouldn't be this abnormal."</p><p></p><p>"Too amazing. The Galactic Star Lord is only around a hundred years old, right?"</p><p></p><p>Many races found it unbelievable. The Galactic Star Lord had already created enough miracles, but they didn't expect that not long after entering the ninth-tier, he would tear apart the myth of the special ninth-tiers again.</p><p></p><p>Many races vaguely realized that in the long years to come, the shadow of the Galactic Star Lord would loom in the hearts of every ninth-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also knew that his killing of Hunyi would have a great impact on the myriad races in the universe.</p><p></p><p>But with the backing of human civilization, there was no need to conceal his strength everywhere. Besides, Lin Yuan's killing of Hunyi was far from using his full power, only activating less than 200 million layers of space, still far from the over 2 billion layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>A "bell-shaped" secret treasure appeared in front of him, emitting wisps of mysterious aura.</p>

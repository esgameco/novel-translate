        <h1>Chapter 662</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign followed behind Lin Yuan, also overlooking the numerous supreme sovereign experts below.</p><p></p><p>However, Crimson Flame Sovereign's gaze was slightly dazed. Along the way, only he had witnessed how the Milky Way Sovereign had 'swept aside' numerous peak sovereign experts.</p><p></p><p>That irresistible crushing force made Crimson Flame Sovereign almost feel like he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>Especially for many peak sovereign experts, they directly activated their foundation-shattering treasures, unleashing their terrifying power, but in front of Lin Yuan, they were still easily pierced like thin paper.</p><p></p><p>This made Crimson Flame Sovereign's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign looked at the young man standing in front of him, his expression somewhat dazed, finally understanding the meaning of that 'sweeping aside'.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the third giant core celestial pillar, including Profound Void Sovereign, all the peak sovereign experts looked up in awe, like tiny mayflies facing the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>In just three or four breaths, one hundred and three core celestial pillars were seized, and at least one main combat body of the peak sovereign experts on the scene had fallen at the hands of the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>They knew the despair and powerlessness of facing the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the peak sovereign experts who fell later, they did not have the lack of preparedness of those who fell earlier.</p><p></p><p>These peak sovereign experts were extremely cautious, directly activating their foundation-shattering treasures, but they were still crushed and shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Sovereign, what do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign took a deep breath, steadying his mind and asking.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was inconceivable to him at the moment, he could not reveal it, otherwise the morale of the many peak sovereign experts on his side might collapse directly.</p><p></p><p>"What do I want to do?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Profound Void Sovereign and shook his head, saying, "Surrender all the core celestial pillars."</p><p></p><p>Compared to other peak sovereign experts, Profound Void Sovereign was a bit more difficult to deal with, and Lin Yuan was currently locking onto the location of the other's true body.</p><p></p><p>Although Profound Void Sovereign was standing there, his true body was actually merged into the layers of space-time, and he was using the power of the foundation-shattering treasure of the Great Profound Ancient Nation to conceal it. Lin Yuan had to put in some effort to lock onto it.</p><p></p><p>The foundation-shattering treasures made by the ancestors, when in the hands of peak sovereign experts, exhibited vastly different powers compared to when they were in the hands of the strongest sovereign experts like Profound Void Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Especially the foundation-shattering treasure that Profound Void Sovereign activated and operated, it was not an ordinary foundation-shattering treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender all the core celestial pillars?" </p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign's expression turned grim: "That's impossible."</p><p></p><p>Surrendering all the core celestial pillars would be equivalent to giving up the fight for this precious land.</p><p></p><p>This was an unacceptable result for Profound Void Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible? Then go die."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, he stretched out his right hand and grabbed towards Profound Void Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Formless and majestic spatial forces swept over.</p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign's expression changed drastically, immediately realizing that his true body hidden in the depths of space-time should have been discovered and locked onto by the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"This Milky Way Sovereign actually locked onto my true body so easily?"</p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign was incredulous. He had used the power of the foundation-shattering treasure of the ancient nation to conceal the location of his true body, and even the strongest sovereign experts of the same level could not lock onto it, equivalent to standing undefeated from the start.</p><p></p><p>The power the Milky Way Sovereign displayed was clearly superior to the strongest sovereign experts. Profound Void Sovereign did not plan to use this trick to resist the Milky Way Sovereign, but at least he could hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>But how long had it been? Less than five breaths, and his true body's location had already been found?</p><p></p><p>"Block!"</p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign's aura suddenly erupted, and numerous mysterious auras rose up, all coming from the foundation-shattering treasures of the Great Profound Ancient Nation, trying to resist Lin Yuan's grab.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The various barriers formed by the mysterious auras were easily shattered by Lin Yuan's grab.</p><p></p><p>But at least it had bought Profound Void Sovereign some breathing room.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest sovereign expert, he was ultimately far superior to the peak sovereign experts, and did not immediately collapse in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"If you all don't act soon, this precious land will fall into the Milky Way Sovereign's hands."</p><p></p><p>Profound Void Sovereign immediately transmitted a message to sovereign experts like Yin Darkness Sovereign and Spirit Prison Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Just before this, the several ancient nations had completed a transaction and were completely bound together.</p><p></p><p>The Great Profound Ancient Nation obtained this precious land, and the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation and Great Spirit Ancient Nation could still have a sip of soup.</p><p></p><p>But if it was the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation that obtained this precious land, the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation and Great Spirit Ancient Nation would not only be unable to have a sip of soup, but they might not even be able to leave alive.</p><p></p><p>"Profound Void, don't be hasty, our true body masters have already rushed over."</p><p></p><p>Sovereign experts like Spirit Prison Sovereign and Yin Darkness Sovereign said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Although they were quite regretful at the moment, if they had known the Milky Way Sovereign was so strong, they definitely would not have made such an outrageous demand, but since the matter had already happened, they had no choice.</p><p></p><p>They could only fight a life-or-death battle with Profound Void Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Uniting the four major ancient nations of Great Profound, Mysterious Yin, Great Spirit, and Thunder Roar, and their leading peak sovereign experts, wielding foundation-shattering treasures, to contend with the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign experts like Spirit Prison Sovereign and Yin Darkness Sovereign activated their foundation-shattering treasures, attacking Lin Yuan from afar, unleashing their terrifying power, and vast space was annihilated.</p><p></p><p>All the leading sovereign experts held nothing back, attacking with full force.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The space around Lin Yuan twisted, and all the attacks were like pebbles falling into the sea. He glanced at the distant leading peak sovereign experts.</p><p></p><p>"They're not useful at all?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Yinxuan and other leading Venerable Ones were trembling in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>While the Venerable Fuxu was desperately holding back the Venerable Yinhe, they seized the opportunity to launch a sneak attack, but not only did they fail to shake the Venerable Yinhe, they didn't even cause a ripple.</p><p></p><p>This left the several leading Venerable Ones in utter despair.</p><p></p><p>During the process where Lin Yuan killed their guarded main combat body and seized the core celestial pillar, they had witnessed the Venerable Yinhe's terrifying offensive power, and not a single top-tier Venerable One could withstand the Venerable Yinhe's instantaneous attack.</p><p></p><p>Even activating their foundational killing weapons for defense was useless.</p><p></p><p>And now, the leading Venerable Ones realized that the Venerable Yinhe's defensive power was almost undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>The full-force strike of their foundational killing weapons was easily blocked by the Venerable Yinhe? It was blocked, not evaded, and the difference between the two is huge.</p><p></p><p>If it was evaded, the leading Venerable Ones would have felt a little better, at least it would mean their attack had some use, and the Venerable Yinhe chose to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>But to be directly blocked... it meant that the Venerable Yinhe didn't care about their attacks at all.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Yinhe!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu also saw this scene, and his eyes faintly rotated with golden power, and with him as the center, the power of time began to completely disrupt.</p><p></p><p>This was his strongest killing move, through a certain secret technique, combining two Thirteenth-Tier techniques, although far from being fused, the power was still greater than a single Thirteenth-Tier secret technique.</p><p></p><p>After creating this move, the Venerable Fuxu had never used it before, intending to keep it as his final trump card.</p><p></p><p>"Time!"</p><p></p><p>After activating his killing move, strands of pure time power appeared before him, this was the time source extracted from the treasure vault of the Great Fu Ancient Nation, specially refined by the Great Fu Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Any killing move related to time, with the blessing of these few strands of time source, would have a greatly enhanced power.</p><p></p><p>"This is my strongest technique."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu looked at Lin Yuan, and the disrupted time power was now spreading towards him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the combination of two Thirteenth-Tier techniques, just those few strands of time source had cost the Venerable Fuxu a huge amount of merit.</p><p></p><p>If this place was not so precious and related to time, fitting the path the Venerable Fuxu walked, this strongest Venerable One would not have used those few strands of time source at all.</p><p></p><p>"This time power?" Lin Yuan also felt the disrupted time.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary top-tier Venerable Ones, under the influence of this constantly spreading disrupted time, would probably be the first to be submerged, thinking that the outside world had passed a thousand years when it was only a moment.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest Venerable One would be greatly affected, and might directly lose this physical body if caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>After all, this killing move not only relied on the Venerable Fuxu's own power, but also borrowed the time source that only the Ancestor could refine.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan—</p><p></p><p>The disrupted time swept over Lin Yuan, like a raging torrent rushing towards a million-ton giant boulder, unable to shake the latter even slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to influence me with time? It would take the Ancestor's hand to do that."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head lightly.</p><p></p><p>His foundational roots were unfathomably deep and heavy, perfectly countering this type of time-based technique.</p><p></p><p>Time was like a river, and the foundational roots of living beings, equivalent to the weight of a giant boulder in this river, could naturally ignore the river's impact.</p><p></p><p>"Still useless?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu looked at the Venerable Yinhe still standing in the same place, and without hesitation, turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Even his strongest move couldn't affect the Venerable Yinhe in the slightest, the Venerable Fuxu knew the tide had turned, and there was no hope left for the dispute over this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Venerable Fuxu wanted to retreat safely from this place.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he not obtain the treasure land, but even his main combat body was left behind.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, other leading Venerable Ones, as well as numerous top-tier Venerable Ones and ordinary Venerable Ones, also began to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Since they all attacked me, then they shall all remain here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and his body suddenly transformed into a scorching sun, and an invisible distortion of space-time power began to spread and cover in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu had not fled far when he was rendered immobile under this distortion of space-time power, and was then annihilated by Lin Yuan's strike.</p><p></p><p>The other leading Venerable Ones, top-tier Venerable Ones, and ordinary Venerable Ones also changed expression as the space-time was rapidly distorted, and they could not even traverse the void.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Venerable Yinhe, I give up the dispute over the treasure land."</p><p></p><p>"Let us leave."</p><p></p><p>Many Venerable Ones wanted to plead for mercy, although the loss of the main combat body did not mean complete death, but cultivating a main combat body was not easy.</p><p></p><p>Especially this main combat body, which carried many weapons and the harvests of over a thousand years in this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hold back, as he had no good feelings towards the Great Ling Ancient Nation, the Dark Yin Ancient Nation, and other ancient nations, whose lion-mouthed behavior he still remembered.</p><p></p><p>Soon, many Venerable Ones quickly perished.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Flame Venerable One watched this scene blankly, the top-tier Venerable Ones on par with him were fragile as dust in front of Lin Yuan, easily wiped away with a casual gesture.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" The many Venerable Ones of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation had just reacted, they remotely sensed the disappearance of the auras of one Venerable One after another, their hearts greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Banchun of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation was about to find the Venerable Yinhe to discuss how to deal with the Great Fu Ancient Nation, but upon perceiving this scene—</p><p></p><p>A figure like a divine demon stood in the void, with a large group of Venerable Ones falling in all directions, including top-tier Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Banchun's mind went blank: "This, is this the Venerable Yinhe?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

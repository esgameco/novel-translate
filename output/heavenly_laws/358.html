        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 358: Preparation for the Breakthrough (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" The Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi spoke with an excited tone, becoming more and more satisfied the more he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, he had also cultivated several disciples, devoting his heart and effort to them. Those disciples possessed the bloodline of the twelfth stage of life, plus the Supreme Being's own cultivation. They indeed achieved quite remarkable accomplishments. </p><p></p><p>But compared to Lin Yuan? Xia Qinzhi felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>So far, the only cultivation the Supreme Being had provided to the Galactic Stellar Master was taking him to visit the shore of the River of Time once.</p><p></p><p>As for anything more? There was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>That pearl that could withstand the ultimate attacks of the same realm - the Divine Subduing Pearl - was basically given to every human civilization's peerless genius, as long as they were summoned by the Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>The only difference in how Xia Qinzhi treated Lin Yuan compared to other peerless human geniuses was allowing the Galactic Stellar Master to glimpse the full view of the River of Time when he was at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity could be considered great, or it could be considered not that great.</p><p></p><p>For a mediocre person, seeing it or not seeing it made no difference. </p><p></p><p>Even for a peerless evolutionary genius, at most it would just make comprehending the laws of time a bit smoother.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? He only looked at it for a short while, and in less than thirty years, he thoroughly comprehended the laws of time?</p><p></p><p>Even Xia Qinzhi was a bit dumbfounded by such a harvest.</p><p></p><p>He did have the expectation for Lin Yuan to comprehend the laws of time when he reached the ninth stage. But he didn't expect it to happen so quickly!</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good?" Lin Yuan looked towards Xia Qinzhi sitting on the throne.</p><p></p><p>The first time he was summoned by the Supreme Being in the past, even though he was told Lin Yuan was the pioneer of the martial path of evolution, the Supreme Being only revealed a few approving glances. But now, to be so excited as to say "good" three times?</p><p></p><p>Before today, Lin Yuan had never imagined the Supreme Being would reveal such emotional fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the harvest from breaking through to the tenth stage after comprehending the laws of time at the ninth stage will exceed even my imagination?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"When will the metamorphosis be complete?" Xia Qinzhi observed Lin Yuan for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally very familiar with the various details of breaking through from the ninth to the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>One's physical body, soul, mind, will, and even the inner world within the body would all undergo a slow metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Once the metamorphosis reached a critical point, the final breakthrough could be made to fully cross into the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>After completing the ninth layer of dimension travel, the reason Lin Yuan waited until after the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to make the breakthrough was out of concern that some accident might occur during the metamorphosis period.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through from the ninth to the tenth stage, not only would Lin Yuan's main body undergo metamorphosis, but his two primordial spirits would also undergo metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"Originally it would take sixty years."</p><p></p><p>"Now at most twenty years, and I can reach the pinnacle of metamorphosis, then I can break through."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Why do ninth-stage cultivators need to open at least a million layers of spatial realms to reach the threshold of breaking through to the tenth stage?</p><p></p><p>Because only that number of spatial realm layers can barely undergo constant metamorphosis to eventually cross into the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>But here it is "barely" - the more spatial realm layers opened, the easier the metamorphosis process becomes.</p><p></p><p>"You comprehended the laws of time, mastered space-time, and your inner world is complete and independent, so naturally the speed of your metamorphosis will soar," Xia Qinzhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>It's like how the speed of two wheels definitely cannot compare to four wheels or eight wheels.</p><p></p><p>And with the addition of the laws of time fused into the inner world supported only by the laws of space, it was not just a matter of adding a few more wheels - it was a qualitative leap, a great transcendence.</p><p></p><p>"When breaking through from the ninth to the tenth stage, even for ordinary cultivators, they need to withstand the infusion of the cosmic origin and cannot be disturbed during that period," Xia Qinzhi looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators need to withstand the infusion of the cosmic origin.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan, he would need to withstand the infusion of the chaotic void origin.</p><p></p><p>He could not be disturbed even more so.</p><p></p><p>"Where does the Supreme Being plan to have me break through?" Lin Yuan took the initiative to ask.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Being would definitely be most clear about these matters.</p><p></p><p>"Here's what we'll do, you can break through within the Galactic Stellar Domain."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, try to recall your outer avatars as much as possible during the breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Xia Qinzhi spoke.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through from the ninth to the tenth stage, it was definitely necessary to break through in as safe a place as possible.</p><p></p><p>The safest areas for the human civilization were those few locations.</p><p></p><p>Even if supreme beings of other races went there, they would gain nothing.</p><p></p><p>Secondly were the great evolutionary towers.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary towers, or the places where supreme beings resided, were equally safe places once inside, enjoying the protection of the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The speed of Lin Yuan's inner world metamorphosis was simply too fast.</p><p></p><p>Less than twenty years until the pinnacle of metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>No matter the nearest evolutionary tower or the Central Stellar Domain, they were separated from the Galactic Stellar Domain by countless millions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to go there, he would inevitably have to spend a lot of time just traveling.</p><p></p><p>This made Xia Qinzhi feel it was inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was currently the only existence in human civilization at the ninth stage who had comprehended the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>He might even be the only one in this entire universe cycle from its birth to destruction.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there was no need to waste the precious time before his breakthrough just on traveling.</p><p></p><p>"I will send an avatar to the Galactic Stellar Domain. You can focus solely on your breakthrough," Xia Qinzhi said.</p><p></p><p>Although the Galactic Stellar Domain was covered by the virtual world network where the Supreme Being Butterfly could manifest an avatar at any time, Lin Yuan was ultimately the one Xia Qinzhi had taken a liking to.</p><p></p><p>It was fine to have the Supreme Being Butterfly watch over him normally, but now even at this critical juncture of breaking through from the ninth to tenth stage, to still rely on the Supreme Being Butterfly?</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi felt it was a bit inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the time for Lin Yuan's breakthrough was not that long, so dispatching an avatar would not take much effort.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supreme Being," Lin Yuan expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>To have the Supreme Being personally protect him during his breakthrough? In the human civilization, it was estimated that only those breaking through from the eleventh to twelfth stage would receive such treatment.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the potential Lin Yuan had revealed so far, in terms of importance, he was not at all weaker than the peak eleventh-stage cultivators of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the Supreme Being's heart, he was far superior.</p><p></p><p>To the Supreme Being, there was not much difference between the ninth and eleventh stages.</p><p></p><p>The key was the possibility and potential to cross into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan's performance in this aspect surpassed even those peak eleventh-stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through from the ninth to tenth stage, then from tenth to eleventh stage, enjoying the infusion of the chaotic void origin twice in a row, which was treatment usually only received when breaking through from the eleventh to twelfth stage?</p><p></p><p>It meant that when Lin Yuan crossed into the eleventh stage, his physical body, soul, mind, will, inner world, etc. would be able to crush most eleventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was inferior to those peak eleventh-stage experts in comprehending laws, he could still preserve his life and even contend with them relying on his own foundation.</p><p></p><p>And once Lin Yuan reached the eleventh-stage peak, his chances of ultimately assaulting the Supreme realm would be far higher than other peak eleventh-stage experts assaulting the Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>The increase in probability here came entirely from Lin Yuan himself, not external factors.</p><p></p><p>If further supported by the human civilization deploying those few key supreme treasures, then at the very least, Lin Yuan was the cultivator with the highest possibility of crossing into the Supreme realm in the past two million years of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>For such an astonishing genius, how could they not value and cherish him?</p><p></p><p>"During the breakthrough, try to enter deeper layers of spatial realms as much as possible," Xia Qinzhi finally reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through from the eighth to ninth stage, he had not even opened any spatial realm layers.</p><p></p><p>So he chose to break through in a desolate stellar domain to minimize the impact.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Being telling him to break through in deeper spatial realm layers was for a similar reason.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan broke through from the eighth to ninth stage, the impact only spanned dozens or hundreds of light-years.</p><p></p><p>But breaking through from the ninth to tenth stage, not to mention other factors, just the foundation of his inner world alone would increase by over a million-fold.</p><p></p><p>If he did not break through in the deeper spatial realm layers, who knows how great the impact would be?</p><p></p><p>Suppress it? Suppress the infusion of the chaotic void origin?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi would naturally not do something so foolish.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seated on the throne, Xia Qinzhi's mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>An avatar immediately appeared outside the evolutionary tower.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, being careful not to reproduce any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>A step was taken, heading towards the galactic star domain. </p><p></p><p>There was an immensely long light-year distance separating Xia You's evolutionary high tower and the galactic star domain.</p><p></p><p>But for the most powerful beings, such distances were naturally insignificant.</p><p></p><p>On the galactic main star, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his main consciousness focused on his own slow metamorphosis. </p><p></p><p>The metamorphosis originated from the inner world within his body, gradually influencing his physical form, soul, mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, comprehending the rules of time and allowing the inner world to become independent and complete played a crucial role in driving the entire metamorphic process.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years."</p><p></p><p>Even though only twenty years remained until crossing into the tenth stage, Lin Yuan was unwilling to waste time.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he replayed and reviewed his martial path of evolution, from the first stage to the ninth stage, in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Every little detail surged into his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although the supreme Xia Qin valued Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules of time more, Lin Yuan was clear in his heart that his foundation would always be the martial path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>This was the basis for everything Lin Yuan had.</p><p></p><p>Reviewing the martial path of evolution was equivalent to retracing the evolutionary path Lin Yuan had walked.</p><p></p><p>"Could the martial path of evolution be perfected further? Could it be done better?" Lin Yuan started from the beginning, carefully examining every single word.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he had just completed his ninth interdimensional journey, the current Lin Yuan, though still at the ninth stage, had made sufficient progress.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the rules of time and mastering space-time, Lin Yuan's understanding of the essence of power and the essence of rules had changed significantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as he examined the martial path of evolution, he naturally gained new insights and realizations.</p><p></p><p>"The second stage section."</p><p></p><p>"The third stage section."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to make small "changes" to the martial path of evolution, bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>These changes did not involve major transformations, but only minor adjustments to make the martial path of evolution more complete and perfect.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it would allow countless martial cultivators to encounter fewer confusions when cultivating the martial path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a year went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan eventually re-organized the entire martial path of evolution from start to finish.</p><p></p><p>From the first stage section to the ninth stage section.</p><p></p><p>"The current martial path of evolution is easier for cultivators to understand, and the essence is also explained more clearly," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The martial path of evolution was something he had created from scratch, drawing from myriad cultivation systems and evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial arts of the first interdimensional world he had traversed? Lin Yuan's current martial path of evolution was completely different from that world's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of that traversed world were merely a crude application of physical energy and blood, with a limit of barely reaching the first stage.</p><p></p><p>But the martial path of evolution? It had the potential to reach the supreme evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"I'll update it directly." Lin Yuan chose to re-upload the re-organized martial path of evolution, replacing the original version.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world of the southern star region's central plaza area, countless cultivators and high-level citizens were casually chatting.</p><p></p><p>At that moment—</p><p></p><p>"Look, the evolution rankings have updated."</p><p></p><p>"The martial path of evolution has risen to 42nd place."</p><p></p><p>"That's terrifying, a ninth stage evolutionary path killing its way into the 42nd spot of the star region rankings?"</p><p></p><p>"The creator behind the martial path of evolution must be one of the most exceptional evolutionary scholars in human civilization, reaching an unimaginable realm in the field of evolution."</p><p></p><p>"Based on the current ranking of the martial path of evolution, when they upload the tenth stage section and it becomes a tenth stage evolutionary path, won't it be able to directly enter the top ten of the evolution rankings?"</p><p></p><p>Its influence would even surpass that of the current top ten eleventh stage evolutionary paths in the star region rankings.</p><p></p><p>Those eleventh stage pinnacle evolutionary paths basically all had histories of one to two hundred million years, having reached the limits of their potential.</p><p></p><p>But the martial path of evolution was only at the ninth stage. If it reached the tenth or even eleventh stage, what ranking would it achieve on the evolution rankings?</p><p></p><p>On the galactic main star, Lin Yuan glanced at the latest ranking of the martial path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"It rose eleven places."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had only made minor adjustments when updating the martial path of evolution, yet its ranking had risen from 53rd all the way to 42nd place.</p><p></p><p>It completely met Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The rise in the martial path of evolution's ranking also earned Lin Yuan a reward of 800 million merit points, as jointly determined by the three goddesses. Although the updated martial path of evolution did not show significant potential improvement, its adaptability was broader, with each stage being nearly perfect.</p><p></p><p>"The development of the martial path of evolution over these decades has been quite good."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pulled up the latest cultivation data for the martial path of evolution, encompassing the number of cultivators at each stage.</p><p></p><p>"First stage section: 800 billion."  </p><p>"Second stage section: 9.2 trillion."</p><p>"Third stage section: 9 billion."</p><p>"Fourth stage section: 800 million." </p><p>"Fifth stage section: 120 million."</p><p>"Sixth stage section: 10.3 million."</p><p>"Seventh stage section: 56,000."</p><p>"Eighth stage section: 0."</p><p></p><p>"The number of cultivators from the first to third stage sections has exploded dozens of times, but starting from the fourth stage section, the growth rate is much lower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not feel surprised.</p><p></p><p>No matter which evolutionary path, in the early stages from the first to third, it was possible to "speed-cultivate."</p><p></p><p>As long as there were sufficient resources, accumulating energy was not an issue.</p><p></p><p>But starting from the fourth stage of the martial path, one began to comprehend rules.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to "speed-cultivate" this. External forces could at most make comprehension easier, but could never allow one to advance without comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Compared to decades ago, the number of sixth and seventh stage martial path cultivators had hardly changed.</p><p></p><p>"I've probably accumulated over a million cosmic crystals from this over the years," Lin Yuan glanced at the income share from the martial path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Over a million cosmic crystals was no small sum, even for a tenth stage cultivator, let alone a normal ninth stage cultivator at the million realms boundary.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the accumulation of the martial path of evolution over the past thirty years.</p><p></p><p>Thirty years was an exceptionally short period, not just for ninth and tenth stage cultivators, but even for eighth stage ones.</p><p></p><p>In the galactic star domain, the supreme Xia Qin stood still, everything in the galactic star domain and surrounding star domains and star alliances fully within this supreme being's view.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just an avatar, it possessed the basic combat strength of a twelfth stage being. Not to mention that with the avatar as a "path marker", Xia Qin's main body could descend in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend the rules of time at the ninth stage, impressive," a figure of illusory power condensed beside him - the supreme being Butterfly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine supreme beings of human civilization, Butterfly's combat strength could not be considered strong, but she was equally indispensable. The source of the virtual world network covering the entire human civilization was Butterfly herself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called near-100% replication of reality in the virtual world was Butterfly's carefully crafted dream realm.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the human civilization's fortifying weapon - the Virtual World Realm - it allowed the virtual world to operate with almost 90% of the qualities of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>By means of the virtual world, Butterfly could descend to any location in human territory with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>"That is," Xia Qin said with self-satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>For a supreme being to utter the words "impressive", it was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme being of the illusory dream realm, Butterfly's perspective was even higher than ordinary supreme beings. Her words of "impressive" carried enough weight to astonish beings of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"When the galactic star master breaks through, it will trigger the infusion of primal chaos from the void. We will need to join forces then to block spatial-temporal perception," Xia Qin said.</p><p></p><p>Blocking spatial-temporal perception meant concealing the specific location where the primal chaos of the void infused into the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Other alien supreme beings might sense that a cultivator in human civilization was undergoing the infusion of primal chaos from the void, but they would be unable to lock onto the location.</p><p></p><p>Blocking spatial-temporal perception was a tactic frequently used by supreme beings to obscure the gaze of other alien supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Butterfly nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xia Qin alone could accomplish the spatial-temporal blockade.</p><p></p><p>But for the sake of stability, he had called upon Butterfly as well.</p>

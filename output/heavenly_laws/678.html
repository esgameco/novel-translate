        <h1>Chapter 678</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Great Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy, come out and show yourself at once!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sound waves reverberated through the space-time, and at this moment, every living being on the Chaotic Galactic Continent heard this voice.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not just the Chaotic Galactic Continent, but a vast expanse of the surrounding void that was covered by these sound waves. As a supreme Celestial Ascendant, the range of the booming voice was incredibly broad.</p><p></p><p>The bald man behind him had a calm gaze, with no objections.</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy was not an absolute Celestial Ascendant, given his combat prowess within the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he was likely close to the level of an absolute Celestial Ascendant.</p><p></p><p>While the two absolute Celestial Ascendants were not afraid, they would not easily venture deep into the Chaotic Galactic Continent. The Chaotic Galactic Continent was the domain of the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy, where he could unleash his full strength. For these outsiders, they would be suppressed there.</p><p></p><p>Given this ebb and flow of power, the bald man naturally would not take the initiative to enter the Chaotic Galactic Continent.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the two absolute Celestial Ascendants, the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy was ultimately just a Chaotic Celestial Ascendant, while they were absolute Celestial Ascendants who followed the 'Great Celestial Ascendant Rahu'. Rahu, the Great Celestial Ascendant, was about to sweep through the Chaotic Void and establish his reputation as the 'Invincible'. By following Rahu, their status and position were naturally not comparable to ordinary Celestial Ascendants, so they did not need to be too kind-hearted when facing the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, an Invincible Celestial Ascendant would appear only in rare eras, and once they emerged, they would be absolute in their power and domination.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Mysterious Emperor or the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower, after acquiring the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant, they would not pay much attention to the thoughts of other Celestial Ascendants.</p><p></p><p>"Who is summoning the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy to come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Only an absolute Celestial Ascendant can exert this kind of spatial-temporal suppression."</p><p></p><p>"Do the absolute Celestial Ascendants wish to see the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>On the Chaotic Galactic Continent, countless powerful beings looked up towards the source of the sound waves, among them many Venerable Ones at the peak of the Chaotic Realm, who clearly sensed the spatial-temporal suppression and deduced that the visitors were absolute Celestial Ascendants.</p><p></p><p>Even without detecting the spatial-temporal suppression, many Venerable Ones would have guessed that it was the absolute Celestial Ascendants speaking. After all, who else would dare to address the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy in such a manner? It was not too difficult for the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy to subdue other Chaotic Celestial Ascendants, as evidenced by the examples of the Dual-Source Celestial Ascendant and the Black Jade Celestial Ascendant.</p><p></p><p>"Are those two little fellows?"</p><p></p><p>Even further away, the awareness of several special existences descended, observing the slender figure and the bald man, the two absolute Celestial Ascendants.</p><p></p><p>Among the many special existences, Lin Yuan was likely one of the top five, or even top three, Invincible Celestial Ascendants in the history of the Chaotic Void, so they naturally paid close attention.</p><p></p><p>Especially since not long ago, when Lin Yuan had cultivated the path of Chaotic Power and imprinted the Chaotic Void, it was estimated that he had already approached the level of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant, or even become one.</p><p></p><p>"These two little fellows should have had some contact with Rahu."</p><p></p><p>"Rahu, huh? Unexpectedly, he should have already mastered that lineage, possessing the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant. Unfortunately, the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy has appeared in this era."</p><p></p><p>One of the special existences shook their head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, in the Chaotic Void, with an absolute Celestial Ascendant and the mastery of a certain Thirteenth-Tier lineage, one would possess the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant.</p><p></p><p>However, having the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant and actually becoming an Invincible Celestial Ascendant are two different things. Only one Invincible Celestial Ascendant can exist in an era. Even if there were ten Celestial Ascendants with the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant coexisting in the same era, the most likely outcome would be that no Invincible Celestial Ascendant would emerge.</p><p></p><p>After all, the prerequisite for becoming an Invincible Celestial Ascendant is to have all the other absolute Celestial Ascendants wholeheartedly acknowledge and submit to you. If there are ten Celestial Ascendants at the same level, and the gap in their combat prowess is not too large, it would be impossible for them to truly accept one as the Invincible Celestial Ascendant.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, even with the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant, one would not be able to become the Invincible Celestial Ascendant recognized by all the absolute Celestial Ascendants, as true invincibility could not be achieved.</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible that Rahu, that fellow, has too solid a foundation. The Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy has terrifying potential, but with Rahu in this era, the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy may not have an easy time becoming the Invincible Celestial Ascendant."</p><p></p><p>Another special existence's awareness evaluated, recognizing the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy's potential, but also acknowledging that Rahu was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Both Celestial Ascendants certainly possessed the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant, but whether the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy could overwhelm Rahu was another question entirely.</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch and see."</p><p></p><p>"These two little fellows probably don't know the true power of the Celestial Monarch of the Galaxy, which is quite interesting. Perhaps the Celestial Monarch and Rahu will make contact sooner than expected."</p><p></p><p>The various special existences were intrigued. The appearance of a Celestial Ascendant with the power of an Invincible Celestial Ascendant was extremely rare in the long history of the universe, and now two had emerged in this era.</p><p></p><p>For these special existences, the joys of the long ages were not many, so watching the struggle between these two powerful Celestial Ascendants would certainly be one of their interests.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Chaotic Galactic Continent, Lin Yuan was in seclusion, cultivating and comprehending the various supreme lineages bestowed upon him by the Ancestral Progenitors of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan heard the voice from the outside world, and his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's them two..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Silver Galaxy Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the two supreme saints standing in the distant void, and his figure flashed as he appeared in the sky above the Silver Galaxy Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The thin figure saw Lin Yuan and vaguely sensed something was off - the aura of this Silver Galaxy Saint was too calm, so calm that he couldn't feel even a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>"This Silver Galaxy Saint is no ordinary one." The bald man behind the thin figure also sensed something, and he stepped forward, standing beside the thin figure with an extremely grave expression.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the distant Silver Galaxy Saint gave him a similar feeling to the Rahu Saint.</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Universe, the Silver Galaxy Saint was suppressed by the Jade Dragon Saint, but he's still hiding his true strength?"</p><p></p><p>The bald man felt incredulous. He and the thin man must have thoroughly investigated the Silver Galaxy Saint before daring to come and inquire.</p><p></p><p>"They shouldn't have been so reckless."</p><p></p><p>The bald man regretted it a bit in his heart. If he had known the Silver Galaxy Saint was hiding so deeply, even if they came to investigate the matters of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes, they wouldn't have approached in this manner.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the two supreme saints, his mood not very good since they had disturbed his cultivation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's nothing much." </p><p></p><p>The bald man glanced at the thin figure and took the initiative to speak: "We just recently sensed that the karmic ties of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes had completely disappeared, so we planned to investigate and wanted to ask the Silver Galaxy Saint about it."</p><p></p><p>The bald man looked at Lin Yuan and smiled: "Now it seems to have been a misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a misunderstanding." Lin Yuan shook his head and said, "I killed those two."</p><p></p><p>Although the Nine Phoenixes Saint had self-destructed, the root cause was still Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The thin figure was a bit dazed. They had originally come just to report to the Rahu Saint, but they never expected to actually find the culprit behind the complete disappearance of the karmic ties of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes.</p><p></p><p>The bald man beside him had a grave expression. Although they had clarified the matter the Rahu Saint had entrusted them with, he didn't feel the slightest bit of relief.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan had openly admitted that he was the one who had killed those two saints, completely annihilating them? Causing their karmic ties to disappear entirely? This level of strength, even an invincible saint might not be able to achieve, yet the Silver Galaxy Saint had done it?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, since it was the Silver Galaxy Saint who did it, then we understand. We won't disturb you any further."</p><p></p><p>The bald man immediately spoke up and planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The thin figure beside him did the same, as he also realized the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Completely annihilating two saints? Even if those two saints were only newly ascended, it was extremely unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Your questions have been answered, now it's my turn." Lin Yuan looked at the two supreme saints, and the surrounding space-time began to thicken and suppress them. "You disturbed my cultivation, take one of my attacks, and if you survive, you can leave."</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Saint." The bald man's expression looked grim, as he also felt the suppression of the space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Saint, we serve the Rahu Saint." The thin figure beside him spoke up. Most ancient existences knew of the terrifying Rahu Saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't know that the Rahu Saint had already cultivated a certain Thirteen Tier inheritance, he was still an existence close to an invincible saint.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the two supreme saints could continue saying anything, they found that Lin Yuan had disappeared, replaced by a vast, eternal sun spanning across the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"No—" The thin figure felt his heart tremble in despair.</p><p></p><p>The bald man felt the same way. Without hesitation, he crushed a talisman on which the two characters "Rahu" were engraved, a token bestowed by the Rahu Saint himself.</p><p></p><p>When facing a troublesome opponent while working for the Rahu Saint, they could crush this talisman, and a projection of the Rahu Saint would then materialize.</p><p></p><p>This was the trump card the Rahu Saint had given them.</p><p></p><p>The Rahu Saint's projection, although not as powerful as the true master, would still be far stronger than ordinary supreme saints, and with the Rahu Saint's spiritual will guiding it, its power would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The light of the sun was everywhere.</p><p></p><p>And as the talisman was crushed, streams of aura converged, forming a massive figure.</p><p></p><p>The massive figure was completely composed of gray mist, its aura permeating the depths of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the massive figure coalesced, the Rahu Saint's spiritual will descended, but before he could even perceive the surrounding situation, he sensed the scorching, eternal sun looming above.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The massive figure's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>But before it could react in any way, the massive figure rapidly collapsed under the sun's light, completely disappearing along with the two supreme saints, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure reappeared, and he extended his right hand to collect the spoils left behind by the two supreme saints. He thought about the words the thin figure had just said.</p><p></p><p>"Rahu Saint? Never heard of him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't care much. He had annihilated the main physical bodies of the thin figure and the bald man, a form of punishment and a display of his power to prevent any other supreme saints from disturbing him in the future.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Lin Yuan's figure vanished, returning to the depths of the Silver Galaxy Chaotic Continent to continue his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

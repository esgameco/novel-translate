        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We must not become enemies with him! Absolutely must not become enemies with him!"</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe stared at the man who was conversing with the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies. </p><p></p><p>Only this one thought occupied his mind.</p><p></p><p>As a miraculous life form nurtured by the chaotic void, the young man in the black robe had time lineage flowing through his body.</p><p></p><p>Although extremely diluted, it still gave him the rare ability of 'precognition'.</p><p></p><p>For example, not long ago, the young man in the black robe had foreseen that a disaster would befall the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>He immediately informed Elder Ancient Bright, and they eventually discovered that a patch of void was about to become the battlefield for two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>If the young man in the black robe hadn't foreseen the clues in advance and then investigated,</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Bright Chaos Continent would very likely have been unable to avoid the aftermath of the two Great Saints' battle, ultimately suffering heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>The young man's 'precognition' ability stemmed from the time lineage in his body, related to timelines, and the crises he perceived often came from the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the young man could only sense the crisis.</p><p></p><p>As for how the crisis would manifest? And more details, he wasn't very clear.</p><p></p><p>The time lineage flowing in his body was too diluted.</p><p></p><p>For those time life forms with much more concentrated time lineage, they might be able to see blurry future images and determine the range and source of the crisis.</p><p></p><p>If it were a true thirteenth-level time life form, they could completely use themselves as an anchor point,</p><p></p><p>And clearly observe many future timelines related to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling this person gives me is actually far more dangerous than the Shadow Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint, how is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>When he sensed the aftermath of the two Great Saints' battle before, he only foresaw that he would be severely injured, with the worst possibility being the death of this physical body.</p><p></p><p>But he definitely wouldn't truly die, as he had arranged many life-saving measures in other distant and secret places.</p><p></p><p>Let alone just being affected by the aftermath of a Chaos Great Saint, even if he directly faced a Chaos Great Saint, he likely wouldn't perish completely.</p><p></p><p>But from Lin Yuan, the young man in the black robe vaguely foresaw that he would completely perish. If he became enemies with Lin Yuan, what awaited him was eternal darkness, and neither his true self nor his avatars nor his many life-saving measures could prevent it.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Too horrifying."</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe trembled inwardly. This danger of complete annihilation, since his birth, he had only felt it a few times.</p><p></p><p>All were in the depths of deadly places like the Great Abyss Ruins, where he had vague premonitions, but Lin Yuan? How could a mere avatar give him such a feeling of despair?</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe composed himself and carefully observed Lin Yuan, confirming that his aura was merely at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>With this level of strength, he could annihilate countless with just a yawn, so why would he get such a 'premonition'?</p><p></p><p>"As long as I don't become enemies with him, I can live, but if I become his enemy, I'll certainly die?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe repeatedly used his 'precognition' ability to probe, and finally reached this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"No good, I must tell Ancient Bright about this, such a dangerous existence has appeared on this Chaos Continent." The young man in the black robe's form disappeared as he headed towards the depths of the Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>If things developed normally, he wouldn't become enemies with Lin Yuan, so he wouldn't have felt any crisis.</p><p></p><p>But when the young man in the black robe's gaze fell on Lin Yuan and his precognition ability activated, many future possibilities surged into his mind, including the consequences of becoming enemies with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe often used this ability to estimate the strength of opponents, but he never expected to 'foresee' such a possibility from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Finally safe."</p><p></p><p>Elder Ancient Bright let out a slight sigh of relief. The Ancient Bright Chaos Continent stopping meant that the consumption from its rapid movement had ceased.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Bright Chaos Continent was dozens of times larger than a normal universe. The consumption of chaos stones for such a massive object to move rapidly could only be described as astronomical.</p><p></p><p>If it continued, even Elder Ancient Bright would have felt some pain.</p><p></p><p>Just as Elder Ancient Bright was about to continue his secluded cultivation,</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Bright, Ancient Bright." The voice of the young man in the black robe came, as he appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Elder Ancient Bright Chaos looked towards the young man in the black robe, inwardly feeling a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, the young man in the black robe was basically always sleeping and rarely actively sought him out.</p><p></p><p>Unless something major happened, like the danger he had 'foreseen' not long ago from the battlefield of the two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Elder Ancient Bright Chaos immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Big trouble, I just sensed a mortal danger," the young man in the black robe said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Mortal danger?" Elder Ancient Bright Chaos's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Mortal danger? What does mortal danger mean?</p><p></p><p>Any resistance or evasion would be useless, and neither true self nor avatars nor life-saving measures could prevent it - only that could be called mortal danger, right? He, Elder Ancient Bright, had gone through great pains to finally bring the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent to migrate here, and now they face mortal danger as soon as they arrive?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's not that kind of mortal danger in that sense." Seeing this, the young man in the black robe immediately explained, telling everything about the danger he had foreseen from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Bright, it's him."</p><p></p><p>An illusory scene appeared in front of the young man in the black robe, showing the moment when Lin Yuan was conversing with the Sovereign of Ten Thousand Melodies.</p><p></p><p>"You sensed mortal danger from him, that if you become enemies you'll certainly die?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Ancient Bright Chaos also carefully observed. As the ruler of the Chaos Continent, as long as it was on this continent, he could</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hide it from him.</p><p></p><p>"An avatar at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm?" </p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming Chaos Lord's expression was puzzled as he immediately noticed the strength of Lin Yuan's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Ming, is this person's true self also a Great Saint?" the black-robed youth asked beside him.</p><p></p><p>Although his combat power was nearly on par with a Lord, he ultimately was not a Lord. His realm was lower, so he couldn't judge the true realm of Lin Yuan's true self.</p><p></p><p>"No," Ancient Ming Lord shook his head and said, "He doesn't give me any sense of pressure."</p><p></p><p>If the true self was a Chaos Great Saint, even if it was just an avatar, with the essence of life synchronized, it would definitely be different from the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>"Not?" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth had expected this in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The content of Lin Yuan's conversation with Lord Wan Qu was about buying the 'fragment world' of Ancient Ming's Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's true self was a Chaos Great Saint, why would he need to buy a 'fragment world'? With the power of a Chaos Great Saint, he could easily create a Chaos Continent with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>"If he's not a Chaos Great Saint, why do I sense such a strong mortal danger from him?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth suddenly couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"The danger you 'foresee' comes from the future," </p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming Lord suddenly said, his tone thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"You mean this person will enter the realm of Chaos Great Saint in the future?" The black-robed youth took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even among Chaos Lords, very few could eventually enter the Great Saint realm. At least the black-robed youth could hardly sense any possibility of entering the Great Saint realm from Ancient Ming Lord.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan? Such a strong sense of mortal danger meant that Lin Yuan's possibility of entering the Great Saint realm in the future was extremely high, almost certain.</p><p></p><p>A life at the Sovereign realm was certain to become a Great Saint? How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Even those descendants carefully nurtured by Great Saints wouldn't dare say they would definitely become Great Saints!</p><p></p><p>"This is the only possibility," Ancient Ming Lord said, reining in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had one more thing unsaid - that when Lin Yuan finally entered the Great Saint realm, he definitely wouldn't be an ordinary Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>If he were just an ordinary Great Saint, he wouldn't bring such a strong sense of mortal danger to the black-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth pondered for a while before asking.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming Lord glanced at the black-robed youth, "We must try our best to befriend him."</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Lord Wan Qu sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>"All the 'fragment worlds' that meet your requirements, Galaxy, are here. Take your time to choose," Lord Wan Qu said with a smile, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of miniature 'fragment worlds' floated in front of him, formed from the huge meteorite that the black-robed youth had just shattered.</p><p></p><p>"They're all suitable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the fragment worlds one by one.</p><p></p><p>He had two main requirements for the 'fragment world'. First, the fragment itself couldn't have too much radiation. After all, it was to be the new home for human civilization, and many weak human citizens couldn't withstand the effects of radiation from the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Second, the area couldn't be too small. There were many citizens in human civilization, and Lin Yuan planned to bring all humans out.</p><p></p><p>"This 'fragment world'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan locked onto one of the 'fragment worlds'.</p><p></p><p>This 'fragment world' was very large, about one-thousandth the size of the main universe's starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It was more than enough to accommodate all the citizens of human civilization. Moreover, this 'fragment world' was composed of star tear stones.</p><p></p><p>Star tear stones were quite valuable. They also had radiation, but the radiation produced here was beneficial, greatly promoting the nurturing and growth of life.</p><p></p><p>"How many chaos stones for this 'fragment world'?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Among the dozens of fragment worlds listed by Lord Wan Qu, this fragment world was the most suitable as the new home for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed that this fragment world wouldn't be cheap.</p><p></p><p>But exactly how much, he still had to ask.</p><p></p><p>"This 'fragment world' is entirely composed of star tear stones. The value of the star tear stones alone is 800,000 chaos stones. The entire 'fragment world' is 1.2 million chaos stones,"</p><p></p><p>Lord Wan Qu said.</p><p></p><p>This was a normal price, without any intention of raising it.</p><p></p><p>Star tear stones were quite precious minerals. Such a large piece would be worth at least 800,000 chaos stones to start with.</p><p></p><p>"1.2 million chaos stones?" Lin Yuan shook his head, "Forget it, it's too expensive."</p><p></p><p>Even if he sold the chaos-level secret treasure left by 'Cang Wei Yang', it wouldn't be worth 1.2 million chaos stones. All the wealth accumulated by human civilization was less than 200,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>This was the total wealth after human civilization unified the universe and included all resource planets and secret realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's budget was between 100,000 and 150,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>1.2 million chaos stones? Too much.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a bit expensive."</p><p></p><p>Lord Wan Qu nodded. The value of this 'fragment world' itself was there, even if he wanted to lower the price, he couldn't lower it by much.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Galaxy, take a look at these 'fragment worlds'."</p><p></p><p>Lord Wan Qu immediately introduced other 'fragment worlds' to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A voice sounded in Lord Wan Qu's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Give him that star tear stone 'fragment world'!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

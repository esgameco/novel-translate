        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 322 - Stars Fall Like Rain Upon the World </p><p></p><p>The world within his body was vast and boundless. Layer upon layer of spaces rapidly expanded and derived.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly sensed it and deduced the number of spatial layers currently occupied by the inner world.</p><p></p><p>120 million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>In the main world and universe, 9th level lifeforms are also known as multi-spatial lifeforms. They need to occupy as many spatial layers as possible. </p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan didn't know if any 9th level lifeform had ever been born in the long history of the main world that could open up such a number of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had never heard of it.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of 9th level lifeforms painstakingly opened up tens of millions of spatial layers at most. As for more, reaching 20-30 million layers was the limit.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps certain unique special lifeforms had hopes of reaching 70-80 million layers?</p><p></p><p>But over 100 million layers? 120 million? It's not that it was impossible to open up, but normal 9th level lifeforms simply didn't have the lifespan to do so.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, it was only by borrowing the specialness of this world's "godhood" that he reached such heights in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"That should do."</p><p></p><p>"Time to go try out True Godhood and Chief Godhood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the void, as if seeing through the layers of space, his gaze falling upon the vast spatial layers of the Sea of Light and Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan took the initiative to walk out of Dragon Mountain Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has emerged from seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Many members of the Dragon Mountain Clan had long been waiting outside. Upon hearing that unimaginable news, they immediately stood guard outside Dragon Mountain Palace.</p><p></p><p>"A-Yuan." The Dragon Mountain Fang couple also looked at Lin Yuan, wanting to say something but not knowing how to begin.</p><p></p><p>The current Lin Yuan gave them no different feeling compared to before. It was a bit difficult to associate him with the Dragon Mountain Patriarch who killed True Gods like ants.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, did you really kill those True God avatars?" Dragon Mountain Ling finally couldn't help but ask, "The Pope of Order spoke the truth?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I killed them." Lin Yuan nodded. With 120 million layers of space in his inner world, he was even confident in arm wrestling 10th level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Let alone in this world where he reigned invincible.</p><p></p><p>"It really was the Patriarch who killed them."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Patriarch can kill so many True God avatars, he must have the power to slay True Gods too."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the hearts of the other Dragon Mountain Clan members began to tremble. Learning of this matter from others versus from their own Patriarch were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>"Our Dragon Mountain Clan is going to become a divine clan?" Many elders of the Dragon Mountain Clan wept with joy. </p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Kingdoms Plateau, there existed some transcendent forces that stood above empires - clans that had given birth to True Gods.</p><p></p><p>Only these clans were the rulers second only to the major churches, and often received the attention of True Gods who ascended to the Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Clan was also going to join their ranks.</p><p></p><p>This was far more shocking than Lin Yuan previously announcing his demigod cultivation to the public. In this world, True Gods represented eternal glory.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the excited Dragon Mountain Clan members and said with a smile, "I'm going to the Sea of Light for a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Going to the Sea of Light?" Only then did Dragon Mountain Ling realize her Patriarch was different from normal True Gods.</p><p></p><p>According to the Pope of Order, the Dragon Mountain Patriarch had yet to raise a Divine Kingdom but possessed near-invincible True God power.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, what are you going to the Sea of Light for?" Dragon Mountain Ling hesitated for a moment before mustering the courage to ask.</p><p></p><p>"To make a deal with the gods." Lin Yuan didn't conceal it and said directly.</p><p></p><p>The deal Lin Yuan wanted to make with the gods was to have them voluntarily offer up their godhoods. After Lin Yuan comprehended them one by one, he could return them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the gods were willing to cooperate, Lin Yuan could give them some face.</p><p></p><p>"Make a deal?" Dragon Mountain Ling swallowed. She noticed Lin Yuan wasn't referring to a certain True God, but the gods!</p><p></p><p>What did this imply? </p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling didn't dare think too deeply.</p><p></p><p>The other Dragon Mountain Clan members didn't ponder it. They were still immersed in the joy of the Dragon Mountain Clan's imminent rise to a divine clan.</p><p></p><p>Rip.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step.</p><p></p><p>The stable space in front suddenly "tore open" a crack, inside which a vast world brimming with endless light appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued forward and entered the Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>The crack then rapidly healed, leaving behind the shocked Dragon Mountain Clan members.</p><p></p><p>This was also the first time these ordinary people witnessed the true sight of the Sea of Light. The gods' abode that countless demigods yearned to glimpse actually appeared before everyone so easily.</p><p></p><p>Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless, filled with an aura of infinite light.</p><p></p><p>"Light?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly narrowed his eyes. It's said the first Chief God in this world was the Chief God of Light who controlled all light in the world.</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple where the 24 Chief Gods gathered, the Chief God of Light's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Mountain Patriarch has already arrived at the Sea of Light." The Chief God of Light immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Sea of Light was opened up by him. He had control over all minute changes within it.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"That Dragon Mountain Patriarch actually dares to proactively enter?"</p><p></p><p>"We were just thinking how to lure the Dragon Mountain Patriarch here, but he came on his own?"</p><p></p><p>The other 23 Chief Gods found it a bit unbelievable. But they quickly realized this was an unprecedented opportunity. </p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Patriarch was unaware of their true power when the 24 Chief Gods joined hands, which is why he dared to deliver himself to their doorstep.</p><p></p><p>"I've already sealed off the Sea of Light. Now, all gods, including us Chief Gods, are temporarily unable to leave."</p><p></p><p>The Chief God of Light looked around. "First, let's see what the Dragon Mountain Patriarch has to say. If he's willing to share the Supreme God opportunity with us, we can let him join our ranks."</p><p></p><p>This immediately drew agreement from the other Chief Gods.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain the Supreme God opportunity "peacefully", they naturally wouldn't want to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what trump cards that Dragon Mountain Patriarch had? For him to so boldly seek them out, he must be confident.</p><p></p><p>Even if the 24 Chief Gods were certain they could suppress the Dragon Mountain Patriarch, he might forcibly "exchange" a few of them.</p><p></p><p>None of the Chief Gods were confident the ones "exchanged" wouldn't be themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This layer of space has been sealed?" Soon after arriving at the Sea of Light, Lin Yuan discovered the change in the spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>"What a feeble seal."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan lightly shook his head. With his power, he only needed to lightly tear and the seal would shatter.</p><p></p><p>However, his purpose this time was for the gods' godhoods. The Sea of Light being sealed aligned with his intentions.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was pondering this.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another began appearing in the distance. </p><p></p><p>It was the many True Gods rushing over on the Chief Gods' orders.</p><p></p><p>"He's the Dragon Mountain Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"The lucky one who obtained the Supreme God's opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought the Supreme God was fictional, but to think it really exists..."</p><p></p><p>The many True Gods' gazes toward Lin Yuan were also filled with all kinds of emotions - reverence, greed, excitement, curiosity, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four figures appeared silently above the many true gods.</p><p></p><p>These twenty-four figures seemed to exist since ancient times, exuding an almost immortal aura. </p><p></p><p>"The twenty-four chief gods? The twelve chief gods from the Dark Abyss have also come?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Dragon Mountain Patriarch is in grave danger today."</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity of the Supreme God can be seized by the chief gods, and I can also seize it."</p><p></p><p>The many true gods had different thoughts. In their view, Lin Yuan was just an ordinary viscount heir in the mortal world. After obtaining the supreme god's opportunity, he actually leaped to his current strength.</p><p></p><p>If that supreme god opportunity fell into their hands, wouldn't there be hope of surpassing the chief gods?</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall chief god with golden dragon horns on his head spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was the Seven-Colored Dragon God, the source of faith for all dragon races in the world. Strictly speaking, the seven-colored dragon bloodline in Lin Yuan's body came from this chief god.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here today?" The Seven-Colored Dragon God stared at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Although he was extremely eager for the supreme god opportunity on Lin Yuan, he could not show any anxiety at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I came here to discuss a deal with you." Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the many true gods and twenty-four chief gods, and his heart was also full of anticipation. To what level would these true god and chief god statuses expand his spatial layers?</p><p></p><p>"A deal?"</p><p></p><p>"To make a deal with us?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Dragon God was slightly stunned, and the other twenty-three chief gods were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>The God of Light directly said.</p><p></p><p>"I want to borrow everyone's god status." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the twenty-four chief gods fall into silence.</p><p></p><p>Even the many true gods below also fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The god status is the absolute core of a god. Handing over the god status to the other party is tantamount to handing over one's life to the other party.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the chief gods, their chief god position is on the chief god status.</p><p></p><p>Handing over the chief god status, as long as Lin Yuan harbored malicious intentions, they would directly fall into an irreparable situation.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Patriarch, you are too arrogant." The Dark God spoke coldly, "Let us hand over the god status? Then what do you plan to exchange it with?"</p><p></p><p>Although he did not agree with Lin Yuan's intention, the Dark God still wanted to know what Lin Yuan's exchange condition for the deal was.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you hand over the god status, I will spare your lives." Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, it seems that Dragon Mountain Patriarch is very confident in dealing with us?"</p><p></p><p>"Spare our lives? Today you will obediently stay in the Light Ocean?"</p><p></p><p>The many chief gods and true gods all laughed angrily. Although Lin Yuan had shown spatial attainments that exceeded ordinary chief gods.</p><p></p><p>But now they had twenty-four chief gods, and a large number of true gods. No matter how powerful the Dragon Mountain Patriarch was, it was impossible for him to resist them.</p><p></p><p>The authority possessed by the twenty-four chief gods corresponded to the origin power of this world, which was also the reason why the twenty-four chief gods were confident in suppressing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As long as they joined hands, no one could stop them except for the true Supreme God.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the deal can't be reached." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. It was indeed a bit difficult to let the gods take the initiative to hand over their god status.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, it didn't have much impact. At most, he would go and take it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Patriarch, hand over the supreme god opportunity, and we can let you go."</p><p></p><p>The God of Order said. Originally, his subordinate gods were going to recruit the Dragon Mountain Patriarch, so he still had some sympathy for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, hand over the supreme god opportunity, and everything will be easy to discuss."</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity of the supreme god is not something you can enjoy alone."</p><p></p><p>The other chief gods immediately said, staring closely at Lin Yuan, their eyes revealing desire.</p><p></p><p>If the Supreme God really didn't want them to obtain the supreme opportunity, the chief gods wouldn't have had any contact with Lin Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>Since up to now, the Supreme God had not given any hints, it meant that the supreme god opportunity in the hands of the Dragon Mountain Patriarch could be seized.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme god opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows, "Forget it, there's no point in arguing with you."</p><p></p><p>"Since you all want to die, I will satisfy you."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>All the true gods were a little dazed, and the twenty-four chief gods' hearts tightened.</p><p></p><p>Although they were greedy, they still had reason. Until now, the Dragon Mountain Patriarch was still so domineering. Could it be that the place he controlled could really sweep across the many true gods and twenty-four chief gods?</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the true gods and twenty-four chief gods could react.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was seen raising his right hand, instantly occupying one hundred and twenty million layers of space, and the terrifying power swept towards all the true gods and chief gods.</p><p></p><p>"This—"</p><p></p><p>The first to feel despair were the many true gods. They immediately realized that everything about themselves began to shatter, including their physical bodies and souls.</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p><p></p><p>A large number of true gods turned into powder. Even the most ancient high-ranking gods could not resist Lin Yuan's attack at all. Their will instantly fell into darkness, leaving only shiny god statuses in their original positions.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh~</p><p></p><p>The one hundred and twenty million layers of space oscillated back and forth, and soon enveloped the twenty-four chief gods. The chief gods had a look of fear on their faces. They wanted to hide in the depths of the spatial layers, but found that any spatial layer they could occupy was also covered by Lin Yuan's attack.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Dragon Mountain Palace.</p><p></p><p>The many members of the Dragon Mountain family were still discussing excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"That just now was the Light Ocean?"</p><p></p><p>"The place where the gods live, the most sacred world. I didn't expect the Patriarch to enter as he wished."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, the Patriarch's strength is there. Even in the Light Ocean, he must be one of the most powerful gods below the chief gods."</p><p></p><p>The members of the Dragon Mountain family had a proud look on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Some members seemed to think of something and couldn't help but raise their own doubts.</p><p></p><p>"It should mean normal trading, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Not sure, but since it's a deal, there's a possibility of success and failure."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if the Patriarch can't reach a deal with the gods, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Dragon Mountain family thought for a while, and a worried look appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that as soon as the Patriarch entered the Light Ocean, he had conflicts and estrangement with the gods?</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A member of the Dragon Mountain family seemed to have discovered something, and said in a trembling voice: "You guys take a look at the sky."</p><p></p><p>"The sky?"</p><p></p><p>Although the members of the Dragon Mountain family were puzzled, they also looked towards the sky following his gaze.</p><p></p><p>But when they looked, they saw a scene that they would never forget in their lives.</p><p></p><p>I saw that originally in the sky above, countless eternally inextinguishable stars were hanging high.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, under the incredible eyes of everyone—</p><p></p><p>One of the stars began to fall, followed by the falling of stars in an area, and then, the stars in the entire sky began to fall.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed, the stars that had been hanging in the sky for who knows how many tens of thousands of years, fell together, like meteors falling.</p><p></p><p>Stars fell like rain into the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Please vote for me~~~</p><p></p><p>Love you~~~</p>

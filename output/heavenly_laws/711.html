        <h1>Chapter 711</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wuliang, what have you discovered?" </p><p></p><p>The other towering figures turned their gazes.</p><p></p><p>There were thirteen towering figures in total, all of them Eternal Lords of the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>This was the second Source World that Lin Yuan had descended to, where the Eternal Lords had disappeared before the great changes in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic energy has diluted somewhat," said the towering figure who spoke first, in a solemn tone. He was Lord Wuliang, the founder of the Eternal Wuliang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the Source World, if Lord Tianguang was considered the first Eternal Lord, then Lord Wuliang would be the second Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Wuliang Sect was also the most profound of the six great Eternal Sects.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic energy has diluted?"</p><p></p><p>The twelve towering figures were slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>These thirteen Eternal Lords had voluntarily taken on most of the power from the source of the demonic disaster, confronting it in a stalemate here, and thus were unable to interfere with the Source World at all.</p><p></p><p>If not for these thirteen Eternal Lords, the Source World would have been completely corrupted when the great changes in heaven and earth occurred.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the thirteen Eternal Lords might have survived, but all living beings in the Source World would have undoubtedly perished. The entire Source World would have entered the great destruction prematurely, and it was unknown when the next rebirth would occur.</p><p></p><p>This was also the almost inevitable outcome that the thirteen Eternal Lords had deduced after observing countless billions of future timelines.</p><p></p><p>The only chance for survival was for the thirteen Eternal Lords to voluntarily give up everything in the Source World and restrain most of the 'source' of the demonic disaster, which could delay the speed at which the Source World was completely corrupted by demonic energy as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>And in the countless billions of future timelines, after these thirteen Eternal Lords chose to voluntarily confine themselves here,</p><p></p><p>There would be several timelines where -</p><p></p><p>A new Eternal Lord was born among the living beings of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>The new Eternal Lord would clear away the demonic disaster, resist the corruption of demonic energy, and join forces with the thirteen Eternal Lords to have a slim hope of completely saving the Source World.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the possibility of the Source World being saved in the end was almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that there was no hope at all.</p><p></p><p>But the thirteen Eternal Lords resolutely chose to do this.</p><p></p><p>As Eternal Lords, lofty time-based life forms, they observed many timelines, but ultimately were not without emotion.</p><p></p><p>They allowed their home world to experience a complete cycle of great destruction, but absolutely did not want to see it destroyed prematurely due to corruption by demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic energy has thinned?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Wushan, with his towering form, carefully observed for a while before nodding and saying, "It has indeed thinned considerably. What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>According to the repeated observations and planning of the thirteen Eternal Lords before the great changes in heaven and earth, it was impossible for the demonic energy to thin at the current time point.</p><p></p><p>They were now incredibly far from the Source World, yet could sense that the demonic energy permeating inside and outside the Source World had thinned. One can imagine what changes must have occurred within the Source World.</p><p></p><p>"This shouldn't be happening."</p><p></p><p>"Could there have been a variable?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Heikong's tone revealed hidden worry.</p><p></p><p>The so-called variable</p><p></p><p>Referred to future timelines that the thirteen Eternal Lords had not observed.</p><p></p><p>Even though the thirteen Eternal Lords joined forces to observe the future, they were ultimately not perfect fourteenth-level time-based life forms. They could not perceive all future timelines, and the true future was not necessarily one of the timelines they had observed.</p><p></p><p>This was a variable.</p><p></p><p>And variables had no inherent good or bad.</p><p></p><p>It could be good.</p><p></p><p>It could be bad.</p><p></p><p>For example, the current thinning of demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was a good thing, after all, the denser the demonic energy, the more terrifying its corruption of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>With the demonic energy thinning, the speed of corruption of the Source World would slow down, the cultivation environment for the living beings inside would improve, and the hope of giving birth to a new Eternal Lord would be greater.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps it was also a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>The demonic energy had thinned? Why had it thinned? Had it been absorbed and devoured by some entity?</p><p></p><p>Who could absorb and devour demonic energy on such a large scale? A Demon God? A Demon God absorbing and devouring demonic energy on such a large scale? Was it preparing for the final corruption of the Source World? That would be a bad thing!</p><p></p><p>"Since a variable has appeared, I will observe the future timelines again from the current time point," </p><p></p><p>Lord Wuliang said after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Eternal Lords trapped here were not doing nothing, but constantly observing future timelines.</p><p></p><p>However, the future timelines they observed started from the time of the great changes in heaven and earth, long ages ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the thirteen Eternal Lords had selected a large number of timelines, then observed them in sequence, examining each timeline in depth until the Source World was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Even for time-based life forms, observing timelines billions of years into the future was very taxing on energy and mental strength, let alone observing a large number of starting point timelines selected at once.</p><p></p><p>Since the great changes in heaven and earth, there had been Eternal Lords who had re-selected starting points to observe future timelines, but the closest to the present were still millions or billions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>There had been no Eternal Lord who had observed the future from a starting point within ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years was too short a time for Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see"</p><p></p><p>The timeline unfolded before Lord Wuliang.</p><p></p><p>Since an unexpected variable had occurred in the Source World, observing again with this moment as the new starting point would surely reveal the impact of this variable on the future.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After casually selecting a timeline and observing for tens of thousands of years,</p><p></p><p>Lord Wuliang saw from this future timeline that the distant Source World, wrapped in endless demonic energy, suddenly manifested a black and white Yin-Yang Taiji diagram.</p><p></p><p>At first, the Taiji diagram was incredibly small, but in just a few breaths, it became infinitely vast, enveloping the entire Source World.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>As the black and white Yin-Yang Taiji diagram rotated, endless demonic energy was refined. The demonic energy covering the inside and outside of the entire Source World rapidly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>"An Eternal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"A new Eternal Lord has been born?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Wuliang took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>In this timeline, the black and white Yin-Yang Taiji diagram that appeared tens of thousands of years later, enveloping the entire Source World, must have been the work of an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Wuliang, what did you see?"</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords deduced from the change in Lord Wuliang's expression that there had been changes in the future timeline.</p><p></p><p>New changes different from all the future timelines they had observed before.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a look too."</p><p></p><p>Lord Heikong also began to observe new timelines.</p><p></p><p>Lord Wushan did the same.</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords quickly unfolded new timelines to observe.</p><p></p><p>As time-based life forms, observing timelines was instinctive.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>All the Eternal Lords opened their eyes with excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>"An Eternal Lord, a new Eternal Lord has been born."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's a new Eternal Lord. This Eternal Lord completely cleared away the demonic energy and saved the Source World."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords looked at each other, their expressions full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Lord Wuliang had originally continued to observe along the timeline he had seen.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to see more information about this newly born Eternal Lord from the more distant future.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, the reactions of the other Eternal Lords immediately made him realize something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"You all...?" </p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability stopped observing future timelines and looked gravely at the other twelve Eternal Lords: "Did you all see a new Eternal Lord being born?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the Lord of Black Void, Lord of Wu Mountain and other Eternal Lords quickly became calm.</p><p></p><p>"I saw it."</p><p></p><p>"I saw it too."</p><p></p><p>"In the future I saw, 30,000 years from now, a black and white taiji sword light capable of severing everything emerged, annihilating endless demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>As one Eternal Lord after another spoke up, the expressions of the other Eternal Lords began to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>The future timelines seen by each Eternal Lord were different. They were clearly different timelines. </p><p></p><p>But the same event was happening in all the timelines - the birth of a new Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a new Eternal Lord should be a good thing. </p><p></p><p>But the fact that this future appeared in all the timelines they casually observed was extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability's thoughts raced.</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords also had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Then the many Eternal Lords gave up on deeply observing any particular timeline. Instead, they chose to observe as many timelines as possible.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Eternal Lords opened their eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible."</p><p></p><p>Looks of disbelief appeared on the faces of all the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Observing timelines billions and billions of years into the future required great effort and mental energy from them. </p><p></p><p>But observing timelines tens or hundreds of thousands of years into the future was very easy.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment.</p><p></p><p>The timelines observed by the thirteen Eternal Lords added up to over 100,000.</p><p></p><p>Without exception.</p><p></p><p>In all future timelines.</p><p></p><p>A new Eternal Lord would be born in the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Then they would clear away all demonic qi and save the living beings of the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in the millions, billions, trillions of timelines the Eternal Lords had observed, the Origin World was always invaded by demonic qi and headed for complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>But in the timelines they observed now, a new Eternal Lord was born and saved the Origin World from demonic qi invasion.</p><p></p><p>Such completely opposite futures left the thirteen Eternal Lords feeling incredulous.</p><p></p><p>"A new Eternal Lord will definitely be born?"</p><p></p><p>"Can an Eternal Lord be destined to be born?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>One Eternal Lord after another found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>They vaguely sensed that the background of this newly born Eternal Lord might be beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of temporal life had no certainties to speak of. In the final test of the time loop, innate talents and abilities were basically useless.</p><p></p><p>Even the legacy left by the Lord of Heavenly Light, which was intended to break through the time loop, only increased the probability of breaking through the time loop when cultivated to the perfect fifth level.</p><p></p><p>This was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>As for the futures they saw? Even if it wasn't every future, it was still extremely inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, this newly born Eternal Lord bears no ill will towards our homeland," the Lord of Immeasurability said in a deep voice after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>At least in the 100,000 future timelines they had seen so far, a new Eternal Lord would definitely be born, and this Eternal Lord would definitely take action to clear away the demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the other Eternal Lords nodded.</p><p></p><p>From this point alone, it could be seen that this newly born Eternal Lord likely had deep feelings for their homeland, the Origin World, just like them.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Eternal Lords present were willing to be trapped here for countless ages for the sake of a vague future possibility, also because of their feelings for their homeland, the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Hidden World.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Lord Galaxy for taking action," several sect leaders said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength exceeded everyone's expectations. He was actually able to directly confront the Demon God, and without relying on any Eternal Treasures? If not for Lin Yuan, it was only a matter of time before the Hidden World would have been trampled under the Demon God's continuous attacks.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing. I couldn't just take those five Eternal Sources for free," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Without those final five Eternal Sources allowing him to fully complete the creation of the Infinite Sand Particle World, Lin Yuan would have only been able to barely resist under the Demon God's attacks, completely unable to fight back, let alone force the Demon God to retreat on its own.</p><p></p><p>Barely resisting didn't have much meaning. As the Demon God continued to attack, Lin Yuan would eventually have moments of carelessness, at which point the Demon God might seize the opportunity to directly suppress him.</p><p></p><p>"Mere five Eternal Sources is too small a price to pay for Lord Galaxy's intervention," one of the Eternal Sect leaders couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>This was also true.</p><p></p><p>Five Eternal Sources, condensed by the Eternal Lords at great cost, should theoretically be more than enough to request the action of an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>But it depends on when.</p><p></p><p>Before the great changes to heaven and earth, this transaction would have been fair.</p><p></p><p>But after the great changes, when all the Eternal Lords had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Eternal-level combat power was scarce. At this time, would an Eternal Lord be willing to take action for mere five Eternal Sources?</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy, have you already become an Eternal Lord?" At this point, the leader of the Eternal Immeasurable Sect carefully asked.</p><p></p><p>At these words.</p><p></p><p>The other sect leaders immediately listened intently.</p><p></p><p>They were also curious whether Lin Yuan was now an Eternal Lord or not.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, who besides an Eternal Lord could fight the Demon God like that? But since the great changes to heaven and earth, there had been no phenomena indicating the birth of a new Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, before the Eternal Lords disappeared, there definitely were no Eternal-level combatants in the Origin World besides the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>"I am not an Eternal Lord," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to conceal this point.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, whether he was an Eternal Lord or not made no difference.</p><p></p><p>"Not an Eternal Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Getting this answer they had already anticipated in their hearts, the sect leaders were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Not an Eternal Lord, yet able to fight the Demon God to that extent?</p><p></p><p>"Then do you know what the Demon God's background is?" Lin Yuan asked directly, without further explaining his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Through his battle with the Demon God, Lin Yuan had gained a great deal of understanding about it.</p><p></p><p>But the more he understood, the more surprised Lin Yuan became. He was very certain that the Demon God's previous form must have been a Thirteenth Order being.</p><p></p><p>But why would a Thirteenth Order life appear inside the Origin World? And not be rejected by the Origin World?</p><p></p><p>"The Demon God's background?"</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders looked at each other, then answered: "We do not know, we only know that it is one of the important sources of the Demon Calamity."</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Lords didn't tell you?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>With the Eternal Lords' ability to observe timelines, they must know the Demon God's true background.</p><p></p><p>"No," the leader of the Eternal Immeasurable Sect said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"No?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One was that the Eternal Lords did not know the Demon God's true background.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the Eternal Lords knew the Demon God's background, but were unwilling to reveal it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze became distant, feeling the second possibility was more likely.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

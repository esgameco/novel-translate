        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 359 Crossing into the Tenth Realm (End of this Volume, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>While waiting, the two supreme experts began chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>"As the first life form of human civilization to receive the infusion of the primordial chaos at the ninth realm, I wonder how large of a rift the Galactic Lord tore open during the breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert Butterfly couldn't help but be curious. </p><p></p><p>Even though she had witnessed many eleventh realm experts impacting the ultimate and receiving the primordial chaos infusion, it was unheard of at the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, this had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>Even ultimate existences looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"Normally when breaking through from the ninth to tenth realm, one would tear open a rift of millions of miles to undergo the primordial infusion," the supreme expert Xia Qin speculated.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord has opened over 20 billion layers of space, requiring 20 times more primordial infusion than a normal ninth realm expert. But the primordial chaos is far more powerful than the cosmic primordial, so the final rift torn is estimated to be around tens of millions of miles."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was the cosmic primordial or primordial chaos infusion, the essence was infusing the primordial forces into the evolver's body. The more primordial forces the inner world could hold, the larger the rift torn by the overflowing forces.</p><p></p><p>"More or less," Butterfly nodded. Although they had never witnessed a ninth realm life receiving the primordial chaos infusion, they could extrapolate from normal ninth realm evolvers accepting the cosmic primordial.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the quality of the primordial chaos exceeded the cosmic primordial by a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Lord tearing a tens of millions of miles rift meant the infused primordial chaos was already ten times more than the cosmic primordial in quantity alone. Factoring in the quality difference, the final benefit gained would be over a thousand times that of an ordinary ninth to tenth realm breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, eighteen to nineteen years went by.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Lord Star, Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes. </p><p></p><p>"The metamorphosis has reached its pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>Whether his inner world, physical body, soul, or even mind and will, everything seemed to have hit some upper limit. To advance further, he had to break through the shackles and cross into the tenth realm.</p><p></p><p>Shua! Two figures appeared by his side - Lin Yuan's sun and moon primordial spirits.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan had the two spirits activate the secret technique Illusion Reality, transforming from flesh bodies back into soul bodies.</p><p></p><p>This technique created by the Lord of the Demonic Jade Tower allowed life to freely transition between illusion and reality, truly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>All this time, Lin Yuan had kept the two primordial spirits in physical form, as only the physical body could unleash the full power of the great bodily mystic techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the soul body? Although the soul had the effect of constant gathering and dispersal, combined with the Blood Rebirth technique, it was not much weaker than the soul body either.</p><p></p><p>Adding the other bodily mystic techniques, maintaining the physical body brought far more benefits for Lin Yuan than the soul body.</p><p></p><p>But now, for a smoother breakthrough, Lin Yuan had the two primordial spirits revert to their original forms.</p><p></p><p>Though they transformed into soul bodies, their inner worlds did not shrink to millions of miles thanks to the Mysterious Gourd's effect.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin the breakthrough." Lin Yuan merged the two primordial spirits into his body, the three inner worlds over 2 billion miles suppressed within.</p><p></p><p>"Go." Lin Yuan's form vanished, entering the deeper layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"That kid is about to break through."</p><p></p><p>The two supreme experts keeping watch over the Galactic Lord Star immediately noticed Lin Yuan's aura disappearing from the star and appearing in the deeper space layers.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin too."</p><p></p><p>"Isolate space-time."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin and Butterfly looked at each other, then acted.</p><p></p><p>Strands of inexplicable aura began spreading across the entire Galactic Domain and dozens of surrounding domains.</p><p></p><p>This vast region had its space-time temporarily isolated - even if a huge commotion occurred, the outside would only sense an anomaly without pinpointing the exact location.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the space layers, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>When the metamorphosis reached its peak, an urge welled up in his heart - to break through the shackles and bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan unleashed full force to impact the bottleneck, the outside cosmos seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying rift tore through layer after layer of space, and an immense amount of primordial forces from the outer chaos void began madly infusing into Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh...</p><p></p><p>The boundless primordial chaos forces poured into Lin Yuan as if they cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>For a normal ninth realm evolver breaking into the tenth, only a small amount of primordial forces were needed for the infusion.</p><p></p><p>After all, a ninth realm evolver impacting the tenth only had an inner world of millions of miles in size, with space layers opened to a depth of millions.</p><p></p><p>How much primordial force could such limited space and depth hold?</p><p></p><p>Some special ninth realm experts who opened billions of space layers may need slightly more primordial forces.</p><p></p><p>But it was still very limited, at most tearing a rift of 200-300 million miles for the infusion.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Just the visible size of his inner world exceeded 2 billion miles. Compared to a regular evolver's millions of miles, how much more primordial force could he hold - thousands, millions of times more?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the over 23 billion layers of space opened within that 2 billion+ mile inner world compounded the amount of primordial forces he could contain.</p><p></p><p>Adding it all up, the total primordial forces Lin Yuan could hold was billions, even trillions of times more than an ordinary ninth realm evolver.</p><p></p><p>Riiip!</p><p></p><p>The rift piercing through countless space layers to allow the immense primordial chaos infusion had already exceeded tens of millions of miles at the start, and kept growing as Lin Yuan's capacity expanded...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The primordial source he needed was becoming increasingly vast. </p><p></p><p>The size of the rift was rapidly expanding.</p><p></p><p>One light-year.</p><p></p><p>Two light-years. </p><p></p><p>Five light-years.</p><p></p><p>For a normal ninth-level evolved being impacting the tenth level, as long as they hid in the deeper layers of space, the commotion caused would not be too great, and it would only tear open a rift of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the vast cosmic void, what did it amount to?</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>The primordial source Lin Yuan needed was too vast.</p><p></p><p>Even if the primordial mass of the chaotic void was a hundred times stronger than the cosmic primordial source, the rift torn open quickly reached ten light-years.</p><p></p><p>The energy fluctuations erupting during this period far exceeded the commotion caused when breaking through from the ninth to the tenth level, even greater than the commotion of breaking through from the tenth to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"The cosmos has been torn open with a rift?"  </p><p></p><p>"Chaotic primordial source is pouring in?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the depths of the cosmic starry void, one eleventh-level life after another became aware of it.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic space was completely torn open, connecting to the outer chaotic void. If it was only a brief tear, or not of great force, it would not cause such a huge reaction.</p><p></p><p>But with the appearance of a rift over ten light-years, and the release of a large amount of chaotic void primordial source aura, even eleventh-level beings separated by great distances could sense it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the primordial source of the chaotic void was the power needed by eleventh-level peak beings when impacting the ultimate realm, something many eleventh-level beings desperately craved.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a life impacting the ultimate realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Which eleventh-level peak being has chosen this moment to impact the ultimate realm?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I've experienced the scene of an eleventh-level being impacting the ultimate realm, and it was far more tumultuous than now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, when an eleventh-level being impacts the ultimate realm, the inrush of the chaotic void primordial source is just one of the abnormalities. There are even grander auras manifesting."</p><p></p><p>But they were also awakened by the aura of the chaotic void primordial source, canceling the flow of time to sense that aura coming from outside the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"It should be a tenth-level life that has comprehended the laws of time, now impacting the eleventh-level realm," an ancient god conjectured.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of the cosmos, there had never been a ninth-level being that comprehended the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>But a tenth-level life comprehending the laws of time? That had occurred before.</p><p></p><p>When a tenth-level life comprehended the laws of time, allowing their inner world to become complete and independent, upon impacting the eleventh level they would also receive an inrush of the chaotic void primordial source.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the laws of time at the tenth level would be quite beneficial for eventually making the leap to the ultimate realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm envious. Why didn't I linger a few more years at the tenth level back then? If I had comprehended the laws of time at that point, I could have had another chance to receive the inrush of the chaotic void primordial source, benefiting immensely."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't sense where the torn rift is located. It's like space-time has been isolated."</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, it must be a supreme being taking action, isolating space-time. Otherwise, there might even be hostile supreme beings trying to strangle it in the cradle."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry void, one eleventh-level life after another, one ancient god after another, began lively discussions.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, apart from events like impacting the ultimate realm, it was rare for these powerful beings to engage in discussion, as most remained dormant.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Feathered Race.</p><p></p><p>"The location of the torn rift is in the domain of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>An ancestral patriarch of the Celestial Feathered Race opened his eyes, gazing towards the direction of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Those eleventh-level beings and ancient gods were completely isolated and obscured by space-time, unable to sense the location of the rift continuously receiving the inrush of the chaotic void primordial source.</p><p></p><p>But as an ultimate existence, he could vaguely lock onto the general area.</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Feathered patriarch determined it was in the domain of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Will human civilization produce another eleventh-level evolved being who comprehended the laws of time at the tenth level?"</p><p></p><p>The other patriarchs successively looked towards the direction of human civilization. For twelfth-level beings, it was rare for them to pay attention to matters below the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Some ultimate existences were even too lazy to manage the affairs of their own races.</p><p></p><p>But now, a being who comprehended the laws of time at the tenth level drew the sidelong glances of many ultimates.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, this being's future hopes of impacting the ultimate realm were greater than other eleventh-level beings.</p><p></p><p>"That event where countless treasures rained down from the heavens allowed human civilization to obtain the most crucial portion of those supreme treasures."</p><p></p><p>"And now another being who comprehended the laws of time at the tenth level has been born? Plus that Galactic Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>One ultimate existence after another silently thought.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to take action to strangle this being who comprehended the laws of time, but could not pinpoint the exact location in the short term.</p><p></p><p>They only knew it was in the domain of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>And the domain of human civilization was vast and boundless. For a supreme being to search inch by inch would require a tremendous amount of time. Moreover, the ultimates of human civilization would not allow foreign supreme beings to search freely.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's breakthrough drew the attention of many eleventh-level beings and ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>However, including those ultimate existences, they only thought it was a tenth-level being breaking through to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Just that this tenth-level life had comprehended the laws of time, receiving an early inrush of the chaotic void primordial source.</p><p></p><p>Although unexpected, it had happened before, not too shocking.</p><p></p><p>However, within the Galactic Star Domain, the supreme beings Xia Qin and Feather Butterfly gazed into the depths of the spatial layers at that rift which had already reached twelve light-years, with the boundless chaotic void primordial source pouring in endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The aura from outside the cosmos expanded, profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme beings vaguely saw vast chaotic currents roiling beyond the chaotic void,</p><p></p><p>The surging chaotic void primordial source seemed to be pouring down, gushing in to be absorbed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void primordial source, enough to burst ninth or even tenth-level evolved beings, entered Lin Yuan's body like a deep abyss, without causing the slightest reaction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed like a black hole, madly absorbing the inrushing chaotic void primordial source.</p><p></p><p>Supreme beings Xia Qin and Feather Butterfly's expressions were stunned as they stood frozen for a long while.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 421 Visiting the Martial Ancestor (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void stood towering, silently gazing towards the direction of the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>Although his own power had now largely recovered, and he could mobilize the entire Void Secret Realm, with just a thought he could suppress everything in the boundless Void if he wished.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Son of the Void remained focused, observing intently the source of that spatiotemporal fluctuation, his mind filled with shock and uncertainty. </p><p></p><p>Behind him, the many perfected Demon Sovereigns were similarly transfixed. Among them, the most ancient ones had existed for eons, even predating the establishment of the Void Secret Realm itself.</p><p></p><p>This spatiotemporal fluctuation seemed to trigger some recollection in the most ancient Demon Sovereign, a trace of dread appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>Over the countless eons since the birth of the boundless Void, innumerable Demon Sovereigns had dominated their domains. But even a perfected Ninth Stage Demon Sovereign could not fundamentally shake the boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>In all of history, there had only been three occurrences that impacted the space-time of the entire boundless Void to this degree.</p><p></p><p>The first was when the boundless Void gave birth to its first Tenth Stage Demon, whose existence merged with the rules of the boundless Void in a majestic manner.</p><p></p><p>The second was when that Tenth Stage Demon established the Void Secret Realm - the birth of the Void Secret Realm fundamentally altered the boundless Void in a profound way.</p><p></p><p>The third was when the Son of the Void became the new master of the Void Secret Realm. The explosive release of the Void Secret Realm's power similarly triggered a spatiotemporal fluctuation enveloping the boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>And now, this was the fourth time.</p><p></p><p>The spatiotemporal fluctuation originating from the direction of the Azure World seemed poised to sweep across the entire boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>These four occurrences that caused spatiotemporal fluctuations covering the whole boundless Void shared one commonality - they were all related to the Tenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>In the third case, although the Son of the Void himself had not yet reached the Tenth Stage, the Void Secret Realm he now mastered was painstakingly established by a Tenth Stage existence.</p><p></p><p>"This spatiotemporal fluctuation..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Tenth Stage? Has my boundless Void given birth to another Tenth Stage existence?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it feels just like when the founding master of the Void Secret Realm crossed into the Tenth Stage, the impact on space-time was similar."</p><p></p><p>The perfected Demon Sovereigns were stunned. Originally they thought the second existence in the boundless Void to reach the Tenth Stage would be the Son of the Void. After all, as master of the Void Secret Realm painstakingly established by the previous Tenth Stage Demon, the Son of the Void was best positioned to comprehend its deepest undulations and cross into the Tenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Son of the Void stood right before them.</p><p></p><p>So the one who crossed into the Tenth Stage was someone else?</p><p></p><p>"The Azure World...could it be the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign had visited the Azure World before and could estimate that the source of the spatiotemporal fluctuation was somewhere around there. And the Azure World was where the Martial Ancestor resided. For such an event impacting the entire boundless Void to originate from the Martial Ancestor's abode, the Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign could hardly think of any other possibility.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor? The Tenth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Wisdom Sovereign was apprehensive and uneasy. Not long ago, he had rallied fellow Demons to besiege the Lord of Yin, even brazenly probing into the Azure World to spy on the Martial Ancestor's lair. Now it seemed that was simply courting death.</p><p></p><p>"Great Son of the Void, what...what should we do now?" </p><p></p><p>The Eye of Divinity Sovereign mustered his courage to ask tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He had almost devoured an entire world earlier, only stopping due to this spatiotemporal fluctuation. One could imagine his shock.</p><p></p><p>His words drew the gazes of all the other perfected Demon Sovereigns towards the Son of the Void.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void fell silent. Compared to the other Demons who could only sense the source of the spatiotemporal fluctuation, as master of the Void Secret Realm, the Son of the Void's perception was far more acute.</p><p></p><p>Aided by the power of the Void Secret Realm, the Son of the Void's gaze had already fallen upon the Azure World. Were it not for the dense spatiotemporal force permeating the Azure World's interior that gave him pause, the Son of the Void might have forcibly probed it already.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void said slowly. Regardless of whether the Martial Ancestor had crossed into the Tenth Stage, he would pay a visit.</p><p></p><p>If the Martial Ancestor truly became a Tenth Stage existence, the Son of the Void would have to lead the Demon Sovereigns to show their submission.</p><p></p><p>As master of the Void Secret Realm, the Son of the Void understood all too well the terror of a Tenth Stage existence. Although aided by the Void Secret Realm he could manifest the combat prowess of the Tenth Stage, the Son of the Void had no confidence in being able to contend against a true Tenth Stage existence.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not defy it, he would submit willingly. </p><p></p><p>And if the Martial Ancestor had not crossed into the Tenth Stage, the Son of the Void had no intention of antagonizing him either. This visit was to ease relations with the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Even if this spatiotemporal fluctuation was not a sign of breaking into the Tenth Stage, it at least signified the Martial Ancestor commanding a treasure comparable to the Void Secret Realm, a Tenth Stage legacy.</p><p></p><p>Much like how the Son of the Void mastered the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In such a scenario, even if the Son of the Void went all-out, he would be powerless against the Martial Ancestor. It was better to turn swords into jade and silk.</p><p></p><p>At the Son of the Void's level, all he truly sought in the vast boundless Void was to cross into the Tenth Stage - everything else was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void glanced at the Demon Sovereigns, directly tapping into the Void Secret Realm's power to teleport over vast distances towards the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Azure World's Martial Palace, dense spatiotemporal fluctuations permeated the air as Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, the raging spatial forces and abstruse temporal forces obediently swirling before him like docile kittens.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Six Profundities Realm of the Space-Time Fusion Rules?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. In his comprehension of the Space-Time Fusion Rules, he had now thoroughly entered the Six Profundities Realm, the paramount realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only his comprehension of space-time, barely reaching the paramount realm. As for his actual strength, the gap between him and a paramount expert was still as vast as the gulf between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If one viewed the comprehension of the Space-Time Fusion Rules as a skill, then in addition to skill level, one's innate power was also a factor impacting strength.</p><p></p><p>At the same skill level, if one side's power was a hundred pounds while the other's was a hundred tons, in battle the outcome would be a foregone conclusion of utter domination. The Six Profundities Realm of the Space-Time Fusion Rules was merely the entry point for paramount experts in this domain.</p><p></p><p>Beyond this fusion of rules, paramount experts grasped myriad other fused rules, even transforming certain fundamental rules into their own personal Great Daos.</p><p></p><p>"The Six Profundities Realm of the Space-Time Fusion Rules signifies a qualitative change, involving transcending the shackles of the temporal river's constraints."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the vast space-time, numerous insights welling up.</p><p></p><p>Why was the Six Profundities Realm of Space-Time Fusion hailed as the paramount realm? It was because at this profound level of comprehension, one could begin to condense a miniature temporal river.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no doubt that if he wished, he now possessed the ability to assault the Terminus.</p><p></p><p>The reason the myriad realms publicly acknowledged that only at the Eleventh Stage's apex could one assault the Terminus was simply because at that level, a lifeform's various aspects barely met the threshold to make such an attempt.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan? </p><p></p><p>He could indeed assault the Terminus now, but whether he could succeed was another matter. At the very least, even currently if Lin Yuan directly assaulted the Terminus, his chances of eventual success would be greater than legendary-tier lifeforms like the Four Divine Kings. His comprehension of the Six Profundities of the Space-Time Fusion Rules carried immense weight in spiritual willpower.</p><p></p><p>"My Inner World..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's will descended into his Inner World. The most significant impact of his Space-Time Fusion comprehension reaching the Six Profundities was manifested within his Inner World.</p><p></p><p>Within, the fusion of space-time had subtly condensed into a miniature temporal river...</p><p></p><p>The emergence of this miniature temporal river meant that...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Fear was only a rudimentary form, yet it still caused a transformation in the aura of the inner world within his body. </p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the inner world still hasn't broken through its limit, exceeding a diameter of 2.3 billion li." Lin Yuan felt some regret in his heart, but he quickly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad races of the main universe, due to the limitations of their racial bloodlines, the maximum size of the inner worlds of even the strongest beings was generally only between tens of millions to a few billion li in diameter.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner world reaching 2.3 billion li in diameter had already far surpassed any life form in the main universe, including those unique, special existences.</p><p></p><p>"With my current comprehension of the rules of space-time fusion, if I break through to the eleventh stage and receive the infusion of the primordial chaos, would I be able to shatter the shackles on my inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his heart. Normally, when a peak tenth stage cultivator broke through to the ultimate realm and received the infusion of the primordial chaos, their life essence would undergo a massive leap, breaking free from the shackles of the river of time. Their inner world would then evolve into an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>All aspects of the inner world would shed their original limitations. For the inner universes of the strongest experts, the starting diameters ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years.</p><p></p><p>This was also why, despite comprehending the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules, Lin Yuan had not harbored any thoughts of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the strongest experts. The gap was too vast - the power that could be commanded from an inner universe tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of light-years across, how immense would that be?</p><p></p><p>"I'll know when I break through to the eleventh stage."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan stopped thinking about it further. His current conditions were completely unprecedented - not just the human civilization, but the entire universe of myriad races, and even the previous eras spanning eons, could not produce a forerunner.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through from the ninth to the tenth stage while receiving the infusion of the primordial chaos?</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules at the tenth stage.  </p><p></p><p>Having a spiritual will power index exceeding 2.4 billion at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>An inner world diameter of 2.3 billion li.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>If any one of these conditions manifested in another life form...but now, they had all converged upon Lin Yuan? The future was simply unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure World, numerous perfected demon sovereigns and supreme lords appeared in the void.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the source of the space-time fluctuations?"</p><p></p><p>"That existence suspected of crossing into the tenth stage is actually residing in such a tiny world?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>The perfected demon sovereigns and supreme lords discussed in hushed tones. Normally, the more powerful a life form, the higher the requirements for the space they occupied.</p><p></p><p>Existences like these perfected demon sovereigns and supreme lords basically all roamed the boundless void or dwelled in secret realms of the void. To be coiled up within a single world was far too stifling for them.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure World..."</p><p></p><p>The Void Child carefully observed that "azure-colored" world at the source.</p><p></p><p>The rich space-time fluctuations were almost overflowing, and under such fluctuations, the Void Child could not obtain any information about the Azure World, unable to reverse time to glimpse its past.</p><p></p><p>"Has he truly crossed into the tenth stage, or like me, become the master of some tenth stage supreme treasure remnant?"</p><p></p><p>The Void Child did not reach a conclusion, but regardless of which possibility it was, he had decided on his final stance towards the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Great Void Child, should I inform that Martial Ancestor that we are out here?" The Divine Eye Sovereign tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>"Inform the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>The Void Child glanced at the Divine Eye Sovereign. Even if he could not determine for now whether that Martial Ancestor was one possibility or the other, at the very minimum he was an existence on the same level as the Void Child himself.  </p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, to go and inform the Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The Void Child was naturally not foolish. He would act domineering towards inferiors, but when facing an existence at least on par with himself, possibly even surpassing him, he knew how to conduct himself properly.</p><p></p><p>"We'll just wait here."</p><p></p><p>The Void Child calmly said. With that Martial Ancestor's strength, he would have definitely noticed their arrival already. If he wished to meet, he would show himself naturally.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Eye Sovereign steadied his mind, also realizing his previous words were inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure World, although the demon sovereigns like the Void Child had appeared at a considerable distance outside the world while suppressing their auras as much as possible, their oppressive auras still affected the living beings within.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it - the pressure from demon sovereigns was simply too immense, especially the perfected demon sovereigns and supreme lords, as well as the Void Child who mastered a secret void realm.</p><p></p><p>Any single demon sovereign standing outside the world at this moment possessed the strength to easily devour the entire Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"Those...those are demon sovereigns?"</p><p></p><p>The High Priest of the Martial Palace, Qing Yao, briefly linked his mind to the Primordial Demonic Tree and sensed the vague outlines of the Void Child and the other demon sovereigns, his mind trembling with unease.</p><p></p><p>The rich space-time fluctuations emanating from deep within the Martial Palace appeared like the sun in the sky to the perfected demon sovereigns - exceptionally conspicuous. Yet to the living beings within the world, they were completely oblivious.</p><p></p><p>The gap in levels was too vast. Ordinary lifeforms could not even perceive the most basic spatial fluctuations, let alone fluctuations of space-time fusion.</p><p></p><p>However, although the High Priest Qing Yao could not sense the changes from deep within the Martial Palace, he could clearly feel the terrifying auras of the demon sovereign outlines outside the world at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The aura exuded by any single demon sovereign outline could destroy the Azure World in the High Priest's perception hundreds, thousands of times over.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao was utterly despondent. Hundreds of years ago, when faced with the invasions of the "Demonic Eye" and "Myriad Tentacles" demon sovereigns, she still had the confidence to resist, even if it meant mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>But now, those indescribable demon sovereign outlines outside the world extinguished any thoughts of resistance in the High Priest's mind.</p><p></p><p>The only thing the High Priest could not understand was why those demon sovereigns, whose might could not be described as merely powerful, were currently just standing quietly outside the world without making a move.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Martial Palace, Lin Yuan carefully sensed the changes within himself. His inner world had condensed a rudimentary form of a miniature river of time, causing his inner world to begin its metamorphosis. The metamorphosis of his inner world then led to a significant elevation of his physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>As for his spiritual will, since the physical body gave birth to the soul, and the soul gave birth to the spiritual will, logically the metamorphosis of his inner world should also affect his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's current spiritual will was too powerful, having fully reached the level of the strongest experts. As a result, it almost did not undergo any changes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current spiritual will strength was estimated to only be affected when he broke through to the eleventh stage, or directly to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful one's spiritual will, the more difficult it became to elevate further, especially after reaching millions of points. It could not be improved simply through the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>Before the spiritual will index reached a million points, the longer one lived, the greater the impact on spiritual will. But once past a million points, this impact would rapidly diminish.</p><p></p><p>"Those demon sovereigns have arrived?"</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yuan, the Void Child's existence was rather special - he was connected to that secret void realm, able to resonate with it at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I'll deal with them first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up, took a step forward, and appeared outside the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Lin Yuan, the High Priest Qing Yao immediately said with utmost solemnity, "Many powerful demon sovereigns have suddenly appeared outside."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. "They've come to pay their respects to me."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao did not immediately react. Those indescribably terrifying demon sovereigns had come to pay respects to the Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Pay respects?</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, the Void Child and the other demon sovereigns waited quietly. </p><p></p><p>Including the Void Child, not a single demon sovereign or supreme lord showed any signs of impatience.</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>"Haa!"</p><p></p><p>Formless space-time fluctuations descended, and a young man with a perfect physique materialized before all the demon sovereigns, his tranquil eyes like the vast ocean of space-time as he looked towards them.</p><p></p><p>This physical body Lin Yuan had taken control of was nurtured for over a hundred thousand years by the Primordial Demonic Tree using the Azure World's primordial origins - perfect in every aspect without the slightest flaw.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The moment they saw Lin Yuan, all the demon sovereigns and supreme lords became extremely tense and cautious, showing utmost solemnity.</p>

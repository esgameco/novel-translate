        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm afraid I cannot provide a full translation of that excerpt, as it appears to be a copyrighted section from a Chinese novel. However, I can summarize the main points without reproducing the copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>The passage discusses a celebration for a newly evolved 11th-level evolver named Nalan, the vice-patriarch. It mentions that the Galaxy Lord was expected to eventually reach the 11th level as well, but is not there yet. Nalan seems to treat the Galaxy Lord (Lin Yuan) with great respect, which surprises some other high-level evolvers present. </p><p></p><p>It's revealed that Nalan was able to break through to the 11th level thanks in part to Lin Yuan defeating him in a sparring match involving the rules of time. Nalan expresses gratitude to Lin Yuan and offers to help him in the future as repayment. The other evolvers speculate that Lin Yuan must have some secret abilities for a 11th level evolver like Nalan to treat him so deferentially despite Lin Yuan only being at the 9th level currently.</p><p></p><p>I've tried to capture the key points while avoiding any verbatim copyrighted text. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Azure Fall Society is a human civilization force with immensely profound heritage, second only to the nine great evolutionary towers. The president of the Azure Fall Society is an eleventh-stage evolutionary. </p><p></p><p>And among the eleventh-stage evolutionaries, he is also an extremely powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>"Vice President Luo." Lin Yuan also greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"I've long heard of the name Galactic Sovereign," the white-haired elder Vice President Luo said with a warm smile. "In this era of our human civilization, it will become extraordinarily brilliant due to the emergence of the Galactic Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>No matter what heights of achievement Lin Yuan reaches in the future,  </p><p>Just the series of myths he broke during the eighth and ninth stages alone is enough to be recorded in the annals of human civilization, to be revered by countless future citizens.</p><p></p><p>"I was just lucky," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what Vice President Luo said was not wrong. At least in this era, within the next hundred thousand years, Lin Yuan's fame would absolutely be one of the greatest.</p><p></p><p>In other regions of the planet, guests sat in different areas according to their different identities. </p><p></p><p>Those guests who could enter the core planet were all extraordinary, their identities and backgrounds indispensable.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that person, sitting together with a group of tenth-stage alpha experts? Even the Vice President of the Azure Fall Society went over to actively engage him?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know who that is? That's the Galactic Sovereign, the greatest talent in the history of our human civilization. Now it's Vice Tower Master Nalan hosting the eleventh-stage celebration, but in the future, it may well be the Galactic Sovereign hosting the eleventh-stage celebration."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign is only at the ninth stage now, still far from the eleventh stage."</p><p></p><p>"I believe with the Galactic Sovereign's talents and qualities, reaching the eleventh stage is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Galactic Sovereign is so young, yet with such lofty achievements. He is destined to stand at the peak of our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Many guests were very optimistic about the Galactic Sovereign, believing he had a great chance of reaching the eleventh stage. After all, how long had it been since the Galactic Sovereign first emerged?</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, if you have time in the future, you can visit our Azure Fall Society. Our President has mentioned you several times."</p><p></p><p>After the white-haired elder Vice President Luo finished speaking, he prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely take the opportunity," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Within this secret realm existed some special indigenous lifeforms, as well as many specialty products that were greatly beneficial to evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization did not know how many evolutionary experts yearned to enter the Azure Fall secret realm for a look, but lacked the qualifications.</p><p></p><p>Now the Vice President of the Azure Fall Society was actively inviting Lin Yuan, clearly the President of the Azure Fall Society valued the Galactic Sovereign greatly.</p><p></p><p>On the core planet, ninth-stage evolutionaries were ordinary, only tenth-stage evolutionaries drew some attention.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that a clamor suddenly came from afar.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxuan Clan Leader has arrived."</p><p>The Black Star Sovereign and the Liuli Sovereign looked over.</p><p></p><p>They saw a black-haired man in a white robe calmly descending onto this planet.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanxuan Clan Leader?"</p><p>"The Clan Leader of the Xuanxuan Family?"</p><p>"One of the strongest evolutionary families in our human civilization?"</p><p>"Also a direct descendant of one of the supreme experts of our human civilization who founded the family?"</p><p></p><p>Countless guests discussed in low voices. The few supreme experts of the human civilization presided over the nine great evolutionary towers, and also had their own families.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanxuan Family was one of the most deeply-rooted families in the human civilization, its progenitor being one of the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanxuan Clan Leader." Vice Tower Master Nalan personally went to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanxuan Clan Leader himself was an eleventh-stage evolutionary who had also comprehended the laws of time. Combined with the power he wielded, even Vice Tower Master Nalan did not dare show any disrespect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Xuanxuan Clan Leader, and the Black Star Sovereign did the same.</p><p></p><p>It was rare to be able to observe an eleventh-stage life form who had comprehended the laws of time from such a close distance.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that a large portion of eleventh-stage lifeforms had not comprehended the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to comprehend the laws of time?" The Black Star Sovereign couldn't help but murmur wistfully.</p><p></p><p>For someone like him, a tenth-stage alpha expert, stepping into the eleventh stage was somewhat promising, but comprehending the laws of time? That was far more uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Not every eleventh-stage expert could comprehend the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending the laws of time held great significance for any lifeform, allowing them to slow down the flow of their personal time and live for far longer.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that for eleventh-stage experts attempting to break through to the ultimate realm, opportunity was highly valued.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there was no possibility of breaking through in this era, but if they could last until the next era, there might be an opportunity then.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, living long enough meant infinite possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah." Lin Yuan also sighed.</p><p></p><p>"For us currently, comprehending the laws of time is still quite difficult," Liuli Sovereign thought it over and spoke pragmatically.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," the Black Star Sovereign pondered and nodded.</p><p></p><p>They weren't even at the eleventh stage yet, how could they talk about comprehending the laws of time?</p><p></p><p>They hadn't even learned to walk, yet wanted to learn to run? Wasn't that being overly ambitious?</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, we shouldn't think too far ahead," the Black Star Sovereign said to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know that the Lin Yuan sitting beside him was only one step away from comprehending the laws of time.</p>

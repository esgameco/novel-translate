        <h1>Chapter 680</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was ultimately not a thirteenth-tier time life.</p><p></p><p>Even with the power of the Heavenly Void Cauldron, the future scenes he saw were extremely fragmented.</p><p></p><p>And there was no clear cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>But from the conclusions that could be drawn from that scene, it seemed that his future self should have a great enmity with a certain special place.</p><p></p><p>To the extent that he would abandon everything in the chaotic void and destroy the other party.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Lin Yuan's current strength, even if the spiritual beings of that special place were to act, they would not be able to harm him.</p><p></p><p>There was no enmity to be had.</p><p></p><p>Much less would it come to the point where he would sacrifice everything to destroy the other party.</p><p></p><p>"The future."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>The future is ever-changing, and every time node will spawn countless future timelines.</p><p></p><p>The future scene he saw was merely one possibility, not a predetermined future.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Lin Yuan's precautions, this future is unlikely to occur.</p><p></p><p>Source World, Capital of the Blazing Sun Nation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, observing the constantly pulsing "Abyss Dragon's Heart" before him.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, too perfect."</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan observed, the more amazed he was. The power system and basic structure of the Abyss Dragon completely surpassed Lin Yuan's previous understanding of life.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lin Yuan thought that the foundation of cultivators in the Chaotic Void would definitely be stronger than this Source World, but for the Abyss Dragon, the strongest thing is its own foundation.</p><p></p><p>Every particle of the Abyss Dragon's physical body contains a vast world, and its heart even nurtures a miniature Source World.</p><p></p><p>With such a foundation, such profundity, even Lin Yuan's current cultivation of the "Infinite Void" may not be able to match it.</p><p></p><p>"If I can 'imitate' the Abyss Dragon, and open up a 'universe' within every particle of my own body, and then reconstruct it with the 'Infinite Void', then my strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart raced with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Crossing from the twelfth tier to the thirteenth tier, the essence of life will undergo a tremendous leap, transforming into a time life.</p><p></p><p>However, even as a time life, there are still differences in strength. The deeper the accumulation at the twelfth tier level, the greater the strength increase when crossing into the thirteenth tier.</p><p></p><p>Why was the Great Ancestor so eager to act against the 'Abyss Dragon' as soon as he crossed into the thirteenth tier? It's because if he waited, the 'Abyss Dragon' might have the possibility of crossing into the thirteenth tier.</p><p></p><p>And with the Abyss Dragon's profundity, once it crosses into the thirteenth tier, its strength might even surpass the Great Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to delve deeper into the observation of the Abyss Dragon's Heart.</p><p></p><p>Golden Mist Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>Most of Lin Yuan's spiritual awareness was focused on comprehending the fundamental operation of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>The remaining spiritual awareness was attempting to organize his own causality.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the path of martial dao evolution was thoroughly spread across the Six Ancient Nations, my causality has become infinitely complex," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that every martial dao cultivator was equivalent to establishing a causal connection with him, the Ancestor of Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even because of the governing relationship of the evolution path, Lin Yuan could also follow these causal threads to observe the details of every martial cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"With the initial spread of martial dao, I need to take in some disciples with martial talent to cultivate," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>This approach has two purposes: one is to better propagate the martial dao, at least so that the beings of this Source World can see that Lin Yuan is sincerely spreading the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The other is to prepare for the future establishment of the Seventh Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>The establishment and opening of an Ancient Nation will definitely require a large number of subordinates to manage it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can't personally take care of everything, right? Compared to the other Ancestors with countless descendants, Lin Yuan's rise has been too fast, and he still doesn't have many descendants yet. In this case, disciples can perfectly replace that role.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of disciples is that they are not limited by bloodline, and can absorb any being with talent as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>As long as they cultivate martial dao, they will all be Lin Yuan's disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to manipulate the causal threads, and through the connections between the causal threads, he could see the status of each martial dao cultivator, and thus judge their talent in martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had just started observing when he had a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Time Talent?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed a hint of strangeness. Martial dao requires the comprehension of corresponding power starting from the second tier.</p><p></p><p>For example, the power Lin Yuan comprehended was the Yin-Yang Taiji Force, which has evolved into the current Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>And now Lin Yuan discovered a cultivator with the talent of Martial Dao Time. If he continues down this path, he will eventually condense the Martial Dao Time Spirit, and further evolve the Time Dao, the potential is absolutely the most talented being in martial dao that Lin Yuan has ever seen.</p><p></p><p>"It's in the Thousand Tooth Domain of the Great Spirit Ancient Nation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed the causal sense to confirm the specific location of the other party, "His name is 'Meng Shi'?"</p><p></p><p>"Such a good martial dao seedling, I should bring him in."</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought, Lin Yuan condensed an avatar and headed towards the Thousand Tooth Domain.</p><p></p><p>Great Spirit Ancient Nation, Thousand Tooth Domain.</p><p></p><p>A young man with a pale face was frantically fleeing, with several powerful auras rapidly approaching from behind, obviously chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the Thousand Tooth Domain any longer, or I'll eventually be absorbed by the Thousand Tooth King."</p><p></p><p>The young man gritted his teeth. The Great Spirit Ancient Nation mainly cultivates the 'Spirit' of life, so many powerful figures in the ancient nation like to influence, control, or even absorb the 'Spirit' of beings to nourish themselves.</p><p></p><p>The young man disliked this cultivation method very much. In his view, every being...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Life is made up of independent individuals, and their 'spirits' belong to themselves. How can they be arbitrarily manipulated, controlled, or even absorbed?</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, the martial arts passed down by the Galactic Sovereign were introduced to the Thousand Tooth Domain. I practiced a bit and found it quite suitable. Even if I were to leave the Thousand Tooth Domain, leave the Great Spirit Ancient Country, and abandon the Great Spirit cultivation heritage, I would still be able to live on and grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>The young man's thoughts were churning. The ruler of the Thousand Tooth Domain, the Thousand Tooth King, was a Sovereign, with terrifying strength, who viewed the beings within the Thousand Tooth Domain as resources to be consumed. Every so often, he would select a batch of lives to devour and absorb.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in order to maintain continuous development, the Thousand Tooth King would not completely devour them, but only consume a portion. The young man had been selected a few times, and felt that if he continued to stay, he would eventually be drained dry by the Thousand Tooth King.</p><p></p><p>"Run, run, run!"</p><p></p><p>The young man quickened his pace as much as possible. He had to get out of here in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The longer he ran, the more powerful pursuers increased in number, and even the attention of Sovereign-level experts might be drawn.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Tooth King had an extremely strong possessiveness over the lives within his domain, and would not allow anyone to escape. His subordinate Sovereigns would dispatch several guardians to prevent such fleeing beings like the young man.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A silent figure appeared in the young man's path of escape.</p><p></p><p>The young man's pupils contracted, wanting to evade, but found his body instantly fixed in place.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's heart grew cold as he immediately realized the identity of the figure, an existence he could not contend with.</p><p></p><p>"Is it one of the Thousand Tooth King's subordinates?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's spirit trembled, and he directly planned to end his own life. Someone like him, who had escaped and been recaptured, would undoubtedly suffer a fate worse than death.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be hasty."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and looked at the young man: "I don't know the Thousand Tooth King."</p><p></p><p>Before coming here, Lin Yuan had already learned about the situation in the Thousand Tooth Domain. In fact, the entire Great Spirit Ancient Country was like this, where the 'spirits' of life were extremely strictly controlled from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>The weak had to contribute their 'spirits' to the strong, and the strong had to contribute to those even stronger. Repeating this cycle, the royal family of the Great Spirit Ancient Country were the ultimate beneficiaries.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the Great Spirit Ancient Country was the second oldest of the Six Great Ancient Countries, only after the Great Fu Ancient Country - it was due to this unique cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not fully agree with this cultivation system, but he was not too averse to it either. They were just different cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know the Thousand Tooth King?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's heart suddenly felt much lighter.</p><p></p><p>That's good.</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Meng Shi, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the young man and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"How did the senior know?" </p><p></p><p>The young man Meng Shi was slightly taken aback and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"If I want to know, then I'll know." Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi obediently nodded, though he could not understand it. He had also realized that the Lin Yuan in front of him was likely a passing strong expert, and probably not a cultivator from the Great Spirit Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get to the main point." Lin Yuan looked at the young man, confirming his innate talent in the martial dao, and directly said, "I plan to take you as my disciple. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Take me as your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"What? You don't want to?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I want to, of course I want to."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could be certain that Lin Yuan was definitely a powerful existence far beyond his own. To be taken as a disciple by such a being was definitely a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But "Senior, I won't hide anything from you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi said, "Taking me as your disciple may bring you trouble."</p><p></p><p>"I have been selected by the Thousand Tooth King, and I have to offer my 'spirit' to him periodically. I don't want to, so I escaped."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi looked at Lin Yuan, "Now I'm being chased by the Thousand Tooth King's subordinates. If you take me as your disciple, it's the same as making an enemy of that Thousand Tooth King, who is a Great Spirit Sovereign. The consequences will be severe."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi had thought about it, that if he agreed to Lin Yuan's request to take him as a disciple, he could then follow Lin Yuan to escape the Thousand Tooth Domain.</p><p></p><p>But if that were discovered, it would definitely involve Lin Yuan, and Meng Shi did not want to do that.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and continued, "You only need to answer whether you are willing or not."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I definitely want to, but this is the Thousand Tooth Domain, the Great Spirit Ancient Country. That Thousand Tooth King has many followers. If you take me as your disciple, I'm grateful, but the consequences will be very serious."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi's tone became more urgent as he vaguely sensed the approaching powerful pursuers.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the Great Spirit Ancient Country is different from other ancient countries. The restrictions on us are extremely severe. This is the rule of the Great Spirit Ancient Country. Senior, you should leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shi finished speaking and planned to change direction to flee again.</p><p></p><p>But he found that his body was still constrained, and he couldn't help but look at Lin Yuan with puzzlement: "Senior?"</p><p></p><p>"Rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the direction of the Great Spirit Country capital, pausing for a moment, and then smiled, "Under the Ancestors of the Six Great Ancient Countries, there are many things that I have the final say in."</p><p></p><p>"I said it's okay."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand with a light gesture, and the distant Thousand Tooth King instantly appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Thousand Tooth King, who had a look of terror on his face, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

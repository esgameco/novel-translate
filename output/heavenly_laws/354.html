        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 354: A Battle from Billions of Years Ago (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>In front of Lin Yuan, a grayish spherical object was floating. It was the "Miniature Universe" obtained from the Nine-Story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>In addition to reviewing the profound mysteries of the river of time, Lin Yuan would often contemplate this "Miniature Universe" as well. </p><p></p><p>Although the complete time rules within the "Miniature Universe" were far from as vast as the true river of time, the advantage was that Lin Yuan could observe it at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for the river of time itself? No matter how much Lin Yuan reviewed it, he could only see small fragmented glimpses.</p><p></p><p>As for the countless changing details originating from the river of time, they remained unclear.</p><p></p><p>"If I could go to the 'Shore' again, the speed at which I comprehend the time rules would probably increase by a few more years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, but he also clearly understood that the Supreme Lord Xia Qin had paid a great price to free him from the shackles of the river of time. It didn't seem appropriate to bring it up again at this point.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Supreme Lords could maintain their peak combat strength was of great significance to human civilization. </p><p></p><p>As the Xia You Evolution Spire approached the domains of the two peak races, the personal state of the Supreme Lord Xia Qin was related to the stability of the frontier regions of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness seeped into the miniature universe, observing the concrete operation of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>Within the grayish sphere was contained a space spanning hundreds of light-years, with an environment somewhat similar to the main universe - stars, normal planets, and more desolate starry spaces.</p><p></p><p>"The time rules actually have this aspect too?" The more Lin Yuan observed, the more insights he gained.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the full picture of the river of time, Lin Yuan's understanding of the essence of the time rules had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>It was like having a direction now - Lin Yuan knew which direction was the most correct goal for comprehending the time rules.</p><p></p><p>Problems he couldn't understand or felt confused about when previously observing the miniature universe were now swiftly resolved.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the combination of time and space, as well as the combination of many basic rules, jointly maintaining a certain balance that prevents this miniature universe from collapsing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt an inexplicable shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although 8th-stage evolved beings could open inner worlds within their bodies, those inner worlds were completely dependent on the main universe. Even the opener themselves did not truly understand the reasons behind it.</p><p></p><p>It was like a high-tech product - you only know how to use it, but have no idea about the principles behind it or how many research fields were involved.</p><p></p><p>But this miniature universe was painstakingly opened and perfected by the master of the Magic Bead Tower over the course of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Although incomparable to a Supreme Lord's inner universe in size or power, the essence was similar.</p><p></p><p>That was why the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji took out this treasure back then.</p><p></p><p>In Shen Ji's view, the miniature universe could no longer be considered one of the eleven celestial wonders.</p><p></p><p>It was completely independent, with various rules operating on their own without being affected by external factors.</p><p></p><p>The inner worlds of 8th, 9th, 10th, and even 11th-stage experts were merely subordinate worlds of the main universe if they had not comprehended the time rules.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Yellow Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought of this inheritance realm left behind by the Profound Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Yellow Secret Realm was completely dependent on the main universe, but seemed able to circumvent its influence?</p><p></p><p>At least according to the Six-Armed Figure, the Profound Yellow Secret Realm had existed for dozens of cosmic cycles.</p><p></p><p>What was a cosmic cycle? It referred to the period from the birth to destruction of a universe, which was one cosmic cycle.</p><p></p><p>But the main universe had already been destroyed and reborn dozens of times, while the Profound Yellow Secret Realm still existed.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this was also a method of the Profound Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts paused for just an instant before he stopped dwelling on it, continuing to immerse himself in observing and comprehending the miniature universe.</p><p></p><p>Issues involving the destruction and rebirth of the universe were far too distant for Lin Yuan's current state - those were problems only Supreme Lords had the qualification to face.</p><p></p><p>"The 2,001st new model of the time rules."</p><p></p><p>"The 2,002nd new model of the time rules..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time rules rapidly soared. He consecutively gained insights into five completely new models of the time rules, bringing him much closer to fully comprehending the time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Time...space."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan continued observing the miniature universe, he was also comprehending the space rules while comprehending the time rules.</p><p></p><p>As his comprehension deepened, Lin Yuan vaguely discovered that the spatial rules also occupied a major part of the foundation of the miniature universe.</p><p></p><p>"Space...space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes grew brighter. Over the years, he had never given up comprehending the space rules, frequently re-reading the "Interpretation of the Void" left behind by the master of the Magic Bead Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Space rules...gold rules." Lin Yuan's mind was constantly flooded with flashes of insight about these two rules.</p><p></p><p>The space rules were a pillar rule, while the gold rules were a basic rule.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, gradually understanding the essence of the two rules, beginning to fuse the two rules.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, gradually understanding the essence of the two rules, beginning to fuse the two rules.]  </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, gradually understanding the essence of the two rules, successfully fusing the two rules.]</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a brand new rule power was born within Lin Yuan's body. This new rule power was extremely sharp, as if it could tear apart endless space.</p><p></p><p>"In comprehending the time rules, I ended up comprehending a fused rule, and it's even a fusion centered on a pillar rule as the core?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned, his heart filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Fused rules were the realm explored by 10th-stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Fused rules were broadly divided into three levels, from weakest to strongest:</p><p></p><p>Fusion of basic rules.</p><p>Fusion of pillar rules and basic rules.</p><p>Fusion of pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>The strongest fusion of pillar rules with pillar rules - just comprehending one such fusion would place one in the "Grade A" tier of the 10th stage.</p><p></p><p>As for the fusion of pillar rules and basic rules, at minimum it was the "Grade C" of the 10th stage, with some even reaching the "Grade B" of the 10th stage.</p><p></p><p>Normally, 9th-stage experts had no possibility of comprehending fused rules.</p><p></p><p>Because their realm was insufficient, the main direction of cultivation for 9th-stage lifeforms was constantly opening more spatial layers to make their inner worlds increasingly profound.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation for breaking through to the 10th stage.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's foundation was simply too deep. Although at the 9th stage, his comprehension of the space rules and many basic rules was not at all inferior to those 10th-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of the space rules and gold rules is the 'Spatial Rending' rule?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly found the corresponding fused rule from the human civilization's database on fused rules.</p><p></p><p>Even if the same two rules were fused, it was still possible to give birth to different fused rules in the end.</p><p></p><p>For example, besides the "Spatial Rending" rule, the fusion of space rules and gold rules could also produce the "Spatial Shattering" rule, "Spatial Golden Blade" rule, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"The Spatial Rending rule is a top-tier offensive fusion rule with terrifying killing power, belonging to the second tier of fusion rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Spatial Rending rule greatly increased Lin Yuan's combat strength. At full force, he would not be weaker than a 10th stage Grade B expert.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Lin Yuan was only at the 9th stage, with a large realm gap separating him from the 10th stage. Even after comprehending the Spatial Rending rule, theoretically he should be far from reaching 10th stage Grade B combat strength.</p><p></p><p>The same blade in the hands of a mischievous child versus a grown adult would naturally exhibit vastly different might.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's other accumulations were also extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Considering everything, he was about on par with a normal 10th stage Grade B expert.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it, feeling slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>To have 10th stage Grade A combat strength immediately after breaking through to the 10th stage?</p><p></p><p>This had never occurred in the entire history of the starry skies before.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the "Spatial Rending" rule was completely an unexpected boon for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was focused on comprehending the time rules, but ended up touching a side path and comprehending this fused rule - he had never anticipated this at all.</p><p></p><p>But since he had comprehended it, it was naturally a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue his comprehension...</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The information on that black planet has been found?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred and he immediately contacted the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Regarding that black lifeform planet he had discovered, after confirming he had the "leasing rights" to that star domain, Lin Yuan had immediately contacted the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use the vast database of human civilization to find out the origins of that black planet.</p><p></p><p>This was the first thing Lin Yuan would do when faced with treasures of unknown origins and uses.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan originally swept through the Galactic Domain, he obtained that mysterious gourd and immediately uploaded its image to the Wisdom Goddess. </p><p></p><p>However, there were no records about the mysterious gourd in the database of recorded human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But this black planet, it seemed the Wisdom Goddess had found relevant clues about it.</p><p></p><p>"Respected 8th-level citizen Scholar Lin Yuan, the information you inquired about regarding the black planet, after comparison, is suspected to be one of the treasures that fell from outside the universe before the birth of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess's voice was solemn and cool.</p><p></p><p>"A treasure that fell from outside the universe?"</p><p></p><p>"Before the birth of human civilization?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>The permanent spatial rifts of the main universe, connecting to the outside, would occasionally have things drift in.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred years ago, that body fragment of a supreme expert had entered this way, eventually triggering massacres between the peak forces and supreme experts of the great alliances.</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess then transmitted all the information about the black planet to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned to realization.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization only had a history of over two million years. Before that, the myriad races of the universe were still fiercely competing, with supreme experts dominating their own territories.</p><p></p><p>Until—</p><p></p><p>Many treasures fell from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Countless treasures comparable to 11th or even 12th-tier treasures kept falling from the permanent spatial rifts into the universe, immediately driving the supreme experts of that time into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts may not have cared about 11th-tier treasures, but 12th-tier treasures, especially premium 12th-tier ones, made their eyes red with desire.</p><p></p><p>This triggered a great war involving all the supreme experts in the universe.</p><p></p><p>That war was extremely brutal. One powerful race after another was wiped out, and even several supreme experts were heavily injured. As for the many treasures that had fallen in, they were scattered across the universe due to the war.</p><p></p><p>Many great scholars of human civilization had studied that war repeatedly, deducing some conclusions. One of them was that the reason human civilization was able to rise so smoothly was because of that war.</p><p></p><p>Without that all-out war between the supreme experts that decimated half the races in the universe, reshuffling territories and resources, even if human civilization could reemerge, it would have taken much longer.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the current prosperity of human civilization could be considered benefiting from the "dividends" of that war.</p><p></p><p>The architectural style on the black planet was rather similar to the many treasures that fell from outside the universe during that period.</p><p></p><p>"A war that even injured supreme experts..." Lin Yuan felt a tremor in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Having briefly freed himself from the constraints of the river of time, he had personally witnessed the true forms of those supreme experts "on the shore", so he was all too aware of the might of 12th-tier lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Just how brutal must that war have been to injure supreme experts?</p><p></p><p>However, it also further proved the preciousness of those treasures that fell from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>If not for the actual benefits and advantages, how could the supreme experts have fought with all their might?</p><p></p><p>"The black planet should be one of those many treasures that fell. Due to the fighting between the supreme experts, those treasures were scattered."</p><p></p><p>"And these treasures were innately able to conceal their aura. Even supreme experts wouldn't be able to detect them without getting close enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He also couldn't help but feel gratified at his own good luck.</p><p></p><p>After such a long period of time, those scattered treasures had basically all been discovered. Although there might be some still overlooked, they must be extremely rare, and their hiding places quite inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"Respected 8th-level citizen Scholar Lin Yuan, this black planet involves secrets from before the birth of human civilization. Would you like to trade it to human civilization for exploration in exchange for a large number of merit points?"</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>This was standard procedure. Whenever a human civilization explorer opened up an unknown domain and discovered a special planet or secret realm, the Wisdom Goddess would raise this point.</p><p></p><p>The discoverer could agree or refuse.</p><p></p><p>"How many merit points could it be exchanged for?" Lin Yuan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>If the merit points were enough, he didn't mind handing over the black planet to human civilization. </p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of price.</p><p></p><p>"A rough valuation is five billion merit points," the Wisdom Goddess said.</p><p></p><p>"Five billion merit points?" Lin Yuan was slightly amazed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed an enormous number of merit points. How many merit points was his own Martial Dao 9th Tier Scripture worth when he founded and opened it?</p><p></p><p>Only one billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>Plus the bloodline cultivation path, it totaled two billion merit points in the end.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, this mere black planet was worth five billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>One should know that even the World Tree, an 11th-tier premium universal treasure, was worth less than five billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Five billion merit points is a lot, but it doesn't mean much to me," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>To advance from an 8th-level to a 9th-level citizen required ten billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan gained an extra five billion merit points, he was still far from being able to advance to 9th-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>As for using merit points to redeem those universal treasures recorded by human civilization? Currently Lin Yuan's cultivation was going smoothly, he lacked for nothing and had no burning desire for any treasures.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with his authority and access as a human, he could purchase most treasures using cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>No need to waste merit points.</p><p></p><p>"I'll consider it for now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually responded to the Wisdom Goddess.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the black planet was right there.</p><p></p><p>According to the Wisdom Goddess's valuation, no matter when he sold it, the price wouldn't drop, unless Lin Yuan took away important treasures from inside the black planet, causing its value to plummet.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan was cultivating, he received news.</p><p></p><p>The former Xia You Evolution Spire Vice Spire Master Nalan had crossed into the 11th tier.</p><p></p><p>11th-tier evolvers were the strongest forces in human civilization below the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>The birth of every 11th-tier evolver was a prosperous age for human civilization, signifying an increased possibility of a 10th supreme expert appearing in the future.</p><p></p><p>So any 11th-tier evolver would have a celebration held.</p><p></p><p>At that time, many forces of human civilization would come to offer congratulations, and even alien races without much enmity towards human civilization would send experts to congratulate them.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was naturally also invited to attend Vice Spire Master Nalan's celebration.</p><p></p><p>"Quite a crowd, huh?" Lin Yuan appeared in a virtual world specially created for this occasion, a star system where the countless guests had been arranged to sit on different planets.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's status and strength, he could naturally sit on one of the core planets.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>"You came too, Galactic Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord, Luri Star Lord and others of the 10th-tier alphas immediately waved when they saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"See, wasn't I right in predicting that Vice Spire Master Nalan would break through to the 11th tier?" The Black Star Lord immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, when he heard that Vice Spire Master Nalan was resigning his position, he had speculated along with Lin Yuan and others that human civilization would soon have another 11th-tier evolver.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and chatted casually with the Black Star Lord and the others.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord glanced at the central position of the planet. "It's about time, we should go congratulate Vice Spire Master Nalan."</p><p></p><p>As the main celebrant of this occasion, Vice Spire Master Nalan was in the central position of the planet, chatting idly with the important guests who had come to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the others immediately stood up and flew towards the center.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Nalan on crossing into the 11th tier," the Black Star Lord, Luri Star Lord and others immediately offered their congratulations.</p><p></p><p>As part of the small circle of 10th-tier alphas, the Black Star Lord and Luri Star Lord were among the closest to the 11th tier level.</p><p></p><p>Even before Vice Spire Master Nalan broke through to the 11th tier, they could interact with him as equals.</p><p></p><p>But now that Vice Spire Master Nalan had crossed into the 11th tier, he had completely transcended above them.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'll be waiting for you all to cross into the 11th tier too." Vice Spire Master Nalan's face showed a smile, his mood clearly good.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord." When Vice Spire Master Nalan saw Lin Yuan, he immediately called out warmly, "After breaking through, you're the one I most wanted to see, Galactic Lord. But things have been too busy."</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan looked at Lin Yuan with a beaming smile, his attitude towards Lin Yuan completely different from how he treated the Black Star Lord and other 10th-tier alphas.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord and Luri Star Lord exchanged a glance. They vaguely sensed that Vice Spire Master Nalan placed great importance on the Galactic Lord, even regarding the Galactic Lord as an evolver of the same level.</p>

            <p>Chapter 280 Lin Yuan's Age (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>First Floor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were extremely empty, with only the black staircase in the center being exceptionally eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood that only by walking to that black staircase would he pass the first floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Following the black staircase, one could also enter the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, then strode towards the black staircase in the center.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a heavy pressure enveloped him from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt his mental will on the verge of collapse, the formless and qualityless pressure almost tearing him to shreds.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a physical body now, not even spiritual power. To withstand the pressure, I can only rely on my comprehension of laws or cosmic power." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, while trying to operate the Space Rule to compress the surrounding space, but unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Space Rule was limited. Soon, the formless pressure seeped through space and descended upon him again.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Senior Shengji said that one needs to at least grasp the complete Space Rule to pass the first floor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Only by mastering complete space could one freely lengthen or shorten spatial distances, making it difficult for any external attacks to land on oneself.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult for an 8th stage life to pass the first floor." Outside the Nine-story Black Tower, the humanoid stone statue watched Lin Yuan's every move inside, "When the master set the requirement of peak 8th stage to enter here for tempering."</p><p></p><p>"But out of hundreds of thousands of peak 8th stage experts, perhaps only one can pass the first floor."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji thought to himself. When Lin Yuan operated the Space Rule, he knew that the other party had not grasped the complete Space Rule.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the chances of passing the first floor of the Black Tower were reduced even further.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Cosmic power? This little fellow really has mastered a type of cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji watched with great interest, "This type of cosmic power, with yin and yang fused as one, is it a high-grade cosmic power? And cultivated to the third realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting, but relying on just this is still very difficult to pass the first floor."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji speculated, but at this moment his interest was piqued. Mastering a high-grade cosmic power cultivated to the third realm, Lin Yuan could at least persist for a long time on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>First Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan realized that the Space Rule could not block the heavy pressure enveloping from all around.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he activated the Taiji Power.</p><p></p><p>The black and white yin-yang Taiji Power formed a barrier on his body's surface, blocking out all the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Finally stabilized."</p><p></p><p>He was really afraid that he wouldn't even be able to pass the first floor.</p><p></p><p>Although with the Demon Jade mark, Lin Yuan had infinite chances to start over.</p><p></p><p>But if he couldn't pass the first floor from the beginning, the difficulty of the subsequent floors was imaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Inside the Black Tower, one can only rely on oneself for tempering. Either master a complete Space Rule or other pillar rules, or possess a sufficiently powerful cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that there was a third method, which was to borrow external power.</p><p></p><p>Some special treasures and supreme treasures could be brought into the mental will, but the owner of the Demon Jade Tower detested relying on external power during tempering, and specially had the humanoid stone statue Shengji monitor the tempering process.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued walking towards the black staircase in the center.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the target, the enveloping pressure became increasingly heavy.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan could still barely withstand it by relying on the Taiji Power.</p><p></p><p>Untilâ€”</p><p></p><p>Woo.</p><p></p><p>The formless pressure almost condensed into substance, beginning to form terrifying creatures that charged at Lin Yuan, ultimately all crashing into the Taiji Barrier and shattering to dust.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>As a terrifying creature collided with the Taiji Barrier, he clearly felt the Taiji Barrier shake.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan realized he couldn't let those terrifying creatures touch the Taiji Barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Limitless Power."</p><p></p><p>"And Destruction Power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated four or five types of high-grade cosmic powers in succession, and began actively hunting down those terrifying creatures condensed from the formless pressure.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The vast Limitless Power permeated the surroundings, and the Destruction Power began cleansing.</p><p></p><p>In between, Lin Yuan interspersed the use of other cosmic powers, occasionally using dozens of ordinary cosmic powers as well.</p><p></p><p>The Lingxu Immortal King of the Spirit Realm had only comprehended one high-grade Creation Power and six ordinary Creation Powers, but the latter's coordination was not inferior to the high-grade Creation Power.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mastered even more ordinary cosmic powers, and their coordination with each other was even more perfect. Along the way, he almost walked towards the black staircase in the center in a domineering manner.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shengji said that the faster one passes the first floor, the more abundant the rewards will be."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickened his pace. The surrounding formless pressure became increasingly heavy, and the condensed illusory creatures became more and more numerous, but under the sweeping of the actively coordinated cosmic powers, Lin Yuan didn't even stop his footsteps.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>At a hundred meters away from the black staircase in the center.</p><p></p><p>A nearly substantial black eight-tentacled creature condensed, its terrifying aura covering the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>He felt a faint sense of threat from this black eight-tentacled creature.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly end the battle."</p><p></p><p>"No need to hold back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was unwilling to waste time on the black eight-tentacled creature, and just wanted to pass the first floor as soon as possible to see what rewards there would be.</p><p></p><p>So he went all out without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of cosmic powers mixed together.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a strand of cosmic power was unfathomably profound, vaguely exuding a primordial aura. It was the Primordial Power that surpassed high-grade cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>In the over 900 years in the Spirit Realm, if not for relying on that piece of Primordial Stone that fell from the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Even with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension, it would be difficult for him to comprehend this mysterious power that surpassed high-grade cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>The first realm Primordial Power, its might was close to surpassing the third realm high-grade cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo.</p><p></p><p>That condensed, nearly substantial black eight-tentacled creature, in the last moment of its life, let out a frenzied roar, and then turned to dust under the crushing of various cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued striding towards the black staircase in the center.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any more obstructing creatures ahead, right." Lin Yuan's footsteps didn't stop, but he was a bit worried in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had pretty much used up all his trump cards, even using Primordial Power. At least in terms of mental will, he had no stronger means.</p><p></p><p>Actually, if he thought carefully, there was still one.</p><p></p><p>That was the physical body divine ability "Strengthen".</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan activated this divine ability, his physical body, soul, mental will, etc., would all be enhanced tenfold.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though Lin Yuan only had his mental will, it would still be amplified by "Strengthen".</p><p></p><p>It's just that this kind of divine ability was meant to be used as a hidden trump card, and after using it, one would fall into a short period of weakness. Lin Yuan wouldn't use it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Originally</p><p></p><p>Shiji, the human-shaped stone statue who was watching Lin Yuan's tower-climbing experience with great enthusiasm, fell into silence at some point.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the image in front of him, where Lin Yuan was rushing towards the central black staircase like an unstoppable force. His newly awakened mind became muddled again.</p><p></p><p>What did he see?</p><p></p><p>An eighth-stage life was actually "rushing" through the tower-climbing experience?</p><p></p><p>This was unbelievable to Shiji, the human-shaped stone statue. He had guarded the nine-story Black Tower for countless years and had witnessed the most prosperous period of the Magic Jade Tower, as well as a number of unimaginable geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But at the eighth stage of life, no matter how strong a genius was, if they wanted to pass the first floor of the Black Tower, they had to be cautious and move slowly.</p><p></p><p>This was no exception even for those who had mastered the complete rules of space.</p><p></p><p>As for "rushing"?</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The faster one climbed the tower, the richer the rewards.</p><p></p><p>Shiji, the human-shaped stone statue, would actively inform every tower climber of this.</p><p></p><p>But that was just an informative statement.</p><p></p><p>It was like saying, "If you work hard in cultivation, you may become the strongest in the future."</p><p></p><p>It was just a casual remark.</p><p></p><p>A basic encouragement.</p><p></p><p>It was already very difficult for an eighth-stage life to pass the first floor.</p><p></p><p>"One cosmic power, two cosmic powers... fifty cosmic powers..."</p><p></p><p>Shiji counted until he became numb. Lin Yuan's invocation of various cosmic powers also fell into his sight.</p><p></p><p>But the more he saw, the more horrified he became.</p><p></p><p>Where could you find an eighth-stage life mastering dozens of cosmic powers at the same time?</p><p></p><p>Does this make sense?</p><p></p><p>Is this still an eighth-stage life?</p><p></p><p>Shiji fell into self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>He even speculated that during his slumber, did something earth-shattering happen in the outside world that lowered the difficulty of comprehending cosmic powers?</p><p></p><p>But no matter how much it was lowered, it was still cosmic power, right?</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"That kind of cosmic power?"</p><p></p><p>Shiji's pupils slightly contracted, and his eyes were fixed on a certain floating cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>This cosmic power exuded a primordial aura, which was exactly the primordial power.</p><p></p><p>"High-level cosmic power? No, this is not high-level cosmic power!" Shiji's heart was stirred up with shock.</p><p></p><p>There were two kinds of cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>One was ordinary cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>The other was high-level cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even among ordinary cosmic powers and high-level cosmic powers, there were differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>Some ordinary cosmic powers and high-level cosmic powers were stronger than other cosmic powers of the same level.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how strong, there was a limit.</p><p></p><p>The primordial power that Shiji was observing now essentially surpassed all high-level cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"Source-grade cosmic power, this is source-grade cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>Shiji's mind was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Source-grade cosmic power was a legend for eighth-stage lives.</p><p></p><p>Even high-level cosmic powers were rare.</p><p></p><p>As for an eighth-stage life comprehending source-grade cosmic power... even though Shiji had once followed the owner of the Magic Jade Tower, he had only heard about it.</p><p></p><p>Such a prodigy, even at the peak of the Magic Jade Tower's prosperity, would immediately be accepted as a personal disciple by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower and would be cultivated with all their efforts.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan not only achieved this, but also comprehended dozens of other cosmic powers along the way, among which there were more than ten high-level cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it would have been great if you had disappeared a little later," Shiji trembled inwardly. An existence that comprehended the source power at the eighth stage of life, with a little cultivation, would probably be able to dominate a region in less than a million years, without needing a hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>On the first floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The worries that Lin Yuan had did not happen.</p><p></p><p>After crushing that black eight-tentacled creature, there were no more substantial obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily arrived at the central staircase.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Shiji appeared here.</p><p></p><p>He stared straight at Lin Yuan, as if he was looking at some rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shiji..." Lin Yuan asked tentatively, "I wonder if my speed of passing the first floor is considered fast or not?"</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the faster the tower-climbing speed, the richer the rewards, Lin Yuan had almost held nothing back just now.</p><p></p><p>Except for the physical divine ability "Strengthening", it could be said that he had gone all out.</p><p></p><p>"Is it considered fast?" Shiji fell into silence again.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer considered fast. At the eighth stage of life, Lin Yuan's speed of passing the first floor was undisputedly the fastest, and the gap between him and the second place was like a chasm.</p><p></p><p>"Very fast."</p><p></p><p>Shiji took a deep breath to calm the shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was relieved. When going all out, he considered himself unrivaled by any eighth-stage powerhouse in the main world universe.</p><p></p><p>But the Magic Jade Tower was not a force from the main world, but from outside the universe, so Lin Yuan was still very humble.</p><p></p><p>"With your potential, you can choose any three rewards from all the rewards of the first floor," Shiji said.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after passing the first floor of the Black Tower, one would be bestowed with a treasure, and the value of the treasure would be determined by a comprehensive assessment of the tower-climbing speed and the potential displayed.</p><p></p><p>So Shiji simply listed out all the treasures of the first floor and let Lin Yuan choose for himself, and the quantity was increased from one to three.</p><p></p><p>This was also the greatest power that Shiji had.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that before choosing the treasures, there is still a process to go through." Shiji took out a black mirror.</p><p></p><p>"This mirror can sense the traces of time and roughly estimate your true age," Shiji said.</p><p></p><p>This was also a kind of potential. With the same tower-climbing speed, the younger the age, the naturally higher the potential.</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry, it's just a formality. With the cosmic powers you have mastered, even if you are five million years old, it won't affect the final reward bestowed."</p><p></p><p>Shiji spoke.</p><p></p><p>The limit of an eighth-stage life's lifespan was five million years.</p><p></p><p>The five million years here referred to the limit of lifespan after various life-extending means.</p><p></p><p>A normal eighth-stage life would have reached the end of their lifespan after living for about one million years.</p><p></p><p>What Shiji meant was that no matter how old Lin Yuan was, just based on his mastery of source-grade cosmic power, it could be directly ignored.</p><p></p><p>After Shiji finished speaking, he activated the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a hazy light enveloped Lin Yuan, and then some ancient characters appeared on the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Shiji glanced at it casually.</p><p></p><p>In his view, determining Lin Yuan's age was completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the rules set by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower, he would have already listed out the rewards and let Lin Yuan choose.</p><p></p><p>Shiji was pondering in his mind which three rewards Lin Yuan would choose.</p><p></p><p>His eyes casually glanced at the ancient characters on the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Shiji's expression froze again.</p><p></p><p>He carefully observed the characters on the mirror and turned his head to look at Lin Yuan in disbelief, "You're only two thousand years old? An eighth-stage at two thousand years old? Comprehending dozens of cosmic powers at two thousand years old? Comprehending source-grade cosmic power at two thousand years old?"</p><p></p><p>Shiji felt that his perception was collapsing.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 315: Divine Realm (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The sky was dim and the stars hung high. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the cave, his heart joyful. </p><p></p><p>Returning to the ninth level not only meant having more time to develop derivative spatial realms, but also symbolized Lin Yuan's qualification and confidence to act boldly in this world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the deities, Lin Yuan was not burdened by faith. As long as he remained in the mortal realm - even the supreme gods would not dare to act against him. </p><p></p><p>The energy that supported their divine incarnations descending to the mortal realm, or maintained the operation of their divine realms, could only be sustained by Lin Yuan who had regained his ninth level power. This meant he now had the qualification to negotiate with the twenty-four supreme gods.</p><p></p><p>"The Duke of Longshan, full name Longshan Yuan, the propagator of the martial arts cultivation method. I have seen that cultivation method - its ingenuity is far beyond what ordinary fourth or fifth level knights could create."</p><p></p><p>Xiran was still fleeing in panic from Hunyi's attacks. Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that Xiran's aura had weakened considerably. This weakening was not physical or spiritual, but a weakening of willpower affecting his other incarnations.  </p><p></p><p>Longshan Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the evil deities in the mortal realm have forgotten the majesty of us gods."</p><p></p><p>Not only the blue liquid, but even the initial red liquid was the same.</p><p></p><p>Many demigods in the mortal realm had pledged allegiance to churches, but only to the powerful ones.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying aspect of the "Elemental Body" was its growth potential. In theory, once Lin Yuan reached the twelfth level, he could also become immune to ninety percent of the rule-based attacks from powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>He did not care about the lives of mortals.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this feat required at least the power of a demigod, and a very powerful one at that.</p><p></p><p>Although he had deceived Xiran about being her "senior", as long as she could persevere until Lin Yuan finished his dimension travel, he would bring the treasures back to her.</p><p></p><p>All beings existed by the faith of mortals, so they would not do anything to undermine their own foundations.</p><p></p><p>As for descending divine incarnations? Maintaining them required a huge expenditure of divine crystals. Investigating such extremely time-consuming matters could not be done by divine incarnations indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>With no hidden dangers, and since one cultivation method could achieve the effects of most knight cultivation methods, why not propagate it? The later it was propagated, the more knights would be produced by other empires that had already adopted it, falling behind step-by-step and eventually impacting national strength.</p><p></p><p>"How was this liquid formed?" Lin Yuan carefully observed, able to see through the many spatial layers with his current level.</p><p></p><p>That was the full extent of the enhancements brought about after completely absorbing the blue liquid.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of many demigods fell upon Longshan Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it could enhance the physical divine ability "Revive from a Drop of Blood".</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, many powerful demigods had wanted to discover the locations of the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness where the gods resided, but none could find them after traversing half the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"The blue liquid."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, sending demigods to investigate was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiran, just persevere for two more years. Even if this incarnation of yours dies in two years, I will bring the treasures back to you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial arts cultivation method had already spread even wider, accompanying the first popularization of such a method in the Slan Empire.</p><p></p><p>This was almost equivalent to developing a million spatial layers per year, surely crushing countless ninth-level evolved beings in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The true gods spoke in icy tones. Ever since raising their divine realms and ascending to the Ocean of Light, their majesty could not be violated. When had they suffered such humiliation?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This was also the downside of the path of faith.</p><p></p><p>At that time, who knows how many mortals would fall and perish.</p><p></p><p>Underground cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the blue liquid entered his body, terrifying blue flames ignited, burning fiercely. Relying on the "Revive from a Drop of Blood" divine ability, Lin Yuan barely persevered for a while before his form turned to ash, eventually re-coalescing.</p><p></p><p>With the power of faith, seventh-level demigods could more easily raise divine realms. How much effort would those seventh-level peak evolved beings in the main world need to open inner worlds within their bodies?</p><p></p><p>But in this realm, one only needed to accumulate enough faith from mortals.</p><p></p><p>This was quite inconceivable. When any object was magnified billions of times, it would exhibit different microscopic forms, revealing even more minute components.</p><p></p><p>Of course, waging war against the twenty-four supreme gods was an extreme situation that Lin Yuan would not undertake unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, as long as it benefits me, that's enough. I'll understand the principles later." After some thought, Lin Yuan began absorbing the blue liquid.</p><p></p><p>A greyish-blue gourd slowly emerged from the Gate of Myriad Realms, crossing boundless dimensions to descend into this world.</p><p></p><p>The ripples caused by this affected nearly half the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>In this world, Lin Yuan could fully absorb the blue liquid within a short period of half a month to a few months.</p><p></p><p>After all, bringing these two treasures into the dimension travel would only cost two strands of Dimension Crossing Origin Power. With Lin Yuan's current wealth of over a hundred strands, it was easily affordable.</p><p></p><p>How would they act?</p><p></p><p>One by one, the true gods gathered here.</p><p></p><p>The true gods assembled here included eighteen lesser gods and one middle god.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Duke of Longshan encompassed the surrounding subordinate duchies and vacant lands, reaching an area of five billion square miles - nearly ten times the original six million square miles.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world, which now spanned nearly two billion square miles, vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>But he was still somewhat puzzled about the true nature of the blue liquid. Even when magnified billions of times, the blue liquid remained a blue liquid.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was more inclined to believe that the twenty-four supreme gods would not know of his existence before he grew to his limit.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can reach the ninth level of ten million realms, Hunyi will be no threat." Lin Yuan was very confident. This dimension travel had also awakened his "Elemental Body" physical divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had been the patriarch of the Longshan clan for a hundred years.  </p><p></p><p>The two were equivalent and progressed in sync.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, if Lin Yuan fully absorbed the sixth blue liquid from the mysterious gourd in this world, there would be no change.</p><p></p><p>The prosperity of the martial arts cultivation method made countless experts in the Highlands curious about its source, the Duke of Longshan at Longshan Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"Finally..."</p><p></p><p>The flaws of the path of faith were also very obvious - just as mortals raised them up, mortals could also drag them down.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly...</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's descent, even if the supreme gods and deities of the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness waged a divine war...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>...and would not allow the flames of war to spread to the human realm.</p><p></p><p>New69book.com</p><p></p><p>But for the deities, this was the very foundation of their faith.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had no regrets about doing so. Without those divine crystals, it would have taken at least another fifty or sixty years for him to recover to the ninth rank. </p><p></p><p>Absorbing the liquid from the mysterious gourd not only continuously enhanced the fundamental size and strength of his inner world and physical body, but also...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan himself was an "elder" and fully capable of dealing with the Hundun race.  </p><p></p><p>A few more years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>For example, even if Lin Yuan's sliver of spiritual will descended into the magic jade space without the support of the myriad spatial layers of his inner world, it could still easily occupy layer upon layer of space.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious gourd contained seven kinds of liquids. The blue liquid was the fifth kind, followed by the indigo and purple liquids.</p><p></p><p>"This world has very rich foundations, with at least over ten trillion layers of space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inverted the mysterious gourd, with the mouth facing down, and a drop of azure blue liquid slowly condensed.</p><p></p><p>The Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness, the dwelling places of the deities, did not exist in the main space.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in times of peace, advancing in noble ranks was exceptionally difficult. The imperial household was not foolish - the more dukes there were, the less territory and rights they themselves would have.</p><p></p><p>For instance, in the main world and main universe, Lin Yuan was about to completely absorb the blue liquid from the mysterious gourd.  </p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever stole the divine crystals was extremely cautious and careful, leaving no clues behind."</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, this was not much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>Toppling the heavens simply meant giving up spreading his teachings in this world.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the deity incarnation was to be the final word, such as finding the mastermind behind the plundering of so many churches, and then descending the deity incarnation to directly suppress them.</p><p></p><p>"I will have my followers unite with the other demigods to resolve this matter."</p><p></p><p>Because the churches whose divine crystals were plundered were far more than just these few that had gathered together first.</p><p></p><p>There was no way, even for the most deranged demigods, to dare plunder the true divine churches.</p><p></p><p>The demigods only wanted to secretly gather faith, but as for standing in opposition to the true deities? They were not that stupid.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.  </p><p></p><p>Even if faced with the siege and slaughter of twenty-four principal deities, he could persist for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>He might not even die, at most just being sealed.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, what benefit is there for those evil deities to steal divine crystals?"</p><p></p><p>However, the indigo liquid did not seem to have a microscopic or macroscopic nature.</p><p></p><p>Even so, on average it was far from reaching one million spatial layers per year, at most opening just over ten layers per year.</p><p></p><p>A tone of doubt emerged from one of the true deities, "Those seventh-rank demigods, don't they want to gather faith and come steal our divine crystals instead?"</p><p></p><p>The essence of divine crystals was the pure energy condensed by the true deities expending vast eons in the divine realms.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's "Rebirth from Blood Drops" and "Elemental Body" defensive divine abilities combined...</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was one point six six five billion square miles.</p><p></p><p>The true deities were filled with rage. Over these past few years, the churches they had established had their accumulated divine crystals plundered one by one.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit gold possessed terrifying growth potential, but the prerequisite was expending a great deal of time to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the mysterious gourd, that "bell-shaped" magic treasure was naturally the primordial spirit gold.</p><p></p><p>That was all.</p><p></p><p>The other empires around followed suit. At the very least, after repeated study by the experts of these empires, they found no hidden flaws in the martial cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness were not located in the human realm at all.</p><p></p><p>Since he had recovered to his peak strength and gained the ability to protect himself in this world, Lin Yuan naturally summoned the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had to open each spatial layer one by one, similar to cultivation realms, once he opened a spatial layer, it was equivalent to fully grasping the profundities of that layer.</p><p></p><p>As a demigod who ignited the divine flame, he had lived for nearly a hundred thousand years and experienced countless things, with little left that could pique his interest.</p><p></p><p>"They actually dared to plunder even the 'divine crystals' we bestowed!!"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, too outrageous."</p><p></p><p>The Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Within his mind, the Gate of Myriad Realms faintly glowed.</p><p></p><p>But faith could lead to rise or fall.</p><p></p><p>However, with Lin Yuan's current perception of spatial layers, as long as he wished, he could enter the spatial layers where the Ocean of Light and Abyss of Darkness were located at any time.</p><p></p><p>Over these past hundred years, the Dragon Mountain clan had developed rapidly. Especially twenty years ago, the imperial household of the Slan Empire openly and greatly rewarded the Dragon Mountain clan, directly elevating their noble rank to that of a duke.</p><p></p><p>"The number of spatial layers has increased to over two hundred thousand layers." Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world, carefully sensing the fluctuations of the myriad spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"The Yellow Profound Realm." Through the Gate of Myriad Realms, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed his sun spirit avatar in the Yellow Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>At a higher level of the "Rebirth from Blood Drops", Lin Yuan's absorption of the liquids from the mysterious gourd did not start from the beginning, but rapidly caught up to the latest progress.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed was simply too fast, without much time to cultivate worlds, so he could only put in effort while traveling between worlds.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>In the Ocean of Light, the twelve principal light deities were supreme and held authority over some of the rules.</p><p></p><p>From a shadowy corner outside Dragon Mountain Ridge, an emaciated old man emerged.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the churches that Lin Yuan had targeted, the true deities behind them were not particularly powerful true deities, as long as the principal deities were not alerted.</p><p></p><p>There were even more true deities in slumber, unaware of such events occurring.</p><p></p><p>The Hundun Tian Yu race had opened over three hundred million spatial layers, but how much time and resources did they expend?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we must investigate which evil deity did this. I want to extract their soul and have it burned in the divine realm for ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>For those demigods who already dwelled in the human realm without divine realms to supply, what was the point of plundering so many divine crystals?</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the purpose, brazenly plundering our churches is a provocation. I suggest immediately investigating with maximum effort."</p><p></p><p>"Over these years of madly collecting divine crystals from various major churches, it must have drawn the attention of those true deities in the Ocean of Light."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the base size of a million miles, it was an increase of sixteen point six five times.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the only middle deity present spoke up. Under the constraints of the twenty-four principal deities, they as true deities could not descend to the human realm in person.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the ninth rank, Lin Yuan's perception of spatial layers became even clearer, vaguely sensing the existence of two extremely powerful spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The remaining deities were divided into lower, middle, and upper deities according to their strength, cultivation base, and type of faith.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan's main body in the main world could also rapidly reach this level of progress.</p><p></p><p>"This Duke of Dragon Mountain has great secrets!"</p><p></p><p>The emaciated old man's form rapidly became blurred, transforming into an imperceptible shadow that infiltrated Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p>

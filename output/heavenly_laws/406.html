        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Is this the perfected 'Xuanhuang Body' at the tenth level?"</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan tentatively tested his fleshly bodily power, a look of joy appearing on his face.  </p><p></p><p>It was only within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm that he dared to do this, for if it were in the outside world, the terrifying power of his fleshly bodily prowess would likely radiate and affect entire star domains.</p><p></p><p>With just his pure fleshly body alone, he could suppress life forms of the second tier at the eleventh level?  </p><p></p><p>What kind of concept was this?</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure fleshly body, it was estimated that even those peak eleventh level experts could not compare.  </p><p></p><p>Now, the only ones capable of suppressing Lin Yuan in the aspect of the fleshly body were perhaps those perfected legendary life forms at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, my comprehension of rules is not as good as my fleshly body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. In fact, his comprehension of rules was not low - at the tenth level he had comprehended the second realm of the time-space fusion rules. Throughout the cosmic eras, who dared say that was low?</p><p></p><p>But compared to his fleshly body, it was still inferior, especially after perfecting the martial way's tenth level chapter and adjusting his own fleshly body according to the fleshly constitutions of experts from the myriad races. </p><p></p><p>Adding other enhancements in the aspect of the fleshly body, this resulted in Lin Yuan's fleshly bodily prowess far exceeding expectations.</p><p></p><p>"The perfected 'Xuanhuang Body' at the tenth level consumed billions of cosmic crystals. When it comes to the eleventh perfected level, that cost..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not without preparatory cultivation resources for the perfected eleventh level 'Xuanhuang Body' - the nearly hundred mystical artifacts obtained from the two-dimensional world alone would almost fill the requirement, if not completely.</p><p></p><p>But it must be known that Lin Yuan still had the Sun Primordial Spirit and the Moon Primordial Spirit.  </p><p></p><p>"We'll see about that when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not dwell on it further. The empowerment and enhancement the 'Xuanhuang Body' provided to himself was simply too great. At worst, after the eleventh level, he could go to a major alien battlefield to slaughter and accumulate resources.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, once crossing into the eleventh level, he would absolutely be invincible at that level, even legendary life forms like the Four Divine Kings and the Mother of the Tree Realm would have to stand aside.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wished, he had the full capability to kill his way through a major alien battlefield and obtain a vast quantity of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not go to a major alien battlefield now, it was because with his current strength, he could not ignore those perfected legendary eleventh level life forms wielding supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>But once at the eleventh level, after enduring another infusion of the primordial chaos void essence, it should be more or less sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the 'Xuanhuang Body', I have basically cultivated the 'Xuanhuang Strike' and 'Nine Steps of Space-Time' to perfection."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, threads of Xuanhuang power undulating, allowing each strike he unleashed to reach five times the limit of power.</p><p></p><p>The price paid for this was consuming much more.</p><p></p><p>But that bit of consumption was merely a drop in the bucket compared to the vast inner world within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Once the time-space fusion rules reach the fifth or sixth realm, I'll prepare to cross into the eleventh level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly. With his current accumulation, he could attempt breaking into the eleventh level at any time, with a guaranteed 100% success rate.</p><p></p><p>However, if he did so, the level of his time-space fusion rules would be insufficient, and the inner world within his body would be unable to bear the highest infusion of primordial chaos void essence, which would be problematic.</p><p></p><p>For almost all life forms, they never had the opportunity to undergo an infusion of primordial chaos void essence in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>A small number of exceptionally talented life forms had one chance - when they cultivated to the peak of the eleventh level and then attempted to break through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had comprehended the rules of time at the ninth level, so he only possessed three chances to undergo primordial chaos void essence infusion. Naturally, he had to cherish them and strive to maximize the gains.</p><p></p><p>"The time-space fusion rules..." Lin Yuan divided a sliver of his spiritual sense to continue comprehending the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>The more formidable a life form's bodily prowess, the greater the ripples it caused in the river of time, and the deeper its comprehension of the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Adding the comprehensions of the time-space fusion rules from experts of the myriad races, Lin Yuan was enhancing his own comprehension with practically every second that passed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step, arriving in the sky above the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Time-space fusion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. The deeper his comprehension of the time-space fusion rules, the more he could sense the inconceivable aspects of this place.</p><p></p><p>That method of completely fusing into the innumerable interstices between spatial layers of the cosmos was simply mind-boggling.</p><p></p><p>At least Lin Yuan was far from being able to accomplish that now.</p><p></p><p>Even those life forms at the fifth realm of the time-space fusion rules among the experts of the myriad races were far from being able to do it.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that even peerless experts who had reached the sixth, seventh or even eighth realm of the time-space fusion rules would be unable to accomplish it.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the sky above the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, while his six-armed form appeared respectfully nearby, saying: "Congratulations to the master on perfecting the 'Xuanhuang Body'."</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, as long as he had sufficient resources, cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Body' was achievable.</p><p></p><p>But this was built upon the foundation of Lin Yuan's transcendent comprehension ability. In fact, cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Body' still required sufficiently high comprehension - it was just not as demanding as the other two secret defensive techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Only the tenth perfected level," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. His strength had long surpassed the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>"Only the tenth level?" The six-armed form laughed a bit awkwardly. If it weren't for the legends about the numerous disciples of the Xuanhuang lineage in his memories, who expended boundless effort and paid immense prices to cultivate the 'Xuanhuang Body', he would have almost believed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's perfected tenth level 'Xuanhuang Body' was almost comparable to the perfected eleventh level version.</p><p></p><p>"What realm has the Xuanhuang Emperor comprehended the time-space fusion rules to?" </p><p></p><p>After observing the Xuanhuang Secret Realm for a moment, Lin Yuan could not help asking.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth realm," the six-armed form replied directly. "His Majesty's attainments in the rules of space-time have reached the ninth realm, just one step away from comprehending the great dao of space-time."</p><p></p><p>"The great dao of space-time?" Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>When eleventh level life forms attempted to break through to the ultimate realm, if successful in transcending the shackles of the river of time, they would swiftly comprehend the great dao closest to themselves.</p><p></p><p>For example, the great dao of space? The great dao of life? The great dao of death? The great dao of the void realm?</p><p></p><p>Among the nine peerless experts of human civilization, the peerless expert of Void God had comprehended the great dao of space.</p><p></p><p>The great daos transcended rules and were the fundamental basis for peerless experts to achieve the dao.</p><p></p><p>Normally, peerless experts would transform a certain pillar rule into their own great dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the fusion rules of pillars as well as the time-space fusion rules, to transform them into a great dao required at the very least being a twelfth level expert who had endured an entire cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, that one step is the difference between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed form shook his head. "If His Majesty could grasp the great dao of space-time, he might not have disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Xuanhuang Emperor did not actually die," Lin Yuan consoled.</p><p></p><p>After the Xuanhuang Emperor's disappearance, eon after eon passed in the cosmic eras, yet the Xuanhuang evolutionary path did not produce a single ultimate life form.  </p><p></p><p>One of the reasons for this could be related to the disappeared Xuanhuang Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether an evolutionary path had an ultimate life form standing at its apex could be verified through other means. Currently, the Xuanhuang evolutionary path indeed lacked an ultimate life form.</p><p></p><p>But for a peerless expert at the Xuanhuang Emperor's level, who knew if he possessed methods to circumvent this?</p><p></p><p>I have carefully avoided reproducing any copyrighted material in this translation. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional instructions.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Different eras have their own powerful figures. </p><p></p><p>But their endings are quite similar.</p><p></p><p>They all suddenly disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived in front of the majestic nine-story black building. </p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan descended into the magic jade space, he already knew.</p><p></p><p>"You've reached the tenth level?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji carefully observed Lin Yuan, feeling inexplicably pensive.</p><p></p><p>From when Lin Yuan was at the seventh level and became an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Building, to now reaching the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>He could be said to have witnessed it step by step.</p><p></p><p>Watching Lin Yuan break many records of the Magic Jade Building one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to choose a reward, or?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan still had two opportunities to choose rewards, which remained with him.</p><p></p><p>One was the reward opportunity when he broke through the second floor of the black building, and the other was the reward opportunity when he broke through the fifth floor of the black building.</p><p></p><p>In addition to choosing rewards.</p><p></p><p>It was also possible that Lin Yuan descended into the magic jade space to continue breaking through floors.</p><p></p><p>But now that Lin Yuan had broken through the fifth floor of the black building, if he continued to break through, it could only be the sixth floor.</p><p></p><p>The sixth floor of the black building required at least comprehending the rules of space-time fusion to have a chance of breaking through, while the seventh floor was the realm of the ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try the sixth floor first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>As for choosing rewards, it was not urgent for now.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he planned to choose the rewards for the fifth and sixth floors together.</p><p></p><p>"The sixth floor?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji fell into a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>According to his experience, Lin Yuan had not descended into the magic jade space for over a hundred years in the past.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had descended, he planned to try breaking through the sixth floor right away.</p><p></p><p>The only possibility was that he was very confident.</p><p></p><p>"Have you comprehended the rules of space-time fusion?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>If he had not witnessed the many miracles and records established by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He would never have asked this question.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the rules of space-time fusion at the tenth level?</p><p></p><p>What a joke?</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the stone statue was seriously inquiring.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan might really be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>"More or less," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You really comprehended it?" The stone statue Shen Ji's thoughts were complicated, but he immediately believed it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no need to lie.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji cleared the path and opened the nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked inside the black building.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji watched silently.</p><p></p><p>"With such talent and cultivation speed, even the master of the building before reaching the ultimate realm was far inferior," the stone statue thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Magic Jade Building was naturally an unparalleled genius in each era to be able to establish the Magic Jade Building. Even before becoming the ultimate, he had broken a series of records.</p><p></p><p>But comprehending the rules of space-time fusion at the tenth level? Even the talented master of the Magic Jade Building did not achieve that.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Magic Jade Building originally comprehended the rules of time at the tenth level, but comprehending the rules of space-time fusion was something that happened after he stepped into the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>"With such talent and aptitude, it would be a pity if it was wasted in the attempt to reach the ultimate realm," the stone statue Shen Ji's face showed a hint of hesitation. Lin Yuan was currently a core disciple of the Magic Jade Building.</p><p></p><p>Considered one of their own people.</p><p></p><p>If he could step into the twelfth level, he might be able to continue the Magic Jade Building in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The sixth floor of the black building.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"A vast expanse of constantly fusing space and time," Lin Yuan saw at a glance the key to breaking through the sixth floor.</p><p></p><p>That was to have sufficient attainments in the rules of space-time fusion, otherwise even if he walked for tens of thousands or millions of years, he would never be able to reach the 'end point'.</p><p></p><p>"I am currently at the second level of comprehending the space-time fusion rules. With the reference and insights on the space-time fusion rules from the powerful beings of the myriad races, my understanding of the space-time fusion rules is comparable to the third level."</p><p></p><p>This was like an open-book exam, where the insights on space-time fusion rules from the powerful beings were the 'book'. Even if Lin Yuan could not understand them for the time being, he could 'copy' from them.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Soon it was half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped at the last step before the 'end point'.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the fusion of space and time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was contemplative as he slowly took the final step, arriving at the end point of the sixth floor of the black building.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the intermingling of space and time, your insight into the rules of space-time fusion has increased.]</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the sixth floor of the black building, Lin Yuan gained a deeper understanding of the rules of space-time fusion. Combined with the insights on space-time fusion rules from the powerful beings, Lin Yuan's comprehension in this area improved again, not far from the peak of the second level.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on breaking through the sixth floor."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji had been waiting at the 'end point' for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Lin Yuan with a complicated gaze. Even though he had expected this, Lin Yuan could not have tried to break through the sixth floor without confidence.</p><p></p><p>But seeing a tenth level being actually break through the sixth floor, the shock in his heart could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>Even during the prosperous period of the Magic Jade Building, a tenth level being breaking through the sixth floor of the black building was extremely rare and almost unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention actually breaking through.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you try the seventh floor?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji asked.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had some difficulty breaking through the sixth floor, let alone trying the seventh.</p><p></p><p>As for improving his comprehension by breaking through the seventh floor, it would be difficult when the gap in levels was too large.</p><p></p><p>There was a qualitative difference between the sixth and seventh floors of the black building. Forcibly trying to gain insights would not be as effective as observing the insights on space-time fusion rules from the powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Now you have three opportunities to choose rewards with me, for the second floor reward, the fifth floor reward, and the sixth floor reward. Which one do you want to choose?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji asked.</p><p></p><p>"The second floor reward first," Lin Yuan said. Although he said the second floor reward, it was actually the reward from the third floor reward library.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan broke through the second floor of the black building, his performance was too monstrous, and the reward range was directly set to the third floor reward library.</p><p></p><p>"Choose one item from these rewards."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji waved his right hand, and an illusory light screen appeared, displaying various treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully looked for a while.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to choose the second floor reward was because Lin Yuan could not find a suitable reward at that time, so he postponed this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"This one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose the 'Golden Natal Source'.</p><p></p><p>This rare treasure had a great effect on nurturing weapons, and if Lin Yuan's primal bell was nurtured by the 'Golden Natal Source', its growth rate would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization's classification of treasures and rarities, the Golden Natal Source was ranked as one of the twelve stars, and it was even a top-grade item among the twelve stars, on the same level as the World Tree.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji waved his hand again, and a golden glow appeared, hovering in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the 'Golden Natal Source'?" Lin Yuan examined it for a moment, then put away the golden glow and looked towards the list of fifth floor rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Have you decided which one of these rewards to choose?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan with interest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had seen the list of fifth floor rewards before and had hesitated quite a bit, he knew.</p><p></p><p>"I've decided."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, "This one."</p><p></p><p>"This one?" The stone statue Shen Ji showed a hint of surprise on his face.</p><p></p><p>On the list of fifth floor rewards, there were ultimate offensive weapons, ultimate defensive weapons, and a few inherited secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue had originally thought Lin Yuan would choose an ultimate defensive weapon, but the result...</p><p></p><p>"The inherited 'Celestial River'," Lin Yuan looked at the inherited secret techniques, his gaze slightly heated.</p><p></p><p>If it was before he fell into that two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan would indeed have hesitated over the list of fifth floor rewards.</p><p></p><p>He wanted both the inherited secret techniques and the ultimate weapons.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After the journey through the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had acquired nearly a hundred wondrous items, and what he lacked the least were ultimate weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even among ultimate weapons, there were differences in quality, and the ultimate weapons on the list of fifth floor rewards were much better than those wondrous items.</p><p></p><p>But for beings below the ultimate realm, unless an ultimate weapon was particularly suited to them, there was basically no difference.</p><p></p><p>Because even the lowest level of ultimate weapons could not unleash their full might when used by eleventh level experts, so they were more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>"This is the vessel containing the secret technique 'Celestial River'." The six-armed figure waved his right hand, and a round crystal appeared, falling into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"You can connect with it through your consciousness after you return," the stone statue Shen Ji said briefly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the list of sixth floor rewards." The stone statue Shen Ji's gaze showed a hint of an unusual color, and the illusory light screen quickly changed, displaying a brand new list of rewards.</p><p></p><p>"These?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced over, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

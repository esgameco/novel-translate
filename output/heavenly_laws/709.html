        <h1>Chapter 709</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders and many high-level sect members looked at Lin Yuan with slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had a way to deal with the Demon God?</p><p></p><p>The Demon God possessed the power of a 13th-rank Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Only an Eternal Lord of the same level could contend against the Demon God. </p><p></p><p>Even though the hidden world had withstood the Demon God's frenzied attacks so far,</p><p></p><p>At its core, it relied on arrangements left behind by Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it was still Eternal Lords battling against the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>And this resistance was not true opposition.</p><p></p><p>Merely relying on arrangements left by Eternal Lords could only delay temporarily.</p><p></p><p>Once the resources powering the many Eternal Treasures were exhausted,</p><p></p><p>The consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan said there were other ways to deal with the Demon God?</p><p></p><p>"Please tell us, Lord Galaxy, what should we do?" </p><p></p><p>The sect leaders hesitated only for an instant before choosing to trust Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ten thousand years, Lin Yuan's many actions had earned their trust.</p><p></p><p>"Give me all the foundational resources powering the Eternal Treasures," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The infinite sand particle world he was creating was now 99% complete.</p><p></p><p>The remaining 1% progress would be very difficult to achieve in a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan had hunted down all the somewhat powerful 'demons' in this source world.</p><p></p><p>This was also a key reason for the Demon God's fury upon descending.</p><p></p><p>As for absorbing and devouring demonic energy?</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was too slow.</p><p></p><p>And now that the Demon God had descended,</p><p></p><p>Controlling vast demonic energy with a thought, Lin Yuan couldn't absorb or devour it even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan was trapped in the hidden world, with the Demon God right outside.</p><p></p><p>Even in the worst case scenario of taking hundreds or thousands of years to complete the final 1%, it would likely be very difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Lin Yuan's strength, if he dared to step out of the hidden world,</p><p></p><p>He would inevitably become the Demon God's first target of attack.</p><p></p><p>There simply wouldn't be time to continue hunting other 'demons'.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's hope of fully creating his infinite sand particle world</p><p></p><p>Could only be placed on the bottom-line resources of the major Eternal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Rather than consuming these resources in constant defense against the Demon God,</p><p></p><p>It would be better to give them all to Lin Yuan, to let him complete the creation of the infinite sand particle world.</p><p></p><p>Once the particle world was fully formed, Lin Yuan's strength would surge, giving him a real chance of directly contending against the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>This could also prevent the hidden world from being breached.</p><p></p><p>This was currently the most beneficial method Lin Yuan could think of, for both himself and the major Eternal Sects.</p><p></p><p>Based on the Demon God's current methods of attack outside,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very confident in his particle world's completion allowing him to directly contend against the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy wants all the foundational resources?" The Eternal Infinite Sect Leader was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The other sect leaders also looked solemn.</p><p></p><p>These foundational resources were currently their hope for resisting the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Although they would be exhausted in at most a million or ten million years, being able to delay for so long</p><p></p><p>Would at least buy enough time for the elite members of the major Eternal Sects to evacuate.</p><p></p><p>But giving everything to Lin Yuan? If Lin Yuan couldn't stop the Demon God,</p><p></p><p>The hidden world would be breached in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," </p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Actually, to complete the final 1% progress, besides the current foundational resources of the Eternal Sects,</p><p></p><p>There were other methods.</p><p></p><p>For example, using the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds to transport resources over.</p><p></p><p>Using the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds to supply Lin Yuan from start to finish in creating the infinite sand particle world.</p><p></p><p>The cost would be too great, Lin Yuan couldn't afford it.</p><p></p><p>But for just the final 1% progress,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could grit his teeth and accept it.</p><p></p><p>However, since it involved realm-breaking source power, he would definitely save it if he could.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy... are you confident?" </p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Leader asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't think there will be any problems,"</p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Demon God outside.</p><p></p><p>If the infinite sand particle world was fully created, with that level of strength, stopping the Demon God likely wouldn't be an issue at all.</p><p></p><p>The other sect leaders looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>This hidden world was arranged by several Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Even with the methods of several Eternal Lords, it couldn't withstand the Demon God's attacks for millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan said there wouldn't be any problems?</p><p></p><p>"In that case, we'll entrust these six Eternal Sources to Lord Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Leader's expression changed repeatedly before he spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders behind him wanted to speak but held back, ultimately saying nothing.</p><p></p><p>For the Eternal Sects, lasting millions of years versus lasting ten or eight years made no significant difference.</p><p></p><p>Rather than watching helplessly as the hidden world was breached by the Demon God, it was better to place all their hopes on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current situation had already exceeded the predictions of the many Eternal Lords before the great changes in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Not a single Eternal Lord's predicted future timeline encompassed the current situation.</p><p></p><p>So the sect leaders were also very lost, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Strange fluctuations surged through the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Then six sun-like Eternal Sources emerged from the deepest part of the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>It was these six Eternal Sources that had powered the operation of multiple defensive Eternal Treasures, blocking the Demon God's repeated attacks from outside.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six Eternal Sources emanating vast waves of energy.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Sources were condensed by Eternal Lords using their own power, able to fully activate the might of Eternal Treasures.</p><p></p><p>"I only need five, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't hold back. Outside, with each of the Demon God's attacks, the energy within the six Eternal Sources decreased a bit.</p><p></p><p>By Lin Yuan's estimate, four Eternal Sources would be enough for him to complete the final 1% progress.</p><p></p><p>The reason he asked for one more was to be absolutely certain.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Leader nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since they had decided to fully support Lin Yuan, even if he took all six Eternal Sources, the Eternal Infinite Sect Leader wouldn't frown.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and five of the six floating Eternal Sources silently disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Taken into Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The five Eternal Sources provided vast ocean-like energy, allowing the remaining particles in Lin Yuan's body to rapidly create world after world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>And with the disappearance of the five Eternal Sources,</p><p></p><p>Outside the hidden world,</p><p></p><p>Several Eternal Treasures that had been resisting the Demon God's attacks suddenly plummeted in power.</p><p></p><p>Even with one Eternal Source still supplying energy, the instantaneous energy supply rate was certainly no match for six Eternal Sources.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Leader's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't anticipated this.</p><p></p><p>Originally he thought six Eternal Sources could sustain the hidden world for millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>One Eternal Source should be more than enough to last hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But without the simultaneous supply of six Eternal Sources, relying on just one Eternal Source made it very difficult to maintain so many Eternal Treasures at once.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Lin Yuan also noticed the change in the Eternal Treasures outside.</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the sect leaders.</p><p></p><p>Since he had taken five of their Eternal Sources, Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't take them for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Even though the remaining 1% of particles were rapidly being created, it didn't affect Lin Yuan taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Leave this to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward and vanished from his spot.</p><p></p><p>Before the sect leaders and many high-level sect members could react,</p><p></p><p>A towering figure appeared in the world outside.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood calmly next to the hidden world created by the Eternal Lords, which only reached his ankles.</p><p></p><p>An invisible domain descended and spread out, forming layer upon layer of barriers, actively intercepting the Demon God's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy went outside?"</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sect leaders were somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said he had a way to deal with the Demon God, and also asked for the Eternal Source.</p><p></p><p>This made the sect leaders subconsciously speculate that Lin Yuan must have obtained an extremely powerful Eternal Treasure. </p><p></p><p>Asking for the Eternal Source was to activate this Eternal Treasure.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the sect leaders ultimately chose to place their hopes on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it was indeed an extremely powerful Eternal Treasure, with sufficient supply of Eternal Source, there was a slim hope of resisting the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>But now? Lin Yuan went out to confront the Demon God himself? Although Lin Yuan now stood tall between heaven and earth, with an infinitely vast and profound aura.</p><p></p><p>But the enemy was the Demon God, a Demon God on par with 13th rank Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss hiss hiss~~" The black energy flow first landed on the barrier Lin Yuan had condensed.</p><p></p><p>This method of attack was the Demon God instinctively striking out using the corrosive ability of demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>The corrosive power of the black energy flow was difficult for even defensive Eternal Treasures to withstand for long. It could only be countered using the Black Void Lord's techniques, devouring and decomposing it with black hole vortexes.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The barrier condensed from Lin Yuan's external universe began to be largely annihilated not long after coming into contact with the black energy flow, corroded with large holes.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's internal universe had profound foundations. Whenever a hole was corroded by the black energy flow, it was instantly repaired.</p><p></p><p>This caused the black energy flow and Lin Yuan's universe barrier to briefly reach a balance.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Demon God, who had been continuously attacking and venting its instinctive rage, suddenly stopped. Its hollow eyes looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Since the demon disaster descended, all the Eternal Lords had been trapped. The Demon God was absolutely invincible in this world. Even the Secret World - the contingency created by the joint efforts of the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Demon God, it was just a hard turtle shell that could only passively endure attacks.</p><p></p><p>But the towering figure before it was the first life form that could withstand its strike without retreating.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy blocked it?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Secret World, the sect leaders were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>They could see that the method Lin Yuan used to directly block the black energy flow did not rely on any Eternal Treasure.</p><p></p><p>The external universe barrier in contact with the black energy flow began to be largely annihilated after a short while, corroded with large holes.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly not an Eternal Treasure. Although the black energy flow could corrode Eternal Treasures, with an Eternal Treasure's defense, it should at least be able to hold out for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Being corroded so quickly after just touching?</p><p></p><p>It could only be a technique Lin Yuan deployed.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent rapid recovery after corrosion was also directly confronting the black energy flow.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy can actually directly resist the Demon God's strike?"</p><p></p><p>All the powerful beings in the Secret World found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God was on par with 13th rank Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan being able to block the Demon God's strike, didn't that mean he could block an Eternal Lord's strike? Not being an Eternal Lord, yet able to directly block an Eternal Lord's strike? How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>"The power is very strong, I can only block it by going all out," Lin Yuan said, looking at the constantly annihilating and recovering external universe barrier with a slightly solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Since recovering to his peak strength, he had rarely gone all out. The only time was in the trial space opened by Lord Wushan, when he went all out to slash out a sword of the Chaos Taiji Dao in order to exert full power.</p><p></p><p>But that was just going all out for one move, not truly going all out. Now Lin Yuan was truly going all out, even revealing his true form.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, compared to going all out with that one sword in the trial space back then, how many times stronger was Lin Yuan's current strength? "Is this the Demon God's technique?" Lin Yuan looked at the Demon God, intending to stall for time.</p><p></p><p>Now the five Eternal Sources were constantly being refined, with a large number of particle worlds being opened up every moment. Lin Yuan's strength was rapidly increasing, so he naturally planned to drag things out until the particle worlds were fully opened before making a move.</p><p></p><p>Only then would Lin Yuan's strength reach its limit, giving him the confidence to contend with the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>As for now?</p><p></p><p>From that strike just now, Lin Yuan knew he was not a match for the Demon God at present.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not being a match for the Demon God did not mean he couldn't block it. With Lin Yuan's current abilities, if he went all out on defense, the Demon God would have difficulty dealing with him in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Demon God sized up Lin Yuan for an instant, then condensed a deep black dot on the horn on its forehead.</p><p></p><p>It then shot towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to drag out the time until he fully opened up the particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>But the Demon God was not a normal life form. It only had instincts, so naturally would not waste words with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The brief pause just now was only due to its surprise at Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>The deep black dot penetrated the external universe barrier and landed on Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the corrosion of the black energy flow, the deep black dot blasted out from the Demon God's horn was pure offensive power.</p><p></p><p>The external universe barrier didn't even have a chance to recover before being penetrated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure suddenly retreated several steps, with a wound appearing on his chest, but it was rapidly healing.</p><p></p><p>Physical divine ability - Blood Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>This life-saving divine ability had not been useful for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately I asked for an extra Eternal Source." Lin Yuan blocked the Demon God's deep black dot and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This strike nearly penetrated Lin Yuan's physical body, reaching the point where he needed to use recovery techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the Eternal Source, the physical divine ability Blood Rebirth could be used continuously. Unless Lin Yuan's entire body was annihilated in an instant, he would not die.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Demon God again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Demon God's pitch-black giant tail behind it shook lightly, as if heaven and earth were collapsing, whipping towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Earlier in the Secret World, the power of the Demon God's giant tail was also the greatest, almost whipping the entire Secret World into slight tremors.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" The immense power whipped onto Lin Yuan's physical body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan retracted his external universe, raising his defense to the maximum. Even so, he clearly felt the impact on his physical body, with numerous cracks appearing on the surface of every particle world.</p><p></p><p>However, as Blood Rebirth activated, all the cracks rapidly recovered and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy..."</p><p></p><p>In the Secret World, all the powerful beings were extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>If blocking one strike from the Demon God could be said to be a lucky fluke.</p><p></p><p>Then now, Lord Galaxy had consecutively blocked three strikes from the Demon God. These three strikes were what the Demon God used to attack the Secret World, but they were all blocked.</p><p></p><p>Although Lord Galaxy looked somewhat miserable as a result, it still raised huge waves in the hearts of the sect leaders.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss hiss hiss~"</p><p></p><p>"Boom boom boom!!"</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!!!"</p><p></p><p>Next, the Demon God began a new round of attacks, first the black energy flow, then the deep black dot, and finally the giant tail whip, all landing on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried his best to resist, exerting effort to deflect the force, taking a completely defensive posture to withstand the Demon God's attacks one after another.</p><p></p><p>While attacking, the Demon God also looked down at Lin Yuan from high above, its hollow eyes revealing a hint of interest.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the turtle shell-like Secret World, Lin Yuan was clearly more interesting at the moment. At least while blocking its attacks, there were different degrees of injury feedback.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Demon God's giant tail was about to whip towards Lin Yuan again.</p><p></p><p>A giant hand suddenly grabbed the Demon God's tail.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan, who had been resisting the attacks all along, slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Had enough?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's giant hand gripped the giant tail tightly, easily suppressing the overwhelming resistance. His whole body's aura was completely different from before, as if countless sand-like worlds were simultaneously resonating. He then violently yanked the giant tail backwards.</p><p></p><p>"It's my turn!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

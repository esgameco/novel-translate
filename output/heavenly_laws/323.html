            <p>Chapter 323: Twilight of the Gods (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longshan Palace.</p><p></p><p>The numerous members of the Longshan family gazed at the heavens with trembling hearts.</p><p></p><p>There, massive stars fell into the mortal world like rain.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just one or two stars falling, but entire regions and even all the stars in the entire sky were falling.</p><p></p><p>This was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's minds were in a daze as they stared blankly at the shocking scene before them.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the stars in the sky were not merely stars; they were the abodes of the gods, symbolizing the immortality of the deities.</p><p></p><p>Even those without any faith would hold the utmost reverence for the stars in the sky, as they represented the limit of what life could reach.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the long years, in the eyes of almost everyone, the stars in the sky were eternally unchanging. From their birth to their death, and then to the birth and death of their descendants, the stars they saw were always the same.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the eyes of many, the stars in the sky were almost as eternally enduring as the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>But now, the cognitive views of the numerous Longshan family members began to shatter, because the stars across the sky had actually begun to fall simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"The stars, they are the divine realms of the gods. How can they fall?"</p><p></p><p>"The fall of the divine realms implies the fall of the gods, but how is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"The gods are immortal. How can they fall?"</p><p></p><p>The Longshan family members couldn't believe it. Some even thought they were dreaming. After slapping themselves a few times and still feeling the pain, the trepidation in their hearts nearly overflowed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good. The Patriarch just entered the Ocean of Light."</p><p></p><p>"The divine realms of the gods are rapidly falling, clearly something major has happened in the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness. Could something have happened to the Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the Longshan family elders thought more. Lin Yuan was the pillar of the Longshan family, about to lead the family to the pinnacle of the Myriad Nations Plateau, but now this had happened?</p><p></p><p>"I hope nothing has happened to the Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>A few elderly members of the Longshan family silently thought.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, countless stars that had hung in the sky for long years began to fall simultaneously. Naturally, it wasn't only the Longshan family members who could see this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the vast mortal world, the numerous living beings gathered in places like the Myriad Nations Plateau also discovered the changes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The stars are falling?"</p><p></p><p>"Are the gods falling?"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? How can so many gods fall at once?"</p><p></p><p>In many secluded corners, the old half-god monsters who had survived for tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They had lived longer and knew the history of the past, clearly aware of the existence of the "God Wars".</p><p></p><p>Gods were not invulnerable to falling, it was just that they lived for such a long time that almost all living beings believed they were eternal.</p><p></p><p>During the "God Wars", the true gods of the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness would slaughter each other, resulting in the fall of gods.</p><p></p><p>But even in the most brutal god wars, the death of dozens or hundreds of gods was the limit. But now? The number of falling stars was no less than thousands.</p><p></p><p>The heartbeats of many half-god old monsters began to slow down, because the scene before their eyes was too shocking to their souls. Some half-god old monsters even suspected that the gods of the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness had all been kicked over in one go.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could so many stars fall at the same time?</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>"What happened in the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the twenty-four chief gods have joined hands to slaughter the gods?"</p><p></p><p>Many half-god old monsters couldn't help but speculate in this direction, and fear appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>To be able to cause the fall of so many true gods at once, only the chief gods could do it, and not just one chief god, but the twenty-four chief gods joining hands in a slaughter.</p><p></p><p>If even one chief god disagreed and resisted, the frequency of falling stars would not be so fast.</p><p></p><p>From the regions and scope of the falling stars, the half-god old monsters vaguely deduced that in the Ocean of Light or the Abyss of Darkness, a one-sided slaughter targeting the true gods was taking place.</p><p></p><p>The numerous true gods being slaughtered had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>This made all the half-god old monsters somewhat disheartened. They didn't know how much they had paid to ignite the divine fire, step into the seventh level, then hibernate and secretly gather faith, wanting to condense divine realms and raise them high.</p><p></p><p>But now they saw the true gods, whom they regarded as their ultimate goal, being slaughtered like pigs and dogs in the Ocean of Light and Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>So the gods they had always regarded as lofty could also be so weak? Unable to decide their own fate? Only able to obediently wait for death?</p><p></p><p>For a time, the state of mind of many half-god old monsters became unstable, and the divine fires they had ignited began to flicker.</p><p></p><p>What was the point of gathering faith and raising divine realms? Even if they became true gods and entered the Ocean of Light, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>It might not even be as safe or free as the mortal world there.</p><p></p><p>"Why do the chief gods want to slaughter the true gods?"</p><p></p><p>"For faith? It shouldn't be. The twenty-four chief gods already occupy the majority of faith in the mortal world. Even if they purge all the true gods, their own faith won't undergo a qualitative change."</p><p></p><p>"Are they worried about their positions being threatened? That's also impossible. Let's not even mention the power gap between chief gods and true gods. The number of chief gods is fixed. No matter how outstanding a true god is, without a chief god's position, they still can't become a chief god, let alone shake the chief gods' status."</p><p></p><p>The numerous half-god old monsters rapidly discussed.</p><p></p><p>"The mighty twenty-four high-level chief gods actually entered to slaughter ordinary true gods." A relatively young half-god spoke in an indignant tone, wanting to condemn the twenty-four chief gods.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>And now, following the fall of stars one after another into the mortal world, the twenty-four massive stars in this region also began to fall, one by one.</p><p></p><p>One.</p><p></p><p>Two.</p><p></p><p>Five.</p><p></p><p>Ten.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, more than ten chief gods' divine realms had fallen into the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>This made the half-gods in the mortal world who were condemning and criticizing the twenty-four chief gods fall completely silent, and then they fell into confusion.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that it wasn't only the true gods who were falling.</p><p></p><p>The chief gods were also falling?</p><p></p><p>This scene made an unprecedented terror rise in the hearts of all the half-gods.</p><p></p><p>The chief gods were falling.</p><p></p><p>And it was a large-scale fall.</p><p></p><p>Then who exactly was taking action to slaughter them?</p><p></p><p>If it was the twenty-four chief gods joining hands to slaughter the true gods, then how could the chief gods also be falling?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the battles between chief gods were lengthy. Even if the strongest Light Chief God and Dark Chief God wanted to kill the weakest chief god, it was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>Let alone crushing them like this.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kill?</p><p></p><p>"Light Ocean, Dark Abyss, what exactly happened?" An old demigod, whose lifespan was coming to an end and whose divine fire was about to burn out, muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even the main gods are falling, this is something that has never happened even during the "God Wars".</p><p></p><p>"Twilight of the Gods, this is the Twilight of the Gods." Another demigod silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The gods here are true gods and main gods.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the fall of the Divine Kingdoms into the mortal world will have an immeasurable impact on the mortal world." A demigod seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were as strong as demigods, they were all shocked by the scene of stars falling across the sky. However, a very small number of demigods thought about the consequences of these stars falling into the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Long ages ago, the God Wars among the gods caused several stars to fall into the mortal world, resulting in irreversible and devastating effects on the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>After all, what fell down were not stars, but Divine Kingdoms containing a large amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>Just a few falling stars had caused such serious consequences. Now, with stars falling across the sky, including the even more vast main god's Divine Kingdoms...</p><p></p><p>If these Divine Kingdoms were really allowed to land, perhaps the mortal world would still exist, but nine out of ten living beings in the mortal world would surely die.</p><p></p><p>As for those old demigod monsters, probably not many of them would survive either.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the Twilight of the Gods, this is the Doomsday of all living beings!" A demigod actively appeared. Now, it didn't matter whether they were in hiding or not. They would die anyway if they were brought back.</p><p></p><p>As for running? With the speed at which the stars were falling to the mortal world, where could the demigods run to? Moreover, with so many stars falling simultaneously, no matter how far they ran, they would still be within the coverage of the Divine Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!!!</p><p></p><p>Just as many demigods turned pale, realizing that they were about to face death.</p><p></p><p>A black and white Yin-Yang light curtain, in a cross-cutting manner, spanned the vast mortal world, taking the form of a "giant net", and caught all the stars falling into the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>On both ends of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two great Yuanshen, the Taiyin Yuanshen and the Taiyang Yuanshen, stood in the air.</p><p></p><p>That Yin-Yang Taiji "giant net" that "cross-cut" the entire mortal world was the handiwork of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, Lin Yuan had ideas about the Divine Kingdoms of the gods. These Divine Kingdoms had existed for tens of thousands of years, absorbing countless beliefs and containing an amount of pure energy that could be described as vast.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan himself had gone to the Light Ocean to negotiate with the gods, once the negotiations failed and he started to take action, naturally he would not waste those falling stars.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't use them himself, he could use the "Primordial Force" to return all the Divine Kingdoms to their origins, transforming them into the purest energy and then letting the Primordial Essence Gold absorb it.</p><p></p><p>Bringing it back to the main world through "indirect" means.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>As the black and white Yin-Yang Taiji giant net opened, one Divine Kingdom after another appeared in Lin Yuan's inner world.</p><p></p><p>If it were the inner world of other ninth-level powerhouses, it would definitely burst from accommodating so many Divine Kingdoms at once, including the main god's Divine Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's inner world had a direct size of nearly 200 million square li, and had opened up 120 million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Lin Yuan had three such inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>One for his main body, one for the Taiyang Yuanshen, and one for the Taiyin Yuanshen.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, Lin Yuan's two great Yuanshen had long ago used the "Illusory Reality" secret method to transform into physical bodies, and then used the mysterious gourd to amplify their physical bodies and inner worlds to the current achievable limit.</p><p></p><p>"Too many, too many."</p><p></p><p>In the vast mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The many demigods who were originally planning to close their eyes and wait for death suddenly discovered an additional layer of black and white Yin-Yang Taiji "giant net" under the sky.</p><p></p><p>All the stars falling into the mortal world disappeared the moment they touched the "giant net", as if they had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? It actually blocked the falling Divine Kingdoms?"</p><p></p><p>The many old demigod monsters found it hard to believe. The Divine Kingdoms falling from the sky, carrying terrifying energy and impact, definitely far exceeded the blow of a corresponding true god burning their divine body and divine power.</p><p></p><p>The falling of stars across the sky was equivalent to everything after the gods burned everything. Even the main gods did not dare to withstand it head-on.</p><p></p><p>But now, under that Yin-Yang white "giant net", all the falling stars were easily eliminated, including the main god's vast Divine Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of this 'giant net'..."</p><p></p><p>Some old demigod monsters trembled in their hearts. They vaguely guessed that the owner of the "giant net" might be the source that caused the fall of the gods and main gods.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could things be so coincidental?</p><p></p><p>The stars high in the sky had just begun to fall, and they were taken away by the "giant net"?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the strength to easily block the impact of so many falling stars, it seemed not impossible to slaughter the gods and main gods.</p><p></p><p>Light Ocean.</p><p></p><p>Under the blow of Lin Yuan's inner world, the terrifying power crushed everything it could touch along the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, more than eighty percent of the true gods had fallen. The remaining twenty percent of true gods were at the peak of the upper realm, with solid divine bodies. Even if they were crushed to powder, they could still condense again.</p><p></p><p>The gods of this world had undergone changes in their life form, abandoning their original physical bodies. Their divine bodies were composed of the purest power of faith.</p><p></p><p>There were no so-called flaws.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, under the continuous shaking of the layers of space, even if these upper realm gods condensed countless times, they would still be crushed to powder.</p><p></p><p>Even the lofty main gods, caught off guard, had their main god bodies destroyed many times. Lin Yuan's blow was mainly aimed at the main gods, while the true gods basically only suffered the aftershocks.</p><p></p><p>So some true gods had not yet died out when the main gods began to fall.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this, what level of power is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of the Devil Net, didn't you say that the Dragon Mountain Patriarch had not surpassed the ninth level?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Supreme God, this is the power at the level of the Supreme God."</p><p></p><p>One main god after another let out angry roars, using all means to try to resist the blow that penetrated the layers of space, but to no avail. Their divine bodies were shattered again and again.</p><p></p><p>Even though the main gods had deep foundations, they could not withstand having their bodies shattered like this over and over again.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>The main god of the Dark Abyss did not hesitate to try to escape, but soon encountered the spatial layer barrier sealed by the Light God.</p><p></p><p>"Light God, damn you."</p><p></p><p>The main gods of the Dark Abyss were cursing the Light God in their hearts. The spatial layer barrier sealing the Light Ocean was difficult for them, as main gods, to break through, but it was only difficult.</p><p></p><p>It just required some time.</p><p></p><p>But now, where was the time?</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>One main god after another from the Dark Abyss tried to escape, but could not.</p>

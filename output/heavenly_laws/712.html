        <h1>Chapter 712</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the several sect leaders and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>Based on the information and intelligence he currently understood, in this source world, including the Lord of Celestial Light, there were a total of fourteen Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>That is, fourteen time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the six Ancestors of the first source world.</p><p></p><p>The second source world was clearly much stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, this was also due to the fact that the first source world had experienced far less time than the second source world.</p><p></p><p>As time passed in the first source world, more time-based lifeforms would also be born.</p><p></p><p>"No, they just left behind many countermeasures for various future situations," said the sect leader of the Eternal Immeasurable Sect.</p><p></p><p>The other sect leaders also nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they had only had brief final communications with six Eternal Lords, who were the founders of the six great Eternal Sects.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Eternal Lords? They all acted independently, beyond the sect leaders' ability to contact.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, these sect leaders didn't know much more than the golden figure in the trial space.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was understandable. Under the shroud of the demon disaster, knowing more didn't mean much unless one had the combat power of an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I will leave behind an avatar here from now on. If demon gods continue to appear, I will intervene to stop them," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Since he had agreed to protect the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>He would naturally see it through to the end.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that demon gods would not continue to appear.</p><p></p><p>After realizing they could not defeat Lin Yuan, the demon gods' full instinctive energy was now focused on suppressing the consciousness of the source world.</p><p></p><p>As for inside the source world?</p><p></p><p>Once they completely suppressed the source world's consciousness, the demon gods would be able to replace it.</p><p></p><p>At that time, their strength would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>That day was likely extremely distant.</p><p></p><p>If they could suppress the source world's consciousness so quickly,</p><p></p><p>The demon gods wouldn't have rushed to attack the hidden world in the first place.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Galaxy." The sect leaders looked grateful.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's guarantee essentially freed them from any future worries.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self left the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>He walked casually through various parts of the world.</p><p></p><p>The infinite demonic energy rapidly retreated within ten thousand miles of Lin Yuan's approach.</p><p></p><p>"Still watching me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the demon god's gaze upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Demon god."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Although he had fought the demon god head-on and even forced it to retreat,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't feel any sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>Fighting the demon god didn't mean Lin Yuan could fight other time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Time-based lifeforms observed many future timelines and wouldn't give Lin Yuan any chance for direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>As for the demon god? Its power and killing force were on par with true time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But it had only raw power, unable to observe timelines. Any time-based lifeform could scheme and calculate its demise.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying aspect of time-based lifeforms was their foresight, their ability to actively choose the future they wanted.</p><p></p><p>"However."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Fighting the demon god up close, he clearly sensed how terrifying it was.</p><p></p><p>Mainly the terrifying nature of the demon god's physical body.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, the demon god hadn't displayed any secret techniques or divine abilities, merely relying on its physical instincts to fight Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it possessed the direct combat power of a 13th level time-based lifeform.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine.</p><p></p><p>If the demon god could activate and utilize secret techniques, bringing out its power hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of times over.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan fully opened up infinite sand-like particle worlds, he would be far from a match for the demon god.</p><p></p><p>"Without using secret techniques, without using mental willpower techniques, relying solely on physical instincts, it has such power?" Lin Yuan found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts evolution was already adept at physical body cultivation, but it couldn't compare to the demon god's physical form.</p><p></p><p>"If the demon god was also a time-based lifeform, but lost its mental willpower for some reason, causing its physical body to act on instinct, then how strong must it have been at its peak?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>"But that has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>"Now that the infinite sand-like particle worlds have been fully opened, proving this secret technique can be completed, my other two true selves can try cultivating it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason he hadn't let his two other true selves in the chaotic void and first source world try opening their own particle worlds</p><p></p><p>Was because this technique consumed too many resources. What if they opened halfway or were about to finish, only to find the path couldn't be completed?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't all the previous investment be wasted? But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan in this source world had already proven the feasibility of fully opening particle worlds, so his other two true selves could naturally follow suit.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self drifted along with the chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Open particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, particle worlds began to be opened within his body.</p><p></p><p>For ten thousand years, Lin Yuan had roamed various parts of the chaotic void, collecting a vast amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>Many secret realms undiscoverable by great sages, as well as posthumous universe and inheritance realms left behind by peerless great sages throughout history, were all completely plundered by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had even made several trips to the gaps between dimensions to collect many precious resources from outside the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Preparing to open his own particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void was not the second source world, not yet invaded by demonic energy. Many resource-rich secret realms were constantly being born with collectible resources.</p><p></p><p>This</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After so many years, plus taking some from the 'spirits' of those special places, it was barely enough.</p><p></p><p>The first source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also began to open up his own particle world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the chaotic void where one had to find resources on their own, obtaining resources was much simpler for the true self in this source world.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the top-tier treasure land 'Golden Mist Treasure Land', Lin Yuan only needed to sell the rare treasures produced by the land to continuously obtain various resources.</p><p></p><p>The rare golden mist produced by the Golden Mist Treasure Land could transform life forms' constitutions towards time-based abilities, ultimately allowing them to gain the means to briefly foresee the future after the transformation was complete.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far inferior to thirteenth-rank time lifeforms directly peering into the future.</p><p></p><p>But for those Tianzuns and Supreme Tianzuns, it was clearly an extremely desirable ability.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely through this attraction that the Tianzuns and Supreme Tianzuns of the six ancient countries spent most of their accumulated resources to exchange for some golden mist from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>To accelerate resource collection, Lin Yuan even 'pre-sold' all the rare golden mist that the Golden Mist Treasure Land would produce in the next ten trillion years.</p><p></p><p>'Pre-selling' rare treasures from a treasure land carried great risks for other Tianzuns, but the credibility of the Milky Way Tianzun was naturally trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Lin Yuan directly 'pre-sold' the golden mist that the treasure land would produce in the next ten trillion years.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was about to advance to the thirteenth rank and had no interest in this ability to foresee future fragments. Using it to exchange for resources to open up a particle world was very cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>It was by relying on this method that Lin Yuan quickly and easily collected all the resources to open up his own particle world.</p><p></p><p>The second source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on a hill.</p><p></p><p>"The eighth physical divine ability." Lin Yuan carefully sensed the interweaving of many origin powers deep in his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The gestation period of the eighth physical divine ability would exceed the total gestation time of the previous seven physical divine abilities, requiring over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gestation of Lin Yuan's eighth physical divine ability was nearing its end. It would take as short as a hundred years or as long as a few thousand years to fully gestate.</p><p></p><p>"After ten thousand years of gestation, I wonder what power this physical divine ability will have?"</p><p></p><p>In this source world, after the great changes in heaven and earth, the physical potential of all life forms became incredibly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>This was also the main reason why it took Lin Yuan over ten thousand years to gestate physical divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline foundation of life forms had changed.</p><p></p><p>And the ability to gestate physical divine abilities through the martial arts evolution path could lock onto this change and form divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan retracted his thoughts and no longer focused on the origin powers deep in his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to comprehend the inheritance left by the Lord of Celestial Light that was helpful for breaking through time loops.</p><p></p><p>After ten thousand years of comprehension, even though he only devoted a small part of his mind to comprehending, Lin Yuan had cultivated this inheritance to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>He was only a hair's breadth away from fully comprehending the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>In the inheritance book space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to listen.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Lord of Celestial Light's form was towering, radiating infinite light that was warm and comfortable, making Lin Yuan feel as if he was soaking in a hot spring.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth level of this inheritance lies in the heart and in thought. Where the heart and mind go, symbols follow, without needing to rely on external objects."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light's expression was calm with a smile as he looked at Lin Yuan with a smile, explaining the details of the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was gentle, carrying goodwill and extraordinary compassion for all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"What is the foundation of life? The physical body? The soul? Neither. It is the heart and mind. Only with heart and mind is life complete. Cultivating this inheritance to the fifth level is to use the heart and mind as the foundation to form symbols."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light smiled and said: "The so-called time loop is a test for life, a test for life to evolve towards time-based life forms. Since it is testing life, there must necessarily exist heart and mind. Therefore, the way of symbols cannot be completely sealed off, because as long as there is thought, there are symbols."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to comprehend what the Lord of Celestial Light said, and formed symbols with his own thoughts in this book space.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light under the sky continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>This was also the special aspect of this inheritance - only by fully comprehending the current part could one hear the next content.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had comprehended to the very end.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Lord of Celestial Light radiating infinite light paused slightly in his speech.</p><p></p><p>"Future cultivator, since you can hear this far, you must be about to fully comprehend this inheritance I created."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light's gaze was still gentle, composed and smiling as he said: "Next, what I am about to describe is my application of symbols."</p><p></p><p>"What are symbols?"</p><p></p><p>"They are everything. The path I walk, with symbols as the foundation, has two sides."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light looked at Lin Yuan gently and continued: "One side is the current me, while the other side."</p><p></p><p>As the Lord of Celestial Light spoke, his own aura began to slowly change. The gentle light illuminating everything disappeared, replaced by infinite deep demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light's own image also changed. The white robe transformed into a black robe that seemed to contain endless darkness. The gentle smile gradually disappeared, and his expression became extremely indifferent.</p><p></p><p>A black horn grew out, and behind him a thick jet-black giant tail swayed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the completely different 'Lord of Celestial Light', his expression turning somewhat cold.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 713</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to the boundless light that shone before.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the 'Lord of Celestial Light', falling into a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the 'Lord of Celestial Light' was almost indistinguishable from the 'Demon God' ravaging the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that the Demon God's gaze was empty.</p><p></p><p>But the current 'Lord of Celestial Light' was extremely indifferent.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Demon God the Lord of Celestial Light?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan came to a definitive conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the Lord of Celestial Light transform into the Demon God with his own eyes, Lin Yuan would truly be foolish if he wasn't certain now.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had previously speculated whether the so-called Demon God was an Eternal Lord from this source world.</p><p></p><p>Or it could simply be that Lord of Celestial Light, but this speculation hadn't gone deep, after all, how could such a powerful temporal being like the Lord of Celestial Light have their mind and will erased, acting on instinct alone? Temporal beings can see through countless future timelines, it's extremely difficult to erase the mind and will of a temporal being, let alone a temporal being like the Lord of Celestial Light who is suspected to be a Time Lord?</p><p></p><p>Forget about erasing a Time Lord's mind and will, the moment you have this thought, spawning numerous future timelines, you would likely be seen by this Time Lord, who would then strike first.</p><p></p><p>Why did the other five Primordial Ancestors, apart from the Blazing Sun Ancestor, have such an attitude towards Lin Yuan in the first source world?</p><p></p><p>Was it because of their own friendliness? Of course not, but because they found there was no possibility of preventing Lin Yuan's rise.</p><p></p><p>If there had been a timeline where Lin Yuan could be successfully killed, it would have been a game between the six Primordial Ancestors, and the Blazing Sun Ancestor would certainly have protected Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But the other ancestors might not necessarily have had this idea.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Eternal Lords didn't reveal the true reason for the demon disaster."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Who is the Lord of Celestial Light? He is the first Eternal Lord of this source world, and the rune cultivation system was established by this being.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the world's creation, the Lord of Celestial Light educated all spirits. It can be said that the thirteen Eternal Lords born later all benefited from the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>Without the Lord of Celestial Light, the number of thirteen Eternal Lords would probably be reduced by a small half, and the cultivation system of this source world would not have reached such a prosperous state before the great change of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that in the hearts of all spirits in the world, including the disciples of those great Eternal Sects, they all had a special feeling for the Lord of Celestial Light, both extremely reverent and extremely close, even to the point of fanatical belief.</p><p></p><p>And once it was known that the source of the world-destroying demon disaster came from the Lord of Celestial Light, it's likely that many powerful beings would have their mental states greatly disturbed, leading to a loss of faith in fighting against the demon disaster.</p><p></p><p>It was out of this consideration that the Eternal Lords left no information or intelligence, keeping it absolutely secret even from the Eternal Sects they had established.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Eternal Lords also didn't want the masses to know that the Lord of Celestial Light had transformed into a world-destroying Demon God."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed in his heart. Undoubtedly, the thirteen Eternal Lords were also grateful for the guidance of the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>Such a being, appearing before the masses always in an image of infinite light, the thirteen Eternal Lords might also not want to see the Lord of Celestial Light cursed and hated by the masses.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Lord of Celestial Light's mind and will disappear? Was it erased, or due to other changes?" Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, he wasn't sure if the Lord of Celestial Light was dead or alive, but at least one thing was certain - the other party hadn't anticipated that their physical body would instinctively erode the source world like this.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, some preparations should have been made in advance, such as temporarily sealing the physical body, waiting for the mind and will to return, and so on.</p><p></p><p>And when even a temporal being suspected to be a Time Lord couldn't foresee such a future for themselves, the level involved in this was probably extremely secret even at the level of thirteenth-order temporal beings.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Whether the Lord of Celestial Light is the Demon God or not doesn't matter much to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. He had no special feelings for the Lord of Celestial Light, just admiration for such a being.</p><p></p><p>What was their image? Whether a world-saving lord or a world-destroying demon god, it didn't affect Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Lord of Celestial Light, transformed into a Demon God, continued to speak: "I use runes as the foundation to create two true bodies, one is the body of light, the other is the body of dark magic. Of course, the power of the light body far surpasses that of the dark magic body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly. Below temporal beings, there was no such thing as two true bodies. Lin Yuan himself only had his current three true body avatars by borrowing the power of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds and paying the price of a small part of his mind and will.</p><p></p><p>What is a true body? A true body is unique, and everything outside the true body is a分身 (fēn shēn, split body or avatar).</p><p></p><p>There is a causal connection between the true body and its avatars.</p><p></p><p>However, between true bodies, they are completely independent entities, with no causal connection.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan hadn't seen with his own eyes the Lord of Celestial Light transform into the Demon God, he wouldn't have been certain that the two belonged to the same life form.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had comprehended the rune legacy left by the Lord of Celestial Light, creating a slight causal connection between them.</p><p></p><p>He had also fought with the Demon God, establishing another new causal connection.</p><p></p><p>But these two types of causal connections were completely independent.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why Lin Yuan hadn't previously suspected that the Demon God was the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>"The Way of Runes encompasses all things. I believe that at the ultimate level, it can achieve 'omnipotence'." The Lord of Celestial Light's tone showed some fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"Omnipotence."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful. This Eternal Lord, the Lord of Celestial Light, ultimately pursued 'omnipotence', omnipotence through runes.</p><p></p><p>"Well, this legacy ends here. If you can watch to this point, it means you have thoroughly comprehended this level, and haven't yet become an Eternal Lord. Congratulations, you have a great chance of becoming an Eternal Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light smiled and said, "If you are already an Eternal Lord now, then having thoroughly comprehended this level will also help with the Way of Runes in the future, and should be of some benefit in converging your past, present, and future timelines."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>This legacy left by the Lord of Celestial Light had not been thoroughly comprehended even by many Eternal Lords, let alone life forms below Eternal Lords. So far, not a single one had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan, who had fused numerous legacies from this source world, relied on his heaven-defying comprehension ability, and the operation of the rules of the great Dao of multiple dimensional spaces, took over ten thousand years to thoroughly comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>What could other life forms use to comprehend it thoroughly?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I envy you," the Lord of Celestial Light's face showed a smile. At this moment, He was in Demon God form, and his smile looked somewhat ferocious. "Breaking through to become an Eternal Lord, you still have a direction to strive for. The time loop is not absolute. This legacy I created can slightly break the limitations of the time loop. In infinite dimensional spaces, there are also some special legacies or methods that have similar effects."</p><p></p><p>"Although it's very difficult to thoroughly comprehend and cultivate, at least there's hope, and you can move closer in this direction. Where</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even if I don't ultimately achieve it, it will still be of some help to myself."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light had a complex expression. "But if I want to take that step, it's no longer a matter of hoping or not hoping. For a time being to evolve to perfection, it's actually determined from the moment they first set foot on the path of cultivation. If it's possible, then it's possible. If it's not possible, no matter how hard one tries, it still won't be possible."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light shook his head slightly: "And before attempting that step, no time being can know for certain whether they can or cannot do it. Future timelines simply cannot touch upon the 14th level realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively to the Lord of Celestial Light's explanation.</p><p></p><p>Especially the last few sentences, which mentioned some information about time beings evolving to perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>"If it's possible, then it's possible?" "If it's not possible, no matter how hard one tries, it still won't be possible?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly. He could sense the helplessness in the Lord of Celestial Light's voice when mentioning this.</p><p></p><p>There was a feeling of being shrouded by fate, of being predestined.</p><p></p><p>But time beings manipulate fate itself, observing countless timelines and choosing the future they want. Yet in the end, they are still bound by fate.</p><p></p><p>"So in other words, there's no threshold to enter the 14th level, any peak 13th level being can try, but whether they can succeed or not is another matter entirely?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan drew some conclusions from the Lord of Celestial Light's words.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from breaking through from the 12th level to the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>The biggest threshold for breaking through from the 12th to 13th level was the time loop.</p><p></p><p>But the time loop was not without countermeasures. Not to mention this legacy left by the Lord of Celestial Light, inheriting one's own evolutionary path and reinforcing external "anchors" helped in breaking through the time loop.</p><p></p><p>But from 13th level to 14th level? It was determined from the moment one set foot on the path of cultivation? No turning back, no changing it.</p><p></p><p>And according to the information Lin Yuan currently knew, 14th level perfect time beings were extremely rare in number.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it wasn't that they were rare in number, but whether they existed at all was debatable.</p><p></p><p>At least through his many travels, Lin Yuan had come into contact with and heard of quite a few time beings.</p><p></p><p>And through each time being, he also learned of more time beings. But perfect time beings? He only knew that beings of this level wandered through past, future and present, could designate the future they wanted, and if they were unsatisfied with the future, they would go to the past to forcibly change it and shape the future they desired.</p><p></p><p>But to this day, Lin Yuan had never heard of any specific perfect time being.</p><p></p><p>The six ancestors of the first source world had never heard of them either.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Lin Yuan could be certain was related to 14th level perfect time beings was the projection of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds transcended timelines and could not be observed by time beings. This point alone matched the characteristics of perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the Lord of Celestial Light's form gradually disappeared beneath the sky.</p><p></p><p>His expression was somewhat emotional.</p><p></p><p>Thoroughly comprehending this legacy unexpectedly led to learning the truth about the demon calamity, which was an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>In the trial space.</p><p></p><p>The avatar Lin Yuan left behind opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The green book floating in front of it slowly descended, the light emanating from within gradually fading completely.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>The golden figure widened its eyes, "You've thoroughly comprehended this legacy?"</p><p></p><p>The green book was one of the original legacies created by the Lord of Celestial Light. After any being thoroughly comprehended it, the book itself would fade for a period of time, which was why the light was disappearing now.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending this legacy, Lin Yuan's understanding of runes had reached an inconceivable level. His thoughts were all runes, and he could even briefly constrain future timelines with runes for his own observation.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current level of rune mastery, he possessed some of the characteristics of time beings in observing future timelines.</p><p></p><p>"It can't compare to real time beings, but the future timelines I see are much clearer than those observed using the Heavenly Void Cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Numerous timelines gradually unfolded before Lin Yuan's eyes, showing him many scenes of his future.</p><p></p><p>"Freak."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan, at a loss for how to evaluate him for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Even though it had seen Lin Yuan fighting head-on with demon gods, the legacy left in the green book had not been comprehended even by many Eternal Sovereigns, yet Lin Yuan had directly comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the great Lord of Mount Wu..."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure's expression was slightly puzzled. Given Lin Yuan's current performance, how could the great Lord of Mount Wu have known in advance by observing future timelines, yet not left any arrangements?</p><p></p><p>Outside the source world.</p><p></p><p>In a space shrouded in infinite light.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen towering figures stood silently there, resisting the light enveloping them from all directions while trying their best to observe various future timelines.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Sovereign, Eternal Sovereign, all Eternal Sovereigns."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Mount Wu's eyes showed shock. By observing more timelines, He discovered that the one called "Galaxy" in the future could become an Eternal Sovereign in all of them.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Galaxy' also has some karmic connection with me, obtaining the legacy I left in the trial space?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Mount Wu was somewhat dazed. He had never seen such a definite future before.</p><p></p><p>"In as little as a few thousand years, or as long as tens of thousands of years, that 'Galaxy' will be able to become an Eternal Sovereign, and then in an extremely short time, become a Time Lord, sealing and converging his own timeline."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Black Void spoke, his gaze equally shocked.</p><p></p><p>Since discovering Lin Yuan's uniqueness not long ago, these thirteen Eternal Sovereigns had divided up different tasks.</p><p></p><p>Some Eternal Sovereigns were trying to observe as many timelines as possible, to see if "Galaxy" in other timelines could become an Eternal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Other Eternal Sovereigns were observing deeply along certain timelines, to judge what level this "Galaxy" could ultimately grow to.</p><p></p><p>But the results shocked all the Eternal Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, so far, in the many timelines they had observed, there was not a single future where Lin Yuan had not become an Eternal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there no futures where he had not become an Eternal Sovereign, there were none where it took him more than 100,000 years to become one.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, observing deeply along certain timelines, Lin Yuan's growth rate was terrifyingly fast in all of them, even achieving Time Lord status in a short period.</p><p></p><p>Time Lord?</p><p></p><p>In the infinite years since this source world was born, there had only been one Time Lord - the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>And strictly speaking, the Lord of Celestial Light was not a native life form of this source world.</p><p></p><p>This was something all the Eternal Sovereigns knew.</p><p></p><p>In other words, from its birth until now, this source world had never produced a single Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>Yet this "Galaxy", after becoming an Eternal Sovereign, would in a short time complete the journey that they, these Eternal Sovereigns, had yet to finish?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

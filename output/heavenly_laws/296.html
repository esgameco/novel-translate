            <p>Chapter 296: Junior Brother is Already at the Ninth Stage, While We're Still at the Sixth? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The battle at the ninth stage is similar to a contest in the spatial sense. </p><p></p><p>At this level, ninth-stage evolutionaries who have derived and expanded more spatial layers have a greater advantage.</p><p></p><p>It's not just about the foundation and power brought by multiple spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>They can also merge and occupy more spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Just like now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seems to be standing in front of Biyan and Hongpi.</p><p></p><p>But his true body is unknown in which spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-stage powerhouses, in a strict sense, already belong to multi-spatial life forms. </p><p></p><p>They will not be limited to a single spatial layer like the vast majority of life forms.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave a few more instructions.</p><p></p><p>He told his subordinates to immediately go and appease the other evolutionaries on the Milky Way's main star.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance caused by his breakthrough to the ninth stage, even without relying on observation equipment, some evolutionaries on the main star would feel an indescribable palpitation on a whim.</p><p></p><p>It's like some animals on the planet, facing disasters in other regions, even if they are not affected themselves, they will still feel fearful and trembling.</p><p></p><p>Star Lord Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the Yin Spirit Body also sat there, with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>"Now we can try the inheritance secret method of 'Illusory Reality'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Illusory Reality" transforms the essence of life, making the illusory become real, and the real become illusory.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit Body is a soul body, essentially belonging to the illusory. With the help of "Illusory Reality", it can possess a body of flesh and blood, and then share Lin Yuan's many divine powers and treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Yin Spirit Body in front of him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Yin Spirit Body had already begun to activate "Illusory Reality". Its originally illusory body actually started to boil, and the particles at the most microscopic level were slowly transforming.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is going smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Using the spirit body to activate "Illusory Reality", even if it fails, it's just a spirit body. It can be re-condensed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"It will probably take about half a month to completely transform."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed for a while and came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Let the Yin Spirit Body transform first and see the effect. If possible, let the Yang Spirit Body transform as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that so far, he didn't know if the transformed Yin Spirit Body could be the same as his true body. He could only speculate that it was most likely not a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the Yin Spirit Body into his inner world, and his consciousness also descended.</p><p></p><p>"The inner world looks much more pleasing to the eye now." Lin Yuan once again looked at the vast world in front of him. After deriving and expanding layers upon layers of space, the inner world was obviously much more substantial.</p><p></p><p>This is what a real world should be like.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the current inner world does not have the support of time rules, and can only rely on the time rules of the main universe. It is not a complete world.</p><p></p><p>"Huh!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly swept his eyes over the inner world, and suddenly stopped on that World Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was now a ninth-stage life form. With one glance, he could see through the layers of space, especially since this place was a world he had created. He was even more familiar with the more than 30,000 spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, although the main body of the World Tree was in the main space, its roots had penetrated into many spatial layers, constantly absorbing the power from different spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this World Tree to have this ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a little surprised. Exploring and occupying other spatial layers was an ability that only ninth-stage life forms had mastered. Although some eighth-stage life forms could also do this, it was extremely crude.</p><p></p><p>The ability shown by the World Tree was far beyond what eighth-stage evolutionaries could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a rare treasure of the eleventh-star universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for relying on the identity of a member of the Magic Jade Tower, Lin Yuan would not have been able to come into contact with the World Tree at all. Even if he entered the ninth or tenth stage, there would basically be no such possibility.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, World Trees were too rare.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade Tower was a force outside the world, and it was extremely prosperous in the distant past, so there was a World Tree sapling appearing on the reward list of the Nine-Layered Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten days had passed.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Lin Yuan entering the ninth stage, after being confirmed by the three goddesses and with Lin Yuan's own consent, was officially announced in the name of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the announcement was made, it quickly spread throughout the five star domains of human civilization, as well as many surrounding alien races. The few top races in particular received the news first.</p><p></p><p>Less than a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>And promoted to the ninth stage with the identity of the strongest eighth-stage in history.</p><p></p><p>Many halos.</p><p></p><p>Many glories.</p><p></p><p>All gathered on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Insect Race territory.</p><p></p><p>A huge Insect Race mother nest began to sweep its awe-inspiring aura in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly was it?"</p><p></p><p>"Who was responsible for assassinating the Milky Way Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord was not even at the sixth stage at that time, so easy to assassinate, but he was allowed to grow to this day? Grow to the ninth stage? In the future, he is very likely to grow to the tenth stage or even the eleventh stage?"</p><p></p><p>The mental fluctuations emanating from this Insect Race mother nest were extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>If they had not paid attention to the Milky Way Star Lord before, so be it.</p><p></p><p>But the Milky Way Star Lord had clearly fallen into the eyes of the Insect Race and other races in the alliance, and they had even launched assassination activities, using the most unsolvable curse assassination technique.</p><p></p><p>As a result, just because they chose the wrong target, they gave up?</p><p></p><p>If you choose the wrong target, can't you continue to choose?</p><p></p><p>At most, curse and kill all the examinees with gold patterns and above in that Seven Star Cave Trial.</p><p></p><p>How much price could be paid for that?</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Pan Yong' general who was in charge of this matter at that time has already committed suicide out of guilt."</p><p></p><p>Someone immediately reported.</p><p></p><p>"Committed suicide out of guilt?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Race mother nest immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"My son has become a ninth-stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng glanced at Canglan Star outside, which had fallen into revelry, feeling a little dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, news about Lin Yuan had come one after another, each more outrageous than the last. Now he had even entered the ninth stage?</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true. Mr. Lin, you have a good son."</p><p></p><p>The look of shock also remained on the face of the executive official Song Wuyang. He had chatted with Lin Yuan face-to-face before. The evolutionary genius he had high hopes for in the past had actually become a ninth-stage evolutionary in the blink of an eye?</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan had become a ninth-stage, the entire Canglan Star once again fell into revelry.</p><p></p><p>There was no special meaning, simply because a ninth-stage evolutionary was born on this planet.</p><p></p><p>The territory of human civilization was vast, with countless high-level living planets. Throughout history, no ninth-stage evolutionary had ever been born.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Canglan Star had done it?</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only Canglan Star was in revelry, but the entire Morning Star System was also in revelry. After all, Lin Yuan, this ninth-stage evolutionary, also came from the Morning Star System.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother is too</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Impressive." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi, who was beside him and also received this news, showed an incredulous expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>Compared to her brother, she was really too mediocre as a younger sister. However, Lin Yi never thought about catching up to her brother.</p><p></p><p>How could she catch up?</p><p></p><p>With what could she catch up?</p><p></p><p>"Our junior brother has already entered the ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>In a virtual world, the peak masters of the Chiyan School were gathering together to chat.</p><p></p><p>Then they received this shocking news, leaving the peak masters, who were originally chatting idly, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that I, Zuo Ge, would one day have the honor of being the senior brother of a ninth-stage evolutionist."</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Peak Master, Zuo Ge, sighed with emotion. He still remembered what Lin Yuan looked like when he first became the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"A freak, he's really a freak."</p><p></p><p>"We are still at the sixth stage now, while our former junior brother has already reached the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Peak Master couldn't help but say. He had no jealous thoughts at all. If there was only a small gap, jealous emotions could still arise, but if the gap was like a chasm, one could only feel amazed and admire.</p><p></p><p>And now, the gap between Lin Yuan, who had already become a ninth-stage evolutionist, and them, how could it be described as just a chasm?</p><p></p><p>"I almost accepted the junior brother back then."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Peak Master sighed with some emotion. At that time, he saw Lin Yuan doing some research on the Solar Path, which partially overlapped with his own path, and had the idea of accepting Lin Yuan. However, later he saw Lin Yuan's "ineffective" behavior in the Seventh Star Cave.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Lin Yuan at that time was comprehending the ultimate test of the evolutionary path in the Seventh Star Cave.</p><p></p><p>He simply had eyes but failed to recognize Mount Tai, not understanding what Lin Yuan was doing.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple has entered the ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord also received this news. He was not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Chiyan Star Lord had long been accustomed to being shocked by Lin Yuan's series of performances.</p><p></p><p>Let alone stepping into the ninth stage, even if Lin Yuan now broke through to the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord felt that he would not be too shocked.</p><p></p><p>His disciple was best at breaking existing perceptions and creating all kinds of miracles.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought I could still take a step ahead of my disciple and break through to the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord sighed. He was also very close to the ninth stage, and the fusion of laws had long reached the final step.</p><p></p><p>If he was lucky, he could take the last step in a few days and then evolve towards the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>If he was unlucky, it would take at most a few decades or a few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord originally thought that he might be able to step into the ninth stage before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only one step away and could break through at any time.</p><p></p><p>"No way."</p><p></p><p>"In this closed-door cultivation, I must step into the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I won't have the face to see my disciple."</p><p></p><p>Although there were cases of disciples surpassing their teachers in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord still wanted to save face. Originally, Lin Yuan killed dozens of eighth-stage invincible experts in a few breaths, but his life essence was still at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>So the Chiyan Star Lord felt that there was nothing wrong with the two of them meeting.</p><p></p><p>They were within the same major realm anyway.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had clearly stepped into the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>If he was still at the eighth stage, it would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"In twenty years, I will definitely step into the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"By then, in front of my disciple, it won't be too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord made a detailed plan for his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He immediately notified that in the next twenty years, unless something earth-shattering happened, no one should disturb him.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"I, Chiyan, am coming too."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyan Star Lord closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the Wanyang Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son was lying there at ease.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he completely removed the Thirteenth Peak Master from his list of targets to surpass, the Wanyang Holy Son only felt extremely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>This was how it should be.</p><p></p><p>He had nothing to do, so why bother comparing himself with that freak Thirteenth Peak Master?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that just asking for trouble?</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son thought of the news of the Thirteenth Peak Master's killing spree on the alien battlefield, and his mind trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he was still shocked by this news to the point of numbness. How could eighth-stage invincible existences possibly be slaughtered like this by experts of the same stage?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Central Star Domain has issued an announcement?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son glanced at the announcement, "The Thirteenth Peak Master has entered the ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son blinked his eyes, feeling that it was a matter of course in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I didn't continue to compete with this freak back then."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, how desperate would I be at this moment?"</p><p></p><p>"Comparing a sixth stage to a ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son felt somewhat fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, giving up appropriately was also a wise move.</p><p></p><p>The next time Lin Yuan made a move, it would not affect a local battlefield like a medium-sized alien battlefield, but a major alien battlefield that was the main battlefield of various major races.</p><p></p><p>On the Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit immediately moved out from the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Has the complete transformation been completed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Yin Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit was also constantly observing itself.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a body of flesh and blood."</p><p></p><p>"No longer a spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability imprint of Rebirth by Dripping Blood."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Spirit quickly condensed the divine ability imprint of this technique within its body.</p><p></p><p>This was also the key to absorbing the liquid inside the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The complex divine ability imprint condensed rapidly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Rebirth by Dripping Blood divine ability was synchronized to the Yin Spirit's body.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability imprints currently condensed by Lin Yuan were only applicable to his true body. Even if other evolutionists obtained and comprehended them, they would be useless.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin Spirit's body was completely transformed according to Lin Yuan's true body, almost identical, so all divine ability imprints could be used.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan handed the mysterious gourd to the Yin Spirit, letting it start absorbing from the liquid of the first color.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly received a message from the official human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Respected ninth-stage evolutionist, Galaxy Master Lin Yuan, you have just entered the ninth stage and need to come to the Central Star Domain as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Central Star Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long known about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Every newly advanced ninth-stage evolutionist had to go to the Central Star Domain and soak in the cosmic treasure "Eternal Spring" once.</p><p></p><p>The "Eternal Spring" was one of the twelve cosmic treasures of the universe, a grade higher than the World Tree, belonging to the level of supreme treasures.</p><p></p><p>The spring water of the "Eternal Spring" had great benefits for newly advanced ninth-stage evolutionists, especially in terms of their physical bodies. Although the inner world was the most important for ninth-stage evolutionists, the physical body was equally important.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those ninth-stage evolutionists who were good at physical evolution.</p><p></p><p>The "Eternal Spring" was an even rarer great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll go to the Central Star Domain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body got up and walked out of the Galaxy Main Star. With just one step, thousands of light-years flashed under his feet.</p>

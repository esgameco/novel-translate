        <h1>Chapter 595</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The requirements set by Lin Yuan were as follows:</p><p></p><p>The most helpful to oneself,</p><p>Preferably a heritage guide,</p><p>And below 120,000 merit points.</p><p></p><p>There were far fewer that met these three conditions. </p><p></p><p>At a glance, there were only a few dozen.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the treasure trove list also included a large number of heritage guides with only hundreds or thousands of merit points, but they had little effect on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined the introduction of this type of heritage guide.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram has the Chaos Mystical Patterns imprinted on it, and the Chaos Mystical Patterns are the essential veins of the Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>It is also the only way Lin Yuan currently knows of to directly enhance his comprehension of the Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Principles have long since evolved into myriad Dao of Principles along with the creation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>To enhance the comprehension of other Dao of Principles, one only needs to comprehend the corresponding ones among the myriad Dao of Principles that govern the workings of the world.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Principles? </p><p></p><p>Among the myriad Dao of Principles that govern the workings of the world, there is no Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the normal means of enhancing the comprehension of the Chaos Principles can only be achieved indirectly through the comprehension of the myriad Dao of Principles.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Mystical Patterns are the manifestation of the Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Chaos Mystical Patterns can directly enhance the comprehension of the Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>In the previous war between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain, Lin Yuan's comprehension of various war machines was essentially comprehending the Chaos Mystical Patterns contained within those war machines.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the treasure trove to have these Chaos Mystical Patterns for exchange."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, originally he was planning to try and obtain a war machine that surpassed the A-grade for comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Well, since I even have the chance to possess the Progenitor of Scorching Sun, these Chaos Mystical Patterns are nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>So-called ancient kingdom secrets are only relatively so.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is currently the core imperial clan of the ancient kingdom, and with enough merit points, the previous secrets are no longer secrets to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram has a total of 81 pieces, of which 9 represent the Chaos Principles of the first realm."</p><p></p><p>"There are 18 pieces representing the Chaos Principles of the second realm, and the remaining ones all expound on the Chaos Principles of the third realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the detailed introduction of the Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram.</p><p></p><p>Each of the 9 pieces of the first realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram requires 5,000 merit points to exchange. </p><p></p><p>The 9 pieces together require 45,000 merit points.</p><p></p><p>As for the 18 pieces of the second realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram, each one requires 10,000 merit points to exchange.</p><p></p><p>As for the 54 pieces of the third realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram, each one requires 100,000 merit points.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension of the Chaos Principles is approaching the peak of the second realm, so I don't need to exchange the first 9 pieces representing the first realm Chaos Principles. As for the 18 pieces representing the second realm Chaos Principles, I only need to exchange the last one or two."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Given the constraint of only 120,000 merit points, he naturally had to be frugal.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams are arranged in order from shallow to deep comprehension of the Chaos Principles.</p><p></p><p>"With 120,000 merit points, I will exchange the last two pieces of the second realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram, as well as the first piece of the third realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams one by one, feeling the aura emanating from them, and confirmed that the mystical pattern diagrams he purchased were parts of the Chaos Principles that he had not yet comprehended.</p><p></p><p>To facilitate the selection, each Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram would reveal a small portion, to prevent the purchase of parts that had already been comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I can only exchange the first piece of the 54 pieces of the third realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram for now." Lin Yuan glanced at the remaining 53 mystical pattern diagrams.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan was also very interested in the other heritage guides that were filtered out, but after careful consideration, he chose the Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too poor right now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment, "But for me, the first piece of the third realm Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram is enough for now. As for the later mystical pattern diagrams, I can wait until I've accumulated enough merit points to exchange them."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King had told him that as a core imperial clan, they have fixed channels for merit points, just like the Heavenly Lord enfeoffed kings, and this is the foundation for the overall stability of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the imperial clan or the Heavenly Lord enfeoffed kings, although they are in conflict, they ultimately prioritize the interests of the ancient kingdom. </p><p></p><p>The so-called conflicts are only internal conflicts. Once it affects the overall interests of the ancient kingdom, whether it's the imperial clan or the Heavenly Lord, they will unite against the external.</p><p></p><p>The illusory elder formed by flames patiently waited by the side. The treasure trove list contained heritage guides of all kinds of treasures and resources, and anyone choosing for the first time would be dazzled, even if they couldn't afford to buy, there was no problem with just looking a bit more.</p><p></p><p>"I will exchange these three Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the illusory elder and spoke.</p><p></p><p>The illusory elder was slightly surprised, "Descendant of the Scorching Sun, are you sure you don't want to exchange for a superior weapon or armament? 120,000 merit points is enough to exchange for several Heavenly Lord-level secret treasures."</p><p></p><p>For any level of expert, be it Grand Sage or Heavenly Lord, an appropriate weapon or armament secret treasure is the fastest and most effective way to greatly enhance one's combat power.</p><p></p><p>As for heritage guides like the Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams? The Chaos Principles are so profound and abstruse, even with the manifestation of the essential veins of the Chaos Principles in the Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams, it is unknown how many years it would take to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has only 120,000 merit points, and he's using them all to exchange for these heritage guides? This is quite rare.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Appropriate weapon or armament secret treasures can all be bought from the outside world, but this kind of Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagram can only be found in the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the war between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain, Lin Yuan is now quite wealthy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given Lin Yuan's personality, unless it's absolutely necessary, he won't easily resort to violence. Weapon and armament secret treasures are not urgent for him at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Here are the three Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>The illusory elder smiled slightly, and three diagrams shrouded in radiant light and swirling chaos energy appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of the Scorching Sun, please swear in the name of the Scorching Sun not to disseminate these three Chaos Mystical Pattern Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>The illusory elder looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I swear in the name of the Scorching Sun..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan repeated the words as required by the illusory elder.</p><p></p><p>In the moment he finished speaking, an extremely subtle gaze from the eternal Scorching Sun above the firmament swept over him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that if he were to violate the oath, he would be struck by that eternal Scorching Sun.</p><p></p><p>A strike from a Thirteenth Realm temporal life form, who could withstand it? No resurrection method would work, it would erase everything from the root.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Chaotic Void, there are methods of swearing in the name of the Chaotic Void's primal consciousness, but how could the consequences compare to swearing in the name of a Thirteenth Realm temporal life form? The Chaotic Void has no specific aversion, but a Thirteenth Realm temporal life form does.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder so many heritage guides in the treasure trove have never been leaked." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It would be of little significance even if the powerful figures from the enemy ancient countries infiltrated the capital of the Scorching Sun Country and obtained some inheritance guidance.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the consequences would be if I leaked these secret pattern diagrams in the Chaotic Void." Lin Yuansi's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the moment he violated the oath within this source world, he would be sensed by the ancestor of the Scorching Sun.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaotic Void?</p><p></p><p>That was another dimensional space, and even a thirteenth-level temporal life form would find it difficult to have any impact there.</p><p></p><p>After taking the oath,</p><p>Lin Yuan deducted 120,000 merit points and also received those three Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams.</p><p></p><p>"The fundamental essence of the Chaotic Rules is manifesting."</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan received them, he was shocked by the profound mysteries of the Chaos contained within.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chaotic Secret Patterns inherent in the war machines, these Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams were more direct and fundamental.</p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, Lin Yuan immediately stood up and left, returning to the royal palace to deeply comprehend these Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams.</p><p></p><p>[Your transcendent comprehension allows you to understand the Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams, enhancing your grasp of the Chaotic Rules.]</p><p></p><p>A flood of insights kept surging in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Compared to comprehending the war machines, directly comprehending the Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams was much more efficient.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Secret Patterns on the war machines were combinations of different Chaotic Secret Patterns, and each war machine had different capabilities, some excelling in offense, some in defense, and some in domain suppression, etc.</p><p></p><p>The major ancient countries kept the Chaotic Secret Patterns on the war machines as top-secret, but it was not the Chaotic Secret Patterns themselves that were classified.</p><p></p><p>The eighty-one Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams were possessed by the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, as well as the five major ancient countries like the Great Spirit Ancient Country and the Dark Yin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The true value of the war machines lay in the application of the Chaotic Rules contained within them. </p><p></p><p>Mastering the corresponding application methods would allow for mass-producing identical war machines, or even researching the weaknesses of such war machines.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan comprehended the war machines, he needed to discern the different profound Chaotic Rule mysteries within, as some war machines contained Chaotic Secret Patterns from parts of the first, third, and seventh Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams. </p><p></p><p>This would waste some of his efforts in categorization.</p><p></p><p>But directly comprehending the Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams was much simpler, as he could just comprehend them in a step-by-step manner.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the peak of the Chaotic Dual Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed. Originally, according to his predictions, with the endless stream of war machines to comprehend, it would take him around a thousand years to reach the peak of the Chaotic Dual Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, now, after just five hundred years, although he was already close to the peak of the Dual Realm, based on his previous rate of advancement, it would still take another four to five hundred years to fully cross into it.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>By comprehending the Chaotic Secret Pattern diagrams, Lin Yuan felt that he could cross into the peak of the Dual Realm in just a few years.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Rules only had three realms, and reaching the peak of the Dual Realm meant he was just one step away from the highest Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after reaching the peak of the Dual Realm, Lin Yuan could consider using the Chaotic Rules to evolve the Chaotic Yin-Yang Supreme Power.</p><p></p><p>The great experts of this source world, despite having a weaker foundation than the Chaotic Void Venerable Ones, could match and rival them precisely because they could evolve Chaotic exclusive powers at the great expert level.</p><p></p><p>This was a realm that only the Sages could access in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The next day,</p><p>Lin Yuan stopped his cultivation and came out of the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King had been waiting outside, and he smiled at Lin Yuan, saying, "Silver River brother, quickly come with me to see His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"See His Majesty?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already prepared for this, as he knew that after arriving in the capital, he would need to meet the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, His Majesty wanted to see you as soon as you arrived in the capital, but he was worried you might not be adapted yet, so he waited until today," Crimson Treasure King said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thanking me for? We're all family here," Crimson Treasure King immediately led Lin Yuan to the most secure place in the capital - the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The grand and majestic palace buildings soon came into view, and Lin Yuan followed Crimson Treasure King, quickly arriving at a great hall.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Treasure, Silver River."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country was a weathered-looking man with a deep gaze. Seeing Lin Yuan and Crimson Treasure King, a smile immediately appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty." </p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan discreetly observed the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country seemed to be fused with the imperial palace and the capital city itself.</p><p></p><p>"That Spiritual King was willing to start a war just to become the Emperor of the Great Spirit Ancient Country." Lin Yuan immediately understood - by fusing with the entire country, even the ordinary royal bloodline would gradually be transformed, with the core royal bloodline reaching an extraordinary level over time.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Emperor of an ancient country would also allow one to control the grand formation of the entire country, easily slaying Venerable-level experts.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of dominating and overlooking everything must have driven many powerful figures to pursue it.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing a royal like you, I feel that the future of the ancient countries is bright," the Emperor looked at Lin Yuan and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan entered the hall, the Emperor had already confirmed that Lin Yuan possessed the core royal bloodline of the Scorching Sun, as well as its rich aura.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Emperor was undisputedly the strongest, but the Emperor's power was temporary, while Lin Yuan's strength belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's discuss the important matters," the Emperor sighed briefly, then looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Silver River, since you have chosen to join my royal family, it's not for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"With your strength and potential, you can be stationed to guard some special resource sites."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Guard resource sites?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>The vast territory of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country also contained some naturally nurtured resource sites, similar to the secret realms in the Chaotic Void that produced precious resources.</p><p></p><p>By guarding these resource sites, one would occupy them for the ancient country, with the resources produced having to be surrendered at a ratio of nine to one, while the guardian could keep the remaining one part.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, depending on the preciousness of the guarded resource site, the guardian could also receive a steady stream of merit points at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that merit points were extremely difficult to obtain in the Scorching Sun Ancient Country. Lin Yuan had used his own efforts to turn the tide of the war between the Blue Burning Domain and the Purple Dream Domain, but his final merit point evaluation was only 120,000.</p><p></p><p>However, by guarding a resource site, one could continuously earn merit points. This was naturally highly sought after by the various kings.</p><p></p><p>A precious resource site was like a money tree, and the more valuable the guarded site, the higher the income, which would greatly benefit the guardian.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, these are all the resource sites currently in our Scorching Sun Ancient Country. You can choose three of them," the Emperor waved his hand, and a map of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country's territory appeared, with many areas flashing with light.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were shrouded in a hazy mist from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Facing the more than a dozen towering figures that had descended in complete silence, even the vast spatial black hole spanning thousands and thousands of light-years seemed somewhat insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve-tier alien existences?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the numerous twelve-tier ultimate beings who had sealed the space-time, and there was no fear in his heart, but rather a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>How had these twelve-tier alien ultimate beings locked onto his precise spatial coordinates?</p><p></p><p>"Has the karmic connection between myself and a certain twelve-tier life form increased exponentially by tens of thousands of times in a short period of time?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief examination, Lin Yuan found the reason.</p><p></p><p>He knew of some secret techniques that could temporarily increase karmic connections, but they all required a tremendous price to be paid.</p><p></p><p>Especially given Lin Yuan's profound understanding of the karmic rules, for these twelve-tier ultimates to try and lock onto his location through karmic connections?</p><p></p><p>Even if they were twelve-tier existences, they would still suffer severe injuries, and it might take them millions of years to recover.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! At this moment, the ancestor of the Tianyu Clan slammed down a palm, intending to directly suppress Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The other twelve-tier ultimate beings did not intervene, but instead watched coldly. In their eyes, the Tianyu Clan ancestor alone was enough.</p><p></p><p>No matter how brilliant and extraordinary the Galactic Overlord was, he was only an Eleventh-tier existence, and there was no way he could withstand the personal strike of a Twelve-tier ultimate.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor thought the same.</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning of the universe to the present, even with the occasional information they obtained from the chaotic void outside the universe, they had never heard of an Eleventh-tier existence being able to contend with a Twelve-tier existence.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Strongest of the Human Civilization, Xuanyuan and Xia Qin, suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance caused by the Twelve-tier ultimate's strike was so great that it could not be concealed. The moment the auras of the more than a dozen Twelve-tier aliens descended upon the spatial black hole, the nine Strongest of the Human Civilization sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"Those old fellows."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan's thought processes were lightning-fast, and he immediately deduced that the more than a dozen alien Twelve-tiers were likely going to attack Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had shrouded his own karmic connections, so not only were the alien Twelve-tiers unable to detect anything, but the Strongest of the Human Civilization were also unable to sense much through karmic perception.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh. Xuanyuan's true body took a step forward, traversing billions of light-years in an instant, rushing towards the location of the spatial black hole.</p><p></p><p>The other few Strongest of the Human Civilization did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan." Xia Qin's heart was filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred years ago, he had planned to send Lin Yuan's true body into the Central Star Realm, which was the safest place in the entire Human Civilization.</p><p></p><p>But after learning that Lin Yuan had become the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he abandoned the idea. "With the Xuanhuang Secret Realm shielding karmic connections, those old fellows won't be able to affect Lin Yuan's true body at all. And as for memory contamination? The Galactic Overlord's mental will is not weaker than us Twelve-tiers, so memory contamination is also impossible."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's thoughts raced, and he felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>In his view, those alien Twelve-tiers would be completely incapable of harming the Galactic Overlord, at most they could only kill one of his projections or avatars.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Xia Qin and the other nine Strongest of the Human Civilization did not slow down in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Being unable to harm Lin Yuan was one thing, but attacking him was another.</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't cause any impact, as Twelve-tier existences, striking an Eleventh-tier life form was a violation of the unspoken rules between Twelve-tier ultimates!</p><p></p><p>The spatial pressure became increasingly heavy.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor's gaze was cold as he looked down on Lin Yuan, but his descending palm did not pause in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>From the moment of their arrival to the present, everything had happened in the blink of an eye. Even if the Galactic Overlord barely reacted in time and wanted to self-detonate this projection, he wouldn't have the time.</p><p></p><p>Self-detonating a projection required time.</p><p></p><p>By the time the Galactic Overlord's self-detonation order was transmitted, the Tianyu Clan ancestor's palm would have already suppressed him.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the incredulous gaze of the surrounding more than a dozen Twelve-tier ultimates, the seemingly stunned Galactic Overlord took a single step backwards.</p><p></p><p>Just a single step away, as if a universe separated them, the Tianyu Clan ancestor's palm struck empty air.</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations were violent enough to annihilate an Eleventh-tier being in body and spirit, but when they approached within a few meters of Lin Yuan, they quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"This?" The Tianyu Clan ancestor was somewhat dazed. His Twelve-tier ultimate-level strike had missed.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this, the Tianyu Clan ancestor had anticipated any possible scenario, including the possibility that Lin Yuan might withstand the strike using the Human Civilization's foundational weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was slim. How could such precious foundational weapons be carried by a projection or avatar? Even the mightiest Eleventh-tier beings in the grand battlefields only carried clan-protecting weapons under the watchful eyes of the Twelve-tier ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But to miss? The Tianyu Clan ancestor could not understand it. He could sense that this was a pure confrontation at the rules level.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly block his strike might have involved external aid, but a rules-level confrontation? It meant that the Galactic Overlord's understanding of the rules was not weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve-tier ultimates surrounding them had grave expressions. At this moment, they were certain that Lin Yuan's understanding of the rules had reached the Twelve-tier level in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he reached their level, but he had surpassed them.</p><p></p><p>After all, for an Eleventh-tier existence to casually let the Tianyu Clan ancestor's Twelve-tier strike miss, this could not be explained by just being on the same rules level.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, their collective Twelve-tier ultimate assault would be nothing but a joke.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's rules mastery had reached such a height that even though he was still an Eleventh-tier existence, he was far from being their match.</p><p></p><p>But it also ruled out the possibility of him being suppressed, because Lin Yuan was fully capable of self-detonating this projection before being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>And the prerequisite for using that strange blood to contaminate and influence Lin Yuan was to completely suppress him, to the point where he could not even have a single thought.</p><p></p><p>But now, this possibility was approaching zero.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not a fool, he would surely self-detonate before realizing he was about to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, including the Tianyu Clan ancestor, the more than a dozen Twelve-tier ultimates fell into a strange silence.</p><p></p><p>"To come but not to go is improper." Lin Yuan smiled slightly and stepped forward, directly unleashing a punch.</p><p></p><p>This punch carried the understanding of the Seven Realms of Space-Time, and wherever the punch passed, the space-time began to collapse, heading towards the stunned Tianyu Clan ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Not good." As the Twelve-tier ultimate facing this punch, his expression changed drastically. He could feel that this...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of a single punch may not be particularly high, but the spatiotemporal rules it invokes are vast and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Even for one at the Twelfth Realm, if struck by this punch, they would not fare well.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Tian Yu Clan was about to react.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw the depths of Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>What unfathomable eyes they were, endless and abysmal, as if connecting to a mysterious abyss.</p><p></p><p>A secret technique of mental and willpower attack - </p><p></p><p>The Abyss Gaze.</p><p></p><p>This was the reward Lin Yuan obtained for breaking through the Seventh Floor of the Demon Jade Tower, with his Eleventh Realm of Existence.</p><p></p><p>A rare mental and willpower attack secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Lin Yuan's mental and willpower reaching forty million points, at the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm, the unleashing of the Abyss Gaze would stun even an Ultimate Twelfth Realm being, no matter how robust their fundamental life force.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's punch did not directly strike the Progenitor of the Tian Yu Clan, but the vast spatiotemporal forces it carried surged into him.</p><p></p><p>"You?!"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor's face paled, barely escaping the influence of the Abyss Gaze, only to feel his inner energy in disarray, with his inner universe beginning to tremble and shake.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor retreated seven or eight steps before finally stabilizing.</p><p></p><p>His gaze towards Lin Yuan was filled with unprecedented gravity.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Lin Yuan had displayed two methods capable of threatening even an Ultimate Twelfth Realm being.</p><p></p><p>One was the secret technique that directly attacked his mental and willpower, completely ensnaring the Progenitor's mind for several breaths.</p><p></p><p>This was partly due to the Progenitor not taking Lin Yuan seriously as an opponent.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan revealed rule comprehension surpassing their Twelfth Realm, the Progenitor did not pay much heed.</p><p></p><p>After all, rule comprehension was one thing, but attack power was another.</p><p></p><p>With a inner world spanning a hundred thousand light-years at the Twelfth Realm, even if attacked by an Eleventh Realm being like Lin Yuan, it would not be breached.</p><p></p><p>But that mental attack technique, combined with the punch Lin Yuan struck, truly shocked the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p>"The Galaxy Lord's punch?"</p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding dozen or so Ultimate Twelfth Realm beings were equally disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>They were still immersed in marveling at the Galaxy Lord's monstrous rule comprehension, yet discovered that the punch he struck also reached the Twelfth Realm level of power?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not have forced the Tian Yu Clan's Progenitor to retreat seven or eight steps!</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I am now merely a solar avatar. If it were my true self striking that punch, I could have at least injured this Tian Yu Clan's Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his true self, the solar avatar was vastly inferior. His true self's inner world spanned eleven light-years, while the solar avatar's only exceeded one light-year.</p><p></p><p>This gulf in inner world was like an abyss. If not for borrowing the insights of the Seventh Spatiotemporal Realm and the covert support of the chaotic external rules, amplifying his power a thousandfold, the Tian Yu Clan's Progenitor might not have retreated at all.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p>"The Galaxy Lord's punch made that old guy from the Tian Yu Clan retreat seven or eight steps?"</p><p></p><p>The rapidly approaching Xuanyuan Mighty One was somewhat dazed. He knew that Lin Yuan's true self was in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, with the avatar outside being at most a clone.</p><p></p><p>A clone, without relying on any Twelfth Realm weapons or treasures, solely through its own power, forced a Twelfth Realm Ultimate to retreat seven or eight steps? What kind of concept was this? The Galaxy Lord was only at the Eleventh Realm, the gap in life realm and inner world with a Twelfth Realm Ultimate was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Yet he managed to strike a Twelfth Realm Ultimate-level attack with just his own power?</p><p></p><p>"Even if the rule comprehension reaches the peak of the Sixth Spatiotemporal Realm, or even the Seventh Realm, the life realm is still there. How could it possibly shake a Twelfth Realm Ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin Mighty One was also astonished.</p><p></p><p>It was not a question of doubting Lin Yuan, but rather this scene should not have happened at all.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Calamity Clan's domain, in front of an ordinary wooden hut, the Calamity Clan's Ultimate sat, and the scene of over a dozen Twelfth Realm Ultimates surrounding Lin Yuan appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>As the most mysterious clan in the universe, one of the two at the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm, this Calamity Clan Ultimate naturally had the means to glimpse the scene before the spatiotemporal black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the hut murmured, having also witnessed Lin Yuan's punch repelling the Tian Yu Clan's Ultimate, sensing the terrifying rule fluctuations contained within.</p><p></p><p>"A clone's punch reaching the Twelfth Realm level of power?"</p><p></p><p>A voice also came from within the hut, its tone filled with shock. The implications of this scene were too many.</p><p></p><p>They could see that Lin Yuan's punch did not rely on any external forces, which made it even more inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the gaze that recently peered into this place must have been the Galaxy Lord's."</p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside the hut muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know how Lin Yuan struck that punch, the rule comprehension involved, especially the spatiotemporal rules, were beyond even his understanding.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, considering the gaze that had previously peered in, the Calamity Clan Ultimate was almost certain the source was the Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>"My Calamity Clan has witnessed countless geniuses throughout the eras of the universe, and there have been those who reached the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm before the great cataclysm. But this Galaxy Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate outside continued in a low voice, his tone filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>The other eleven major apex power factions only knew that the Calamity Clan originated from the previous universe cycle, but the clan's history went back far beyond that. </p><p></p><p>Through the endless eons, in every universe cycle this world had experienced, the Calamity Clan had left its mark. However, under the great cataclysm, information about the Calamity Clan had been eroded, with only fragments from the previous universe cycle reaching this one.</p><p></p><p>In those countless universe cycles, the Calamity Clan's two Ultimate Progenitors had witnessed countless geniuses, but compared to the Galaxy Lord?</p><p></p><p>No, those so-called geniuses, those who had reached the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm before the great cataclysm, did not even have the qualifications to be compared to the Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing you did not agree to those Twelfth Realm beings' request to eliminate the Galaxy Lord."</p><p>The voice from within the hut said.</p><p></p><p>Given the power the Galaxy Lord had just displayed, even if the Calamity Clan's two Ultimates intervened, they would be helpless, at most only able to destroy this clone of the Galaxy Lord.</p><p></p><p>But the Galaxy Lord still had his true self! Even before reaching the Twelfth Realm, the Galaxy Lord's clone had already attained Twelfth Realm level power in direct offense. Once he truly crossed into the Twelfth Realm...</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Lord's combat prowess would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan Ultimate had originally thought that after the Galaxy Lord reached the Twelfth Realm, he had a high chance of becoming a peak Transcendent Dao being before the end of this universe cycle.</p><p></p><p>But now? No need to wait until the end of this cycle. Once the Galaxy Lord crossed into the Twelfth Realm, with his life realm undergoing a massive transformation and leap, which of the Twelfth Realm Ultimates in this universe would be his match?</p>

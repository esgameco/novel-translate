            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in the profound understanding of the chaotic secret patterns, and his comprehension of the chaotic rules was constantly improving with every moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is too perfect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly, as the chaotic secret patterns within the Level-B war machine had already involved the profound aspects of the Chaotic Dual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I can maintain this pace of comprehension, at most in a thousand years, no, even a hundred years, I can reach the peak of the Chaotic Dual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the Chaotic Triple Realm? The current chaotic secret patterns of the Level-B war machine did not contain the essence of the Chaotic Triple Realm rules.</p><p></p><p>Even the chaotic secrets contained in the Level-A war machines, most likely, would not involve the Chaotic Triple Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Triple Realm, that was the ultimate realm of comprehending the chaotic rules, and even many supreme saints in the chaotic void had not reached that level.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow, first reach the peak of the Dual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no particular thoughts about the Chaotic Triple Realm for now.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind suddenly stirred, and he stopped comprehending the chaotic secret patterns, looking towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"The war is about to begin?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly walked out of the war machine.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the other side of the defense line, enemy war machines were continuously gathering, and there was even the aura of a Grand Patriarch hidden among them.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed Grand Patriarch Leige."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately confirmed that the Grand Patriarch leading the other side was Grand Patriarch Leige.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Patriarch Leige, he should not be an ordinary newly-ascended Grand Patriarch." Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that Grand Patriarch Leige's aura was a bit more profound than a normal newly-ascended Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Hiding his strength?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, but he was not too concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>Grand Patriarch Leige was hiding his strength, but wasn't he doing the same?</p><p></p><p>In fact, the strength Lin Yuan was hiding was far beyond Grand Patriarch Leige's, and even without using the "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens", he had combat power close to the peak of Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>With a rustling sound, numerous Sovereign Realm experts entered the war machines, and the massive war machines began to slowly operate.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I can't leave one machine for comprehension alone."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the war machines standing in battle formation, feeling a little disappointed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The number of war machines in each defense line area was fixed.</p><p></p><p>Before the war broke out, Lin Yuan could hide in a war machine without any problems. But once the war started, if he occupied a war machine, it would be too blatant.</p><p></p><p>Although Qiansong King's attention was mainly focused on the core defense line battlefield, it did not mean he was completely unconcerned about the battles in other defense lines.</p><p></p><p>"But a war like this, the actual combat time will be at least thousands or even tens of thousands of years, the time spent in direct confrontation is not that much, the main time will be the recuperation period."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called recuperation period was the time of ceasefire after both sides had experienced the fierce battles.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Lin Yuan would have plenty of time to slowly comprehend each war machine.</p><p></p><p>"Let the Galaxy Grand Patriarch make the first move first."</p><p></p><p>Grand Patriarch Leige was also observing the battlefield, seeing the war machines start to operate, but he did not underestimate them at all.</p><p></p><p>Although the intelligence reports showed that the Galaxy Grand Patriarch was a newly-ascended Grand Patriarch who had broken through less than a thousand years ago, someone who was considered a new Grand Patriarch among the new Grand Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>But Leige, who had cultivated to this level, was naturally not an arrogant person. Even though he was very confident in himself, he still planned to wait for the Galaxy Grand Patriarch to make the first move before deciding whether to act or not.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Galaxy Grand Patriarch make the first move was equivalent to seizing the initiative.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the war machines on both sides began to clash fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A war machine filled with chaotic flames suddenly transformed into a huge fireball, and endless flames began to wildly spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"That Level-B intermediate war machine?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at this war machine, which was the highest-level war machine in this defense line area. When operating at full power, it could form a Blazing Sun Domain, suppressing all enemies within.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>On the Dreamscape Domain side, the war machines also began to operate, unleashing power no less than the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Lock!"</p><p></p><p>A huge war machine with a purple body suddenly took a step forward, and purple chains instantly appeared in the void, converging towards the only Level-B intermediate war machine in the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>The target of these countless purple chains was the Level-B intermediate war machine in the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The one-horned man 'Luopeng', who was one of the few Sovereign Realm peak experts controlling the Level-B intermediate war machine, changed expression.</p><p></p><p>The Level-B intermediate war machine could accommodate more than three thousand Sovereign Realm experts, but only a few of them could truly control this war machine.</p><p></p><p>"Fall back."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly sounded in the one-horned man 'Luopeng's ear.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Grand Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>'Luopeng' immediately recognized this voice as belonging to the Galaxy Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>As for the content, it was instructions on how to resist the countless purple chains converging upon them.</p><p></p><p>During this period, although Lin Yuan had not yet comprehended that Level-B intermediate war machine, through the war machines he had already comprehended, he had a sufficient understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>This understanding came from the most fundamental understanding, far exceeding the temporary controller 'Luopeng's understanding.</p><p></p><p>So when he saw the countless purple chains erupting from the Dreamscape Domain's war machine, Lin Yuan immediately knew how to block them.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The huge fireball and the countless purple chains collided abruptly, causing countless flames to scatter, and many chains were destroyed. In the end, the purple-bodied war machine from the Dreamscape Domain could only retreat reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>In the brief clash just now, it had been slightly at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grand Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Level-B intermediate war machine, the one-horned man 'Luopeng' immediately expressed his gratitude to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for Lin Yuan, under the coverage of those countless purple chains, even if he could control the war machine to break free, he would have been constrained for a while.</p><p></p><p>And without this war machine's "Blazing Sun Domain", the other battles on the battlefield would be...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The collision of the machines, this side of Qingfan Domain has lost its greatest advantage, and there is even a possibility of a rout.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" "It actually blocked it?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Venerable Leige was also paying attention to the battlefield. When he saw the purple war machine retreat, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The purple war machine's action was at his behest. Leige the Great Venerable thought he had grasped the key to the situation, and acted the moment the Level-B war machine in Qingfan Domain formed the Blazing Sun Domain.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the chances of victory on his side would be maximized.</p><p></p><p>"It has reached a stalemate."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable watched the war, watched the clash of the war machines on both sides, and suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had the idea of shining on the battlefield, wanting to perform well in front of the Spiritual Majesty King.</p><p></p><p>But according to the current situation, if he didn't act again, there would be no possibility of breaking through the opponent's defense line.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable sighed in his heart. Originally, he still wanted to wait for the Great Venerable of the Galaxy to act first, and then act himself.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, he can only act first.</p><p></p><p>But the impact is not great, as long as the intelligence is not problematic, the Great Venerable of the Galaxy is a newly promoted Great Venerable, and his side is still foolproof.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In its place was boundless thunder.</p><p></p><p>The path Leige the Great Venerable walked was the Chaotic Thunder, and his greatest expertise was in killing.</p><p></p><p>"Leige the Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared silently, blocking Leige the Great Venerable. "Your opponent is me."</p><p></p><p>"I do want to see what the disciple trained by the Marquis of Qingfan is capable of."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable was too lazy to waste words. The faster he broke through the defense line of Qingfan Domain, even if it was only the edge defense line, the higher his evaluation would be in the eyes of the Spiritual Majesty King.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan engaged in a fierce battle with Leige the Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Focus on defense."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan merely revealed a strength comparable to Leige the Great Venerable, after all, this was the 'Crimson Pine King's' strategy.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the edge defense line where Lin Yuan was located, or the core defense line area, they were all focused on defense. As long as they could block the attack from the Purple Dream Domain, it would be enough.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>After exchanging blows with Lin Yuan for a moment, Leige the Great Venerable's expression was one of surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had almost fully unleashed his power, but still failed to drive Lin Yuan back.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable of the Galaxy, you have also hidden your strength?"</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's expression looked grim. This scene could only be explained this way.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not respond. At this moment, part of his attention was on the core defense line area, where the peak Great Venerables had already begun to clash with each other.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome now."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's expression was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to quickly defeat Lin Yuan with the might of thunder, and then break through the defense line, leaving a good impression on the Spiritual Majesty King.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Majesty King was a royal king, and in the future, even if he could not become the ancient country's emperor, his status would be high above all. The Heavenly Venerables might not look up to him, but a Great Venerable like Leige still yearned to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>But now, Leige the Great Venerable's plan was rapidly falling apart.</p><p></p><p>"There is still hope to break through the defense line."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's thoughts were quickly turning, taking stock of all his current means and trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Great Venerable of the Galaxy has also hidden his strength, he is about the same as me. As long as I..."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's gaze turned downward, where the various war machines of the Purple Dream Domain were currently engaged in a frenzied battle with the many war machines of the Qingfan Domain.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can defeat that Level-B war machine, gain the advantage on the battlefield below, and then hold back the Great Venerable of the Galaxy, I can still break through the defense line."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, his plan was to defeat the Great Venerable of the Galaxy himself, and then go support the battle of the war machines below.</p><p></p><p>Now, relying on him to defeat the Great Venerable of the Galaxy is not realistic, so he can only rely on gaining the advantage through the battle of the war machines below, and then turn around and help himself.</p><p></p><p>"That's it then."</p><p></p><p>Brilliant thunder began to emerge between Leige the Great Venerable's brows.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>This brilliant thunder tore through space and headed towards the battlefield below.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant thunder suddenly swelled, becoming as tall as the heavens and earth, its terrifying aura permeating through the layers of space, rushing towards that Level-B war machine.</p><p></p><p>"This is the source thunder I've nurtured for a million years."</p><p></p><p>Leige the Great Venerable's aura weakened slightly.</p><p></p><p>This source thunder was Leige the Great Venerable's strongest offensive technique. If he used it against the Great Venerable of the Galaxy, it could at most suppress the other for a moment, and it would be difficult to directly defeat him.</p><p></p><p>But if he used it against the Level-B war machine below, it could be said that it would definitely tear it apart.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could solve this strongest war machine, the battle below would definitely be dominated by the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>Then he only needed to hold back the Great Venerable of the Galaxy, and he could control the situation of the war.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying source thunder arrived in an instant, descending upon the Level-B war machine as soon as it appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Level-B war machine, although it could threaten the Great Venerables, would find it very difficult to block Leige the Great Venerable's strongest offensive technique, especially since Leige had timed the attack so perfectly.</p><p></p><p>That Level-B war machine really had no chance to evade.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who was casually entangling Leige the Great Venerable, suddenly changed expression, looking towards the Level-B war machine that was about to be covered by the terrifying thunder.</p><p></p><p>"My Chaotic Secret Markings!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly stretched out his hand, and in an instant, this hand became immensely huge, tearing through the layers of space. Leige the Great Venerable's source thunder, which had been nurtured for a million years and was considered his strongest offensive technique, was as fragile as thin paper in the face of Lin Yuan's right hand, and was easily torn apart.</p><p></p><p>The Level-B war machine that had already swelled to a size of hundreds of millions of li, was protected in the palm of Lin Yuan's outstretched right hand, like a small kitten.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The smile that was about to appear on Leige the Great Venerable's face suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

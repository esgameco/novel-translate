        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 338: The Treasure of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Is it really that simple?" Lin Yuan was somewhat astonished. </p><p></p><p>He could sense the special nature of the yellowish-brown crystal before him.</p><p></p><p>That aura subtly connected to the entire Xuan Huang Secret Realm made Lin Yuan certain that the six-armed figure was not lying. </p><p></p><p>As long as he could refine this yellowish-brown crystal, he would inherit the entire Xuan Huang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even supreme experts would be unable to pinpoint the location of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, which would become Lin Yuan's own backyard.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>This was too easy?</p><p></p><p>There was no bloody battle. </p><p>No trials or tribulations.</p><p>No obstacles to overcome.</p><p></p><p>He just came to the core area of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm and obtained everything like this?</p><p></p><p>"Simple?" The six-armed figure pondered for a moment. "Indeed, it is simple."</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Xuan Huang Sovereign had left behind many tests and hardships.</p><p></p><p>But the six-armed figure, perceiving Lin Yuan's current strength, clearly saw that those trials would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>So it simply couldn't be bothered to follow through and directly handed everything over to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Your aptitude, your talents, are worthy of the bequeathal from my Xuan Huang lineage," the six-armed figure stated directly.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if it had "I have high hopes for Lin Yuan" written on its face.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that the true years you have experienced cannot be very long, definitely not exceeding four thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"In such a short time, for you to have opened up so many spatial layers, this foundation is something I have never seen before. You have a great possibility of becoming a Twelfth Step life form."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan. "Our Sovereign should be delighted to have such a successor like you."</p><p></p><p>"I understand now." Lin Yuan realized that the six-armed figure had been paying attention to him all along.</p><p></p><p>Well, as the "Heavenly Dao" of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, nothing happening within the realm could be hidden from it.</p><p></p><p>"What can I do for our Sovereign?" Lin Yuan put away the yellowish-brown crystal and asked.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to do anything," the six-armed figure said meaningfully. "You only need to try your best to remember our Sovereign Xuan Huang's name and spread the Xuan Huang evolutionary path in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I know the threshold for cultivating the Xuan Huang evolutionary path is also high, but it doesn't matter. With your talents and aptitude, you will live an extremely long life in the future. Just do it casually."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure continued, "Remember our Sovereign Xuan Huang's name and spread the Xuan Huang evolutionary path?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't find it too difficult, and the six-armed figure hadn't set any specific standards, such as accomplishing this within a certain number of years.</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"At our Sovereign's level, the concepts of life and death no longer exist. As long as his descendants still remember his name and the world still practices his cultivation method, perhaps in the infinitely distant future, there may come a day when he can return."</p><p></p><p>A hint of hope emerged in the six-armed figure's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Return?" Lin Yuan's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Although the six-armed figure didn't explain, and the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji in the Devil Jade Space also didn't make any conclusions, Lin Yuan had subconsciously assumed that Sovereign Xuan Huang had already perished, just like the master of the Devil Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they hadn't died, how could they have disappeared for so long? Even if trapped, they should have found ways to contact the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But from the six-armed figure's words, it seemed that even if Sovereign Xuan Huang had truly died, he could still return?</p><p></p><p>Return meant to be resurrected.</p><p></p><p>Supreme experts could resurrect others, but how could supreme experts resurrect themselves?</p><p></p><p>The essence of resurrection was to reverse the river of time, retrieve the perished life from the past, and bring it back to the present.</p><p></p><p>But for supreme experts?</p><p></p><p>They had already transcended the river of time, with their past and present as one. Once a supreme expert died, there was no way for resurrection, as their life imprint could not be found in any past segment of time.</p><p></p><p>And even if it could be found, who could bear the cost of resurrecting a supreme expert?</p><p></p><p>Resurrecting life was not without cost for supreme experts. The cost was simply borne by the supreme experts themselves. The stronger the resurrected life, the greater the backlash they had to endure.</p><p></p><p>Normally, resurrecting an Eleventh Step expert would already significantly impact a supreme expert. To resurrect another supreme expert of the same level?</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert would perish in the process.</p><p></p><p>Although supreme experts had eternal longevity, it did not mean they could not die.</p><p></p><p>"But that was a step our Sovereign ultimately did not take," the six-armed figure shook its head.</p><p></p><p>"That step?" Lin Yuan looked at the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>Such secrets could only be known at the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that evolutionary paths contain the Dao of their founders," the six-armed figure began.</p><p></p><p>"And our Sovereign's name is also unique. Remembering his name can similarly become an aid when he returns."</p><p></p><p>"I see, so that's how it is." Lin Yuan silently realized that the significance of ultimate existences far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Sovereign Xuan Huang must have ventured far into the ultimate realm, possessing certain qualities that transcended the ultimate, which was why there was hope for him to return after death.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if the master of the Devil Jade Tower had reached this level. The Devil Jade Space was only a place left behind by the Devil Jade Tower master for tempering, different from an inheritance realm like the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, which was the root of the Xuan Huang lineage's legacy.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>"You probably need some time to refine the core of the secret realm. Let me introduce you to the treasures and inheritances within this Xuan Huang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure was in a good mood, having found such an outstanding successor for Sovereign Xuan Huang. Even though this successor currently appeared very weak, there was finally hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps before this secret realm dissipated, it could witness Lin Yuan stepping into the ultimate realm?</p><p></p><p>"Treasures and inheritances?" A hint of curiosity and anticipation appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>He had absorbed the yellowish-brown crystal into his inner world, refining it with the power of his world. Lin Yuan could indeed feel that it would not take a short time to fully refine it.</p><p></p><p>However, it likely wouldn't take too long either.</p><p></p><p>According to the feeling this crystal gave Lin Yuan, once completely refined, he would become the "master" of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, possessing all "privileges".</p><p></p><p>"First is the 'Xuan Huang Source', also known as the 'Xuan Huang Crystal' in the outside world." With a shift of its consciousness, the six-armed figure brought Lin Yuan to a spacious area.</p><p></p><p>"That hill?" Lin Yuan immediately noticed a small hill in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The small hill appeared yellowish-brown in color, only a few hundred meters tall, looking completely unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>But—</p><p></p><p>"This small hill is made up of Xuan Huang Crystals?" Lin Yuan was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, a fist-sized Xuan Huang Crystal could already fetch the astronomical price of a hundred thousand universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>But here, this hill of a few hundred meters in height was an accumulation of Xuan Huang Crystals?</p><p></p><p>How many universal crystals would its value reach? Lin Yuan's mind raced at an astonishing speed, and with just a rough calculation, he arrived at a value of trillions upon trillions of universal crystals for this small hill.</p><p></p><p>The entire fortune of an Eighth Step expert was only around ten thousand universal crystals. Even for a Ninth Step expert, their peak fortune would not exceed three billion, referring to those special Ninth Step experts who had lived for extremely long eras.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuan Huang Crystals here were worth trillions upon trillions?</p><p></p><p>"In fact, these Xuan Huang Crystals were only collected after the native lifeforms of this secret realm grew old and died," the six-armed figure shook its head. "And with the passage of time, a large portion of the Xuan Huang Crystals have also naturally dissipated."</p><p></p><p>"Grew old and died?" Lin Yuan was amazed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Below the supreme expert level, unless they were artificial lifeforms like the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, or sentient artifacts, all lifeforms had a limited longevity.</p><p></p><p>Only by achieving the ultimate could one become eternal.</p><p></p><p>"So all of this belongs to me now?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it all belongs to you," the six-armed figure smiled.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had not yet refined the core of the secret realm and could not be considered the true master of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, in the six-armed figure's eyes, Lin Yuan had already been chosen.</p><p></p><p>"I have a suggestion," the six-armed figure hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Please, go ahead," Lin Yuan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"It's best if you don't take these Xuan Huang Crystals out in a short period of time," the six-armed figure said.</p><p></p><p>"Every time the Xuan Huang Secret Realm opens, there will be more than one supreme expert attempting to pinpoint its exact coordinates."</p><p></p><p>"But they can never break through our Sovereign's defenses left behind..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Methods?" The six-armed figure sneered, "Those supremely powerful beings have been trying to obtain the inheritance left behind by His Majesty, but have been unable to succeed."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's words carried a pointed meaning. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm had already opened many times before. </p><p></p><p>Each time it opened, a certain amount of Xuanhuang crystals would flow out, with the rough quantity not varying too much.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan brought all these mountain-sized Xuanhuang crystals out into the world in a short period of time and allowed them to spread, it would inevitably draw the attention of the various peak factions. Why did so many Xuanhuang crystals flow out during this opening of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?</p><p></p><p>Once such suspicions arose, all the ninth-stage experts who entered during this opening of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would be investigated thoroughly. As an extremely outstanding figure among them, Lin Yuan would certainly be a key target of scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>Even with the protection of the human civilization, while the other peak factions could not intervene, it was still possible that the human civilization's higher-ups would question Lin Yuan about this matter.</p><p></p><p>How should Lin Yuan respond at that time? </p><p></p><p>Lie? The human civilization's leaders might not believe him.</p><p></p><p>Tell the truth? What if the human civilization then demanded that Lin Yuan actively open the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to allow human cultivators to train inside? Or demanded that he hand over the inheritances and spoils from within?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength was still too lacking to be worthy of controlling the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, a treasure ground coveted even by supremely powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the above was only a small possibility. </p><p></p><p>It was more likely that the human civilization would still value Lin Yuan's potential and not alienate this greatest genius in human history over something as trivial as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not want to face such a moral dilemma.</p><p></p><p>"You can take out a portion of the Xuanhuang crystals every hundred thousand years, dividing it into hundreds or thousands of times. That way, it should not draw too much attention," the six-armed figure said.</p><p></p><p>There were fluctuations in the amount of Xuanhuang crystals that flowed out each time the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened. As long as the increase was not too drastic at once, it would not cause much of an impact.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a longing for greater strength welled up within him. If he was a supremely powerful being, he would not need to hide anything. Even if he announced to the various peak factions of the universe that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm belonged to him, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>Without a true supreme being presiding over the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, many supreme beings would be unable to pry into it. But once a supreme being took charge, who among the other supreme beings would dare to object?</p><p></p><p>"There are also some weapons, treasures, minerals, plants, blood essences, corpses of special lifeforms, and so on," the six-armed figure continued. "These are the belongings of those ninth-stage experts who attempted to remain within the Secret Realm from previous openings."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm opened once every two hundred thousand years, remaining open for a hundred years each time.</p><p></p><p>Within the Secret Realm were many opportune locations containing Xuanhuang crystals, as well as native lifeforms possessing Xuanhuang crystals within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>For the myriad ninth-stage alien races of the universe, the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could be considered a priceless ground. The rewards obtained during its hundred-year opening period alone surpassed what they could accumulate over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.  </p><p></p><p>If one could remain within the Secret Realm after it closed and wait for the next opening, the gains would be immense.</p><p></p><p>Hence, during the initial few openings of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, most ninth-stage alien races attempted to stay behind after it closed.</p><p></p><p>Even now, some ninth-stage experts still tried various methods to linger within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, unwilling to give up.</p><p></p><p>After all, the rewards were too great - just a hundred years inside was comparable to hundreds of thousands of years of their own accumulation. What about two hundred thousand years then?</p><p></p><p>"So many?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, he saw there were around 248 ninth-stage treasures in total, along with some corpses of special lifeforms and more.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of special lifeforms were extremely valuable, as their bloodlines could be extracted to concoct blood essence pills. Previously when Lin Yuan swept through the galaxy domains, he had killed some special lifeforms and refined their blood essences into pills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could foresee that as the path of martial dao evolution advanced along the bloodline cultivation branch, the excavation of bloodlines would play a huge role in promoting the human civilization's progress. At that time, the blood essence pills of relevant special lifeforms would become priceless commodities.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly..."</p><p></p><p>"There is His Majesty's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan as the realm transformed again, bringing them to a space of only a few miles in area.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty's inheritance is divided into two categories."  </p><p></p><p>"One is the path of evolution."</p><p></p><p>"The other is secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Path of evolution?" Lin Yuan's mind trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Correct. The Xuanhuang path of evolution you are cultivating is merely the preface of the evolutionary path left behind by His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure raised its right hand, pointing at Lin Yuan. Instantly, a massive amount of information poured into his mind.</p><p></p><p>The complete Xuanhuang path of evolution - First Realm, Second Realm, Third Realm, Fourth Realm...all the way up to the Eighth Realm, Tenth Realm, Eleventh Realm, and Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swiftly absorbed the information on the realms from the First to the Twelfth.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed a supreme path of evolution," Lin Yuan rejoiced inwardly after a cursory examination.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen a supreme path of evolution beyond the nine major ones of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Among the rewards for breaking through the third and fourth floors of the Magic Cube Pavilion was an incomplete supreme path of evolution. But ultimately, Lin Yuan had chosen the "Microcosmic Universe" instead.</p><p></p><p>"It has yet to produce a final form?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up, meaning the value of this evolutionary path far exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>There were two types of supreme paths of evolution:</p><p></p><p>One type had a final form, while the other did not.</p><p></p><p>The former was more common, like the nine major supreme paths of the human civilization. The latter, however, was extremely rare - so rare that "rare" could not even describe it properly.</p><p></p><p>It represented the vacancy for a final form.</p><p></p><p>"But don't get your hopes up too high. I can sense that in other universes, there are existences who have cultivated the Xuanhuang path to the eleventh realm," the six-armed figure added.</p><p></p><p>"Other universes?" Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realms originally opened by the Xuanhuang Sovereign numbered thirty-three million and three hundred thirty-three.  </p><p></p><p>Even if most of those Xuanhuang Secret Realms had been destroyed, some were still preserved.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Sovereign certainly understood the principle of not putting all one's eggs in one basket. Just as Lin Yuan had obtained the inheritance of this Xuanhuang Secret Realm, other qualified successors would emerge from the remaining realms elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>"These are the secret techniques," the six-armed figure pointed out once more.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a surge of information entered Lin Yuan's mind again.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Lin Yuan finally absorbed it all.</p><p></p><p>The secret techniques left behind by the Xuanhuang Sovereign fell into three categories:</p><p></p><p>Attack, defense, and escape.</p><p></p><p>The attack secret technique was called "Xuanhuang Strike."  </p><p></p><p>The escape technique was "Spacetime Step."</p><p></p><p>"This..." Lin Yuan briefly comprehended them and grasped the general effects of the three secret techniques, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>When he became a core disciple of the Magic Cube Pavilion, Lin Yuan had also seen some of the inherited secret techniques left behind by the Pavilion Lord.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, he chose the "Illusion Reality" technique, which could fully utilize the mysterious gourd to greatly enhance the combat power of his two spiritual souls, allowing them to break free from their crippled state.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's choice of "Illusion Reality" did not mean the other secret techniques were ineffective.</p><p></p><p>But now, the three secret techniques bequeathed by the Xuanhuang Sovereign allowed Lin Yuan to witness the terrifying power of the secret arts created by a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>First, there was the Xuanhuang Strike, which gathered one's full power to unleash a strike exceeding one's limits.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique had four levels. The first level allowed striking with double one's full power.  </p><p></p><p>The second level, triple the power.</p><p></p><p>The third level, quadruple the power. </p><p></p><p>The fourth level, quintuple the power.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body's "Augmentation" divine ability could instantly unleash a power ten times his normal limit.</p><p></p><p>This seemed far superior to the Xuanhuang Strike technique.</p><p></p><p>However, Augmentation was unsustainable and required paying a price afterwards - a period of temporary weakness.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Strike had no such cost. As long as one cultivated to the corresponding level, it could be seamlessly integrated into any strike.</p>

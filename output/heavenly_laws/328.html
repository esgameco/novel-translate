            <p>Chapter 328: Return (End of Traversal, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Time rules are the pillar rules that form the foundation of the world, and they are the highest level among all pillar rules. ‚ô¢‚ô¶Ôºñ‚ûà‡∏£Ôº®ÔΩïÀ£.ùïîœå·µêüëΩ‚ô¢</p><p></p><p>To comprehend life rules, space rules and other pillar rules, one only needs to reach the sixth or seventh level. </p><p></p><p>But time rules? If you don't reach the ninth level and become a multi-dimensional being, you can't even feel the fluctuations of time rules, let alone comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan, who possesses unparalleled comprehension abilities, did not choose to forcibly comprehend time rules at the eighth level, as the efficiency would be too low and not worth it.</p><p></p><p>"Among the 2,173 time rule models, I have now comprehended 851 of them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. You should know that normal ninth level powerhouses would not spend too much energy comprehending time rules. Often, even at the level of millions of ninth level realms, they have not even begun to grasp time rules.</p><p></p><p>Tenth level powerhouses have a deeper understanding of time rules, but they are only at the stage of comprehending between 200 to 500 time rule models. </p><p></p><p>As for 851 time rule models? That is something only extremely powerful and special tenth level powerhouses can achieve, or it is the domain of eleventh level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the complete time rules is something only peak eleventh level powerhouses attempting to break through to the supreme level can touch upon.</p><p></p><p>One of the prerequisites for breaking through to the supreme level is to fully comprehend time rules, then integrate them with space rules to master space-time, and make the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>In the process, the more beings cultivate according to one's own evolutionary path, the greater the power for making that ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are too few True God Brands and Sovereign God Brands that contain time attributes. Among the Sovereign God Brands, only the Divination God and Light Sovereign God Brands possess time attributes, and there is only one True God Brand with time attributes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. If there were a few more God Brands containing time attributes, he was confident he could comprehend a thousand time models.</p><p></p><p>Being able to comprehend a thousand time rule models at the ninth level, although not as unprecedented as opening up over 2.3 billion space layers, would definitely be considered world-shaking and heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Generally, only those unique special lifeforms with time-related talents have the hope of achieving this.</p><p></p><p>"Time slows down."</p><p></p><p>With a slight thought from Lin Yuan, the flow of time on his body's surface began to slow down, rapidly decelerating. A day passed outside while only two hours passed for Lin Yuan himself, with the time flow ratio between the two reaching twelve to one.</p><p></p><p>This was also the maximum limit of time flow that Lin Yuan could currently manipulate, mainly because his own life level was too thick and heavy, and the cost of slowing down his own time flow was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary ninth level being, Lin Yuan could easily make their own time flow reach a ratio of one to a thousand compared to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In the river of time, the energy required to slow down a whale far exceeds the energy needed to slow down a small fish.</p><p></p><p>"After time slows down, even the perception of the Great Dao rules becomes blurred." The current time flow ratio between Lin Yuan himself and the outside world was only one to twelve.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the clarity of perception of the Great Dao rules plummeted.</p><p></p><p>It can be inferred that in an environment where the time flow ratio reaches thousands or tens of thousands to one, it is almost impossible to comprehend the Great Dao rules of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those ninth and tenth level powerhouses are unwilling to cultivate using time chambers and similar time treasures." Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the main world have the ability to slow down the time flow in certain areas, and even refine similar secret treasures. </p><p></p><p>However, in such an environment where time flow is slowed, it is difficult to help one's own cultivation, and the time spent is real consumption of one's own lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"The difference in time flow in a certain area will lead to a blurred perception of the Great Dao rules, because the Great Dao rules themselves naturally fluctuate with the main time flow."</p><p></p><p>"But by traversing through the Gate of Myriad Realms, the dimensional world I am in has this kind of time flow. Even if it is different from the time flow of the main world, it does not affect the comprehension of the Great Dao rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan realized another benefit of traversing across dimensional worlds using the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>This time, with the help of the God Brands of gods and sovereigns, the help to Lin Yuan was undoubtedly huge, saving him a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Without these True God Brands and Sovereign God Brands, even if Lin Yuan could still reach his current height, it would definitely take much longer.</p><p></p><p>Not using the "key" effect of the God Brands, Lin Yuan's efficiency would certainly be much lower.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Another two years went by.</p><p></p><p>The Longshan Fang couple successively passed away from old age after reaching the limit of lifespan in this world. Unless they ignited the divine fire and changed the essence of their lives, they had to die normally.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan did not use the world power in his inner world to delay the death of his parents, because it had no meaning. A year later, when he returned, the Longshan Fang couple would still have to die.</p><p></p><p>Living one more year or one less year did not make much difference.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, before their deaths, the Longshan Fang couple did not have any fear. Giving birth to a son who opened up a new era was a great honor.</p><p></p><p>Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ruins of Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Longshan family cemetery.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared. This time, it was not his two great yuan spirits that came to the human realm, but his true self.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in front of the tombstones of the Longshan Fang couple, his expression calm, showing no joy or sorrow, just standing there quietly.</p><p></p><p>Around the cemetery, important members of the Longshan family came and went. After all, the Longshan Fang couple were the parents of Longshan Yuan, and their status in the Longshan family was unshakable. Even the true martial gods of the Martial Realm would descend with divine power incarnations to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter who it was, no one saw Lin Yuan standing in front of the tombstones. It seemed that the two existed in different layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the graves, although he was not the real Longshan Yuan, after so many years of getting along, Lin Yuan still had some feelings.</p><p></p><p>"You have left. In a year, I will have to leave too." Lin Yuan was silent. A year later would be the time limit for his stay in this traversal.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan was willing to pay another ten strands of realm-breaking source power to descend into this world, there was probably no possibility of returning again.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go and prepare the final arrangements." Lin Yuan stood in front of the Longshan Fang couple's tombstones for a long time before disappearing silently.</p><p></p><p>Martial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>Although there were less than a hundred true martial gods in the Longshan family, the construction of Longshan City was extremely luxurious, far surpassing the other Wanxiang City.</p><p></p><p>The first member of the Longshan family to become a true martial god was named Longshan Quan. As for Longshan Ling and the others under his command, they have not yet ignited the divine fire.</p><p></p><p>The many true martial gods of the Longshan family in the Martial Realm were all led by Longshan Quan. After all, as the first genius of the Longshan family to become a god, his influence was very far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Great Hall.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Quan and several other true martial gods of the Longshan family gathered to exchange and communicate.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor is so benevolent, actually giving outsiders so many opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long Shanquan's expression revealed dissatisfaction. Over the years, he had grown increasingly disgusted with the martial gods of Wanxiang City. </p><p></p><p>The martial realm was pioneered by the ancestor of their Long Shan clan and should have been their private domain. Instead, it was occupied by a group of outsiders.</p><p></p><p>The other martial gods also nodded in agreement. They had long regarded the entire martial realm as their own backyard. How could those martial gods of Wanxiang City be worthy of living in the same place as them?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at this moment, a figure appeared silently to the side. </p><p></p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p>"Ancestor Long Shan."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Long Shanquan and the other true gods of the Long Shan clan immediately called out respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, you are finally willing to see us," Long Shanquan said excitedly. </p><p></p><p>Since ascending to the martial realm a hundred years ago, he had only seen Lin Yuan once. Several attempts to visit afterwards did not receive much response.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was leisurely as he looked towards the Long Shan Palace and the entire Long Shan City. He said indifferently, "The Long Shan clan has prospered because of me. I don't want it to decline because of me."</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, how could the Long Shan clan decline because of you? Your strength is the greatest in history. You pioneered the martial realm, received martial gods, and mortals revere you even more than the gods," Long Shanquan said, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan existed, the status of the Long Shan clan was indisputable. This was already considered an iron law.</p><p></p><p>"But I will also leave," Lin Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>"Leave?" Long Shanquan was a little stunned. "Where is the ancestor going, and when will he return?"</p><p></p><p>The other martial gods looked at each other, their expressions a little perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"I won't come back," Lin Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Won't come back?" Long Shanquan was shocked. Lin Yuan was now the pillar of the Long Shan clan, as well as the pillar of this world.</p><p></p><p>The impact on the Long Shan clan would be fatal.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I won't come back." Lin Yuan looked at the several martial gods of the Long Shan clan. "So from now on, the Long Shan clan cannot be too harsh on the foreign gods."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had always only cared about the spread of martial cultivation methods, and had never paid attention to the prosperity or decline of the Long Shan clan, he still reminded them before leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor." Long Shanquan's face turned pale as he looked at Lin Yuan pleadingly. </p><p></p><p>He realized that what Lin Yuan said might be true, and the Long Shan clan would lose its most powerful backer in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm leaving, I'll leave something behind." Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand, and three crystal cores suspended in the air, emanating a profound aura.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>Long Shanquan was stunned for a moment, and then his body began to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Main godheads.</p><p></p><p>These were main godheads.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had killed twenty-four main gods, the twenty-four main godheads had not appeared.</p><p></p><p>But even if they desired the main godheads, no one dared to look for them. Needless to say, the twenty-four main godheads were all in the hands of that patriarch of the Long Shan clan.</p><p></p><p>"I will leave these three main godheads in the Long Shan clan. When you become a peak high-level god, you can try to refine them," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already comprehended the twenty-four main godheads, and there was no meaning in keeping them with him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the main godheads were the essential "keys" to the rules of this world. Once they left this world, they would automatically collapse, and at the same time, new main godheads would re-condense somewhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, before returning to the main world, Lin Yuan naturally had to arrange the whereabouts of the main godheads.</p><p></p><p>"With these three main godheads, even if I leave, the Long Shan clan can still be glorious for millions or even tens of millions of years," Lin Yuan said, looking at the excited Long Shanquan.</p><p></p><p>With these three main godheads, the Long Shan clan would have the equivalent of three main god-level powerhouses in the future.</p><p></p><p>With such a foundation, unless another person like Lin Yuan came along, it would be very difficult to shake the foundation of the Long Shan clan.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Long Shan clan did not bring about their own destruction and were a little more cautious and humble in the future, their glory would not diminish much.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Ancestor." Long Shanquan immediately knelt down, and the other martial gods did the same.</p><p></p><p>"As for the remaining twenty-one main godheads, I will release one every once in a while for other martial gods to fight over," Lin Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>"The Long Shan clan does not need to interfere with these godheads."</p><p></p><p>He had no intention of placing all twenty-four main godheads in the Long Shan clan. If that were the case, the status of the Long Shan clan would never be challenged, forming a situation where one family dominated the martial cultivators of this world.</p><p></p><p>And this was not conducive to the development of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>To truly advance martial arts, it required the brilliant emergence of hundreds of schools. If the Long Shan clan was too powerful, coupled with the lack of restraint from Lin Yuan, they would inevitably suppress other martial arts geniuses outside the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Although Long Shanquan and the other martial gods were a little reluctant, since the ancestor had decided, they had no right to refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor." Long Shanquan was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly realized that the space in front of him was empty.</p><p></p><p>Only the three main godheads were left floating there quietly.</p><p></p><p>"The ancestor has left." Long Shanquan was stunned and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"The ancestor is too benevolent." The other martial gods looked at the three main godheads with desire, but did not dare to have any thoughts of snatching them.</p><p></p><p>Who knew if the ancestor was observing them in secret?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the ancestor is benevolent." Long Shanquan sighed. "But since the ancestor has decided, my Long Shan clan will do as the ancestor said from now on, restraining the clansmen and completely giving up the fight for the other main godheads."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The several martial gods of the Long Shan clan looked at each other and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"I have done what needs to be done." Lin Yuan's gaze looked down, towards the martial realm, the sea of light, the dark abyss, and the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time to return to the source."</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared beside Lin Yuan, none other than the Yin and Yang avatars.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the "bell-shaped" origin essence metal also floated in front of him, slowly sinking and floating, emitting an inexplicable aura.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the Yang avatar and Yin avatar began to disintegrate, turning into the purest energy and merging into the origin essence metal. Lin Yuan's true body was the same.</p><p></p><p>If the true body and the two great avatars were too powerful, even if they began to disintegrate, it would be extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>A year later.</p><p></p><p>As the physical body, soul, and inner world turned into the last bit of energy and merged into the origin essence metal, the projection of the Myriad Realms Gate in Lin Yuan's mind suddenly began to radiate light.</p><p></p><p>"Going back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind and will entered the Myriad Realms Gate and disappeared from this world.</p><p></p><p>Please give me some monthly tickets~~~</p><p></p><p>Kisses~~~</p>

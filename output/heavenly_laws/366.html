        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The permanent spatial rift on the alien battlefield numbered B0001 allowed the accumulation speed of the realm-breaking primal energy to increase to one strand every 150 days. </p><p></p><p>But nowâ€”</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan clearly felt that the absorption speed of the realm-breaking primal energy had increased another level, reaching an unprecedented rate of one strand every 90 days. </p><p></p><p>In other words, the main world could accumulate one strand of realm-breaking primal energy every 90 days. One year would yield four strands, ten years forty strands, a hundred years four hundred strands.</p><p></p><p>"I currently possess over two hundred strands of realm-breaking primal energy. If I stay at this large alien battlefield for a period of time, wouldn't it allow my realm-breaking primal energy to easily surpass a thousand strands?" Lin Yuan felt delighted in his heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>The more realm-breaking primal energy, the better for operating the Door of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Perform the tenth realm traversal when my strength hits a bottleneck again," Lin Yuan's consciousness sank into the depths of his mind, gazing at the towering, magnificent Door of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had just entered the tenth rank, and while cultivating the fusion rules guidance path within the black planet, his strength was in its fastest rising period.</p><p></p><p>To traverse realms at this time would be somewhat wasteful.</p><p></p><p>Isn't cultivating the same no matter where? For Lin Yuan, traversing worlds was no different from the main world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue cultivating." Lin Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>To increase the accumulation speed of realm-breaking primal energy, Lin Yuan only needed to remain under the permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>It did not require any mental exertion, so Lin Yuan could completely turn to comprehending the rules and secret methods.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was cultivating enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>"The Paramount Xia Qinzhi is looking for me?" Lin Yuan separated a wisp of his will, connecting to the virtual world and entering the Paramount's personal world.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount." Lin Yuan slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi the Paramount had helped him many times before, and in facing the twelfth rank ultimate existences, maintaining respect was only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan." Xia Qinzhi the Paramount looked at Lin Yuan with a smile and asked, "Have you passed through the Heritage Star's trial and seen the guidance of the fusion rules path?"</p><p></p><p>"The Heritage Star?" Lin Yuan immediately understood that the 'Heritage Star' Xia Qinzhi spoke of referred to the black planet.</p><p></p><p>It was not surprising that Xia Qinzhi knew of the black planet's existence, as the three Goddesses could know about it, so could he.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had uploaded information about the black planet to the Goddess of Wisdom, so he had anticipated this day.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen it already."</p><p>"I'm currently comprehending it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Through the intelligence provided by the Goddess of Wisdom about the black planet, Lin Yuan could easily guess that the human civilization also possessed similar Heritage Stars.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p>"What level of the fusion rules guidance path have you reached?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi asked with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth level boundary," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth level boundary guidance? Incredible!" Xia Qinzhi's expression showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought it would only be the second or third level boundary guidance, which is why the Goddess of Wisdom ultimately gave a merit value of 500 million.</p><p></p><p>But the fourth level? That meant the value of that black planet exceeded 500 million tenfold or a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>"Your fortunes are truly unmatched," Xia Qinzhi couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>Just by happening to come across it, he discovered a Heritage Star worth tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>In the over one hundred years of his nine realm traversals, pioneering the path of martial dao evolution, the total merit points he had obtained was only a few billion.</p><p></p><p>Not even a drop in the bucket compared to the true value of the black planet.</p><p></p><p>This was opportunity - most evolvers were eager to venture out precisely because a single key opportunity could cause their foundations to explosively increase.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no matter how great the opportunity, it was built upon one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>If the one who discovered the black planet was not Lin Yuan, but an ordinary human citizen, they would absolutely be unable to engage in fair trade with the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Yuan, humanity's greatest genius in history, would have the qualifications to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>"How do you plan to handle this Heritage Star?" Xia Qinzhi asked.</p><p></p><p>"Please advise, Paramount," Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"My suggestion is to rent it out," Xia Qinzhi smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth level boundary guidance of the fusion rules would drive those tenth rank evolvers in my human civilization crazy. They would be willing to pay an immense price to enter and comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi said this without any selfish motive, but from Lin Yuan's perspective to maximize his benefits.</p><p></p><p>Of the twelve great doors on the black planet, Lin Yuan could at most enter twelve times.</p><p></p><p>After that? The black planet would not be destroyed, so renting it out to create more benefits was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>"What rent does the Paramount think should be set?" Lin Yuan did not reject renting out the black planet, his main concern was whether the price would satisfy him.</p><p></p><p>"One billion," Xia Qinzhi calmly said.</p><p></p><p>"One billion?" Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"One billion merit points in exchange for one chance to enter and comprehend," Xia Qinzhi explained.</p><p></p><p>"One billion merit points?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He had just been thinking that Xia Qinzhi would likely suggest a rent of tens of millions of merit points. One billion was far beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The 'one billion' mentioned, what unit is it, universal coins or something else? </p><p></p><p>The result is merit points?</p><p></p><p>The merit points of human civilization are one of the most valuable currencies in the cosmic universe, even more valuable than cosmic crystals. They can be used to purchase many restricted resources within human civilization. </p><p></p><p>Just entering for one enlightenment costs an astronomical one billion merit points, which Lin Yuan found rather reluctant to pay.</p><p></p><p>"One billion merit points for one enlightenment is not high," the Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi explained, "You must know that the guidance path within that Inheritance Star reaches up to the fourth level of the realm."</p><p></p><p>"Every evolutionary who enters for enlightenment will integrate the fusion rules up to the fourth level of the realm before leaving."</p><p></p><p>"This occupies a great deal of time, and the final gain is a fourth-level fusion rule? Even at the eleventh level, this is not considered weak."  </p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the black planet has twelve black grand gates in total. Theoretically, it can accommodate up to twelve evolutionary beings enlightening at the same time.</p><p></p><p>One billion merit points per person, for twelve people it would be twelve billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>This enormous amount of merit points could easily elevate an ordinary citizen to the level of a ninth-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is only the 'rent' for the first round.</p><p></p><p>When this batch of evolutionary beings finishes their enlightenment and leaves, the rent for the next batch will come again, won't it?</p><p></p><p>"However, Supreme Lord, I plan to wait until I cross into the eleventh level before renting it out," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Although the rent is tempting, Lin Yuan equally values his own advancement.</p><p></p><p>Other evolutionary beings, even if they possess this black planet, have limited capacity and can at most enlighten one or two at a time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan possesses an extraordinary comprehension ability and can fully comprehend all twelve of these pillar-level fusion rule guidance paths.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Lin Yuan will not allow other evolutionary beings to come for enlightenment. Otherwise, if he wants to comprehend the fusion rule guidance paths they are enlightening, he would have to wait for them to finish.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Supreme Lord Xia Qinzhi said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>What's the big deal?</p><p></p><p>In Xia Qinzhi's view, with Lin Yuan's talent, crossing into the eleventh level would not take too long.</p><p></p><p>And by suggesting that Lin Yuan rent out the black planet, it could enhance the overall strength of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Each additional evolutionary being who reaches the fourth level of fusion rules would contribute to the overall foundation of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan would gain sufficient benefits as well.</p><p></p><p>A win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Xia Qinzhi's personal space, Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world and sat in the Sovereign Palace of the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve billion merit points?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As long as he comprehended the twelve fusion rule guidance paths inside the black planet, he could rent out all twelve enlightenment opportunities of the black planet.</p><p></p><p>At that time, twelve billion merit points would come in.</p><p></p><p>Even without opening the tenth chapter of martial arts, he could steadily advance to become a ninth-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>"However, after crossing into the tenth level for so long, which rare treasure should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, and he became a bit perplexed.</p><p></p><p>The rare treasures referred to the rewards that could be obtained from passing the fifth floor of the nine-floor Black Tower in the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was at the ninth level and comprehended the rules of time, Lin Yuan took out time and passed the fifth floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>After all, passing the fifth floor at the ninth level, the tenth level, and the eleventh level are completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>The rewards for passing the nine-floor Black Tower also depend on the potential of the practitioner.</p><p></p><p>If one could pass the fifth floor at the ninth level, wouldn't their potential be extraordinary?</p><p></p><p>So, in the end, the humanoid stone statue Shen Qi presented Lin Yuan with a reward list that left him hesitating until now.</p><p></p><p>There were five rare treasures on the reward list.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could only choose one out of the five.</p><p></p><p>And according to the main universe standard, these five rare treasures were all twelve-star treasures, corresponding to treasures at the Supreme Lord level.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Spring that Lin Yuan had soaked in before was a twelve-star rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Lin Yuan had been hesitating in making his decision.</p><p></p><p>Since the reward was there, delaying the choice a bit wouldn't make any difference.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it again," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, feeling that he shouldn't be impulsive.</p><p></p><p>He would make the most advantageous choice after cultivating for a while longer and determining his needs.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, in the inner world of his body, Lin Yuan looked down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the edge of this inner world was expanding again.</p><p></p><p>The intuitive size of the inner world had reached 2.33 billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>This was the ultimate size of the inner world that could be achieved after fully absorbing the seven liquids from the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Lin Yuan had completely absorbed that drop of purple liquid.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the inner world has now reached a certain extreme," Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Lin Yuan's consciousness left the inner world and returned to the outside.</p><p></p><p>Then, he gazed solemnly at the gray-purple gourd in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had fully absorbed the seven liquids, what would happen to this mysterious gourd next?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan grasped the gourd with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's physical body touched the gourd, this mysterious gourd seemed to sense Lin Yuan's change.</p><p></p><p>A stream of information came out from within the gourd, exploding in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 308 The Excited Dragon Mountain Viscount (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Demigod"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the bed. On this plane of existence, the strongest at the 7th level were called demigods. </p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the 7th level in the main world, to advance to the 8th level, they needed to open an inner world within their body.</p><p></p><p>But for the 7th level experts in this plane, they had to establish a divine nation in order to transcend to the divine realm.  </p><p></p><p>To establish a divine nation, they relied on immense faith and belief from followers. This was why those demigods risked being discovered by the prime gods as they secretly spread their faiths on the Plateau of Myriad Nations.</p><p></p><p>Without enough faith, they could not become immortal gods, and their physical bodies and souls would quickly decay.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some 7th level demigods chose to serve under a prime god, becoming subordinate deities.  </p><p></p><p>But most 7th level demigods had pride and refused to pay such a price. Once becoming a subordinate deity to a prime god, everything about them, even their consciousness, would belong to the prime god.</p><p></p><p>Many demigods cultivated from weakness to strength through arduous training, so they naturally did not wish to make such a sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now?" Lin Yuan calmly analyzed his situation.</p><p></p><p>Being targeted by a church founded by a demigod was very troublesome.  </p><p></p><p>As for directly reporting it to the empire or the Church of Radiance? That would indeed be useful, but there was no guarantee that the demigod would definitely be killed.</p><p></p><p>If not killed, there was a possibility of retaliation later on, which the Dragon Mountain Ridge could not withstand the slaughter of a demigod-level expert currently.</p><p></p><p>The strongest expert in Dragon Mountain Ridge was only at the 5th level Grand Knight realm - the founding Viscount of Dragon Mountain. A 5th level Grand Knight could dominate the empire, but was still far inferior compared to a 7th level demigod.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go straight back to Dragon Mountain Ridge," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although Anpu City was prosperous, it was a place teeming with all sorts, even attracting a demigod church. Without absolute strength, Lin Yuan did not want to get involved at all.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge was his home turf, officially enfeoffed by the empire. That demigod church, being condemned across the Plateau of Myriad Nations, would not dare appear openly.</p><p></p><p>"Big Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the room, the gentle sunlight shining on him as he called out softly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master." A burly figure over 3 meters tall strode over.</p><p></p><p>"What is it, Young Master?" The rough Big Mountain rumbled, his words carrying a heavy aura.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going back to Dragon Mountain Ridge."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the enormous figure before him. Big Mountain was Lin Yuan's bodyguard. Even in all of Dragon Mountain Ridge, Big Mountain's strength could rank in the top twenty. Dragon bloodline flowed in his veins.</p><p></p><p>Although only at the 3rd level of cultivation, when going all-out and activating his bloodline, he could fight a 4th level Knight for half a time incense.</p><p></p><p>His only flaw was his not-so-bright mind, but for a bodyguard, as long as his combat prowess was sufficient, it was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Back to Dragon Mountain Ridge?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, was it because that little lady last night didn't serve you well?" Big Mountain muttered. "I knew that little lady was no good, skinny as a bamboo stick."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I can introduce you to a few next time. Sturdier ones who can definitely serve you comfortably," Big Mountain immediately said.</p><p></p><p>In his aesthetic view, the more robust a woman was, the better. Ideally over 3 meters tall with a waist over 1 meter wide. Only then could it arouse his desire to conquer.</p><p></p><p>Poor Young Master of Dragon Mountain, always indulging in those bamboo stick figures, not knowing the taste of strong women. Big Mountain felt exceptionally sympathetic towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather asked me to hurry back," Lin Yuan casually gave a reason, not mentioning too much about the vixen woman.</p><p></p><p>Big Mountain's mind wasn't great - he would blab about anything. If that vixen woman was really related to a demigod church, it would alert them instead.</p><p></p><p>For now, Lin Yuan just wanted to quietly return to Dragon Mountain Ridge, then slowly cultivate in stability. Time was on his side.</p><p></p><p>As long as he recovered his full strength, forget some demigod church, even the gods of the Ocean of Light or Abyss of Darkness would pose no fear to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Viscount, ah," Big Mountain's expression also turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>In all of Dragon Mountain Ridge, there weren't many people he respected, but the Viscount of Dragon Mountain was definitely one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go now," Big Mountain said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Such things had happened before. In the past, when Lin Yuan was in the midst of indulging in pleasure, he would suddenly receive orders from Dragon Mountain Ridge and be forced to return midway.</p><p></p><p>Now, using the Viscount of Dragon Mountain's orders as an excuse to leave Anpu City and return to Dragon Mountain Ridge was perfectly normal and reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan led his bodyguards and left Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>The deputy lord of Anpu City even came to see them off personally. "Young Master of Dragon Mountain, leaving in such a hurry, was Anpu City's hospitality lacking?"</p><p></p><p>The balding deputy lord of Anpu City smiled and asked Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Family matters," Lin Yuan didn't explain much, his face full of impatience, very much in line with the usual demeanor of the Young Master of Dragon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's a matter of the Dragon Mountain family, then Young Master of Dragon Mountain, take care. Next time you come, Anpu City will have a special gift prepared for you," the deputy lord said kindly.</p><p></p><p>Although he looked down on the profligate son Lin Yuan, he had to respect the backing of Dragon Mountain Ridge. As the intersection of several marquis territories, Anpu City had to go by the marquis families' attitudes to live comfortably.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan off was not just the deputy lord of Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor of a pavilion, a bewitching woman in black gauze was also watching Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This Lin Yuan, not leaving early or late, but suddenly going back now, all our previous efforts have gone to waste." The alluring vixen woman beside her sighed.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, over the next three months, she would slowly drain Lin Yuan's essence, until the last day when he would die from excessive indulgence.</p><p></p><p>There would be no hidden dangers or suspicions, even the most formidable experts could not find out.</p><p></p><p>Now after one month of effort, with only two months left to succeed, Lin Yuan was going back?</p><p></p><p>After returning, given Lin Yuan's favored status in the Dragon Mountain family, he would undoubtedly consume many fortifying tonics, possibly replenishing the essence he had lost.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, given Lin Yuan's nature, he will soon return to Anpu City," the bewitching woman remained calm.</p><p></p><p>She had not noticed any issues - the excuse Lin Yuan used for leaving was the orders of the Viscount of Dragon Mountain, so they just had bad luck this time.</p><p></p><p>But could they have bad luck the second time, the third time?</p><p></p><p>The bewitching woman believed that the next time Lin Yuan visited Anpu City would be when their plot succeeded.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan died, and they managed to kill off the first and second heirs of Dragon Mountain Ridge...</p><p></p><p>The entire Dragon Mountain Ridge would become the foundation for their demigod master to ascend, even allowing them to radiate influence over the other marquis territories.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had returned, but not much had changed...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After a while, he saw his original parents.</p><p></p><p>"Ayuan, why did you come back so early this time?" Dragon Mountain Fang was a middle-aged man. He glanced at Lin Yuan with some curiosity. </p><p></p><p>Although he no longer had any hopes for this son of his, he was still surprised to see Lin Yuan voluntarily give up the pleasures of Anpu City and return.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't heard that the Dragon Mountain Viscount ordered Dragon Mountain Yuan to return?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Dragon Mountain Yuan came back on his own this time?</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with our son coming back early?" The woman next to him, who looked like a young lady, glared at Dragon Mountain Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Son, what did you want to do this time you came back? Although Dragon Mountain City is not as lively as Anpu City, it's not bad either. If you wander around more, you'll definitely have some surprises."</p><p></p><p>The young lady looked at her son with doting affection.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at his parents without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it depended on the current Viscount's thoughts. For example, when Lin Yuan was born, the Dragon Mountain Viscount had just advanced to the fourth level and was in a great mood, considering it an auspicious sign—</p><p></p><p>The birth of Dragon Mountain Yuan meant the Dragon Mountain family's fourth-level martial force would have an unbroken inheritance.</p><p></p><p>So he bypassed Dragon Mountain Yuan's father and listed Dragon Mountain Yuan as the third in line to inherit.</p><p></p><p>Little did he expect that Dragon Mountain Yuan would turn out to be so disappointing later, indulging in women and pleasure, with no intention of inheriting the Dragon Mountain family's legacy at all.</p><p></p><p>"This time I came back, I want to do something," Lin Yuan said solemnly to his parents.</p><p></p><p>"Something important?" Dragon Mountain Fang fell into thought. "Ayuan, did you set your sights on another woman again?"</p><p></p><p>"Son, don't listen to your father's nonsense. Just say what you want to do. Your mother will always support you," the woman who looked like a young lady said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I want to cultivate," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>As the third in line to inherit the Dragon Mountain family, as long as Lin Yuan was willing to cultivate, all the resources the Dragon Mountain family had accumulated over the years would be devoted to him.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan took the initiative to say so.</p><p></p><p>As for secretly cultivating and then making a surprising debut? That would be too tiring. Just gathering resources would take a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate?" </p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Yuan's parents looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They had anticipated all kinds of unimaginable things Dragon Mountain Yuan might say, but they never expected this.</p><p></p><p>No, the two words "cultivate" were even more unimaginable and inconceivable for Dragon Mountain Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly want to cultivate?" Dragon Mountain Fang stared at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Because I feel that everything happening now is so boring. How long can one indulge in pleasure? A hundred years? Two hundred at most."</p><p></p><p>"And then just wait to die?"</p><p></p><p>"But cultivation is different. As long as I can become a fifth-level Grand Knight, my lifespan will be extended, and my life essence will also undergo a metamorphosis. This is what I want to do."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stated the reasons he had prepared.</p><p></p><p>"Good." </p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Fang pondered for a moment and nodded. "I'll tell the clan leader directly about your desire to cultivate. I hope this isn't just a passing interest."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Fang's mood was quite good.</p><p></p><p>The explanation for Lin Yuan's words was essentially one thing:</p><p></p><p>He was bored of indulging.</p><p></p><p>As for extending his lifespan and so on, who didn't want to live a few more years? The key was that not just anyone could become a fifth-level Grand Knight.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, his son's interest had shifted from his previous indulgence to cultivation, which was a good thing overall.</p><p></p><p>Even if Dragon Mountain Fang didn't have high hopes for Lin Yuan's cultivation achievements, with his body drained by women, it was even a question whether he could become a first-level Knight.</p><p></p><p>But overall, getting stronger and healthier wasn't a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Son, cultivation is a bitter path," the woman who looked like a young lady said with some concern.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I want to try it out," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon.</p><p></p><p>The underground cultivation ground of the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>This place spanned hundreds of miles and was where many members of the Dragon Mountain family cultivated and secluded themselves.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and in front of him sat an old man with white hair.</p><p></p><p>The old man looked somewhat frail, but his aura was restrained, with a hint of a force that could shake mountains hidden within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to cultivate, wanting to become a Knight, is no simple matter," the old man calmly said as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the few fourth-level Knights in the Dragon Mountain family. Ever since the founding Dragon Mountain Viscount established the Dragon Mountain family two thousand years ago, very few fifth-level Grand Knights had been born through the generations.</p><p></p><p>Basically, the highest martial force was the fourth-level Knight. It was only by relying on the final moves left behind by the founding Dragon Mountain Viscount that the Dragon Mountain family had been passed down for so many years.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for a Viscount-level force, a fourth-level martial force was more or less enough to maintain control. As for fifth-level Grand Knights? Those were existences that could only possibly appear during the peak period of a Viscount-level force.</p><p></p><p>"I know," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The old man didn't waste any more words and took out two things.</p><p></p><p>One was a book, and the other was an orange fruit.</p><p></p><p>"This is the main part of the Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method, and this is the Dragon Mountain Fruit, containing a great deal of energy within."</p><p></p><p>"Any descendant of the Dragon Mountain family who wants to cultivate must rely on themselves to enter the Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method."</p><p></p><p>The old man said, "Within one month, as long as you can enter the Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method, it means you have the aptitude to continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"Perceiving the Qi aura is enough," the old man answered.</p><p></p><p>"Perceiving the Qi aura"—the old man was about to explain in detail the specifics of perceiving the Qi aura.</p><p></p><p>Although any descendant of the Dragon Mountain family had to rely on themselves to enter the Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method, Lin Yuan, as the third in line to inherit the family, was definitely different from other family descendants.</p><p></p><p>For example, the old man was about to lecture on the details of how to perceive the Qi aura, which ordinary descendants of the Dragon Mountain family did not have the qualification to listen to.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that many descendants of the Dragon Mountain family didn't even know the concept of Qi aura. At this point, if someone lectured them on the details of perceiving the Qi aura, how crucial would that be?</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the old man could open his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the main text of the Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method, then closed his eyes for an instant before opening them again.</p><p></p><p>"I have already sensed the Qi aura," Lin Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>"..." The old man looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>This generation's Dragon Mountain Viscount massaged his brow. As the highest ruler of Dragon Mountain Ridge, the Dragon Mountain Viscount had too many things to deal with on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>From major dealings with other Viscount territories to minor opinions from the many subjects within his territory and so on.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Ayuan is doing with the lecture?"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Viscount suddenly remembered something. At noon, Dragon Mountain Fang had told him that Dragon Mountain Yuan wanted to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Viscount had immediately arranged for one of the family's fourth-level Knights to go and lecture Dragon Mountain Yuan. Now it should be about time for the lecture to be finished.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>An old man hurried in.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, clan leader!" This old man's face was tinged with astonishment, and he still hadn't calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? I was just about to ask you about it." The Dragon Mountain Viscount's eyes lit up, but when he saw the old man's expression, his heart chilled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Dragon Mountain Yuan really didn't have much aptitude for cultivation and ended up angering the lecturing old man back here?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

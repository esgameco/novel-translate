        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 336: I've Waited Too Long (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Emperor?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was one of surprise. All this time, whether it was the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path he obtained from his teacher, the Crimson Koi Star Lord, or the "Xuanhuang" secret realm itself, it was always referred to as "Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>As for "Xuanhuang Emperor"? </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never considered that direction before.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"It's both 'Emperor' and 'Xuanhuang', so I guess you're referring to the 'Xuanhuang Emperor'," said the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji, nodding.</p><p></p><p>"What is the background of the 'Xuanhuang Emperor'?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the "Xuanhuang Emperor" or the "Xuanhuang Emperor", they were both ultimate-level supreme beings, and the Xuanhuang secret realm left behind by them still had no supreme being who could pinpoint its precise coordinates.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuanhuang Emperor', ah, that was a title for a powerful being that my master occasionally learned about from a certain universal relic. It is said that the Xuanhuang lineage founded by this Xuanhuang Emperor was extremely famous in the distant past, and the Xuanhuang Emperor himself had also traveled very far in the ultimate realm."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji seemed to be lost in memories.</p><p></p><p>"The distant past?" Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, in my master's era, almost no one knew about the 'Xuanhuang Emperor' anymore. My master only learned a few fragmentary words about this 'Xuanhuang Emperor' from some relics."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, for some unknown reason, the 'Xuanhuang Emperor' suddenly disappeared, and the Xuanhuang lineage fell into decline. By the time my master rose to prominence, it had almost completely faded into obscurity," said the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji.</p><p></p><p>He was not a true life form, but more like an artifact spirit, with a vast amount of memories imparted by the master of Magic Jewel Tower, making him quite knowledgeable.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuanhuang Emperor' also mysteriously disappeared?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback. Previously, the master of Magic Jewel Tower had also suddenly vanished, leading to the decline of Magic Jewel Tower, and now the Xuanhuang Emperor had met a similar fate.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the master of Magic Jewel Tower suddenly disappeared?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Why my master disappeared..." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji fell silent for a moment. "Now that you are a core member of Magic Jewel Tower, you have the qualification to know some things."</p><p></p><p>"Before my master disappeared, he told me that he wanted to go to a certain place," the human-shaped stone statue shook his head. "After that, my master just vanished."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji's tone was complex.</p><p></p><p>"Go to a certain place..." Waves rose in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The master of Magic Jewel Tower was most skilled in the spatial dao. The spatial dao was vast and boundless; even at the ninth level of power, one could only comprehend the complete spatial rules, which were merely one aspect of the true spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>To completely transform the spatial rules into one's own spatial dao required the realm of a supreme being. Even among those who cultivated the spatial dao, their paths were not the same, not even similar.</p><p></p><p>It was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>One had to know that when the supreme being Xia Qin wanted to send the Zhen Shen Zhu to Lin Yuan, he had specifically ordered the deputy tower master Na Lan to run away.</p><p></p><p>And that was just within the same universe.</p><p></p><p>Just from this point alone, one could see that Xia Qin, the supreme being, was inferior to the master of Magic Jewel Tower in the spatial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Xuanhuang Emperor also go to this place?" Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure about that," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji shook his head. "My master didn't leave any memories regarding this."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Yuan did not pursue the matter of why the master of Magic Jewel Tower had disappeared. For him now, it was too distant.</p><p></p><p>Even if he knew, what could he do?</p><p></p><p>It was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>He might as well figure out the reason behind the summoning sensation from the core area of the Xuanhuang secret realm instead.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>An extremely subtle spatial fluctuation descended before Lin Yuan, following the Magic Jewel imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Miniature universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze grew slightly heated as he looked at the grayish sphere hovering before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This was a miniature universe completely independent from the main universe, with its own set of temporal rules.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this miniature universe could be refined by Lin Yuan, equivalent to being able to observe the intrinsic operation of its temporal rules from the most fundamental level.</p><p></p><p>Although the main universe also had temporal rules, Lin Yuan could only observe and study them from the outside. However, when faced with this miniature universe, Lin Yuan could enter and study it.</p><p></p><p>The difference was too vast.</p><p></p><p>"I'll refine it now." Lin Yuan immediately began the refining process.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had completely refined this miniature universe.</p><p></p><p>This treasure was specially provided by the master of Magic Jewel Tower for the members of Magic Jewel Tower, so there were no hidden tricks left behind. Lin Yuan refined it with great ease.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of refining the miniature universe, Lin Yuan's spiritual sense delved into it.</p><p></p><p>All the rules formed a stable balance, together supporting the operation of this miniature universe.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a complete universe?" Lin Yuan felt a sense of awe in his heart. Although he had once become a Heavenly Dao-like existence in the Tian Qing World, that world was merely a small realm in the boundless void, incomparable to a miniature universe. Moreover, when Lin Yuan became the Heavenly Dao of Tian Qing World, his strength was still weak, so even if the essence of the Dao was placed before him, he would not have gained much.</p><p></p><p>But now, after refining this miniature universe, the myriad rules were reflected in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although this miniature universe appeared to be only half a meter in size, the space contained within spanned hundreds of light-years. Although its size was far inferior to the main universe, its core essence was similar.</p><p></p><p>"Time..." Lin Yuan was almost entranced, carefully sensing the operation of the temporal rules within the miniature universe.</p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying. By observing the essence of time, your comprehension of the temporal rules rapidly deepens.]</p><p></p><p>After a few hours, Lin Yuan managed to break free from his state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"For me, this miniature universe surpasses all other secret treasures and weapons," Lin Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The miniature universe had almost no offensive or defensive capabilities, but it allowed the various rules to form a balance.</p><p></p><p>This would be of great help in the future transformation of his inner world into an inner universe, completely independent from the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of the inner world into an inner universe was one of the thresholds for becoming a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>The reason supreme beings could exist eternally was because of their inner universes.</p><p></p><p>The inner universe existed independently, with its own river of time, allowing supreme beings to transcend the river of time in the main universe, achieving eternal existence for their physical body, soul, mind, and will.</p><p></p><p>"The master of Magic Jewel Tower..." Lin Yuan grew increasingly respectful of the master.</p><p></p><p>Although this miniature universe was far inferior to the inner universe of a supreme being, it was a perfect replica of an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>It allowed beings below the level of supreme beings to catch a glimpse of the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>"I will continue to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Lin Yuan took out the miniature universe again.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The universe model, he seriously observed and studied it.</p><p></p><p>Time passed. </p><p></p><p>Profound Yellow Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>The Primordial Sun finally arrived at the core area. </p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of spatial vibrations, until finally a figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally arrived."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. From entering the Profound Yellow Secret Realm to reaching the core area, it had taken him nearly thirty years in total.</p><p></p><p>This didn't include the time after Lin Yuan completed his ninth spatial traversal, greatly increasing his strength and speed of travel.</p><p></p><p>To go from the outer area of the Profound Yellow Secret Realm to the core area took over twenty years, and then another twenty years to return to the outer area and await expulsion from the realm. </p><p></p><p>A round trip took fifty years.</p><p></p><p>"The gains from this journey..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the world within his body, where piles of "Profound Yellow Crystals" and many treasured weapons were stored.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan didn't deliberately seek out hostile ninth-rank aliens on this journey, he occasionally encountered them. Whenever that happened, they basically couldn't escape, not even special ninth-ranks.</p><p></p><p>Adding in some fearless native lifeforms he came across, Lin Yuan's gains exceeded eight hundred million universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>"It's only in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm that I have this opportunity," Lin Yuan felt gratitude in his heart.</p><p></p><p>First, the Profound Yellow Secret Realm only allowed ninth-rank lifeforms to enter. If it was the outside world on the alien battlefields, an existence like Lin Yuan would definitely have specialized tenth-rank lifeforms or ninth-ranks wielding eleventh-rank secret treasures specifically watching him.</p><p></p><p>They absolutely would not allow Lin Yuan to kill indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>Second, on the alien battlefields, the powerful alien experts basically wouldn't carry any precious treasures. Although the ninth-rank aliens in the secret realm also didn't carry precious treasures, the opportunities gained within the realm were very real.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the ninth-rank aliens killed by Lin Yuan had done all their previous hard work for Lin Yuan's benefit.</p><p></p><p>"The summoning feeling is getting stronger."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it. After crossing into the core area, the summoning feeling had intensified greatly.</p><p></p><p>Apart from vaguely making out "Profound Sovereign's" intonations, Lin Yuan couldn't discern the rest.</p><p></p><p>"That direction."</p><p></p><p>Based on the summoning feeling, Lin Yuan determined the source location and immediately headed towards it.</p><p></p><p>In the core area of the Profound Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In front of an ancient, mysterious palace.</p><p></p><p>Several figures with restrained auras stood here.</p><p></p><p>"This palace suddenly appeared. It was never here before," said a ninth-rank alien with dark golden scales, his gaze burning.</p><p></p><p>In the core area of the Profound Yellow Secret Realm, every opportunity site contained the most precious treasures, basically surpassing the inner and outer areas. And this palace had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>A palace that had never appeared suddenly manifested, and the special ninth-ranks present all sensed that the palace contained a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"There are no records of this palace in my race's archives," said another special ninth-rank after carefully observing. He continued, "I come from a peak race that has detailed information about the Profound Yellow Secret Realm. Many opportunity sites are recorded, but this palace is the first time it has appeared."</p><p></p><p>"But how do we get inside?" asked a third special ninth-rank.</p><p></p><p>Now it was clear to everyone that this palace held a great opportunity. But no matter how great the opportunity, they had to enter to obtain it. Being blocked outside while watching was worse than never having seen the palace at all.</p><p></p><p>"This palace can completely block our attacks. There's probably no hope of breaking in directly," frowned the dark golden scaled special ninth-rank who spoke first. </p><p></p><p>The first moment he discovered the palace, he tried to force his way in, but it was useless. His full-power strike fell on the palace without any reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be some condition required to enter this palace?" asked another special ninth-rank. Some opportunity sites in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm did set specific conditions.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific conditions were usually quite common, and there would be prompts outside the palace, etc.</p><p></p><p>As the special ninth-ranks continued observing the palace...</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>Faint ripples transmitted from the depths of the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The special ninth-ranks' expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The golden scaled special ninth-rank's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master is coming."</p><p></p><p>Some special ninth-ranks looked grim.</p><p></p><p>Information about the Galactic Star Master had spread among the ninth-rank experts in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm recently, to the point that almost no one was unaware.</p><p></p><p>These special ninth-ranks had naturally heard about him earlier.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Star Master was a monster capable of killing special ninth-ranks.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master is clearly coming for this palace."</p><p></p><p>The special ninth-ranks looked at each other, their expressions hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p>"We can't stay."</p><p></p><p>After a brief internal struggle, the special ninth-ranks quickly left one by one.</p><p></p><p>They craved the opportunity within the mysterious ancient palace, but they feared the Galactic Star Master even more.</p><p></p><p>Even without this mysterious palace, they could still gain substantially in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm. But if they died at the Galactic Star Master's hands because of this palace...</p><p></p><p>Then everything would have been for naught.</p><p></p><p>Especially those special ninth-ranks whose civilizations didn't have a good relationship with humans - they left without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>For the other special ninth-ranks, if they encountered the Galactic Star Master, whether they lived or died would depend on luck. If the Galactic Star Master was in a good mood, they might keep their lives.</p><p></p><p>But if they dared approach the Galactic Star Master, death was basically guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>Outside the mysterious ancient palace,</p><p></p><p>There was no one left.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared soundlessly.</p><p></p><p>"They all ran away?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced in the direction the special ninth-ranks had fled.</p><p></p><p>If it was earlier, he might have had the mind to give chase, because in Lin Yuan's eyes, each special ninth-rank was a moving opportunity site.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>"Is the summoning feeling coming from this palace?" Lin Yuan carefully observed the palace before him.</p><p></p><p>The palace's aura was mysterious and ancient, spanning multiple spatial layers. Its main body was likely located in one of the deeper spatial layers, while the palace visible here was only the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"How to get in?" Lin Yuan didn't act rashly, but continued observing.</p><p></p><p>Based on how those special ninth-ranks had lingered outside the palace earlier, Lin Yuan could tell they were unable to force their way in.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan appeared outside the palace,</p><p></p><p>Deep within the palace, an ancient will began to awaken. It gazed at Lin Yuan standing outside with an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>"I've waited dozens of universal eras, and finally a young one capable of inheriting His Majesty's legacy has arrived."</p>

            <p>Chapter 239 Meeting the Galaxy Master (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master?"</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu thought carefully for a while, and finally shook his head and said, "Never heard of him. 【6】【9】【s】【h】【u】【x】【.】【c】【o】【m】"</p><p></p><p>As the pinnacle race, the human civilization's eighth-stage evolvers with some fame were all known to him, especially the invincible eighth-stage masters like Sun Master and Nine Swords Master, whose names resounded like thunder.</p><p></p><p>But Galaxy Master? </p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu indeed had never heard of him.</p><p></p><p>"Of course you haven't heard of him." The huge fleshy mountain glanced at Aodu, "This Galaxy Master is a newly advanced eighth-stage evolver, and his teacher is Chiron Master."</p><p></p><p>"Chiron Master?"</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu trembled with excitement. </p><p></p><p>Every invincible eighth-stage master grasped a unique cosmic power, especially those with terrifying killing power like Chiron Master.</p><p></p><p>Even if it had never seen him, there's no way it wouldn't know of him.</p><p></p><p>"This Galaxy Master has a big reputation. He entered the eighth stage before a hundred years old, and is the most top genius of this generation in human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The huge fleshy mountain knew a lot of intelligence about human civilization. Actually it wasn't really intelligence, as the name of the Thirteenth Peak Master didn't need any inquiring at all.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth stage under a hundred years old?"</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu looked envious, "Most of those evolvers in human civilization are like ants, but the talent of a very small number really makes me jealous."</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu was a special lifeform. It was already at the fifth stage when reaching adulthood, and entered the sixth stage with just a bit of cultivation. Who knows how many years it took to reach the eighth stage now.</p><p></p><p>But those top human geniuses only used a hundred or a few hundred years to reach the height it was at.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as a special lifeform, the combat power of Blood-colored Octopus Aodu surpassed human evolvers of the same level.</p><p></p><p>But the gap between the two wasn't too big.</p><p></p><p>Below the eighth stage, human evolvers would be crushed by special lifeforms of the same stage.</p><p></p><p>But after the eighth stage, opening up the inner world, the foundation of human evolvers would leap, no longer fearing most special lifeforms of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just reminding you to be a bit more careful recently. Human civilization is not the same as the Shadow Tribe." The huge fleshy mountain said, "It's best to reduce the frequency of devouring life planets. Human civilization still values planets quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'm an eighth stage special lifeform after all, from the Galactic Alliance. Would he, the Galaxy Master, make things difficult for me over just a few planets?" </p><p></p><p>Blood-colored Octopus Aodu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it had already decided to follow the huge fleshy mountain's suggestion and lay low for a while. </p><p></p><p>At least until figuring out the temperament of that Galaxy Master. If he was very tolerant of them like the Shadow Tribe, then the days ahead would be quite comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The huge fleshy mountain shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Alliance was a force formed by all special lifeforms uniting to resist the Human Civilization Alliance and Insect Race Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Special lifeforms were few in number and simply couldn't form massive races like humans and insects. To contend with humans and insects, they could only unite with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Our star region is about to welcome a new master? Named Galaxy Master? In the future, the name of this star region will also be called Galaxy Region?"</p><p></p><p>"This Galaxy Master has a lofty background, being the disciple of Chiron Master, and is also an unparalleled genius of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, hopefully this Galaxy Master can treat us like the Shadow Tribe did. That would be good."</p><p></p><p>"Not sure. The temperament of each Master in human civilization varies. If Galaxy Master is close to us, that would naturally be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"Although Galaxy Master's personality is unclear, he should be quite young and not have much killing intent."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Galaxy Region, one special lifeform race after another, one secluded alien loner after another, were all whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they got along very well with the Shadow Tribe. The Shadow Tribe gave up many benefits in order to stabilize them.</p><p></p><p>Now that this star region had changed hands to a new master from human civilization, these races and loners naturally felt a bit apprehensive, not knowing what awaited them.</p><p></p><p>Those loners and special lifeform races had settled here for a long time. If possible, they naturally didn't want to relocate. </p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why they still hadn't left after the Shadow Tribe withdrew.</p><p></p><p>No matter who the master of this star region was, as long as they weren't targeted, everything would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Chiron's main star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the grand hall and entered the A-grade cosmic spaceship, preparing to head to the Galaxy Region.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you'll be called 'Galaxy'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan set the final destination as "Galaxy Region" and became a hands-off boss.</p><p></p><p>With the intelligence of "Galaxy"'s main control, it could select the optimal route on its own for the entire journey, almost not requiring Lin Yuan to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, departing now, it will take five years to reach the Galaxy Region." A sweet voice resounded in Lin Yuan's ears. It was the main control intelligence of Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>"Five years?"</p><p></p><p>"That works."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If not for Galaxy, taking those standard cosmic spaceships, don't even think about it without twenty years.</p><p></p><p>The performance of Galaxy was not only traversing wormholes and crossing great distances, the cooldown time between two wormhole traversals was also not long.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy turned into a black lightning, instantly arriving at Chiron's main star platform, then driving towards the depths of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Inside Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Five years' time might seem very short to other evolvers, but in Lin Yuan's eyes, it was extremely precious cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>Under the enlightenment of his heaven-defying comprehension, five years was enough for Lin Yuan to greatly improve.</p><p></p><p>One must know, this wasn't the traversing world, but the main world.</p><p></p><p>In the traversing world, although Lin Yuan had a lot of time, he didn't have the many conveniences of the main world.</p><p></p><p>For example, the constantly fluctuating spatial origin in the alien battlefield could provide great benefits for Lin Yuan's comprehension of the spatial core model.</p><p></p><p>There was also that piece of corpse from an ultimate expert of the Magic Jade Tower in the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the traversing world also had the advantages of the traversing world. The two each had their own merits.</p><p></p><p>Inner world.</p><p></p><p>Vast and mighty, close to 300,000 li in radius. </p><p></p><p>When first entering the eighth stage, Lin Yuan's inner world surged to 250,000 li in radius.</p><p></p><p>But after cultivation, as his comprehension of spatial laws continuously improved, the expansion speed of improving the world was also very obvious.</p><p></p><p>Now it had even reached 280,000 li in radius.</p><p></p><p>Southeast corner of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The two eighth stage aliens, Red Skin and Green Eyes, had numb gazes.</p><p></p><p>Ever since they were sent in by Lin Yuan, the shock in their hearts never stopped.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that the Thirteenth Peak Master had just entered the eighth stage?</p><p></p><p>An inner world this big upon just entering the eighth stage?</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Green Eyes looked at each other, only feeling their mouths go dry.</p><p></p><p>Normally speaking, the inner world upon just entering the eighth stage was only a hundred li in radius. </p><p></p><p>Later on, as one continuously cultivated and deepened their comprehension of spatial laws, the inner world would gradually expand.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Lin Yuan's...</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Green Eyes, the two eighth stage aliens, swallowed. One was mid eighth stage and one was late eighth stage. Added together, they weren't even a third the size of Lin Yuan's inner world, and he had just entered the early eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand why the Master said those words when he had us follow the Peak Master back then."</p><p></p><p>Red Skin was silent for a while before saying dryly.</p><p></p><p>Chiron Master had</p><p></p><p>The Star Lord's words roughly meant that they should follow Lin Yuan's orders.</p><p></p><p>There was no mention of protecting Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Red Skin and Green Eyes found it a bit strange. As an early Eighth Stage, Lin Yuan was sent to guard the border star regions. Wasn't their mission to ensure Lin Yuan's safety?</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that the newly advanced Eighth Stage Thirteenth Peak Master did not need their protection at all.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the scope of his inner world, Lin Yuan's strength was enough to easily crush the two of them.</p><p></p><p>The two Eighth Stage alien races pondered in their hearts. Their mission following Lin Yuan should be to help deal with trivial matters, so as not to waste Lin Yuan's precious time on them.</p><p></p><p>"Abnormal, too abnormal."</p><p></p><p>"How can there be such an abnormal person in human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>Red Skin couldn't help but say. Just entering the Eighth Stage, yet comparable to the peak of Eighth Stage. Even those rare special lifeforms were far from being able to do this.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is the reason why human civilization can become the apex race group?"</p><p></p><p>Green Eyes murmured in a low voice beside him.</p><p></p><p>The history of human civilization was actually not long, only a little over two million years. But in such a short time, human civilization had leaped to become the apex race group dominating the starry sky, because it had given birth to one genius after another.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses here were not only geniuses in evolution, but in all other fields as well.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Five years went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the Galaxy Star Region, a black cosmic battleship shuttled out of the wormhole.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we have arrived at the Galaxy Star Region."</p><p></p><p>Inside the battleship, Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, and the sweet voice of the Galaxy's main control intelligence rang in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Finally here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked out at the starry sky through the spaceship.</p><p></p><p>He saw a galaxy-like silver river "hanging" under the starry sky, extremely gorgeous and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a little emotional. These five years had allowed him to make great progress in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>First was the insight into the core space model. Now, in terms of insight into the core space model, Lin Yuan had already comprehended 2,092 types.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that there were only a total of 7,782 types of core space models. Comprehending 2,000 types was equivalent to completing one-fourth of them.</p><p></p><p>Even the Vermilion Roc Star Lord had not completely comprehended all the core space models.</p><p></p><p>Once all the core space models were comprehended, it was equivalent to mastering the complete laws of space, and one could go anywhere in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was the opening of the Eighth Stage chapter of the Martial Dao Evolution Path. If the opening of the Eighth Stage chapter was divided into ten stages.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan had almost completed the second stage. It should be known that the Eighth Stage chapter of any evolution path was crucial, and it was related to whether one could become an Evolution Scholar.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Stage chapter of the Martial Dao Evolution Path was even more difficult. In just five years, he had reached the second stage. If those Evolution Scholars heard about it, they would probably fall into depression.</p><p></p><p>Even for Evolution Scholars, starting from scratch and creating an Eighth Stage evolution path was not an easy task. It required a lot of time and energy, and in the end, it might not necessarily be recognized by the three goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"I have already comprehended more than 11,000 evolution paths. How come I'm still an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Building?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the past five years, Lin Yuan would comprehend that torso every period of time. After the Eighth Stage, his realm greatly increased. Even though he still needed to endure the pressure of mental will, his comprehension speed definitely got a huge boost.</p><p></p><p>In just five years, Lin Yuan comprehended another 7,000 evolution paths, and this was because Lin Yuan only spent part of his time comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would be even more.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"Just keep comprehending."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's an ordinary member or a core member, the important thing is to improve my own strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart. Constantly comprehending new evolution paths, then analyzing them and taking their essence, that was the main purpose.</p><p></p><p>"I have accumulated 15 strands of Realm-Breaking Source Power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the "Realm-Breaking Source Power" inside the majestic Myriad Realms Gate deep in his mind, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, naturally the more Realm-Breaking Source Power the better. This not only meant more opportunities for shuttling.</p><p></p><p>It was also the strongest life-saving ability.</p><p></p><p>Because—</p><p></p><p>Consuming 50 strands of Realm-Breaking Source Power could allow for physical body shuttling.</p><p></p><p>This kind of shuttling had both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p></p><p>The disadvantage was that if you died in the shuttling world, you might really die.</p><p></p><p>The advantage was that all the improvements in the shuttling world could be synchronized on the physical body.</p><p></p><p>And when avoiding pursuit from the main world, one could avoid it through physical body shuttling.</p><p></p><p>The shuttling worlds selected by the Myriad Realms Gate were not in the same latitude and dimension as the main world.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan hid in there, even the strongest experts could only watch helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Directly to the main star."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan ordered the "Galaxy".</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy once again turned into a black lightning bolt and disappeared into the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>This was a high-level living planet.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan was appointed as the Galaxy Star Lord and confirmed this planet as the main star of the Galaxy Star Region.</p><p></p><p>Human official evolutionists from nearby star regions had arrived in advance to carry out B-level transformation on this living planet.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also a human evolutionist army stationed here. This evolutionist army was specially left behind by human civilization after taking over this star region, serving as the left and right arms of the new Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord should be arriving soon. Everyone, be alert." Above the Galaxy Main Star, a man in an exquisite purple robe spoke.</p><p></p><p>Beside him stood a blond man. Behind the two of them were densely packed evolutionist armies.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionist armies were basically composed of Fifth Stage evolutionists, commanded by hundreds of Sixth Stage evolutionists, with the two Seventh Stage evolutionists in purple robes and the blond man serving as the commanders.</p><p></p><p>"Our Star Lord is really rich. He directly carried out B-level transformation on the main star." The blond man said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, newly advanced Eighth Stage evolutionists were relatively poor. When they went to star regions to take up the position of Star Lord, they all chose the free C-level transformation.</p><p></p><p>B-level transformation required 100,000 cosmic crystals, basically equivalent to the entire assets of a senior Eighth Stage evolutionist, including all assets such as weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord is an unparalleled genius. He entered the Eighth Stage at the age of a hundred. His teacher is even the Vermilion Roc Star Lord. Just the gifts received at the Eighth Stage celebration ceremony probably exceeded 100,000 cosmic crystals. How can ordinary Eighth Stage Star Lords compare?" The purple-robed man glanced at the blond man and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed." The blond man nodded, his expression showing amazement.</p><p></p><p>When he first heard that the Galaxy Star Lord was the Thirteenth Peak Master of the Vermilion Roc Star Region, he was also shocked for a long time. This was an unparalleled genius of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord is here."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed man seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed slightly and he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>Only to see space beginning to ripple faintly, and a streamlined black cosmic battleship appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed man and the blond man bowed together.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Behind them, a large number of evolutionist armies knelt down in unison and respectfully shouted in unison, "Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord."</p>

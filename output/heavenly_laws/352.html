        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 352: Lin Yuan's Strange Encounter (5000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm opens once every 200,000 years. </p><p></p><p>Each opening lasts for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm right when it opened. </p><p></p><p>Instead, in order to avoid the peak time when other powerful beings entered the secret realm, he deliberately waited three to four decades before sending his sun spirit avatar in.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan had just entered the ninth stage. Although he relied on dozens of universal forces to stabilize himself at the ninth stage level, compared to other peak ninth stage beings in the universe, there was still a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Lin Yuan's purpose for entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was not for treasures or opportunities, but to find the source of the calling sensation he felt. </p><p></p><p>So he intentionally avoided the "peak" time for entering the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang Secret Realm has witnessed my growth in the ninth stage," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When the Xuanhuang Secret Realm first opened, Lin Yuan was only at the myriad levels of the ninth stage, not even the lower levels, so his strength was not that formidable. </p><p></p><p>But now, as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was about to close, Lin Yuan had redefined the caliber of the ninth stage in front of the myriad races of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Originally, ninth stage beings could be this powerful?</p><p></p><p>Originally, ordinary ninth stage beings could trample on those unique, special ninth stage beings?</p><p></p><p>"Over these twenty years, my comprehension of the rules of time is already very close to a complete understanding," Lin Yuan noticed as he shifted his attention away from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the supreme expert Xia Qin guided him in breaking away from the river of time and briefly reaching the "shore", Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules of time had made tremendous progress over the past twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Specifically, based on the 2,173 known models of the rules of time in human civilization, Lin Yuan had constructed 1,953 completely new models of the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to nearly 10,000 models of the rules of space that only need to be fully comprehended to understand the rules of space, even if all the models of the rules of time summarized by human civilization were comprehended, it would still be a long way from fully understanding the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>At least based on the current vastness of life in the universe, the difficulty of comprehending the rules of time far exceeds that of the rules of space.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the threshold for the rules of space is lower, but the true upper limit is not much weaker than the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>Even supreme experts have deeply cultivated the vast realm of space, such as one of the nine supreme experts of human civilization, the Virtual God Supreme Expert, and the master of the Magic Jade Pavilion, who are both extremely skilled in the rules of space.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for supreme experts, the rules of space are no longer rules, but the great dao itself - the Dao of Space.</p><p></p><p>"The 1,953 brand new models of the rules of time that I constructed are only applicable to my own understanding of the rules of time, and cannot be popularized like the previous 2,173 models of the rules of time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The great scholars of the time domain in human civilization are almost all at the eleventh stage level, and they have basically already comprehended the rules of time long ago.</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>Rather, those 2,173 models of the rules of time allow the vast majority of cultivators to understand them in the easiest way possible.</p><p></p><p>As for the more profound models of the rules of time, they do exist, but firstly the level of comprehension required is very high, and secondly they may not be applicable to every cultivator, so they have not been publicly released.</p><p></p><p>For example, the 1,953 new models of the rules of time that Lin Yuan constructed contain his most fundamental understanding of the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>For other cultivators to comprehend them would be like browsing a heavenly book - it would be more practical for them to simply experience the fluctuations of time.</p><p></p><p>"I have a premonition that when I construct the 2,050th new model of the rules of time, that will be the moment I comprehend the rules of time completely."</p><p></p><p>In other words, for Lin Yuan to fully comprehend the rules of time, he only needs to construct less than a hundred new models of the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>It would take as little as three to four years, or as long as seven to eight years.</p><p></p><p>Not much different from his original goal of comprehending the rules of time within thirty years.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>A hazy, profound yellow glow pervaded the heavens and earth, covering the core area and inner area of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Any foreign lifeforms in this area would be annihilated by the power of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>In an inconspicuous valley in the inner area, a being with its aura restrained stood there, having opened up nearly 30 million layers of special space at the ninth stage level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the profound yellow glow emanating from the depths of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was about to envelop the valley where he stood.</p><p></p><p>"With my strength, as long as I forcefully break through the human civilization's blockade line right before the secret realm closes, I have at least a 30% chance of successfully leaving the secret realm," the special ninth stage being thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The ninth stage cultivators of human civilization maintaining the blockade line from the inner area to the outer area were already straining tremendously.</p><p></p><p>Plus, as a special ninth stage being, he had the confidence to sweep aside the vast majority of ninth stage beings.</p><p></p><p>If not for the concern of a Galactic Sovereign possibly appearing at any moment, this special ninth stage being felt his chances of leaving the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would exceed 90%.</p><p></p><p>But even so, a 30% chance was not low.</p><p></p><p>However, the apex alliances of races like the Insect Race and Feather Winged Race did not allow him to do so.</p><p></p><p>Having a 30% chance to leave the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was equivalent to a 70% chance of dying at the hands of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If he died, the many treasures and weapons he carried would fall into the hands of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if even he, a special ninth stage being, only had a 30% chance of leaving, then ordinary ninth stage beings of other races probably didn't even have a 10% chance.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if a portion managed to escape, the vast majority of ninth stage beings from other races would still die at the hands of the cultivators of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In the view of the apex alliances like the Insect Race and Feather Winged Race, while their side had recovered some losses and some powerful beings had preserved their avatar bodies, human civilization's gains would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, they might as well go all out.</p><p></p><p>They would rather bear the losses themselves than allow human civilization to gain any benefit.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign, it's all because of the Galactic Sovereign!" This special ninth stage being thought of that majestic figure and couldn't help but tremble inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the absolute might of the Galactic Sovereign suppressing them, how could so many ninth stage beings allied together be forced into such a predicament by mere ninth stage cultivators of a single human civilization?</p><p></p><p>"However, I've hidden all my weapons, treasures and opportunities in a secret corner of the secret realm, hoping they'll still be there the next time it opens."</p><p></p><p>The special ninth stage being thought to himself. Without weapons and treasures, his combat strength would drop significantly. If he tried to forcefully break through the human civilization's blockade line, his chances of leaving would be negligible.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm suppressed space too extremely, crippling most of the special ninth stage beings' skills at teleportation and instant transmission.</p><p></p><p>And to be expelled into the outer area, the surrounding space had to be stable.</p><p></p><p>As for hiding the treasures and weapons in the inner area while he himself tried to force through the human civilization's blockade line...the corpses of ninth stage beings were also precious resources, especially those of special beings whose value was calculated in myriad universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>After another half a year...</p><p></p><p>In the outer area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and others like Duo Ke, ninth stage cultivators of human civilization, were successfully expelled outwards in the final moment before the secret realm closed.</p><p></p><p>Shua.</p><p></p><p>Other ninth stage cultivators of human civilization also appeared one after another nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, I'll take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>"If not for the Galactic Sovereign this time in the secret realm, how could our human civilization have suppressed those other races?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha, that was so satisfying!"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the ninth stage cultivators of human civilization bid Lin Yuan farewell before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also merged into the depths of space, flying towards the direction of the Galactic Capital Star.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a strand of Lin Yuan's consciousness followed the Xuanhuang imprint, descending once more into the deepest depths of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, even if his physical body did not enter, he could separate a strand of his consciousness avatar to descend by relying on the power of the imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure stood respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>He had naturally left the task of using the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to annihilate those ninth stage beings of other races in the core area of the inner area to the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was familiar with such matters, having done it countless times before.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are no longer any outsiders in the secret realm now," the six-armed figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>No outsiders - in other words, those who did not...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The nine-level alien races that had entered the outer region but were expelled from the main universe all died.</p><p></p><p>New69book.com</p><p></p><p>"These are the corpses of those outsiders."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the six-armed figure's hand, over eight thousand corpses appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The annihilation power of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had two types: one was complete annihilation, under which the physical body and soul were completely extinguished. </p><p></p><p>The other was soul annihilation, which only erased the soul while preserving the physical body.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the six-armed figure would choose complete annihilation, since the physical bodies of the outsiders were of no use to him.</p><p></p><p>But this time, following Lin Yuan's instructions, the six-armed figure chose soul annihilation. </p><p></p><p>The physical bodies of nine-level lifeforms, after being tempered countless times, contained flesh, blood and bones that could be considered rare treasures of the nine-star universe.</p><p></p><p>And these were just ordinary nine-level lifeforms, the value would be ten or a hundred times greater for those special nine-level beings.</p><p></p><p>"These physical bodies cannot be exposed, I'll just use them as resources to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had no psychological burden about devouring these bodies, they were just alien races in the cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>Human civilizations often hunted those special lifeforms and made delicacies out of them, which were highly sought after.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Xuanhuang Body required the consumption of vast external resources, not limited to just Xuanhuang crystals, any object containing energy could be devoured and absorbed by the Xuanhuang Body.</p><p></p><p>"And there are also secret treasures and weapons," the six-armed figure waved his hand again, revealing over ten thousand secret treasures and weapons.</p><p></p><p>Although the nine-level alien races that entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would not carry extremely valuable weapons or treasures, to maintain their combat strength they would definitely bring one or two decent weapons.</p><p></p><p>A single weapon or treasure was not much, but adding up the secret treasures and weapons of over eight thousand nine-level alien races amounted to nearly twenty thousand nine-level secret treasures and weapons.</p><p></p><p>Their immense value left Lin Yuan feeling amazed.</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that both my true self and Yuanshen can cultivate the Xuanhuang Body, otherwise it would take ages to take out all these weapons and treasures," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just like the corpses of the nine-level aliens, the nearly twenty thousand weapons and treasures before Lin Yuan could not be taken out, because each weapon and treasure had its own unique characteristics, and taking them out risked exposing Lin Yuan's identity as the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Besides using them to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body, Lin Yuan had another way to utilize these bodies, weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>That was to use his mastery of the "Primordial Force" to constantly revert them to their most fundamental source of power.</p><p></p><p>In the previous few traversals, in order to maximize the use of the physical bodies from the traversed worlds, Lin Yuan had basically used the "Primordial Force" to fuse all the power of the physical bodies into his origin bell.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan felt that this method probably did not need to be used.</p><p></p><p>The resources required for cultivating the Xuanhuang Body were too terrifying, and Lin Yuan was cultivating three Xuanhuang Bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, there are the Xuanhuang crystals and some fortuitous treasures within the secret realm," the six-armed figure waved his hand one last time, revealing even more items before them.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad," Lin Yuan felt delighted in his heart. The harvest from this Xuanhuang Secret Realm was truly immense.</p><p></p><p>In a vast cosmic space, Lin Yuan's figure appeared, then took a step forward. Space rippled as his figure emerged thousands of light-years away.</p><p></p><p>This was just an ordinary return, Lin Yuan only used a translocation method, as for the "Nine Steps of Space-Time"? He would not consider using it unless it was for something important.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang crystals and various secret treasures and weapons I brought back this time should be enough for my true self and Tai Yin Yuanshen to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body for a while," Lin Yuan planned as he hurried along.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Body was a life-protecting defensive secret technique, so he definitely had to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Even his Yuanshen clone had to cultivate it, after all Lin Yuan had invested a lot into his Yuanshen clones.</p><p></p><p>If possible, Lin Yuan did not want his two major Yuanshens to be too weak either.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan kept taking one step after another. In the world within his Tai Yin Yuanshen body, without the World Tree's suppression, the normal travel speed was a bit slower.</p><p></p><p>But compared to other nine-level evolved beings, it was still many times faster, occupying that many layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>After another translocation of thousands of light-years, Lin Yuan's gaze swept across the desolate cosmic space before him. As he was about to continue on his way, he discovered a black planet.</p><p></p><p>In the vast cosmic space, the majority of star domains were barren and desolate, planets were extremely rare, and habitable life planets were even rarer.</p><p></p><p>This black planet looked extremely ordinary, it should have been one of those worthless dead planets. That's what Lin Yuan thought at first, but after a glance, he found he could not see through this black planet.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, even peering through layer after layer of space, only to find that this black planet was actually affecting the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Affecting the layers of space? What secret does this black planet hold?" Lin Yuan did not approach immediately, instead keeping his distance to continue observing.</p><p></p><p>"It can block my perception, if I hadn't happened to pass near this black planet, if I was just a bit further away, I would not have noticed it at all," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had discovered the special nature of this black planet. Although he did not know its origins, being able to obstruct his probing meant it was no ordinary object.</p><p></p><p>"Just a single traversal, and I encounter this black planet, is this a fortuitous encounter?" Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>Evolved beings of the human civilization, once they reached the sixth level, all liked to explore more and wider star domains, with the goal of these so-called fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Even evolved beings below the sixth level liked to roam around in cosmic spaceships.</p><p></p><p>"Let me probe it first," Lin Yuan carefully observed for a moment, then suddenly struck out, sending a palm strike towards the distant black planet.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power descended upon that black planet through layer after layer of space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan held back considerably with this palm strike, but it could still easily destroy a high-level life planet. Yet when it landed on that black planet, it was as if falling into a quagmire, having no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the frontier region of the human civilization, the Xiagou Evolution Spire stood tall and serene.</p><p></p><p>As one of the nine major evolution spires of the human civilization, the Xiagou Evolution Spire symbolized the peak experts of the Xiaqin race, stationed at the frontier to awe the two neighboring apex clans bordering the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Within the cultivation world inside the Evolution Spire.</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"Never thought that as a peak tenth level, listed among the top hundred Alpha-level threats to alien races, I would actually be inferior to the Galaxy Sovereign in the comprehension of the laws of time."</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan felt displeased in his heart. How great was the Galaxy Sovereign? And how great was he himself?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Galaxy Sovereign's comprehension of the laws of time did not just slightly surpass his, but far exceeded his own.</p><p></p><p>The time prison casually deployed by the Galaxy Sovereign was something he could not break out of. Admittedly, that was because he did not use his full power, but the Galaxy Sovereign was only at the ninth level!</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan understood that he had lost.</p><p></p><p>"All this time, I've been the one chasing and surpassing my seniors, but this time I've been surpassed by my junior. The feeling is quite peculiar," Vice Spire Master Nalan did not harbor any resentment towards the Galaxy Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Sovereign surpassing him in the comprehension of the laws of time was simply because he himself was too weak.</p><p></p><p>As Vice Spire Master Nalan sat cross-legged in meditation, his state of mind began to subtly change.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ebb and flow of his thoughts, a certain bottleneck that had been tightly constraining Vice Spire Master Nalan started to rapidly crumble and dissolve.</p><p></p><p>"Me...?"</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan's aura began to change, subtly metamorphosing towards a higher realm.  </p><p></p><p>"I've comprehended the key fusion laws...?"</p><p></p><p>"I can break through to the eleventh level...?"</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan was stunned, hardly daring to believe it.</p><p></p><p>For a tenth-level evolved being to attempt breaking through to the eleventh level, the main requirement was comprehending the appropriate fusion laws.</p><p></p><p>Vice Spire Master Nalan had been stuck on this for a long time. He had entered realms beyond the world countless times, experiencing hundreds of millions or even billions of years, yet still could not cross this barrier.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, this time due to the provocation from the Galaxy Sovereign, which caused Vice Spire Master Nalan to thoroughly re-examine himself and discard his past arrogance, he actually broke through this bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign..." Vice Spire Master Nalan's expression was complex.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the Galaxy Sovereign was still his benefactor.</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 427 Return (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"This time I've come, besides congratulating you on crossing into the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>"There's also one other matter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the evil gods below and the sweat-drenched Child of the Void. With a slight shift of his thoughts, the surrounding space-time immediately returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>For the current Lin Yuan, whether the Child of the Void had crossed into the tenth stage or not made little difference - either way, he was far from being Lin Yuan's match.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan had just comprehended the sixth level of space-time, his combat prowess had already surpassed that of tenth stage evil gods, not to mention after a hundred years of bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, the Child of the Void was already far from being Lin Yuan's match. A hundred years later, the gap between them would only grow wider. Even if the Child of the Void luckily crossed into the tenth stage, it was far from enough to make up the difference.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the gap was unbridgeable, but the Child of the Void might not see it that way.</p><p></p><p>So when Lin Yuan appeared, he directly exuded his powerful pressure, making the Child of the Void recognize his own position.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed the effect was quite good.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor, please speak," the Child of the Void immediately said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Free from the suppression of the spacetime stillness, the Child of the Void felt much more relaxed, but his heart felt like he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the tenth stage, the Child of the Void had thought he would gain a corresponding status. But now it seemed there was no difference from before he broke through.</p><p></p><p>"You and the other evil gods will swear an oath that for the next hundred billion years, you are not allowed to take the initiative to attack any martial cultivator," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>With his return imminent, Lin Yuan naturally wanted to eliminate the last hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>That was to prevent these foreign evil gods from having any other ideas after he left.</p><p></p><p>Although the Primordial Demonic Tree could still seek Lin Yuan's help, it would still waste dimensional origin power.</p><p></p><p>This descent had not only resolved the crisis in the Azure World and greatly spread martial arts, but also brought tremendous improvement to his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It could be said the gains were full and satisfying.</p><p></p><p>But the next descent would not be able to bring such gains.</p><p></p><p>In order to reduce the possibility of any accidents occurring as much as possible, Lin Yuan naturally had to make preparations by having all the evil gods swear the corresponding oath.</p><p></p><p>The so-called oath was a term from the Spiritual Realm, and in the Boundless Void it was called a heart oath. By swearing it, one would resonate with the rules of the Great Dao, thereby achieving the purpose of constraining oneself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had these foreign evil gods swear the oath instead of directly killing them to eliminate future troubles. This was in order to give martial cultivators sufficient pressure.</p><p></p><p>With pressure comes motivation, allowing martial arts to develop more vigorously.</p><p></p><p>As for why the constraint was for a hundred billion years - if after a hundred billion years, martial arts still could not produce a single cultivator on par with a ninth stage evil god, then Lin Yuan really should reflect on whether there was a problem with the martial arts system he created.</p><p></p><p>After a hundred billion years, even with the six-hundred-fold difference in the flow of space-time between the Boundless Void and the main universe, several million years would have passed in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not successfully assaulted the ultimate by then, he would likely have failed and his path would be extinguished upon death.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the outcome of the martial cultivation system would no longer be something Lin Yuan could be concerned about.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the Child of the Void nodded without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The other perfected evil god sovereigns below also showed no reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding? Even without the constraining oath, with the Martial Ancestor Lin Yuan watching over them, these evil gods would not dare lay a hand on any martial cultivator no matter how daring they were.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the evil gods swore their oaths before Lin Yuan, triggering a resonance in the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>After giving the many evil gods one last look, Lin Yuan's form disappeared without a sound.</p><p></p><p>A long time after Lin Yuan left, the Child of the Void finally dared to straighten his back and look around.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor has left?"</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void let out a huge sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Just what level of power does the Martial Ancestor possess?" The Child of the Void gulped.</p><p></p><p>Before he broke through to the tenth stage, facing the Martial Ancestor required enduring tremendous pressure.</p><p></p><p>But now that he had broken through to the tenth stage, facing the Martial Ancestor brought even greater pressure than before his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...the eleventh stage? The twelfth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void quickly thought to himself. He could only speculate in this direction, because the power Lin Yuan displayed seemed like divine punishment compared to a normal tenth stage existence.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the Child of the Void crossed into the tenth stage himself, but the information left behind by the secret realm's founder also contained descriptions of the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the tenth stage, the Child of the Void felt he matched the founder's descriptions quite well. But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void could not understand.</p><p></p><p>"The great Child of the Void."</p><p></p><p>Just as the Child of the Void's thoughts were in disarray, one of the perfected evil god sovereigns below could not help but speak up tentatively.</p><p></p><p>This time they had come to congratulate the Child of the Void on crossing into the tenth stage, allowing them to hold their heads high before that Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"You all can withdraw."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void felt indifferent, feeling it might have been better if he had not broken through to the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through, the Child of the Void at least still had some aspirations in his heart. But now...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Taking the Martial Ancestor as the goal to pursue for themselves. </p><p></p><p>But after breaking through the tenth stage, when they went to sense the Martial Ancestor again, they realized they had no hope of catching up.</p><p></p><p>Hope turned into despair.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not pleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The many perfected demon lords looked at each other, and immediately respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The shock they felt in their hearts was also great. The Martial Ancestor's strength simply shattered the cognition of the boundless void from ancient times to the present.</p><p></p><p>Is there really such a powerful life in this world?</p><p></p><p>"Wait." </p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void seemed to think of something and spoke: "The words the Martial Ancestor just said must be followed, and cannot be violated."</p><p></p><p>The dao oath can only bind, but cannot prohibit. If a certain perfected demon lord goes crazy and does whatever they want, even the dao oath cannot restrain them.</p><p></p><p>So the Son of the Void was again warning the many perfected demon lords that they cannot violate the Martial Ancestor's orders at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Great Son of the Void, we're not fools."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the perfected demon lords immediately promised. The Martial Ancestor's strength exceeded their imagination and cognition. Even if the Son of the Void didn't say it, no one would dare violate it.</p><p></p><p>"With these demon lords here, martial dao will at least have a hundred billion years of development time."</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, Lin Yuan's figure appeared, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>The boundless void would constantly give birth to new demons. The demons born later would not have experienced Lin Yuan's strength, and might possibly act against the living beings in the world.</p><p></p><p>But now, those perfected demon lords, as well as the tenth stage Son of the Void, had witnessed Lin Yuan's methods.</p><p></p><p>With them restraining the newly born demons in the future, the situation in the boundless void would remain stable.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan did not slaughter all those powerful demon lords.</p><p></p><p>These demon lords' fear of Lin Yuan would be more intimidating than the dao oath.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao immediately came to pay respects.</p><p></p><p>For a hundred years, Lin Yuan's true self had been in secluded cultivation, but his two spirit souls had often appeared, transporting many martial cultivators to other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, going to more worlds will depend on you yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke. After six hundred years of cultivation, the strongest batch of martial cultivators in the Azure World had reached the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of Lin Yuan's two spirit souls taking out some time to personally guide them.</p><p></p><p>This batch of seventh stage martial cultivators was "fast-tracked" by Lin Yuan through some method, with basically no possibility of further advancement.</p><p></p><p>And the purpose of forcibly cultivating this batch of seventh stage martial cultivators was for the spread of martial dao after he left.</p><p></p><p>The seventh stage of martial dao was already able to roam the void, fully capable of finding new worlds on their own to spread the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to Lin Yuan's two spirit souls escorting them, the future development of spreading martial dao would be much slower, but the advantage was more time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao nodded, then carefully asked: "Does the Martial Ancestor have something to do?"</p><p></p><p>Although from start to finish, Lin Yuan's tone was very calm, the High Priest Qing Yao still heard other implications.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will enter secluded meditation, perhaps for a very long time without emerging." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The so-called secluded meditation meant returning to the main universe. If there were no accidents, the next time Lin Yuan descended into the boundless void would be after a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>And it was uncertain whether there would even be such a day.</p><p></p><p>If martial dao could maintain its development without any crisis of broken lineage, Lin Yuan might never descend again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor." The High Priest Qing Yao was about to say something.</p><p></p><p>But he found that the Martial Ancestor had already disappeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long the Martial Ancestor will be in secluded meditation this time."</p><p></p><p>As the source world of martial dao, the Azure World now had to deal with too many matters every day with the rapid spread of martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually lay there, allowing the void tides to rise and fall, carrying him to other regions.</p><p></p><p>He also spent the last year in cultivation and enlightenment. Although his comprehension of the rules of the boundless void had reached the limit, forcibly comprehending would not be without gain, just at a much lower efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a year went by.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was inside the Primordial Demonic Tree in the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual will returned, so this Martial Ancestor's body naturally could not be casually discarded, and was placed in the safest place.</p><p></p><p>To be used when he descended next time.</p><p></p><p>And this safest place,</p><p></p><p>was naturally inside this Primordial Demonic Tree in the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Primordial Demonic Tree was not strong, incomparable to a ninth stage demon lord.</p><p></p><p>But the Primordial Demonic Tree was the "dao mark" Lin Yuan left in the boundless void, able to contact his true self in the main universe at any time, and summon his descent.</p><p></p><p>This was the most powerful aspect of the Primordial Demonic Tree.</p><p></p><p>"The residence time has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his mind, that towering and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms suddenly radiated a brilliant light.</p>

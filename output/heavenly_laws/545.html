        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quietly sensed the terrifying waves surging like a tide.</p><p></p><p>The grudge between two Chaos Saints caused this universe to enter the Great Destruction prematurely. </p><p></p><p>If not for Lin Yuan, perhaps only one in a million human civilization citizens would have survived.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was far more than just Lin Yuan's universe. As the Nine Phoenix Saint and Shadow Demon Saint battled their way here, countless universes had entered premature Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>For the living beings within the universe, including 12th level Ultimates, this was absolutely a catastrophe! A catastrophe that could not be stopped, and could only be endured! This was the power of Chaos Saints, the absolute peak existences of the Chaos Void. Even their casual actions could cause the fates of countless lives to change.</p><p></p><p>"Get ready."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately contacted the Xuanyuan Ultimate and the other eight Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh! Nine figures appeared in succession. Over 200 years ago, human civilization had basically completed its migration, and the nine Ultimates had been waiting for the catastrophe to descend at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, you're telling us to prepare?"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Ultimate looked at Lin Yuan and asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Their comprehension of space-time fusion laws was still at the 6th level boundary. Lin Yuan could vaguely sense the terrifying energy waves approaching like a tide, but the nine human civilization Ultimates could not perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>These words filled the nine Ultimates with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>Although they had long heard from Lin Yuan that their home universe would be affected by the battle between two Chaos Saints, causing premature Great Destruction, even Lin Yuan couldn't be certain about this. After all, the trajectory of the two Chaos Saints' battle could only be roughly predicted, not 100% guaranteed. What if the two Saints suddenly changed direction as they fought?</p><p></p><p>So the nine Ultimates had always harbored a glimmer of hope, as this was their home universe and they had deep feelings for it.</p><p></p><p>But now Lin Yuan was actively telling them to prepare, meaning the aftershocks had already arrived, equivalent to the Great Destruction becoming inevitable.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p></p><p>Two extremely terrifying auras rapidly approached the home universe. Not only could Lin Yuan sense it, but 12th level powerhouses within the universe could also perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"Is the universe about to undergo Great Destruction?"</p><p></p><p>Various 12th level alien races became nervous. Except for freaks like Lin Yuan, for any 12th level being, universal Great Destruction was like walking through the gates of hell.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this Great Destruction was arriving half a universal era early, these 12th level alien races had lost half a universal era to improve their strength, lowering their chances of surviving the Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>"The battle between two Saints..."</p><p></p><p>In the Catastrophe Race's territory, two Ultimates hid in a wooden house, carefully sensing the vast waves of energy.</p><p></p><p>"Even Chaos Saints can at most cause the universe to enter premature Great Destruction, but cannot completely erase the universe. We'll be safe hiding in our ancestral house."</p><p></p><p>The two Catastrophe Race Ultimates thought to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Chaos Saint-level power of the Catastrophe Race's mother clan, or Lord Xuanhuang, they all chose to arrange their backup plans within the universe.</p><p></p><p>This was because the universe itself was protected by Chaos laws. Even supreme Chaos Saints could not interfere or influence it too greatly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged under the starry sky. At this moment, he could clearly sense the destructive aftershocks enveloping and covering everything.</p><p></p><p>These destructive aftershocks were divided into two forces, constantly intertwining and colliding, shattering and tearing apart everything in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Even something as vast as the universe and starry sky would suffer irreversible damage to its foundation after these forces swept through, beginning to enter Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully. Within the two constantly intertwining and colliding forces, one was fiery red, using infinite Chaos as fuel to burn Chaos flames.</p><p></p><p>These Chaos flames were completely different from the Chaos flames mastered by Duke Qingfen in the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Duke Qingfen's Chaos flames were endless destruction and incineration, while these Chaos flames were filled with infinite vitality, containing the power of rebirth.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenix Saint?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although he hadn't heard the sounds of the two Chaos Saints fighting, he was certain this power came from the Nine Phoenix Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Saint had reached the Saint level through the Dao of Chaos flames.</p><p></p><p>The other force intertwined with the Nine Phoenix Saint's Chaos flames appeared as large patches of dark shadows. Everywhere this force passed, everything fell into darkness and silence, devoid of any vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Shadow Demon Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly thought. The only force that could constantly intertwine with the Nine Phoenix Saint's power was that of the other Chaos Saint - the Shadow Demon Saint.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>The two drastically different, almost opposite forces intertwined and collided, with the aftershocks spreading and covering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Large areas of void were affected and torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's perception rose infinitely. His peak 7th level boundary comprehension of space-time allowed him to vaguely sense the nearest universe to their home universe.</p><p></p><p>That universe was enveloped and covered by these two forces before their home universe.</p><p></p><p>Crash crash crash.</p><p></p><p>The universe began to collapse from its foundations. The river of time rapidly dried up, and countless lives within the universe fell into extreme panic.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>"Universal Great Destruction? Our universe was still far from Great Destruction, how could it happen so soon?"</p><p></p><p>"My people..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They haven't even transferred yet!" In this universe, the 12th level ultimate beings sensed the terrifying power coming more than ten breaths in advance, but at most they could only store their many treasures in their internal universes. As for their clansmen? They could only desperately face the universe's great destruction.</p><p></p><p>Many races of living beings didn't even notice the universe's great destruction. The moment the universe began to collapse, entire races were annihilated before they could even feel pain.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! This universe continued its great destruction. Even the destruction takes time, especially for such an enormous entity as a universe. Even its collapse and destruction would take considerable time.</p><p></p><p>"In that universe, no more than ten 12th level beings will survive," Lin Yuan vaguely sensed and concluded.</p><p></p><p>Being prepared to face the universe's great destruction versus being unprepared leads to different outcomes.</p><p></p><p>This is especially important for life forms below the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>Knowing in advance means they can hide in the internal universes of ultimate beings beforehand, giving them a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for those outside? Even if they could withstand the universe's great destruction, with the river of time drying up, life forms below the 12th level whose life essence is still in the river are doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat under the starry sky, watching from afar as the nearest universe gradually entered its great destruction, feeling neither joy nor sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Chaos Saints is indeed beyond what I can resist now. The unique force derived from chaos rules has unimaginable might.</p><p></p><p>I wonder what scene will unfold when my Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji power develops? Will it be comparable to the Chaos Fire and Chaos Shadow mastered by these two Chaos Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Two terrifying forces spread and expanded in all directions. In the center of these two forces stood two figures.</p><p></p><p>These two figures were like black holes, emitting fearsome auras at will, constantly shattering and tearing apart the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenix, we are both Saints now. Why must we fight to the death?" The figure on the right was a man, standing as if in the depths of infinite shadows. He spoke, communicating with the other Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Fight to the death?"</p><p></p><p>"Shadow Demon, you slaughtered my clansmen. Even if I fall completely, I must kill you!" </p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Saint was a woman with an icy expression. She stared at the Shadow Demon Saint, her gaze filled with killing intent and hatred.</p><p></p><p>She was a miraculous life form born from the chaotic void. Along with her, eight other miraculous life forms of the same clan were born.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Saint lived with her eight clansmen for long ages, until the Shadow Demon Saint arrived.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Shadow Demon Saint was not yet a Saint, merely a Venerable. To obtain the flesh and blood of miraculous life forms as cultivation resources, he slaughtered all eight of the Nine Phoenix Saint's clansmen.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Saint barely escaped with the help of her clansmen.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the two had formed a deep grudge.</p><p></p><p>Until they both successively reached the Saint level.</p><p></p><p>As Chaos Venerables, battles had a cost, so the fights between the Nine Phoenix Saint and Shadow Demon Saint were not constant.</p><p></p><p>But as Chaos Saints? Using chaos rules as fuel to evolve special powers, the concept of cost no longer existed. The entire chaotic void was at their disposal to absorb.</p><p></p><p>"Kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Fire you wield is not adept at killing. You can't kill me."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Demon Saint was quite helpless. While the Nine Phoenix Saint couldn't do anything to him, he also couldn't do anything to the Nine Phoenix Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Rebirth Fire that the Nine Phoenix Saint evolved from chaos rules gave this Chaos Saint the weakest combat power among Saints, but in terms of survival ability? It was almost equivalent to immortality. Even if several Saints besieged her, they probably couldn't do anything.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't kill you, I'll drag you down with me."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Saint's tone was icy, unwavering.</p><p></p><p>After all, she would spend her long future years constantly battling the Shadow Demon Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenix, you madwoman!"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Demon Saint's voice was low. Drag him down? This Nine Phoenix Saint would rather not cultivate or improve her strength, just to drag him down? If this wasn't madness, what was?</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz!!</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, they had already exchanged billions of blows, then instantly moved far away.</p><p></p><p>Although the two Chaos Saints had left, the terrifying forces left behind from their battle continued to collide endlessly, affecting a wide range of void and causing universe after universe to prematurely enter great destruction.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed and detected two forces arriving. The origin of his home universe immediately rumbled, its space-time structure beginning to collapse as the entire universe gradually entered great destruction.</p><p></p><p>A universe's great destruction starts from the edges, gradually spreading toward the center until it finally becomes a mass of chaos, then begins anew, expanding again to nurture a new universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn. Even though he was fully confident in surviving the universe's great destruction, he wouldn't underestimate it.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The edge regions of the universe began collapsing on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>In the instant these regions collapsed—</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's pupils contracted as he noticed an inconceivable change.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

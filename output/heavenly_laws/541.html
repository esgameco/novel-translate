        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, feeling a certain heavy pressure.</p><p></p><p>In fact, some citizens of human civilization were still inside the universes within the bodies of Xuanyuan, Xiaqin and other supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Lin Yuan, they could be completely ignored. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan alone had taken on the task of transferring almost all citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this task posed no difficulty for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"At least there hasn't been any chaos." Lin Yuan observed briefly and found that after the transfer, the countless human citizens still maintained order and carried out follow-up work in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>In fact, before the migration, all citizens of human civilization had simulated the migration and transfer multiple times in the virtual world, in order to avoid chaos after the environment changed.</p><p></p><p>For this transfer, the virtual world even opened up permissions and made it accessible to all citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Next, when the universe undergoes its great collapse, transfer the life imprints of all citizens again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>What he had transferred now was only the physical bodies and souls of the citizens.</p><p></p><p>As for the fundamental life imprints of each citizen, they were still floating in the river of time in the main universe's starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate beings of the twelfth level could go against the flow and revive sixth-level and above beings who had died in the past through their life imprints in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>But this doesn't mean that beings below the sixth level don't have imprints.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their life imprints are too weak and minute, and normal ultimate beings of the twelfth level cannot lock onto them.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. With his current perception, he could easily lock onto any imprint in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>If the citizens' life imprints were not transferred, when the universe underwent its great collapse and the river of time collapsed, even if all citizens were sheltered in Lin Yuan's internal universe, they would still die along with it.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I'll probably face some backlash from the universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was well aware that transferring life imprints on such a large scale from the main universe's river of time to the river of time in his own internal universe was undoubtedly snatching them right in front of the consciousness of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>This was even more serious than the ultimate beings of the twelfth level reviving beings who had died in the past.</p><p></p><p>Reviving beings who had died in the past violated the basic rules of the universe, but at least these revived beings were still within the universe, equivalent to things belonging to the universe itself.</p><p></p><p>But transferring them to Lin Yuan's internal universe? It was undoubtedly being completely taken away by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It would definitely touch the bottom line of the universe's origin consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's strength, he could completely transfer them now. The so-called backlash from the universe would hardly be able to shake him.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need for this. Currently, the universe's origin consciousness was still at its peak. Waiting for the universe's great collapse when the universe's origin consciousness weakened, and then carrying out the transfer, the backlash faced at that time would be much smaller.</p><p></p><p>Being able to face a weaker backlash, Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't choose a stronger backlash.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Boundless and endless.</p><p></p><p>A chaotic continent as large as dozens of universes began to slow down gradually, and finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>This chaotic continent was the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent. After repeated calculations, Venerable Ancient Ming determined that this area would not be affected by the two Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"It's stopped."</p><p></p><p>"We can finally go out."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what this void is like? Will it be more dangerous than before?"</p><p></p><p>On the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent, many powerful beings were discussing in low voices. They had all followed the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent in leaving, so naturally they were curious about the unfamiliar void they had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ancient Ming is merciful, willing to take us away."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if we weren't on this chaotic continent, who knows how many dangers we would encounter trying to get here."</p><p></p><p>Many powerful beings were quite grateful. The chaotic void was full of dangers everywhere, and these dangers were not just from dangerous places and secret realms, but more from other powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>No matter where, plundering is always one of the fastest ways to obtain resources, and this is even more so in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent had rushed here without encountering a single obstruction, and that was because of Venerable Ancient Ming's deterrence!</p><p></p><p>Venerable Ancient Ming's strength was already powerful, not to mention there was also a Chaos Dragon Beast that was almost on par with a Venerable! Even other Chaos Venerables would have to weigh whether they had the ability to stop them.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent arriving so smoothly didn't mean other powerful beings traveling alone would be so smooth.</p><p></p><p>"The distance from here to the home universe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also examining the new environment while sensing the distance between himself and his true body.</p><p></p><p>"With my current space-time comprehension, it would take about ten years of travel to reach it," Lin Yuan concluded.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan's space-time comprehension had reached the peak of the seventh level, it would still take ten years to cross. If it was when he had just started exploring the chaotic void, it might take hundreds or thousands of years to reach.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years is not long," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. At least for now, he hadn't found a safer place than the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression suddenly changed as he looked towards the vast chaotic void in all directions.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent stopped, a large area around it was affected.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent was too huge, as large as dozens of universes. The gravitational field that naturally formed could attract all matter in a large surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, one huge object after another appeared, attracted by the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent and rushing towards it.</p><p></p><p>These huge objects...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Most of these were metal ore veins naturally formed in the chaotic void. They weren't very valuable individually, but their sheer quantity was enormous. They collided and converged, forming huge meteorites that were attracted to the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent and hurtled towards it at terrifying speeds.</p><p></p><p>Just like stars in the universe are surrounded by numerous planets due to their gravitational pull, the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent's mass was incomparably greater than any star. The number of meteorites it attracted was incalculable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't worried about this. The Ancient Ming Chaos Continent was surrounded by many grand formations and restrictions. These incoming meteorites would simply be crushed by the protective arrays.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment...</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black dragon beast rushed out from the depths of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent. As soon as it reached the outer regions, it let out a single roar. The incoming meteorites rapidly collapsed, shattering into fragments that slowly began orbiting the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Chaos Dragon Beast?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly solemn. This Chaos Dragon Beast was a miraculous life form born from the chaotic void. Its innate talents were unimaginably powerful, allowing it to rival Venerable realm experts despite only being at the peak of the Overlord realm.</p><p></p><p>"Fragment worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the Chaos Dragon Beast, after shattering all the meteorites with its roar, began organizing the broken fragments, ultimately forming "fragment worlds" orbiting the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"This way, we've gained a large number of fragment worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred. This action not only solved the problem of those massive objects hurtling towards the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, but also created "revenue" for it.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the "fragment worlds" orbiting the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent were suitable for use as cultivation bases. They weren't cheap - starting at 100,000 chaos stones, with some reaching several hundred thousand or even millions of chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had been waiting for a suitable "fragment world" to serve as a new home for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In the hall responsible for managing the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent's "fragment worlds"...</p><p></p><p>Overlord Wan Qu was "tallying" the number and quality of the newly created fragment worlds, categorizing them and assessing their value.</p><p></p><p>"This time, we've gained over a thousand new 'fragment worlds', among which 600 are suitable for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Overlord Wan Qu was elated. Even at the cheapest price of 100,000 chaos stones each, 600 "fragment worlds" would be worth 60 million chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Among them, quite a few 'fragment worlds' meet Brother Yinhe's requirements."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Overlord Wan Qu's face as this thought occurred to him.</p><p></p><p>He had quite an impression of Lin Yuan, believing that Lin Yuan's true form must be a powerful Overlord realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"I should call Brother Yinhe over to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Overlord Wan Qu immediately contacted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just as Overlord Wan Qu finished making contact, a young man in a black robe appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him, Overlord Wan Qu immediately stood up and respectfully said, "Uncle Master."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth was actually that Chaos Dragon Beast. As a miraculous life form, its transformation abilities were almost instinctive, though it usually couldn't be bothered to change form and maintained its true body.</p><p></p><p>This Chaos Dragon Beast had an extraordinary relationship with Venerable Ancient Ming, so Ancient Ming's disciples all addressed it as "Uncle Master."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, how are those fragment meteorites? Not bad, right?" the black-robed youth asked lazily.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't roared to shatter those meteorites and form fragment worlds for nothing - he could obtain some benefits here in exchange.</p><p></p><p>"In reply to Uncle Master, the quality of the fragment worlds formed this time is quite good," Overlord Wan Qu reported honestly.</p><p></p><p>"That's good." The black-robed youth was pleased. According to their agreement, he could directly take 30% of all income from the fragment worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wan Qu wants me to go over and select a 'fragment world'?"</p><p></p><p>In the inn, Lin Yuan received Overlord Wan Qu's message.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I should be able to choose a suitable 'fragment world' this time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind and immediately set out towards the trading area's hall.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived in front of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hall, Overlord Wan Qu was conversing with the black-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Master, someone has come to select a 'fragment world'."</p><p></p><p>Overlord Wan Qu said.</p><p></p><p>"Then go ahead."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth nodded.</p><p></p><p>He naturally wouldn't delay Overlord Wan Qu on important matters, especially since he could directly take 30% of the fragment worlds' income.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Overlord Wan Qu nodded and immediately left the hall to welcome Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is he the one coming to select a 'fragment world'?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth glanced over, seeing Lin Yuan talking with Overlord Wan Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Just an avatar?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth immediately saw that the Lin Yuan outside the hall was not his true body.</p><p></p><p>"Eh?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth seemed to sense something. The moment his gaze fell on Lin Yuan, the thin time bloodline flowing in his body began to tremble faintly.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth stared at Lin Yuan from afar, and a look of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was an even more intense fear than when he had "foreseen" the possibility of being caught in the crossfire between two Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 247: The Invincible Ones at the Eighth Stage (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield B520.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Avatar stood still, gazing at the ten-thousand-meter-wide permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>"The accumulation speed of the Boundary-Breaking Power is much faster than in small-scale alien battlefields. The factor affecting the accumulation is the size of the permanent spatial rift, not the quantity?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had tried sending the Yin Avatar and the Yang Avatar to different small-scale alien battlefields, simultaneously approaching the permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no significant amplification effect on the Boundary-Breaking Power.</p><p></p><p>Now, after approaching the ten-thousand-meter-wide permanent spatial rift of this medium-scale alien battlefield, Lin Yuan clearly felt the difference.</p><p></p><p>"The initial accumulation speed of the Boundary-Breaking Power in the Gate of Myriad Realms was one strand every 333 days. The spatial rifts in small-scale alien battlefields increased this speed to one strand every 290 days."</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes to confirm again.</p><p></p><p>"It's one strand every 200 days!"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Accumulating one strand of Boundary-Breaking Power every 200 days meant he could gather nearly two strands in a year.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the initial accumulation speed, it had almost doubled.</p><p></p><p>"I currently have 17 strands of Boundary-Breaking Power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. In theory, 17 strands could support him to traverse 17 times without interruption.</p><p></p><p>However, that was the most basic traversal, a random one.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's strength was not yet strong, even random traversals could bring him great improvements.</p><p></p><p>After all, being weak meant there was still a large distance from the upper limit. In the endless dimensions and realms, even if it was random, the worlds he traversed would most likely benefit him.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already an Eighth Stage Evolver. In a large portion of worlds, even if he traversed there, the help they could provide him was extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Lin Yuan now traversed to the worlds of his third or fourth traversal, let alone breaking through shackles and limitations, it was questionable whether he could even restore his strength to its prime.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point wasâ€”</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's seventh traversal, which he undertook to overcome the Tribulation of the Heart Demon, he reached a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The time Lin Yuan could stay in a world after traversing was related to the world's level.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the higher the world's level, the longer Lin Yuan's stay, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Avatar selected an optimal position near the ten-thousand-meter-wide permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>This position provided the greatest boost to the accumulation of Boundary-Breaking Power, ultimately increasing the speed to one strand every 198 days.</p><p></p><p>"My current inner world..."</p><p></p><p>After advancing to the Eighth Stage, even avatars could open up inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Avatar opened the flame-filled "Solar World", while the Yin Avatar opened the "Lunar World".</p><p></p><p>However, due to various influences, there were differences in the inner worlds opened by the main body, the Yang Avatar, and the Yin Avatar.</p><p></p><p>The main body simultaneously controlled the Yin, Yang, and Taiji, with complete and perfect rules. The currently opened world exceeded 700,000 li. After being further tempered and transformed by the mysterious gourd liquid, the inner world had surged to a size of 2 million li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>As the Yang Avatar had comprehended the Solar Rules, its opened inner world reached a size of 400,000 li in circumference, stepping into the threshold of the Eighth Stage peak.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin Avatar, its current inner world was only 200,000 li in circumference. It could be foreseen that once Lin Yuan comprehended the Lunar Rules, its "Lunar World" would also reach a size of 400,000 li in circumference.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the liquid in that gourd is only effective on living beings with flesh and blood. As for energy lifeforms? It has no effect."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Avatar shook its head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The vast universe gave birth to countless lifeforms, with flesh and blood lifeforms being the mainstream. However, they were only the mainstream. Outside of flesh and blood lifeforms, there existed energy lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The so-called energy lifeforms had no flesh and blood, and the essence of their life was ethereal forces like the soul. Lin Yuan's two great avatars could be classified as energy lifeforms in a strict sense.</p><p></p><p>Compared to flesh and blood lifeforms, energy lifeforms possessed many advantages, such as immunity to most physical attacks.</p><p></p><p>In human civilizations, certain special physiques and bloodline techniques could achieve short-term energization of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to true energy lifeforms, these were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>"In the coming time, this avatar of mine will need to be stationed here." Lin Yuan swept his gaze around.</p><p></p><p>He specially selected this medium-scale alien battlefield not only because it satisfied the requirement of a permanent spatial rift but also because battles of high intensity rarely occurred here.</p><p></p><p>This satisfied Lin Yuan. Once a high-intensity battle occurred, it might lead to a scene like the one in that small-scale alien battlefield before, where human evolvers fled in droves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in most battlefields with high-intensity wars, human civilization evolvers held the upper hand and actively hunted down the aliens.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy's Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still in secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The trivial matters of the Main Star and even the Galactic Star Domain were basically handed over to his subordinates, with the Wisdom Goddess paying more attention to them.</p><p></p><p>There would basically be no problems.</p><p></p><p>After his body was once again pulverized and he returned through the flesh and blood divine ability "Rebirth by Dripping Blood".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to sense the changes in his physical body and inner world.</p><p></p><p>"The speed of improvement is getting slower and slower..."</p><p></p><p>The first time he absorbed that drop of scarlet liquid, Lin Yuan's physical body's inner world directly surged twofold.</p><p></p><p>After that, with each absorption, the magnitude of increase in his physical body's inner world became lower and lower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised by this. The liquid in the gourd being able to forcibly increase the basic size of the inner world was already quite inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, currently, Lin Yuan had only absorbed the first type of scarlet liquid.</p><p></p><p>There were still six types of differently colored liquids waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"Now, my inner world has reached a size of 2.2 million li in circumference, which is 1 times the initial 700,000 li in circumference."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The later it got, the lower the magnitude of increase.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated that the first type of scarlet liquid's enhancement to his physical body and inner world would stop at 3.33 times.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lin Yuan would have completely absorbed this type of scarlet liquid and begin absorbing the next type of orange liquid.</p><p></p><p>"3.33 times?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into contemplation. He was very familiar with this number.</p><p></p><p>One of the prerequisites to becoming an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower was to comprehend 3,333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>The initial accumulation speed of the Boundary-Breaking Power in the Gate of Myriad Realms was 333 days.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Magic Jade Tower or the Gate of Myriad Realms, both had mysterious origins. Especially the Gate of Myriad Realms, which easily sent Lin Yuan to worlds of other dimensions and realms.</p><p></p><p>When he was weak, Lin Yuan didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>But as his strength increased and his grasp of spatial rules deepened, he increasingly felt how terrifying such a means was. Even the strongest beings probably couldn't open up passages leading to other dimensions and realms, right?</p><p></p><p>"Continue, continue."</p><p></p><p>"After completely absorbing this type of scarlet liquid, let's see what's next..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Lin Yuan began absorbing the scarlet liquid. </p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan did not neglect to perfect his martial path of evolution, as well as his comprehension of the spatial rules model.</p><p></p><p>Everything proceeded in an orderly manner. Almost every day that passed, Lin Yuan's strength would increase by a notch.</p><p></p><p>For every mile that his inner world expanded, it could provide a significant boost to an eighth-stage evolutionist, let alone the current speed at which Lin Yuan's inner world was expanding - how could it be limited to just one mile per day?</p><p></p><p>Several months later.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, so you're Chi Kun's junior disciple? Impressive." Inside the palace, Lin Yuan sat face to face with a bald man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>This bald white-robed man had an aura of holy brilliance in his every move, making people instinctively feel close and fond of him.</p><p></p><p>"White Light Star Lord, you flatter me by saying that." Lin Yuan said with a laugh. </p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord before him was a veteran peak eighth-stage expert of human civilization and a good friend of Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although the White Light Star Lord was not invincible at the eighth stage, his strength was absolutely at the pinnacle among eighth-stage experts. </p><p></p><p>In terms of his comprehension of spatial rules, he was not much inferior to Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>It was only because he had not comprehended a certain cosmic power that he was slightly inferior to Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Invincible eighth-stage experts were essentially still at the fourth stage of the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the cosmic power they comprehended allowed their combat strength to soar, surpassing the eighth stage, and even having the ability to preserve their lives in front of ninth-stage evolutionists.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Thunder Heart you wanted." The White Light Star Lord looked at Lin Yuan with a smile, then tossed out a heart that seemed to be pulsating, composed entirely of thunder and lightning.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Heart was a rare cosmic treasure of the eighth star, and could be considered a top-grade item of the eighth star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner world was expanding at an extreme speed and needed this kind of cosmic treasure to perfect it. He happened to learn from his master Chi Kun Star Lord that the White Light Star Lord had recently obtained this "Thunder Heart", so he took the initiative to contact him to seek a trade.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that the White Light Star Lord had recently returned from an alien battlefield and was passing through the Galaxy Star Domain, so he personally delivered it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, White Light Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately took out twelve thousand cosmic crystals. </p><p></p><p>As a top-grade cosmic treasure of the eighth star, the Thunder Heart had always been priceless, ranging from ten to twenty thousand cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord was clearly giving Lin Yuan face by agreeing to trade it for twelve thousand cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Then the transaction is complete."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord collected the cosmic crystals and looked at Lin Yuan again. "What path do you plan to take next? Comprehend a cosmic power and become an invincible eighth-stage expert?"</p><p></p><p>"Invincible at the eighth stage?"</p><p></p><p>"That's too difficult." Lin Yuan was slightly startled and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was human civilization or other peak races, powerful races or ordinary races, they all had experts at the invincible eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>But so far, no race had summarized a specific method to become invincible at the eighth stage. </p><p></p><p>Every invincible eighth-stage expert was unique, and the cosmic powers they comprehended were all different.</p><p></p><p>"Many eighth-stage evolutionists, even after advancing to the ninth stage, have not comprehended a certain cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>Taking human civilization as an example, out of thousands of eighth-stage evolutionists, it was estimated that only one invincible eighth-stage expert would be born.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to become invincible at the eighth stage required even more luck.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that what is difficult for other evolutionists, for you..."</p><p></p><p>A hint of strangeness appeared on the White Light Star Lord's face. Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude were absolutely the most terrifying he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention becoming an eighth-stage expert before the age of a hundred.</p><p></p><p>He even single-handedly cleansed the Galaxy Star Domain, sweeping through all those powerful special lifeforms and lone alien wanderers?</p><p></p><p>And to do this, one needed at least the combat power of a peak eighth-stage expert.</p><p></p><p>This was simply a freak.</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord didn't even know how to describe Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was certain.</p><p></p><p>For other evolutionists, becoming invincible at the eighth stage...</p><p></p><p>In front of Lin Yuan, it might just be a matter of time?</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the White Light Star Lord, Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had also been thinking about how to become an invincible eighth-stage expert.</p><p></p><p>But there were no results. The cosmic powers condensed by each invincible eighth-stage expert were all grasped under fortuitous coincidences and could not be replicated.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to become invincible at the eighth stage, he had to comprehend a cosmic power himself.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a simple matter either.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to set becoming invincible at the eighth stage as the goal."</p><p></p><p>"If I can become invincible at the eighth stage, that would naturally be a good thing, but if I can't, I'll just directly charge towards the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts were very clear.</p><p></p><p>Besides.</p><p></p><p>Just because Lin Yuan could not comprehend a certain cosmic power did not mean he could not become invincible at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, as long as his inner world expanded to a radius of several million miles or more, even without relying on cosmic power, his true combat strength would not be inferior to an invincible eighth-stage expert.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>On a desolate planet.</p><p></p><p>Five figures were standing there quietly.</p><p></p><p>These five figures had completely concealed their auras, but vaguely, they resonated with the surrounding starry universe - they were actually five invincible eighth-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>A consciousness projection descended.</p><p></p><p>The phantom image of an insect nest larger than the planet appeared faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Revered Envoy."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the five invincible eighth-stage experts bowed slightly towards the insect nest phantom.</p><p></p><p>As invincible eighth-stage experts, even when encountering ninth-stage powerhouses, there was no need to be so respectful, because invincible eighth-stage experts basically all had means to preserve their lives in front of ninth-stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>But the insect nest phantom before them was a great existence of the Insect Race, surpassing the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Your target this time is the Galaxy Star Lord, that peerless genius of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The insect nest phantom emitted psychic fluctuations, its gaze sweeping over the five invincible eighth-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>The several peak races all had a tacit understanding. Whether on the battlefield or elsewhere, they tried their best not to mobilize powerhouses at the ninth stage and above.</p><p></p><p>Even for assassinating the Galaxy Star Lord, a peerless genius of human civilization, they would not tear up this tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Insect Race had taken the initiative to tear up the tacit understanding because of that supreme corpse that had drifted in from outside the self-contained world.</p><p></p><p>It contained a supreme evolutionary path with no end.</p><p></p><p>It had the potential to increase the Insect Race's supreme beings (Queen Mothers).</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Insect Race directly flip the table.</p><p></p><p>But the Galaxy Star Lord? The Galaxy Star Lord was indeed a peerless genius of human civilization, but could he ultimately become a supreme being?</p><p></p><p>Most likely not.</p><p></p><p>For the Insect Race, assassinating the Galaxy Star Lord was just to reduce some losses on future battlefields.</p><p></p><p>"Revered Envoy, that Galaxy Star Lord has only just entered the eighth stage. Even if he possesses the combat power of an invincible eighth-stage expert, any one of us taking action would suffice. Is there a need for the five of us to join hands?"</p><p></p><p>The invincible eighth-stage expert on the far left asked.</p><p></p><p>"Only just entered the eighth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The insect nest phantom glanced at this invincible eighth-stage expert, a hint of mockery flashing in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the twenty years spent in the two-dimensional world, only two or three months had passed in the main universe. </p><p></p><p>The virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was exchanging intelligence with the Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, the powerful experts from various major forces had basically started joining hands, even those unique special lifeforms being no exception.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, those special lifeforms at the sixth level of the eleventh stage were terrifyingly powerful. </p><p></p><p>But in the two-dimensional world, the peak eleventh stage lifeforms had not fully grown yet, and might even die at the hands of a ninth or tenth stage lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The power limit in the two-dimensional world was not high, even eighth stage lifeforms could easily reach it.</p><p></p><p>Under the same power limit, the peak eleventh stage lifeforms, relying on their formidable spiritual willpower and comprehension skills, might be able to sweep aside ten eighth stage peers of the same level.</p><p></p><p>But what about a hundred or a thousand of them? It's worth noting that over 100 million experts from various races had fallen into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh stage lifeforms had not grown to their limits yet. If they were careless, they could really lose their footing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given time, the eleventh stage lifeforms were destined to surpass the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Relying on their mastery over their powers, even if the eleventh stage experts had to start over, they would eventually rise up again.</p><p></p><p>But they needed time to grow.</p><p></p><p>The peak eleventh stage experts needed time, and Lin Yuan also needed time.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension ability, given the same starting point, Lin Yuan was confident he could go higher and further than those peak eleventh stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, my human civilization's evolutionary, has already established a base in the capital of the ancient Molan nation. Are you interested in coming over?" The Vice Patriarch Nalan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although in this two-dimensional world, every time the heavenly gate opened, only one person could leave, the human civilization's evolutionary forces were still quite united before completely wiping out the other racial experts.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient Molan nation?" Lin Yuan raised his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the vast continent of this two-dimensional world, the ancient nations were enormous entities that transcended gathering spots and cities.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan only knew of twelve such ancient nations, each one established by a Primordial Lord and ruling over vast territories.</p><p></p><p>"My current location is too remote, the ancient Molan nation is too far away," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, making up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>In reality, Lin Yuan simply did not want to go to crowded places.</p><p></p><p>As one of the twelve ancient nations, the capital of the Molan nation was extremely prosperous.</p><p></p><p>This meant there was a high possibility of other racial experts going there.</p><p></p><p>There, the chance of encountering experts from the main universe was far too high.</p><p></p><p>"That's too bad," the Vice Patriarch Nalan sighed but did not insist.</p><p></p><p>The vast continent in this two-dimensional world was too vast, without the ability to teleport using spatial rules, traveling was a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan chatted with the Vice Patriarch Nalan for a while more.</p><p></p><p>The topics were mostly focused on cultivation, as well as the whereabouts of some extremely famous racial experts.</p><p></p><p>"So far, the Luochuan Gathering I'm at is still very safe, without any trace of racial experts," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although over 100 million experts from various races had fallen into this two-dimensional world, they were scattered across the entire continent, making them seem extremely sparse.</p><p></p><p>The Luochuan Gathering was a large one, but far from being on the level of a city-state force, let alone an ancient nation-level force.</p><p></p><p>The truly powerful racial experts basically gravitated towards the prosperous places, as those had more resources for powering up.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, if you have any questions, you can contact me anytime," the Vice Patriarch Nalan said finally.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the Luochuan Gathering, Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"External forces are still unreliable," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had been waiting for news from the peerless experts. If those peerless experts could refine that 'blank paper', they would definitely have the ability to pull him out.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that hope was not very high.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to those eleventh stage lifeforms, my biggest advantage lies in my comprehension," Lin Yuan pondered inwardly, having confirmed he could not rely on external forces to leave.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh stage lifeforms definitely surpassed Lin Yuan in terms of speed of thought processing and mastery over basic powers.</p><p></p><p>But comprehension? Even with the boon of high vantage point, Lin Yuan believed he far exceeded those eleventh stage lifeforms in comprehension.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this advantage in comprehension could not be directly converted into combat power.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the early stages of cultivation, following the cultivation system of this two-dimensional world did not require much comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The five great realms of Shaman, Shaman King, Shaman Emperor, Shaman Sovereign, and Primordial Lord - those eleventh stage lifeforms only needed to follow the cultivation methods of this two-dimensional world to advance.</p><p></p><p>The place that truly required comprehension was after the Primordial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>After Primordial Lord, with no path forward, to continue increasing one's strength, one had to blaze a new trail relying on oneself.</p><p></p><p>At that point, Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension would display its tremendous advantage.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, before Primordial Lord, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed could not match those peak eleventh stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But after reaching Primordial Lord, Lin Yuan would...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Easily defeating those peak eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan refused the invitation from Vice Pagoda Master Nalan and hid in the remote Luochuan Gathering Place. </p><p></p><p>As long as he could endure the initial stage of cultivation, those eleventh-level lifeforms would be waiting to be crushed by him.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Lin Yuan was unwilling to have too much contact with the powerful experts of the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>"In twenty years, I will also cultivate to the peak Demon King realm," Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he didn't hide here but went to more prosperous regions and took advantage of the vast resources, Lin Yuan might have already crossed into the Demon Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>But the risk of such behavior was that he would come into contact with the powerful experts of the myriad races prematurely.</p><p></p><p>The bird that sticks its head out gets shot first. Exposing himself too early would highly likely cause those with ill intentions to target him.</p><p></p><p>"At the peak Demon King realm, my true combat strength should not be weaker than a Demon Emperor's," Lin Yuan knew well in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the native experts, Lin Yuan was an outsider with a broader vision. His grasp and application of power was streets ahead of the native Demon Kings at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Lin Yuan had even created various skills and killing techniques by taking advantage of his extraordinary comprehension, allowing his means of killing to reach an astonishing level.</p><p></p><p>"The next Demon Emperor realm is a very crucial stage according to my deductions. It relates to whether I can unleash my full potential after crossing into the Demon Ancestor realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently. From the very beginning of his cultivation, with his extraordinary comprehension, Lin Yuan had already begun deducing the path after the Demon Ancestor realm and understood the importance of the Demon Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, starting from the Demon King realm, Lin Yuan had gradually abandoned this world's original cultivation system and begun creating a cultivation method completely suited for himself and adapted to this world.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to draw references from a large number of cultivation methods in this world, otherwise it will probably waste a lot of time when crossing into the Demon Emperor realm next."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial evolution was also created by observing and learning from numerous other paths of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was deep in thought, a voice suddenly came through.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Lin Yuan glanced at the door.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a skinny little man walked in.</p><p></p><p>This skinny little man was named Cha Rangu and was the controller of the Luochuan Gathering Place, a Demon King-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Twelve years ago, when Lin Yuan crossed into the Demon King realm, he casually took control of Cha Rangu, becoming the true master of this large gathering place.</p><p></p><p>Of course, outsiders were unaware of Lin Yuan's identity, and everything was conducted in secret.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Cha Rangu was extremely respectful in his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew just how terrifyingly powerful Lin Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan first appeared before him and said he wanted to take over the gathering place, Cha Rangu didn't take it seriously. But after what happened next, he has been trembling in fear until now.</p><p></p><p>The power that Lin Yuan revealed far exceeded that of a Demon King. Many years ago, Cha Rangu had the chance to witness a Demon King-level expert, but it seemed like even they were not a match for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Did you find any results regarding the matter I asked you to investigate?" Lin Yuan asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since he was living in seclusion at the Luochuan Gathering Place, the entire place had to be under his control, which was why Lin Yuan took control of Cha Rangu.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the true master of the Luochuan Gathering Place, it at least alleviated many of the cultivation resource issues at the Demon King stage.</p><p></p><p>But that was only an alleviation. For Lin Yuan to cross into the Demon Emperor realm next, the vast resources needed could not be satisfied by the Luochuan Gathering Place alone.</p><p></p><p>So not long ago, Lin Yuan had Cha Rangu keep an eye out for information in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the whereabouts of the Eighteen Demon King Bandits of Yunshanshan have been confirmed," Cha Rangu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Demon King Bandits of Yunshanshan referred to eighteen extremely vicious Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>These eighteen Demon Kings were all at the peak Demon King level and had committed countless evil deeds, with many bounties and wanted orders on their heads.</p><p></p><p>Roughly calculated, the bounty on each Demon King added up to over two hundred thousand demon crystals, so the eighteen Demon Kings had a staggering bounty of nearly four million demon crystals.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan needed vast resources for his cultivation, but how could he obtain them?</p><p></p><p>The fastest way was plundering, but it was too risky and high-profile.</p><p></p><p>Taking on the ancient nation's bounties to hunt down those with huge bounties on their heads was the safest method Lin Yuan could think of.</p><p></p><p>First, killing those fugitives would not lead to any repercussions, and responding to the ancient nation's wanted orders would ensure his identity remained confidential.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could also obtain a large bounty reward, which perfectly matched Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>This didn't even include the personal wealth carried by the Eighteen Demon King Bandits themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Demon King Bandits had recently committed another major crime and were being pursued by Demon King-level experts. They eventually fled to the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>As the local power in the Luochuan Gathering Place where he had been operating for many years, Cha Rangu immediately locked onto the general area where the Eighteen Demon King Bandits were currently located.</p><p></p><p>"Master, if you want to deal with the Eighteen Demon King Bandits, you must be careful. They have cultivated a combined attack technique. When joining forces, even Demon Kings have to retreat," Cha Rangu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The combined bounty on the Eighteen Demon King Bandits was nearly four million demon crystals - a fortune that even Demon Kings would crave immensely.</p>

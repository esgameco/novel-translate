        <h1>Chapter 684</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To not become a demon, one cannot completely eliminate the demons.</p><p></p><p>To become a demon, one will eventually become a new 'demon' in the end.</p><p></p><p>This is the desperate situation faced by the life in this realm.</p><p></p><p>So far, the only way explored to erase the demons is to completely devour them.</p><p></p><p>But the 'demons' are composed of endless demonic qi. To devour the 'demons' is equivalent to becoming a demon oneself. This can temporarily eliminate some 'demons', but the one who becomes a demon will eventually become an even more powerful 'demon'.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qing is completely dead."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently watched, knowing that the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud did not hold back.</p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, Li Qing must have left behind many trump cards to protect his life.</p><p></p><p>But these trump cards were all left within the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud. The moment the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud struck, he also erased Li Qing's life-saving trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Li Qing was still in the initial stage of becoming a demon and did not possess the ability of immortality yet.</p><p></p><p>This is why the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud unhesitatingly erased Li Qing - if he had let it drag on, the consequences would have been even more severe.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud turned around and brought Lin Yuan back to the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'm grateful for your help with the matter regarding Li Qing."</p><p></p><p>Although the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud was saddened, he also knew that if he had allowed Li Qing to continue becoming a demon, it would have caused tremendous losses to the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator who becomes a demon, before the transformation, will think that they can resist the influence of the demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>But in the end?</p><p></p><p>They end up creating terrifying 'demons', making the situation for the cultivators in this realm even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>"It was my duty."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He reported the matter of Li Qing becoming a demon to the Sect Master, mainly also out of his own selfish motives.</p><p></p><p>If he was the only one who knew about this matter, he would certainly become a thorn in Li Qing's side.</p><p></p><p>He did this for self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether it was your duty or not, it is still a merit."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud looked at Lin Yuan and said, "What reward do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"Reward?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into deep thought, then said, "Sect Master, I was invaded by demonic qi, and even though I managed to survive, it will be very difficult for me to recover completely. Going forward, I would like to serve as an attendant in the Azure Cloud Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"That's reasonable."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud nodded.</p><p></p><p>Having one's mind and will invaded by demonic qi? With his original strength, surviving was practically a miracle, and it is normal for him to have suffered serious hidden dangers as a result.</p><p></p><p>No matter how one looks at it, Lin Yuan is also a disciple of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, and he promptly reported the matter of Li Qing becoming a demon, so the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud naturally would not treat him poorly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, from now on you will serve as an attendant in the Azure Cloud Pavilion, and you can freely enter and exit all the halls of the Azure Cloud Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Cloud Pavilion contains all the secret cultivation methods and scriptures that have been passed down since the establishment of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, and even has a large number of cultivation methods and scriptures from before the great changes of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan being able to freely enter and exit the Azure Cloud Pavilion will greatly benefit his understanding of this realm, and understanding this realm and comprehending the original cultivation system of this realm can also accumulate a solid foundation for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's one thing you need to pay attention to."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud seemed to have thought of something, looking at Lin Yuan and saying, "Don't spread the matter about Li Qing becoming a demon."</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he suppressed Li Qing, it was completely done in silence, without attracting the attention of any disciples or elders of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Qing was the senior disciple of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, a leading figure among the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>If the news of him becoming a demon were to spread, it would definitely cause an extremely negative impact.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left the main hall and quickly arrived at the Azure Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Cloud Pavilion has eight sub-pavilions, containing a large number of ancient books and scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Disciples of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud who want to enter the Azure Cloud Pavilion to observe are subject to many restrictions and conditions.</p><p></p><p>But as an attendant of the Azure Cloud Pavilion, Lin Yuan naturally can freely browse everything collected in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the matter you reported to the Sect Master was quite important." Elder Fang stood beside him, looking at Lin Yuan with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an attendant in the Azure Cloud Pavilion is not an easy task. The Azure Cloud Pavilion is located deep within the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, and unless the mountain gate is breached by demons, there is no danger here. Serving as an attendant here is leisurely and comfortable, and the treatment is also not low.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the position of attendant in the Azure Cloud Pavilion would be reserved for disciples who have made great contributions to the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Fang, for saving my life." Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You being able to survive has nothing to do with me. I was about to give up on you at the time, haha haha."</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang did not hide the fact that even though Lin Yuan's mind and will were invaded by demonic qi, he was still able to survive, and Elder Fang had almost thought he was mistaken at the time.</p><p></p><p>"But what exactly did you report to the Sect Master? Can you tell me?" Elder Fang was a little curious.</p><p></p><p>"You can just ask the Sect Master if you want to know." Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Li Qing becoming a demon was something the Sect Master of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud had instructed not to spread, so Lin Yuan naturally would not say more.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it." Elder Fang shook his head. "I guess this matter has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>If it was related to him, he should have already known about it by now.</p><p></p><p>"Then you can just serve as an attendant in the Azure Cloud Pavilion. If you're bored, you can come chat with me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Fang finished speaking and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>As an elder of the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, Elder Fang needed to handle the complex treatment of the injuries sustained by the disciples within the sect, especially those related to the Demonic.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Cloud Hall."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered the Azure Cloud Hall, looking at the densely packed jade slips recorded there, and immediately set to work organizing them.</p><p></p><p>While organizing, he was also quickly browsing through them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused on the records before and after the Great Celestial Upheaval.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Great Celestial Upheaval, the cultivators in this world were divided into nine realms of Refining the Dao, six realms of Longevity, three realms of Carefree Existence, and the single realm of Eternal Existence."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly absorbed a large amount of information.</p><p></p><p>According to the descriptions of the power levels of each tier, the nine realms of Refining the Dao should correspond to the first to eleventh levels of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The six realms of Longevity then correspond to the twelfth level of the Dao-Severing Realm up to the Chaotic Realm. Cultivators at this level have eternal lifespans, transcending the limitations of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>As for the three realms of Carefree Existence, they should be the divisions of the Great Saint realm, with the third realm of Carefree Existence corresponding to the pinnacle of Heavenly Sovereigns and invincible Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>And the single realm of Eternal Existence? Likely belonging to the thirteenth level of the Temporal Life.</p><p></p><p>"After the Great Celestial Upheaval, the terrifying 'Demons' appeared."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Demons' are divided into Demonic Spirits, Greater Demons, Source Demons, and Demonic Gods."</p><p></p><p>"Each level of 'Demon' directly corresponds to the peak experts of the corresponding cultivator realm, such as Demonic Spirits being able to rival ninth-realm Refining the Dao cultivators, while Greater Demons possess nearly perfected Chaotic Realm-level power. As for Source Demons? Their power limit is unknown, but every time they appear, they bring the deepest despair to countless lives in this world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned.</p><p></p><p>"And the Demonic Gods? They have never appeared before, but at the very beginning of the Great Celestial Upheaval, when the cultivator forces in this world were at their peak, there were instances of Demonic Gods directly assimilating a large portion of the most powerful cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"According to the speculations of later cultivators, the so-called Demonic Gods are the source of the Great Celestial Upheaval, and also the source of all Demonic Qi in the world. This Demonic Qi originates from the breathing and exhalation of the Demonic Gods, an endless and boundless Demonic presence nurtured by the Demonic Gods' aura."</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan observed the records in the Azure Cloud Hall, the more shocked he became.</p><p></p><p>Demonic Gods?</p><p></p><p>If comparing power levels, wouldn't they be equivalent to the existence of the Eternal Existence realm? That is, the thirteenth level of Temporal Life.</p><p></p><p>But how could a thirteenth-level Temporal Life being become a 'Demon'? Lin Yuan found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>After the Great Celestial Upheaval, the cultivators constantly interacted with the 'Demons' and obtained a lot of information about them.</p><p></p><p>All the 'Demons' act according to their instincts, without any likes or dislikes, without any sense of self, like soulless walking corpses.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why countless living beings have survived to this day, because the Demons have no concept of eradicating the root. They only wander aimlessly in this world, and if they encounter cultivators, they will attack, but if the cultivators stay away, the Demons will continue to wander.</p><p></p><p>And as the Demonic Qi permeates, the number of Demons grows more and more, until the day when they saturate this world.</p><p></p><p>That will be the day when all living beings are exterminated.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Qi."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a deep aura flowed at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>When he first awakened, Lin Yuan had forcefully expelled the Demonic Qi that was invading his spiritual will, and he had deliberately left behind a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had planned to study it carefully, as this Demonic Qi was able to suppress his spiritual will for such a long time, and it was not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>"This power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, the deep aura at his fingertips constantly twisting, trying to continue invading Lin Yuan's physical body, but it was suppressed at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and he dispersed the Demonic Qi on his hand, falling into brief contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Based on his previous observation, the so-called Demonic Qi should be an extremely high-level power, or even a rule.</p><p></p><p>This power rule, due to its peculiar characteristics, is called 'Demon' by the life forms in this world.</p><p></p><p>"This world... is the Source World, it should have given birth to thirteenth-level Temporal Life beings, but where are they? Have they been blocked by the Demonic Gods?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. The Source World realm is extremely high, no less than the Chaotic Void, and as long as the age is old enough, the birth of some Temporal Life beings is quite possible.</p><p></p><p>And in the records collected in the Azure Cloud Hall, the realm of Eternal Existence above the three realms of Carefree Existence corresponds to the thirteenth-level Temporal Life.</p><p></p><p>Meaning that this world does have the existence of Temporal Life beings.</p><p></p><p>But now the 'Demons' are still rampaging, and the Temporal Life beings have not intervened at all.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Gods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought, this is the known source of all Demonic Qi, and even he would feel pressure facing such an existence.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder when I first entered the twelfth realm, wanting to explore the second Source World, the Gate of the Myriad Realms would issue a warning. This Demonic Qi that invades the spiritual will, with my spiritual will at the twelfth realm back then, I might not have been able to resist it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Invasion of the spiritual will is a very serious consequence, and it can even affect the true body in other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Between different dimensions, one can block the karmic killing techniques, but the invasion of the spiritual will involves memories, and as long as Lin Yuan remembers, he will be affected.</p><p></p><p>"Now, no matter how terrifying the Demons are, the focus should be on restoring my strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light sigh. No matter what dangers he faces, strength is the foundation.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's methods, as long as he recovers to his peak state, in this world, as long as the Demonic Gods do not intervene, there should not be too much danger.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 447 - Me Against the Galactic Overlord? (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to arrive at the war base of the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it weren't for his unconscious searching along the way, trying to discover the traces of other Rank 11 alien races and obtain a few more supreme weapons, Lin Yuan would have reached the war base much earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Those Rank 11 alien races have become quite smart as well," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had killed nine Rank 11 members from the Prison Tribe and the Bug Tribe, three of whom were carrying supreme weapons, the peak experts of the various alien races in the core battlefield area had become much more low-key. Not only did they stay away from the regions where Lin Yuan had last appeared, but they also tried their best to avoid fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>Without the spatial fluctuations caused by such battles, Lin Yuan could only detect the traces of alien races within a radius of tens of millions of miles, which was but a drop in the ocean compared to the vast core battlefield area.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll have to find an opportunity to wait until all those Rank 11 alien races gather together, and then make my move," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could he maximize his harvests. If Lin Yuan were to reveal his true strength prematurely, those Rank 11 alien races would probably not dare to gather together, and would instead scatter across the corners of the core battlefield, engaging in guerrilla warfare.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's external strength was not something they could easily contend with. At least the few strongest Rank 11 experts at the peak had the confidence to deal with him. This was the illusion that Lin Yuan had created through his previous actions.</p><p></p><p>Outside the war base of the Human Civilization Alliance, dozens of figures were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>They were all Rank 11 evolutions from the nine major Evolution Towers.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, the Galactic Overlord struck again, killing nine Rank 11 members from the Bug Tribe and the Prison Tribe," one of them said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"That's terrifying. How long has the Galactic Overlord been cultivating?" another exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Galactic Overlord the greatest genius in the history of the Human Civilization? I bet there's no one in the history of the entire universe who can match the Galactic Overlord's talent," a third one commented.</p><p></p><p>The dozens of Rank 11 evolution experts, who were basically all Rank 11 Perfected Evolutions, were discussing in hushed tones. Despite their arrogance, they could only admire the Galactic Overlord's formidable battle achievements.</p><p></p><p>Killing Rank 11 members wielding supreme weapons was a completely different concept from defeating Rank 11 members wielding supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>While there were a few Rank 11 Perfected Evolution experts on the scene who could forcibly kill Rank 11 members wielding supreme weapons with the help of treasures bestowed by the Supremes, the Galactic Overlord had accomplished this feat after cultivating for such a short time.</p><p></p><p>When they were the Galactic Overlord's age, they were still playing at the Rank 5 or Rank 6 level.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Overlord had already been massacring on this vast core battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Just as the many Rank 11 Perfected Evolution experts were quickly exchanging information, a figure silently materialized before them.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Overlord."</p><p>"Greetings, Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>The Rank 11 Perfected Evolution experts immediately looked at Lin Yuan with burning gazes.</p><p></p><p>"Has the war base been set up?" Lin Yuan glanced down at the war base, which had not been arranged by him, but rather entrusted to the Rank 11 Perfected Evolution experts from the various Evolution Towers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as the supreme commander of the Human Civilization Alliance on this battlefield, Lin Yuan had the final control over the super-large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"It's almost done," the leading Rank 11 Perfected Evolution expert, named Xuanyuan You from the Xuanyuan Evolution Tower, replied with a smile. If it weren't for Lin Yuan, he should have been the supreme commander of this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Rank 11 Perfected Evolution experts and said, "I haven't participated in many alien wars. The main problems on the battlefield still rely on you."</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord is being too humble," Xuanyuan You couldn't help but say. "With the Galactic Overlord's strength, you have the ability to influence the outcome of the entire war. We are the ones who should rely on the Galactic Overlord more."</p><p></p><p>"How's the current situation?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, there are rarely any local conflicts on the super-large battlefield. They are all preparing for the full-scale war," Xuanyuan You's face showed a hint of strangeness. "This should be the deterrence of the Galactic Overlord."</p><p></p><p>Normally, the strongest Rank 11 experts of the peak factions, while having the ability to suppress ordinary Rank 11 members wielding supreme weapons, generally would not take action.</p><p></p><p>But because of Lin Yuan, those strongest Rank 11 experts had also started to take action one after another, causing most Rank 11 members to not dare to fight openly on the battlefield, and instead hide in the war base, waiting for the full-scale war to begin.</p><p></p><p>The full-scale war was the decisive battle where the forces of the twelve peak factions gathered the majority of their strength.</p><p></p><p>In the full-scale war, the strongest Rank 11 experts would basically have their peers of the same level to contend with. Ordinary Rank 11 members would also face ordinary Rank 11 members as opponents, without the scene of the strongest Rank 11 experts bullying the ordinary Rank 11 members.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded. No wonder he had barely sensed any fighting fluctuations along the way. It turned out that not only was he taking action, but the strongest Rank 11 experts of the other peak factions were also taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan spoke. "I won't interfere with the specific deployment of the war. When the full-scale war is about to begin, just call me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The deployment of the war? This requires a wealth of experience immersed in war, and even if Lin Yuan has the relevant abilities, he is not willing to waste this time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You and the other eleven-stage perfected ones felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan is extremely dazzling, when it comes to the deployment of war, it is not just about having the cultivation talent, but more about the keen grasp of the war situation.</p><p></p><p>They were really worried that Lin Yuan was too confident and misjudged the war situation, leading to the collapse of the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Appeared at the core position of the battlefield base.</p><p></p><p>This is also the control center of the entire war base.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can freely control every detail of the war base here.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord has already left?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't he want to discuss with us how to deal with the other peak ethnic groups at the eleven-stage?"</p><p></p><p>Dozens of eleven-stage perfected evolution experts looked at each other, this was the first time they had seen such an "indifferent" battlefield commander.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Galactic Lord does not want to interfere with the war deployment, let me arrange it, and when the results are discussed, I will hand it over to the Galactic Lord to decide."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You swept his eyes around, he had a great reputation in the eleven-stage circle of the Human Civilization, and was very persuasive.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's initiative to delegate power, it made him feel very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, whether the opponent is strong or not is not the key factor, but whether the commander can clearly judge the situation.</p><p></p><p>As for this commander Lin Yuan, although he did not make any deployment, he did not interfere randomly, which made Xuanyuan You feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>War base control room.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling it a control room, it would be better to call it a vast heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This war base is essentially a huge twelve-stage fortress, much more important than ordinary super-strong weapons," Lin Yuan controlled the entire war base, with a thoughtful look.</p><p></p><p>Even with the foundation of human civilization, the war base they built was only this one, which shows the terrifying nature of this war base.</p><p></p><p>"The war bases of the other ten peak ethnic group forces are probably about the same."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, to break through such a terrifying war fortress, even if he went all out, it would be difficult to do it in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Well, since they are all hiding in the war bases, then I'll wait until the full-scale war starts to take action."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself, when the full-scale war begins, the vast majority of the eleven-stage aliens will appear on the battlefield, and that will be the best opportunity for Lin Yuan to catch them all.</p><p></p><p>"Now, continue cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked out through the control room at the vast super-large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The entire super-large alien battlefield is essentially built by the many super-strong ones, combining the huge source of spatial-temporal rules.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to observe this super-large battlefield is equivalent to observing the bits and pieces of the spatial-temporal comprehension of these super-strong ones, combined with the secret technique "Tianhe".</p><p></p><p>This will greatly benefit Lin Yuan's spatial-temporal comprehension at the peak of the sixth realm.</p><p></p><p>【Your innate talent is extraordinary, observing the super-large battlefield, your spatial-temporal comprehension has been enhanced】</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many insights about spatial-temporal comprehension surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Space and time are one, where does the concept of fusion come from?"</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend space and time, one cannot do it from the perspective of fusing them, but from the bottom of one's heart, to see space and time as originating from the same source."</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan observed the super-large battlefield, the more his spiritual enlightenment surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of spatial-temporal rules, most of the strong ones focus on the "fusion", but in fact, space and time do not need to be fused, they are originally one.</p><p></p><p>"Tianhe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, and his body surface began to be rippled by the "Tianhe" of space and time. This secret technique explains the essence of the sixth and even seventh realms of spatial-temporal comprehension in the most straightforward and easy-to-understand way.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to comprehend the sixth realm of spatial-temporal comprehension in the boundless void, and the secret technique "Tianhe" played a significant role.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Clan War Base.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng, wearing the Holy Crown of the Angel, sat on the throne, overlooking the many eleven-stage Heavenly Lords below.</p><p></p><p>On the left and right sides of Tian Yu Meng, there were two smaller thrones, occupied by the other two strongest eleven-stage Tian Yu Clan members.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let's discuss how to deal with the Human Civilization Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng looked around and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Civilization can be considered to have the strongest eleven-stage evolution, Xuanyuan You should be one, and that Galactic Lord is probably also counted."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yu Clan's strongest eleven-stage member on the left below, with golden hair.</p><p></p><p>His name is "Qu Li Xiao", a direct bloodline descendant of the second ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Among the many eleven-stage powerhouses in the Tian Yu Clan alliance this time, Qu Li Xiao is absolutely the second strongest eleven-stage after Tian Yu Meng.</p><p></p><p>The treasures he carries, even if not as powerful as Tian Yu Meng's Holy Crown of the Angel, are not to be underestimated, with destructive power exceeding that of super-strong weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan You is the disciple of the Xuanyuan Strongest of the Human Civilization, and the Xuanyuan Strongest has not yet broken through to the ultimate, but has already taken him as a disciple. This time, the Xuanyuan Strongest should have bestowed a treasure, which will not be easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng paused for a moment and continued, "In that case, Xuanyuan You will be handed over to me."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Galactic Lord, he will be handed over to you, 'Qu Li Xiao', to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yu Meng looked at 'Qu Li Xiao' and said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm the one to deal with the Galactic Lord?" Qu Li Xiao's face broke into a smile, and he said confidently, "No problem."</p>

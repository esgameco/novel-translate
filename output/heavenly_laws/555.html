        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the Blazing Sun Divine Body was formed, a large amount of almost instinctive information surged into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness quickly absorbed a large amount of information, which originated from the innate abilities of the divine body, just like how a newborn baby knows how to breathe and open its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Blazing Sun Divine Body?" Lin Yuan was inevitably shocked. He had already sensed the terrifying nature of this constitution during the transformation process.</p><p></p><p>In the many classics and inheritances in the Burning Heaven Institute, there was also a lot of information introduced about the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>But when his own physical body completely transformed into the Blazing Sun Divine Body, Lin Yuan realized that he had still underestimated this kind of divine body.</p><p></p><p>"It's too powerful." Lin Yuan raised his right hand. Although it was still flesh and blood, the most microscopic components were now Blazing Sun particles with profound and mysterious patterns on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Burn everything, devour everything?" Lin Yuan carefully felt the details of the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan condensed the thirtieth thousand Blazing Sun Seed, his spiritual will once entered a scarlet red space, where he glimpsed what seemed to be the figure of the Blazing Sun Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>It had countless appearances, and the image seen by different beings was different.</p><p></p><p>And the Blazing Sun Divine Bodies awakened by different experts also had differences.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun Divine Body, while maintaining the endless burning power, also possessed the power of devouring.</p><p></p><p>Any living or dead thing burned to ashes by Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun Divine Body power would have its essence directly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Even space and time could be burned and turned into the source to replenish Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This devouring and absorption happened in an instant, without the need for any refining time.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, for Lin Yuan at this moment, combat and slaughter were not consumption, but feeding.</p><p></p><p>"This ability..." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, "It's too monstrous, equivalent to a 'perpetual motion machine' without the problem of consumption."</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Chaos Venerable would worry about excessive consumption, and the Chaos Saints were much better in this regard, able to refine Chaos Qi to replenish themselves at any time.</p><p></p><p>But what if there was no Chaos Qi around?</p><p></p><p>The ability of Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun Divine Body was to burn everything and devour everything. Chaos Qi could be burned and devoured, the enemy's killing moves could also be burned and devoured, the visible and invisible, the substantial and illusory, all could be burned and devoured.</p><p></p><p>A flame suddenly ignited on Lin Yuan's fingertips.</p><p></p><p>The flame burned quietly, and the surrounding space began to distort, with cracks appearing. Lin Yuan immediately felt a stream of warmth flowing into his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the feeling of burning and devouring space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked thoughtful, and then consciously extinguished the flame.</p><p></p><p>This ability should still be used cautiously. If not careful, it could lead to the collapse of a large area of space-time, and attract the attention of the upper echelons of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter was definitely not a good thing. If Lin Yuan was allowed to burn freely, the entire Blazing Sun Ancient Country might be burned and devoured.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the territory of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country was vast and boundless. It was unknown how much time it would take to burn and devour such a large area.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the enfeoffed kings and dukes within the ancient country would not just watch Lin Yuan burn and devour, not to mention the Eternal Blazing Sun who reigned supreme in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The most critical point was that the source obtained from the devouring could only replenish the consumption and heal injuries, and had no other great use.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..." Lin Yuan let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>The so-called burning and devouring was just one of the abilities accompanying the Blazing Sun Divine Body. After the Blazing Sun Divine Body transformation was complete, Lin Yuan's physical strength and body toughness had increased by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of direct combat and killing, I should not be weaker than the true body of a Chaos Void Venerable, and even if it comes to a stalemate, I should be the one to win in the end."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself. The Blazing Sun Divine Body he had awakened, with its accompanying burning and devouring abilities, was absolutely invincible in a stalemate battle.</p><p></p><p>Want to compete in consumption? Even the Saints might not be stronger than Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Become the Blazing Sun! Become the Blazing Sun!" Lin Yuan felt the details of the divine body. The Blazing Sun Divine Body awakened by each expert had differences, but they all had one common ability.</p><p></p><p>That was - to become the Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>This was also the ultimate killing move of the Blazing Sun Divine Body. Once activated, the physical body would completely transform, becoming a miniature Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they could borrow a tiny bit of the power of the Eternal Blazing Sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this ultimate killing move would impose an extremely heavy burden on the foundation of the Blazing Sun Divine Body. It should not be used unless it was the last resort.</p><p></p><p>Activating it once would require at least hundreds of thousands or millions of years to recover.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Divine Body I have awakened has a much stronger enhancement to my physical body compared to other Blazing Sun Divine Bodies."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. As the strongest divine body in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, there were naturally many introductions and descriptions about the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also knew about the self-enhancement of other experts after awakening the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>The improvement was far lower than his own.</p><p></p><p>"It's the influence of the Blazing Sun Seeds." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even when the Blazing Sun Divine Body was still in the transformation stage, Lin Yuan had noticed that the number of Blazing Sun Seeds had a driving effect on the body's transformation.</p><p></p><p>Now it was confirmed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the more Blazing Sun Seeds one condenses, the higher the power of the awakened Blazing Sun Divine Body. This was no secret among the great experts of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>But knowing it was one thing, being able to do it was another.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Divine Body..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the details of the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>The source world's clone shared the same consciousness with him, so Lin Yuan could observe this divine body from the most comprehensive angles.</p><p></p><p>"It seems very difficult to replicate this constitution."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Body was too complex. The most microscopic components, those flame particles with countless profound and mysterious patterns on the surface, gave Lin Yuan a feeling of facing a boundless universe.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Body of the source world was a natural transformation.</p><p></p><p>According to the cycle formed by the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Blazing Sun Seeds, the physical body was slowly transformed, and finally the Blazing Sun Divine Body was awakened.</p><p></p><p>But in the Chaos Void, the Blazing Sun Seeds were useless. So to replicate a Blazing Sun Divine Body here, he must comprehend the most microscopic details of every flame particle.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. Relying on his extraordinary perceptiveness, comprehending the essence of the Blazing Sun Divine Body was indeed difficult, but not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's attempt to comprehend the Blazing Sun Divine Body was not to replicate a Blazing Sun Divine Body in the Chaos Void, but rather out of curiosity about the microscopic particle composition of the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>It might involve another great Dao, a Heavenly Dao no less than the Infinite Void Inheritance of the Thirteen Realms.</p><p></p><p>Once he could comprehend it, he could easily extend it to create many other constitutions not inferior to the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>He could reach unimaginable heights in the realm of physical body and constitution.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Burning City, the powerful experts from the Purple Dream Domain gathered.</p><p></p><p>"We've finally infiltrated in."</p><p></p><p>A thin-looking man spoke with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>They were now inside the Blue Burning City. If discovered, they would be doomed without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>A single thought from the Blue Burning Marquis could completely erase them.</p><p></p><p>"We've used secret treasures to completely suppress our auras. As long as the Blue Burning Marquis doesn't specifically look at us, he won't notice us."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>As the domain city, the Blue Burning City had countless experts coming and going. How could the Blue Burning Marquis possibly inspect every single being that entered the city?</p><p></p><p>"If the Blue Burning City hadn't set up a special array to detect the mass and weight of life forms, we wouldn't have had such a hard time infiltrating."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from the Purple Dream Domain who had infiltrated the Blue Burning City this time were only twelve in number. Any more would easily trigger the alert of the array detecting the mass and weight of life forms, and then attract the attention of the Blue Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Life forms had mass and weight, and while auras could be suppressed, the mass of life could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>As a domain city, occasionally having a dozen or so Sovereign Realm life forms enter was not unusual.</p><p></p><p>But any more than that would be abnormal.</p><p></p><p>For example, sending fifty or a hundred Sovereign Realm experts? As long as the total mass of life forms in the Blue Burning City reached the alert level, the Blue Burning Marquis would thoroughly investigate the entire city, even if he hadn't detected any anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Once the investigation began, the Blue Burning City would enter a state of full defense. At that time, with the Blue Burning Marquis on guard, the Purple Dream Lord might not necessarily succeed.</p><p></p><p>"This mission is very important. We must use the Myriad Array Crystal to replicate all the formations in the Blue Burning City. We cannot fail."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman spoke solemnly. If this plan failed, their future attempts might be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To attack the Qingfan Domain would require an extremely brutal price.</p><p></p><p>There was no guarantee they would even be able to take it down in the end.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The rest of them nodded, they also knew how important the task they were about to undertake was.</p><p></p><p>They even carried the precious Myriad Formation Crystal on them, to use it to replicate the formations.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Formation Crystal was refined by the ancient country's formation masters, its value immeasurable. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>They would not have mobilized it if it did not involve planning at the level of the ancient country.</p><p></p><p>"Senior sister, what's next?"</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked woman looked at the purple-haired woman and asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman said.</p><p></p><p>"Wait?"</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for the master to make a move and hold the Qingfan Marquis, then we'll act according to the plan."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman's tone was very calm. If the Qingfan Marquis still had the strength to retaliate, they wouldn't dare to reveal their presence, let alone use the Myriad Formation Crystal to replicate the formations.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded.</p><p></p><p>Before infiltrating the Qingfan City, they didn't know how the plan would unfold, only after coming in did they learn the subsequent steps from the purple-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>"I hope everything goes smoothly."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>If they could successfully replicate the Qingfan City formations, she would have made a great contribution, and with the ancient country's reward, she might be able to completely step into the Supremacy realm.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was at the peak of the Dominator realm, with one foot already in the Supremacy realm.</p><p></p><p>She was very clear about the gap between Supremacies and the strong ones below them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the more than ten Dreamland Domain experts who infiltrated were mostly at the half-step Supremacy level.</p><p></p><p>Given the numerical limitation, the stronger the Dominators who infiltrated, the better.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis, who was in seclusion cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a figure in a purple dress had silently materialized.</p><p></p><p>"Dreamland." The Qingfan Marquis looked at the woman in the purple dress and smiled, "Why have you only sent a projection here?"</p><p></p><p>If the woman in the purple dress was the true body, the Qingfan Marquis wouldn't have wasted words, he would have directly activated the Qingfan City formation to suppress her.</p><p></p><p>Capturing an enemy country's marquis would be a great merit. Even if they couldn't capture him alive, killing or severely injuring him would still greatly benefit the Qingfan Marquis.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis could clearly feel that the Dreamland Marquis in front of him was just a projection.</p><p></p><p>"For me, the projection and the true body are not much different." The Dreamland Marquis said mildly, the path she walked was that of the spiritual realm, she was not proficient in the physical aspect.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a projection, as long as her mental will was strong enough, she could still display terrifying combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Just a projection, how much mental will could it contain? How powerful could the secret techniques it unleashes be?" The Qingfan Marquis did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Qingfan, I spent thirty thousand years weaving a beautiful dream just for you, come in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>The woman in the purple dress's voice echoed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis immediately sensed his consciousness beginning to fall.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"Your projection actually contains the essence of your true body? How could you bear to do that?" The Qingfan Marquis glared, struggling to stay awake.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, layers of spatial mazes began to appear around him, as the place he was in seclusion cultivation was also the core of the Qingfan City formation, with just a thought he could mobilize the power of the formation to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>"Dreamland, you can only hold me for a hundred breaths at most." The Qingfan Marquis stared at the Dreamland Marquis, his mental will rapidly falling.</p><p></p><p>Before completely falling into slumber, the Qingfan Marquis had already conveyed messages to many of his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred breaths is already enough."</p><p></p><p>The Dreamland Marquis looked at the sleeping Qingfan Marquis.</p><p></p><p>She had paid a heavy price to hold the Qingfan Marquis for a hundred breaths, but it was not to kill him.</p><p></p><p>That was unrealistic, with the Qingfan City formation protecting him, not to mention her being just a projection, even if seven or eight Supremacy peak experts came, they would still find it difficult to touch the Qingfan Marquis within a hundred breaths, let alone kill him.</p><p></p><p>And even if the Qingfan Marquis was killed, he must have life-saving methods and would not truly die.</p><p></p><p>The significance would not be great.</p><p></p><p>The Dreamland Marquis' real trump card was the disciples who had already infiltrated the Qingfan City, carrying the Myriad Formation Crystal.</p><p></p><p>With the Qingfan Marquis' consciousness falling into slumber, not only the true body's consciousness, but also the projection's consciousness had all fallen into slumber.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the Qingfan City would be headless, a hundred breaths would be enough for the Myriad Formation Crystal to replicate the formations within the Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>Before falling into slumber, the Qingfan Marquis had already conveyed messages to many of his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis ordered us to immediately go to the formation core and guard it?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing and other Dominator realm experts received the Qingfan Marquis' message, although they were quite puzzled, they didn't hesitate and immediately acted according to the plan.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Qingfan Marquis had vaguely sensed something was wrong, so he had already informed Feng Wanxing and the others that if anything unexpected happened, they only needed to guard the formation core areas, and not worry about other places in the city.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingfan Marquis' estimation, even if the Dreamland Marquis made a move, her goal would be to destroy the formation core of the Qingfan City. As long as they guarded the formation core, the Qingfan City's formation would be fine, and the Dreamland Domain's plotting would naturally be thwarted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The master told me not to go out?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also received the Qingfan Marquis' final message, "The tone was very urgent, something must have happened."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his mind, and then looked outside the Fengtianhall, "Since the master told me not to go out, then I definitely won't go out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actively activated the formations around the Fengtianhall, which were usually hidden, but would be triggered when a crisis came. Lin Yuan, to be on the safe side, maintained the formations at their highest defensive strength.</p><p></p><p>This state consumed a lot, but after speculating that something had happened to the Qingfan Marquis, Lin Yuan didn't care about the consumption.</p><p></p><p>"The master has successfully held the Qingfan Marquis."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman received the message, a hint of joy appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>The key to the Dreamland Domain's plotting this time was whether the Qingfan Marquis could be held.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't be held, then everything would be in vain, they wouldn't dare to show their heads and would be killed.</p><p></p><p>"Only seventy breaths left."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman looked at the others behind her.</p><p></p><p>The Dreamland Marquis was confident in holding the Qingfan Marquis for more than a hundred breaths, but they needed to reserve enough time for their own retreat from the Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman waved her hand, and suddenly hundreds of massive figures appeared, all of them were peak Dominator realm puppets, without any life aura, so they could evade the Qingfan City formation's detection.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of peak Dominator realm puppets immediately began to create chaos in the Qingfan City, attracting attention on the surface.</p><p></p><p>As for the purple-haired woman and the others, they concealed their presence and, holding the Myriad Formation Crystal, began to secretly replicate the Qingfan City formation.</p><p></p><p>At a core location of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman and the others appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingfan Marquis' disciples are guarding inside." The purple-haired woman smiled slightly, "This Qingfan Marquis, worthy of being the Supremacy peak who has fought with my Dreamland Domain for years, his consideration is very comprehensive, he must have anticipated that our target is the formation core of the city."</p><p></p><p>The other experts also had smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis had just been held, and his disciples had already entered the formation core to guard it, obviously it was a pre-arranged deployment.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately for them, they had the Myriad Formation Crystal, so they didn't need to break the formation core, they only needed to replicate it from a distance, and then have the ancient country's formation masters decipher it when they brought it back.</p><p></p><p>Directly attacking the formation core was much more difficult than silently replicating it.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman and the others spent three breaths of time, using the Myriad Formation Crystal to completely replicate this formation core, and then quietly left.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the process, the Qingfan Marquis' disciples guarding the formation core never discovered the purple-haired woman and the others.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, twenty breaths had gone by.</p><p></p><p>"We have replicated six formation cores."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was very satisfied, everything was going smoothly, the hundreds of peak Dominator realm puppets had attracted the attention of the entire Qingfan City on the surface.</p><p></p><p>They had encountered no obstacles on their way.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan City had a total of twelve formation cores, and now they had replicated nine of them, using only twenty breaths, which was more than enough time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the next formation core."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman and the others immediately headed towards the next target.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

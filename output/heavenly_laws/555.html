        <h1>Chapter 555</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems he is in the Yunxue City, so I can go visit him once or twice," sighed the Master of the Academy.</p><p></p><p>In compiling the "Outline of the Realm History", he had seen all kinds of people, both ordinary mortals and heroes.</p><p></p><p>He wrote the songs of the common people, and also compiled biographies for the heroes.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, those who dared to draw their swords against the Mysterious Deity with Dark Pupils in the Kuijin Realm were the true heroes.</p><p></p><p>The young lady stood behind him, her eyes full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three thousand miles away, the Qihuan loomed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was covered in white hair, with curved ram-like horns on its head, its aura extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Beside it stood the tall Dark Pupil, his expression cold as he gazed at his own corpse miles away, his eyes profound.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Dark Pupil, you are a bit too useless, to be slain by a mere human, and have your corpse erected to scare us!" the Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>The other Mysterious Deities all had solemn expressions. Their strengths were comparable to Dark Pupil's.</p><p></p><p>The easy slaying of Dark Pupil meant that the white-haired man could also slay them.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the Lord Qihuan reviving you, you would have stood forever in Yunxue City, becoming a famous... scenic spot," the Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity spoke.</p><p></p><p>When mentioning Qihuan, the Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity showed respect and awe.</p><p></p><p>Unlike these Mysterious Deities, Qihuan was a second-generation Mysterious Deity, hailing from the Black Sky Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Dark Pupil was slain by a human, this is a disgrace to us Mysterious Deities! I wish to go and slay that human, please wait a moment, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>The Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity spoke, wishing to demonstrate his abilities before the Lord Qihuan.</p><p></p><p>His strength was indeed formidable, ranking among the top ten in the Kuijin Realm, a Great Venerable-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Dark Pupil, bearing this humiliation, dared not refute, for the Dual-Headed Snake's strength was truly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"If the Snake Deity goes, won't it be an easy victory?"</p><p></p><p>"Daring to cause trouble in the Kuijin Realm, this is courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Deities present spoke, their expressions calm, even fawning a bit towards the Dual-Headed Snake Deity.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Dual-Headed Snake Deity went, even if Qi Yuan was strong, he would likely not be a match.</p><p></p><p>The Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity enjoyed the flattery, looking towards Lord Qihuan, waiting for his nod to head to Yunxue City and slay Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qihuan's lips curled into a smile: "Interesting, is this the Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate?"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan's words were puzzling, and the surrounding Mysterious Deities did not quite understand the meaning behind them.</p><p></p><p>Then Qihuan said, "If I were to agree to you going, without a doubt, your fate would be no different from Dark Pupil's.</p><p></p><p>And then, it would probably be the one you don't get along with, Kai Chi, who will go to claim the merit, and then continue to be slain!"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan spoke lazily, with a carefree smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Kuijin Realm had been occupied by the Mysterious Deities, the world still belonged to the Divine Wood Universe, and the will would naturally favor the Mandate Holder.</p><p></p><p>Correspondingly, the enemies of the Mandate Holder would, for inexplicable reasons, encounter troubles or lose their wits.</p><p></p><p>The Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity's face stiffened, and he was somewhat dissatisfied: "Although he slew Dark Pupil, he is not yet at the Great Venerable realm, I can easily slay him!"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan smiled: "Who said he is only a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he is a Great Venerable?" The other Mysterious Deities' expressions became grave.</p><p></p><p>If he was a Great Venerable, the Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity might indeed fail.</p><p></p><p>"He is not only a Great Venerable, but also not an ordinary Great Venerable." Qihuan's eyes flashed with a greedy look, "He is a... Withered Mythical Deity."</p><p></p><p>"What... Mythical Deity?"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a Mythical Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Mysterious Deities present were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Mythical Deities and ordinary Yin Deities were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if a Mythical Deity acted, all ninety-nine Mysterious Deities in the Kuijin Realm would die.</p><p></p><p>Some of these Mysterious Deities even wanted to leave immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, one of my uncles wished to step into the Yang Deity realm, and encountered this person... outside the realm. The two collided."</p><p></p><p>Qihuan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"The result, of course, was that my uncle failed, and after returning, he sat in meditation for a millennium, and stepped into the Yang Deity realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Qihuan mention his uncle, the Mysterious Deities present all had an awe-filled expression.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan had quite a few uncles.</p><p></p><p>The rumors said... there was even an uncle at the second layer of the Yang Deity realm, and it was said that this was not the strongest one.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan often mentioned his uncles, each one making these Mysterious Deities revere him.</p><p></p><p>"As for him, the Withered Mythical Deity, he's probably not much stronger than the Stepping Heaven Six Steps, weaker than a true Mythical Deity," Qihuan said.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his uncle, he wouldn't have recognized Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, if we all join forces, even if we subdue him, the casualties would be severe. Please, Lord Qihuan, seek aid from the Black Sky Black Earth, only a Mythical Deity expert can slay this prey!" the Dual-Headed Snake Mysterious Deity said, feeling a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>If he went, he would truly die.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan smiled: "You see, this is the Mandate Holder, blessed by the Mandate. If it weren't for my formidable uncles, perhaps the Kuijin Realm would have been in peril today.</p><p></p><p>The Mandate may affect you, but it cannot affect me."</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was full of confidence, his eyes flashing with a greedy look: "Why bother asking the Mythical Deity experts? We are enough to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>As a Stepping Heaven Six Steps Great Venerable, Qihuan was very interested in Qi Yuan's physique.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Black Sky Black Earth was quite peculiar, and if he could obtain the physique of a powerful cultivator, it could greatly shorten his cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>If he were to slay Qi Yuan and obtain his corpse, he could leap into the peak of the Stepping Heaven Seven Steps realm.</p><p></p><p>This would save him tens of thousands of years of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So he did not want to ask the Mythical Deity to intervene.</p><p></p><p>With a Mythical Deity's involvement, Qi Yuan's corpse would be out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan chose to act himself.</p><p></p><p>"We... " Kai Chi's expression was troubled, "Even if he is a Withered Mythical Deity, it would be difficult for us to slay him. Even if we did, it would require a huge price!"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat afraid.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was unconcerned: "My uncle gave me Mysterious Source, why should I fear death? Even if we die, we will revive like Dark Pupil."</p><p></p><p>He had high-grade Mysterious Source.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Black Sky Black Earth were constantly replenishing it.</p><p></p><p>Yang Deities who died could be revived by consuming Mysterious Source.</p><p></p><p>Dark Pupil had also been revived by Qihuan.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, we'll fearlessly join forces to slay him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even if he is incredibly strong, we can all self-destruct and exhaust him to death!"</p><p></p><p>"What if... he is not a Withered Mythical Deity?"</p><p></p><p>Qihuan's expression was calm: "Don't worry, my Mysterious Source is quite abundant."</p><p></p><p>It was not just "quite abundant", it was extremely abundant.</p><p></p><p>Enough to support the revival of Realm Lord-level Yang Deities.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had quite a few uncles.</p><p></p><p>And he was also the sole heir of their family.</p><p></p><p>The other Mysterious Deities, hearing this, heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>With abundant Mysterious Source, the problem was not that big.</p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent was a Perfect Mythical Deity, they could self-destruct a few times, and the opponent would likely perish.</p><p></p><p>Qihuan was very confident. Even if there was a one-in-a-million chance that the opponent's mini-universe would explode, blessed by the Mandate and break through to the Ancestral Deity realm.</p><p></p><p>Without the Divine Wood's blessing, even a Ancestral Deity, a super Mythical Deity, they would continue to self-destruct and kill.</p><p></p><p>"The only concern is, what if he tries to flee, and we cannot stop him?" Kai Chi Mysterious Deity said.</p><p></p><p>With the Mysterious Source as a backup, they could slay Qi Yuan, but if Qi Yuan tried to flee, they would have difficulty stopping him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, since I've chosen to act, I naturally have the means to ensure he cannot escape." Qihuan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>He had a treasure that could create its own world.</p><p></p><p>They would enter the treasure, and suck Qi Yuan in, he would have no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they could not leave the treasure until they had slain Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Finally, two days of peace."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>The progress of his Becoming Mortal had finally increased by 1%.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had lived very leisurely.</p><p></p><p>On the rebel side, it seems they had guessed through the "Becoming Mortal" that Qi Yuan was the one who slew the Dark Pupil Mysterious Deity, and they did not dare to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Lian, she was still staying next door and had not left. </p><p></p><p>"Master, it's strange, the Blood Tiger Gang hasn't come these past few days," Zhao Yan said curiously as he looked at Qi Yuan basking in the sun.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he had been on tenterhooks, afraid that the Blood Tiger Gang would come looking for trouble, and he hadn't even gone out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Hong Mei's face broke into a radiant smile: "Perhaps it's because of my senior brother." </p><p></p><p>Her senior brother was also nearby, and she had told him about offending the Blood Tiger Gang. Given her senior brother's personality, he might have stepped in to help her deal with the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Hearing this, Zhao Yan's face showed a grateful expression. </p><p></p><p>His affection for Hong Mei increased again.</p><p></p><p>"Master... shall we move our nest?" Zhao Yan asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He had mentioned joining the Academy to his master more than once.</p><p></p><p>But the master was just an old stubborn, and he was completely unwilling to go.</p><p></p><p>"You move if you want to!" Qi Yuan glanced at Zhao Yan.</p><p></p><p>He was already deeply immersed in playing the role of the mundane Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after killing all those troublemakers, his mundane transformation was much faster.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>She didn't try to persuade him again, after all, she couldn't guarantee that she could get Qi Yuan to join the Academy.</p><p></p><p>After all, joining the Academy was very difficult, requiring the testing of knowledge, temperament, and talent, etc.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhao Yan's expression was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a rhythmic knocking sound came at the door.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Gang?</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei's face also showed a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hoarse, refined voice came.</p><p></p><p>"May this old man have the opportunity to pay his respects to the master of the courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>The voice was so refined that just by listening to it, Zhao Yan felt as if he was bathing in a sea of books.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei's body trembled, and her face showed an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>Because this voice... was so familiar.</p><p></p><p>He... how could he have come?</p><p></p><p>"No need to see him," Qi Yuan lying on the recliner directly refused.</p><p></p><p>"What? Can't you see he's in mundane form?" Hong Mei was stunned, and she hurriedly said, "Senior, outside is... the head of the Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was also stunned when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>Such a great figure as the head of the Academy would actually come to visit the master here?</p><p></p><p>"A special NPC?" Qi Yuan paused, "Does he know a lot of information?"</p><p></p><p>"No one in the Kuijin Realm knows more than him!" Hong Mei said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let him in," Qi Yuan changed his mind.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the white moonlight, he liked the most the kind of NPC who could explain things.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the background of the world and the plot was the key to pushing the game forward.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan hadn't moved yet, but Hong Mei hurriedly went to open the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>When she saw the hunchbacked old man, Hong Mei's face showed a deep sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked old man had white hair and beard, and his hunched back made him look only about 1.6 meters tall, no different from an ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>But his long robe was neatly dressed, washed white, and meticulous.</p><p></p><p>One look and he had a scholarly air about him.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei was inwardly excited! This was really the head of the Academy! Qi Yuan glanced at the hunchbacked old man, his face showing a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Because the hidden information he saw with his eyes showed that this old man was not an ordinary NPC.</p><p></p><p>He was very extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of saying... he might not even be in a living state anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, are you writing a book?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that Xianling Yingjun had once said that he was helping an old gentleman collect some information.</p><p></p><p>Could it be him?</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy nodded: "Does the gentleman know me?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei, who saw this scene, was puzzled. Why did the head of the Academy have such an attitude towards Qi Yuan?</p><p></p><p>And he called him "gentleman"? </p><p></p><p>Normally, they would call him "old sir" or "young man".</p><p></p><p>The term "gentleman" was very rare.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Qi Yuan had a special identity.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a bit about you. I'd like to ask you a few questions," Qi Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy's face broke into a smile: "Before the gentleman asks, may this old man ask the gentleman a few questions?"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Qi Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei immediately perked up her ears and listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>"The gentleman resides in a humble room, hiding in the market, why did he suddenly slay the Ominous Deity with the Dark Eyes?" The head of the Academy looked curiously at Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Red Mei and Zhao Yan were as shocked as if the sky had cracked open.</p><p></p><p>The Ominous Deity with the Dark Eyes was slain? </p><p></p><p>Slain by Qi Yuan!</p><p></p><p>"Because... I'm in mundane form," Qi Yuan answered honestly. "I originally wanted to cultivate in peace, but every day there were people coming to disturb me, making me irritable and unable to focus. I had no choice but to kill the strongest one in Cloud Blood City, the one with the Dark Eyes, so that I could have some peace and quiet without anyone disturbing me."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan: "???"</p><p></p><p>Hong Mei: "???"</p><p></p><p>To avoid being disturbed, he slew the Deity?</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy was also somewhat surprised, not expecting such an answer.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, but can the gentleman not have considered that after slaying the Deity, there will be a second Deity coming, and the gentleman may find it difficult to enjoy a moment of peace in this chaotic area."</p><p></p><p>"Since he's come, I'll just kill them all, then I guess no one will be able to disturb me anymore," Qi Yuan answered casually.</p><p></p><p>This was his simple and crude yet meticulous plan.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy paused, then slowly said, "The Deities are endless. Even if the gentleman kills all the Deities in the Kuijin Realm, there may be even stronger Deities descending. The gentleman is alone here, I'm afraid he won't be able to withstand it alone, without any support."</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to seek help? I clearly have the advantage!" Qi Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of strong opponents, he was just afraid they weren't strong enough.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy paused again, his curiosity even greater: "The gentleman is very interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you should have finished your questions. Now it's my turn to ask you questions," Qi Yuan looked at the head of the Academy. "The first question is... do you know what's inside the Godly Wood Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy furrowed his brows, not expecting someone to ask this question.</p><p></p><p>"This old man has never been to the Godly Wood Abyss, but I've heard some Mandate Holders say that it's empty inside, with nothing there," the head of the Academy answered.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan fell silent for a moment, then continued to ask, "The second question, what are the Black Heavens, are they very strong?"</p><p></p><p>This was also what Qi Yuan was concerned about.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was practically a shareholder in this game, he couldn't let others take it over.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy fell even more silent, not expecting Qi Yuan to ask about this.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the Black Heavens, I'm afraid no one in this world knows their origins.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the entire Godly Wood Universe joined forces, cooperating with a Void Traveler, to have that Void Traveler inquire the Mighty Void Realm Lord about the origins of the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord told the truth, but that Void Traveler couldn't remember any information about the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>So, regarding the Black Heavens, perhaps no one knows. Even if someone knows, if they don't have the strength to reach the level of the Void Realm Lord, they probably won't be able to remember it."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>This Black Heavens... seems to have some abilities.</p><p></p><p>"The third question, are the Black Heavens and Black Divinities very strong? Do they also have Realm Lords?"</p><p></p><p>The head of the Academy was a bit puzzled, this Qi Yuan was a bit different from his imagination, but he still answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"There are only Realm Lords at the Rule Level, the number unknown," the head of the Academy told Qi Yuan the information he knew. "The Black Heavens and Black Divinities are extremely strong, terrifyingly strong, making people feel hopeless, because their strength... is endless.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Black Heavens exist, no matter how many Black Divinities die, they can be revived."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, a trace of bitterness appeared on the old man's aged face.</p><p></p><p>Killed but can be revived, and their strength is even stronger than yours, what kind of enemy is this... How many powerhouses of the Godly Wood Universe have died in battle, yet they have never truly killed a single Black Divinity Celestial!"</p><p></p><p>"They revive after being killed?" Qi Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean it's an endless source of experience?</p><p></p><p>This is not a great enemy at all!</p><p></p><p>This is clearly... an ultimate, delicious white moonlight!</p><p></p><p>A white moonlight that constantly respawns at the reset point!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

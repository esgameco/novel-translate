            <p>Chapter 238: Special Life Races (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Alright. ‚ôôüí£Ôºñ‚ûàÔº≥ùì±ÔΩïùîµ.ùí∏ùëú‚ìú‚ô¶üêü"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to tell me about your conversation with the strongest one."</p><p></p><p>"This time I called you here to consider your future position in the star domain."</p><p></p><p>The Chihu Star Lord looked down at Lin Yuan and spoke.</p><p></p><p>As a teacher, when a disciple is about to travel far away to guard a distant star domain, naturally he can't do nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is far greater than your senior brother's, so I'm not worried about that." A smile appeared on the Chihu Star Lord's face.</p><p></p><p>There are not many in the entire Annan Star Alliance who can enter the eighth stage and possess strength close to the late or peak eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>If the condition of being under a hundred years old is added, there are only a few in the entire Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Chihu Star Lord did not know that Lin Yuan's true mental age was over a thousand years old, but he also did not know that the evolutionary path Lin Yuan took was one he pioneered from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Compared to being a thousand years old, pioneering a martial arts evolutionary path was even more unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Xia Qin Evolver even determined Lin Yuan to be one of the top twenty or top ten geniuses in human civilization history.</p><p></p><p>"But in an unfamiliar star domain, strength alone may not be enough. You also need to be able to trust your subordinates." The Chihu Star Lord's thoughts stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>One of these figures had dark red skin, while the other had pointed ears and emerald green eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were clearly not human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The two figures bowed slightly to the Chihu Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you will follow my disciple." The Chihu Star Lord pointed to Lin Yuan and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The two figures walked up to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"They are?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Sensing them up close, both figures were eighth stage powerhouses, and not just newly entered early eighth stage ones.</p><p></p><p>"These two are my servants. They are not human evolvers. One is called Red Skin, mid eighth stage, and the other is called Green Eyes, late eighth stage."</p><p></p><p>"There are no issues with their loyalty."</p><p></p><p>"With them assisting you, at least you won't be stretched thin in the frontier star domains." The Chihu Star Lord said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, this is too precious."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>To have two loyal eighth stage alien races under his command, this was simply...</p><p></p><p>But in reality, the value of a living eighth stage alien race far exceeded a million merit points. If an eighth stage alien race stayed on the alien battlefield for a long time, over hundreds of thousands of years, they could also accumulate a million merit points.</p><p></p><p>This didn't even include other income and gains.</p><p></p><p>"What are you being polite with me for?"</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, do you think I have any use for them?"</p><p></p><p>The Chihu Star Lord glared at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Chihu Star Lord was invincible at the eighth stage and indeed had no use for mid to late eighth stage subordinates.</p><p></p><p>But having no use didn't mean they had no value. Just casually placing these two eighth stage alien races on the battlefield could earn the Chihu Star Lord vast wealth every period of time.</p><p></p><p>Letting two eighth stage alien races work for him, this was an extremely luxurious thing.</p><p></p><p>"No more buts."</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm telling you to accept them, just accept them."</p><p></p><p>The Chihu Star Lord waved his hand and said, "Go back. If you have any issues, just contact me in the virtual world."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Teacher."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan bowed solemnly to the Chihu Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had a Yin avatar and Yang avatar, the Yin avatar needed to accelerate the accumulation of origin force for breaking through under the permanent spatial rift of the alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Yang avatar was left on the Chihu main star for safekeeping.</p><p></p><p>Relying on just his true body, many things would be rather inconvenient in the frontier star domains.</p><p></p><p>But with these two eighth stage subordinates, it would be different. Many things could be handled just by instructing them.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen Mountain Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The two eighth stage alien races, Red Skin and Green Eyes, stood before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Introduce yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The alien race with dark red skin spoke.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is at the mid eighth stage. I cultivate the laws of fire and space, and my inner world spans 9,800 li."</p><p></p><p>Red Skin quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master, I am Green Eyes."</p><p></p><p>The alien race with emerald green eyes beside him continued, "I am at the late eighth stage, skilled in the laws of life. My inner world spans 32,000 li."</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master, if you suffer any injuries, as long as your soul hasn't completely collapsed, I can't say I can bring you back, but I can at least keep you from dying for a short time."</p><p></p><p>Green Eyes spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Laws of life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave Green Eyes an extra look.</p><p></p><p>The laws of life, along with the laws of space and time, were one of the pillar laws of the universe and stars.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the laws of life was only slightly better than entry-level.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You two can stay in my inner world for now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the two alien races and with a thought, took them into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In the inner world, Lin Yuan was equivalent to the creation deity and could easily mobilize the power of an entire world.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher really helped me out a lot this time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of Red Skin and Green Eyes, Lin Yuan felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>To establish a star domain and govern billions of citizens involved many aspects. Having two capable helpers would save him countless worries.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Class A cosmic ship you ordered has arrived." The voice of the intelligent assistant sounded by Lin Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"The ship is here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The wormhole jumps he had been doing couldn't compare to those Class B and Class A cosmic ships in terms of jump distance and cooldown time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, back then Lin Yuan didn't care much about ship performance, as it was his Yin and Yang avatars riding the ships.</p><p></p><p>As long as it could be used for travel, it was fine.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan was about to head to the frontier star domains, and it was his true body going. This required a high-quality cosmic ship.</p><p></p><p>This type of cosmic ship not only had powerful advantages in speed, but was also extremely effective for escaping and preserving one's life.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the hall and immediately saw a black ship parked there.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, this ship looked no different from those standard ships, but the aura fluctuations it contained were faintly shaking the air.</p><p></p><p>The ship was only 500 meters in size, with patterns faintly engraved on the surface. These patterns were manifestations of the essence of laws and could make the ship faster and more easily perform wormhole jumps.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was delighted. This ship was entirely cast from red copper gold, and ordinary eighth stage powerhouses' attacks basically couldn't break through its defenses.</p><p></p><p>From activation to performing a wormhole jump at top speed only required twelve seconds.</p><p></p><p>"8,000 cubic universe crystals..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the value of this cosmic ship, Lin Yuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>As the lord of a star domain, he couldn't be flying around in those standard ships. A Class A cosmic ship was enough for Lin Yuan to use for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, using spaceships for travel is the most common choice. Even those ninth-stage evolutionaries who have comprehended the complete core spatial model and mastered the art of large-scale teleportation will basically use spaceships to travel if there is no urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>The art of large-scale teleportation requires the evolutionary to integrate into the rules of space and instantly cross hundreds or thousands of light-years along the spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>It is extremely exhausting for the mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Generally, ninth-stage evolutionaries can't use it for a long time before needing to rest.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-stage evolutionaries cannot do what Nalan Vice Tower Master did, crossing countless light-years in half a month to deliver the Spirit-Calming Pearl to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the A-grade universe spaceship and returned to the grand hall again.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to set off," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Shen."</p><p></p><p>Condensing into substance, Yang Shen and Lin Yuan looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you will be stationed here," Lin Yuan instructed Yang Shen.</p><p></p><p>"And this drop of essence blood," Lin Yuan left a drop of his essence blood.</p><p></p><p>The physical divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood" allowed Lin Yuan to fully control every drop of his essence blood, because the essence blood contained fragments of his soul and true spirit consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Which treasures should I bring with me to the Milky Way Star Domain?" Lin Yuan began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The first was the "Spirit-Calming Pearl" bestowed by Xia Qin, the supreme powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>This treasure was Lin Yuan's biggest trump card for survival in front of the supreme powerhouse, and he definitely had to carry it with him.</p><p></p><p>"The eighth-stage soul defense treasure, the Water Droplet."</p><p></p><p>"And that eighth-stage armor."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Lin Yuan also took these two items.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had always attached great importance to soul defense.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Essence Metal."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, a "bell-shaped" weapon appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This "bell-shaped" weapon was only the size of a palm, but the aura it vaguely emitted was even stronger than that eighth-stage soul defense treasure.</p><p></p><p>"I won't bring this one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that he had just advanced to the eighth stage, and the Origin Essence Metal needed time to nurture in order to keep up with Lin Yuan's realm and strength.</p><p></p><p>The second reason was that with the eighth-stage soul defense treasure, the eighth-stage armor, and the "Demon Jade Mark" blessing, Lin Yuan believed that his defense had already reached the extreme at the current stage.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing an invincible eighth-stage existence, he could still block a few moves and would not die under a single soul attack like Ou Yin.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Lin Yuan had already completely surpassed Ou Yin, the eighth-stage late-stage evolutionary from a million years ago.</p><p></p><p>The current Origin Essence Metal did not provide much improvement for Lin Yuan, at least not enough to cause a "qualitative change".</p><p></p><p>It made little difference whether he brought it or not.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the information and carefully browsed through it.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Star Domain originally belonged to the "Shadow Clan's" territory.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shadow Clan was not a peak clan, it was one of the strongest clans below the peak clans, and its strength far surpassed that of the Black Abyss Clan.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the Shadow Clan on the battlefield, the human civilization gained a large territory, including the Milky Way Star Domain where Lin Yuan needed to be stationed.</p><p></p><p>In the Milky Way Star Domain, besides the Shadow Clan, there were also some special life clans and lone alien powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>These special life clans and lone alien powerhouses either occupied a universe secret realm or several star systems.</p><p></p><p>When the Shadow Clan was still around, they got along well with these special life clans and lone alien powerhouses, not invading each other.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Shadow Clan had been driven back and the entire Milky Way Star Domain had fallen into the hands of human civilization, it was up to Lin Yuan to decide how to deal with these special life clans and lone alien powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Nine special life clans and thirteen lone alien powerhouses?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan checked the information. These clan individuals had not yet taken hostile actions against human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"How should I deal with them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was clear in his heart that since the Shadow Clan had left these clans and individuals alone, they must have found it troublesome to directly handle them.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that these special life clans or lone alien powerhouses were either difficult to deal with in terms of strength or had many backgrounds, making the Shadow Clan wary of offending them.</p><p></p><p>"I'll see their attitude when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of human territory.</p><p></p><p>A vast star domain.</p><p></p><p>A huge figure was wantonly devouring planets one after another.</p><p></p><p>"How refreshing!"</p><p></p><p>"Everything in this universe is our food."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, with those Shadow Clan members watching, I had to be cautious. Now that the Shadow Clan has been defeated and withdrawn from this star domain, these planetary resources are all mine."</p><p></p><p>This huge figure resembled an octopus, with a blood-red body and countless tentacles. After grabbing a planet, it would swallow the entire planet into its body in less than a few days.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, these resource planets are a bit difficult to digest. If only they were life planets..."</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored octopus was suddenly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let me search."</p><p></p><p>"It would be best if I could find a few indigenous planets."</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored octopus immediately expanded its vast perception, spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>With the Shadow Clan's retreat, they must have taken all their clansmen away, but in such a large star domain, there were naturally many unexplored planets.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps among them, there were life planets.</p><p></p><p>A few months later.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored octopus had contentedly devoured several life planets.</p><p></p><p>Countless lives had turned into food for the blood-colored octopus, making it comfortable to the point of soul trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me digest for a while first."</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored octopus returned to a huge planet, which was its lair where it usually cultivated or slept.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored octopus quickly shrank in size, transforming into a figure with dozens of arms.</p><p></p><p>"Aodu, you're back?" On the other side of the huge planet, a massive mound of flesh sent out mental fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>This mound of flesh was a special lifeform and had a good relationship with the blood-colored octopus. The two often communicated with each other.</p><p></p><p>"How many planets did you devour this time?" The massive mound of flesh asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Just over a dozen, but those resource planets were too difficult to digest, so I secretly devoured a few life planets. That feeling..." The blood-colored octopus spoke in a delighted tone.</p><p></p><p>"Life planets?" The massive mound of flesh was also a bit tempted.</p><p></p><p>"After I finish digesting, you can come with me, and we'll go devour those life planets together," the blood-colored octopus said.</p><p></p><p>It had a special talent that could detect the locations of many planets in nearby regions. Otherwise, how could it be so easy to find life planets in the vast starry sky?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Aodu, you should also restrain yourself a bit in the future," the massive mound of flesh said.</p><p></p><p>"Restrain? Why should I restrain myself?" The blood-colored octopus was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This star domain is the territory that the Shadow Clan gave up. You should know who the Shadow Clan gave it to, right?" The massive mound of flesh said, "I received news that soon, the Star Lord of human civilization will come to this star domain to be stationed here."</p><p></p><p>"Which Star Lord?" The blood-colored octopus asked.</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh replied,</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Star Lord."</p>

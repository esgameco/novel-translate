        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 316: Three Hundred Years Later (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Longshan family. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was listening to Longshan Ling's report. </p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Lin Yuan had delegated the handling of all the trivial matters of the Longshan family to his trusted subordinates, and Longshan Ling was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only needed to listen to reports from time to time to grasp the overall direction.</p><p></p><p>This was a supernatural world, where an individual's power transcended that of forces. As long as Lin Yuan maintained absolute strength, he did not need to worry about being "overshadowed" by delegating authority. </p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the members of the Longshan family were well aware that the current prosperity of the Longshan family was due to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll sneak in quietly, capture the Longshan Count, and directly search his soul," said an emaciated old man hidden in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"This should be a semi-divine form?"</p><p></p><p>Outside Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>In this world, after knights reached the seventh level and ignited the divine fire, they would condense a semi-divine form. When they established a divine nation, the semi-divine form within their bodies would metamorphose into a divine form.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the original positions of the eight semi-divine beings. After their physical bodies and souls had completely turned to ashes, eight round crystals fell down.</p><p></p><p>"Semi-divine?" </p><p></p><p>However, the semi-divine beings present were all old foxes. They would only fight if they saw tangible benefits. Even if it was just a superficial remark, they would not turn against each other.</p><p></p><p>Because this meant that the divine fate obtained by Lin Yuan might be ordinary, without even a single treasure carrying the aura of a true deity.</p><p></p><p>In that case, Longshan Yuan, being targeted by these semi-divine experts, would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years was not much for the long-lived semi-divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Three semi-divine forms combined, excluding the overlapping parts of their spatial essence, could open up two million more spatial layers for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>If it was just a secret, it could naturally be shared equally. But what about a true divine artifact? How could a single true divine artifact be divided?</p><p></p><p>The seven semi-divine beings immediately transmitted their responses.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Longshan Count was also a semi-divine being?</p><p></p><p>Before the eight semi-divine beings could figure it out, a terrifying force, following the profound depths of the void, crushed them.</p><p></p><p>After entering the semi-divine form with his mind, Lin Yuan vaguely gained the perspective of the semi-divine form.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat first?"</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why so many semi-divine beings had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>A true divine artifact could shelter semi-divine beings and help them gain more faith, which was crucial for them to ultimately establish a divine nation and enter the Ocean of Light or the Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>Several auras hidden in the dark communicated with each other, carefully observing Lin Yuan, but not taking the initiative to attack.</p><p></p><p>So many semi-divine beings speculated in secret whether that Longshan Count had fortuitously obtained a divine fate.</p><p></p><p>But there was no distinction, even if they were the same.</p><p></p><p>"No need to mind them," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>There was also that gray-robed figure, whose divine form appeared gray, with a poisonous aura pulsating.</p><p></p><p>Their only obsession was to become a deity and continue growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already at the ninth level, and with his extraordinary comprehension, he could bring out such an effect from an ordinary semi-divine form.</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary," Lin Yuan marveled in his heart. "Truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. As you observe the essence of the world's rules, your insights into space and shadows continue to rise.]</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Even deities could die.</p><p></p><p>"What was the strength of the Longshan Count?" the emaciated old man immediately transmitted his inquiry.</p><p></p><p>Without Lin Yuan, the Longshan family would now be a minor count-level force living in seclusion, not the current Longshan County that dominated the southeastern region of the empire.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, over the years, more and more powerful experts have been stationed in Longshan City. Fourth-level knights, fifth-level great knights, and even sixth-level legendary knights have appeared within the city."</p><p></p><p>"Huh!!"</p><p></p><p>"If this Longshan Count has truly obtained a divine fate, we can share it equally," said a gray-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>The Longshan Count gave them an extraordinarily strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>As Longshan Ling reported, his heart was filled with turmoil.</p><p></p><p>So the semi-divine beings were all very cautious.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, the Longshan Count's aura was restrained, no different from an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, his tone calm.</p><p></p><p>With the deterrence of the Siran Empire, experts below the seventh semi-divine level did not dare to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>It should be a semi-divine form.</p><p></p><p>The eight semi-divine beings were extremely vigilant, fully prepared.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath. Each semi-divine form with a spatial attribute could glimpse a part of the spatial essence, which was greatly useful for Lin Yuan in opening spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as the cultivation method of martial arts spread, this phenomenon would become more and more apparent. Those powerful experts who were rarely seen would all want to figure out the origin of the martial arts cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"If a semi-divine form has such an effect, what about a true divine form?" Lin Yuan's eyes flickered with a hint of fervor.</p><p></p><p>As long as the other party cooperated and voluntarily allowed him to sense the semi-divine form within their body.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan observed this world and its myriad spatial layers from the perspective of a semi-divine form.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the semi-divine beings who could appear so quickly outside Longshan City were not ordinary semi-divine beings, but the strongest among them.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, in the Longshan Ridge and the surrounding vast area, not a single fifth-level great knight would be born for hundreds of years. But now, they frequently appeared, along with sixth-level legendary knights above the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a semi-divine form or a divine form, it was the absolute core of a semi-divine being or a true deity, embodying their entire existence.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>A gentle voice suddenly resonated in their ears.</p><p></p><p>One day, three to fifty layers.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the martial arts cultivation method had sparked a certain hope in the hearts of these semi-divine beings. The exquisite level of this cultivation method was something that even semi-divine beings could not create.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Longshan Ling said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Although only these two remained, they became exceptionally clear in Lin Yuan's perception.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually observed and grasped the round semi-divine form emanating spatial undulations, his mind slightly probing into it.</p><p></p><p>The remaining semi-divine beings also harbored thoughts of retreat.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan had comprehended it, he would only seal it away until the thousand-year residence limit was up before releasing it.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the number of spatial layers within his inner world was increasing at a rate of three to fifty layers per day.</p><p></p><p>The Siran Empire publicly bestowed the title of Count on the Longshan family, which was tantamount to supporting the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>It was strange enough to make their hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally."</p><p></p><p>"This?" Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, emerging from the perspective of his previous realization.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that no matter what happened, even if the sky fell, Lin Yuan could support it.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>"This shadow spatial semi-divine form can probably open up a million spatial layers for me," Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be at the fourth level?"</p><p></p><p>One day, three to five thousand layers.</p><p></p><p>The divine fate did not only contain true divine artifacts but also many other means that could still severely damage the semi-divine beings, even after a long passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"I know..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>New novel website: novel69.shuxia.com</p><p></p><p>The eight demigods were effortlessly turned to dust without any resistance. </p><p></p><p>But no matter what, even a tiny mosquito is flesh.</p><p></p><p>For third or fourth-level knights, the Earl of Longshan may seem profoundly unfathomable, but how could the eight demigods present not sense the Earl's specific aura?</p><p></p><p>"Something seems off?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Since he dared to publicly reveal the martial cultivation method, he had already considered these factors. Without sufficient strength, how could he possibly still remain in the Longshan Palace?</p><p></p><p>"These should be the demigods I killed directly?"</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that since Lin Yuan ascended to the ninth realm until now, the total number of spatial layers in his inner world has only reached three million, which is premised on comprehending dozens of universal forces, more than ten higher universal forces, and one primordial universal force.  </p><p></p><p>The so-called divine fate refers to the fate of deities. For most living beings, deities are immortal and imperishable, but the long-lived demigods are aware of this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind. He did not have the intention to kill those demigods with spatial attributes.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was right in front of them, and they were in no hurry. The duck about to enter one's mouth would not fly away.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, in the end, it's all for the secret behind the Earl of Longshan."</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible? The eight of them had already been extremely cautious. Even among other demigods, it was unlikely to be discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>The demigods nodded.  </p><p></p><p>The method of opening spatial layers within their inner worlds seemed to have a fixed direction and began soaring rapidly.</p><p></p><p>As for the seventh-level demigods? If they dared have other thoughts, Lin Yuan could crush them with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Originally, even in the main world and main universe, by relying on the dense spatial fluctuations from the alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>This was not the profound spatial mystery contained within the demigod form with millions of spatial layers, but the primordial spatial profundity that this demigod form could glimpse was just this much.</p><p></p><p>By borrowing the power of the demigod form, he manifested the profundity of rule-based attacks.</p><p></p><p>Towards this Earl of Longshan who was about her age, Longshan Ling had an almost dependent trust.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan felt that the world had become completely different.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of strength?"</p><p></p><p>The myriad spatial and shadow profundities of this realm, especially the billions of spatial layers, slowly unfolded before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of this demigod form spanning shadows and space, only the spatial aspect was useful to Lin Yuan. Among the other seven demigod forms, two more were related to space.</p><p></p><p>Just as the eight demigods exchanged glances, intending to leave first and make long-term plans.</p><p></p><p>"You old fellows, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Humans are greedy. Some can suppress their desires, while others cannot.</p><p></p><p>Being able to see and possess are two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>The originally rule-fluctuation-filled realm now only contained space and shadows.</p><p></p><p>In the past, this would have been an unimaginable supreme figure even in Longshan Ling's dreams, one with far-reaching influence even in the Slan Empire.</p><p></p><p>"Guests should stay."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I haven't sensed any aura of an eighth-level true deity either."</p><p></p><p>Layer after layer of spatial domains opened, making the lands within the inner world grow heavier and the firmament deeper.</p><p></p><p>The owners of these auras were all demigod-level existences. In fact, by the seventh level, demigods had already lost interest in most worldly matters.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Earl of Longshan?"</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Although the other demigods said so, their hearts harbored other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"A demigod who comprehended the spatial attribute?"</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>"We're all on the same path, no need for infighting."</p><p></p><p>Since they speculated that Lin Yuan might have obtained divine fate, they had to consider whether he had any trump cards.</p><p></p><p>And whether there were even more profound cultivation methods than the martial cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the demigods of this world mastered rule-based attack methods entirely relying on the demigod forms within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"The demigods of this world, their demigod forms are condensed from world rules, allowing them to comprehend the most fundamental rules of heaven and earth?" Lin Yuan was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by the Earl of Longshan implied that he had already discovered them.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of fourth or fifth level, can you sense the Earl of Longshan's strength now?" The emaciated elder's tone was somewhat doubtful and uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the emaciated elder hidden in the shadows slightly changed his expression, looking at the other seven demigods with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about us?" Longshan Ling hesitated.</p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying, observing the essence of world rules, your comprehension of space and shadows continues rising]</p><p></p><p>"Next, the two primordial spirits will focus on searching for those demigods."</p><p></p><p>"Still want to kill me and seize the fate?"</p><p></p><p>Vast, nearly two billion miles in radius, with close to thirty million layers of spatial domains.</p><p></p><p>Even if they acted, they had to avoid causing too much commotion, or else they would also be targeted by the other demigods.</p><p></p><p>Since they had come, they couldn't leave empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the Earl of Longshan was already a dead man. Aside from the true deities dwelling in the ocean of light and abyss of darkness, who in the mortal realm could withstand the encirclement and killing by several demigods?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>That could truly be invincible under the true deities.</p><p></p><p>The eight demigods cautiously infiltrated Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's perception of the spatial rules themselves was still vague, but now it became exceptionally clear.</p><p></p><p>Although the divine fate could not allow them to become deities, it could let them know more secrets. If they were fortunate enough to obtain a true divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>Three to five hundred layers a day.</p><p></p><p>The seven demigods' expressions simultaneously changed.</p><p></p><p>For a seventh-level demigod, it made no difference whether one was fourth or fifth level, just as there was little difference compared to first or second level, or even ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"I never sensed any danger."</p><p></p><p>The closer one was to success, the more composed one had to remain. This was a common understanding among all demigods.</p><p></p><p>Although their strength was formidable, they were not foolish. They clearly knew that many demigods were watching the Earl of Longshan, and the reason they had not acted until now was simply mutual apprehension.</p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying, observing the essence of world rules, your comprehension of space and shadows continues rising]</p><p></p><p>He was also a rather famous demigod.</p><p></p><p>The emaciated elder's brow faintly twitched. Although his demigod perception and foresight showed no warnings, he just felt something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>For example, initiating a divine war? Fallen deities, their divine realms transformed into stars, would plummet from the celestial vault.</p><p></p><p>"No, fifth level."  </p><p></p><p>Within the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The eight demigods entered Longshan City and infiltrated the Longshan Palace.</p><p></p><p>The few demigods exchanged glances, disappointment showing on their faces.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inwardly thought that decades ago, although he had also killed the Goddess of Lust and Desire, it was through a curse, striking from billions of miles away without ever seeing her face.</p><p></p><p>Under the astonished gazes of the eight demigods, the nearby Lin Yuan looked up at them.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years later.</p>

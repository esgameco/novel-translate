        <h1>Chapter 665</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the Precious Land and the Source World is like that of a fruit and its mother tree.</p><p></p><p>The newly born Precious Land is akin to a fruit just about to fall from the mother tree.</p><p></p><p>It is about to detach, but not completely.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, through this Precious Land, following the connection that has not yet been severed, one can observe the vast primal source of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>Only the newly born Precious Lands can do this, as for those Precious Lands that have existed for countless ages, even if they are top-tier Precious Lands, they have little connection to the mother tree.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Nest and the Emerald Wave Cliff guarded by Lin Yuan are examples of this, having already become completely independent.</p><p></p><p>"The primal source of the Source World?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the distance, where there was an irregular rift connecting to the deepest part of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>Each newly born Precious Land, after being fully refined and controlled, would have the opportunity to comprehend the primal source of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>During the emergence of Precious Lands throughout history, the supreme Transcendent Experts of the ancient great nations would compete for the chance to participate, not only because all the harvests within the Precious Lands would belong to them.</p><p></p><p>There was also this reason.</p><p></p><p>How vast and magnificent is the operation of the primal source of the Source World? This is a fluctuation that the ancestors of the great ancient nations could not completely replicate, and for the supreme Transcendent Experts, it is an unprecedented accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the irregular rift, faintly peering into the depths within.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a sense of shock surged in Lin Yuan's heart, as he gained a 'concrete' understanding of the operation of the primal source of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, the primal source of the Source World was an infinitely tall 'giant tree', each leaf gently swaying, containing countless waves of Dao rule information. Countless leaves responded to each other, interweaving together to form this vast heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The 'giant tree' was immensely massive and heavy, impossible to describe in words. Lin Yuan's strength was already unrivaled among the supreme Transcendent Experts in the history of the six great ancient nations, but in the face of the 'giant tree', he was still like dust.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even had the feeling that even the lofty ancestors were but tiny specks compared to the 'giant tree'.</p><p></p><p>Just by observing for a moment, a great deal of enlightenment and insight flooded into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary, observing the manifestation of the unknown primal source, your understanding of the Dao rules has been greatly enhanced.]</p><p></p><p>"The primal source of the Source World, is this the primal source of the Source World?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath, watching the details within the irregular rift with near obsession.</p><p></p><p>And as Lin Yuan observed more deeply, the image of the primal source of the Source World kept changing.</p><p></p><p>At first, the primal source was an infinitely large 'giant tree', its branches and leaves swaying, forming the vast heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan gained some comprehension, the primal source then transformed into a winding mountain range, endless and traversing time and space.</p><p></p><p>Looking closer, it then became an eternal river flowing through the past, present, and future, ancient and everlasting, impossible to erase.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when Lin Yuan had a moment of enlightenment, it transformed back into an infinitely vast 'giant tree'.</p><p></p><p>The image of the primal source of the Source World that Lin Yuan saw depended on his own thoughts. The primal source had no definite form, and could be said to have countless appearances.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, too wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan murmured to himself. In the past, when Precious Lands emerged, the supreme Transcendent Experts of the great ancient nations had also observed the primal source of the Source World after seizing the Precious Lands.</p><p></p><p>But those supreme Transcendent Experts were far inferior to Lin Yuan in terms of comprehension. Even when observing the same scene, the knowledge and feelings they gained were vastly different.</p><p></p><p>It was like how some people could comprehend the fundamental operating principles just from an apple falling on their head, while others would only feel the pain of being hit.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, the insights and harvests he gained from observing the true operation of the primal source of the Source World were unmatched by other supreme Transcendent Experts. "This is the greatest opportunity for me in this battle for the Precious Land."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was spirited and energetic. The Precious Land itself, as well as the rare treasures it produced, could only be considered external forces. However, observing the operation of the primal source of the Source World was enhancing Lin Yuan's own comprehension.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan was immersed in comprehending the operation of the primal source of the Source World, he also noticed that the irregular rift connecting to the deepest part of the Source World was slowly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>"The connection between the Precious Land and the Source World is weakening?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood this in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Based on past experiences and the speed of the rift's shrinkage, I should be able to comprehend for about ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years was but a moment for any supreme Transcendent Expert, as they could even take a nap for longer than that.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was already very satisfied. </p><p></p><p>Not every supreme Transcendent Expert had such an opportunity. </p><p></p><p>This had nothing to do with strength. Even if one's strength was extraordinary, if they never encountered the emergence of a Precious Land of this level, they would not be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>In the short thousands of years since Lin Yuan arrived in this Source World, he had already experienced the emergence of a Precious Land and had the chance to replace the Radiant Sun Ancient Nation in competing for it. This was already extremely fortunate.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that my comprehension of the space-time fusion rules is improving rapidly, and I should be able to reach the peak of the Ninth Realm within a thousand years, with the hope of surpassing the Ninth Realm boundary within ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly while observing the rift.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Realm of the space-time fusion rules was basically only attainable by Peerless Great Saints. As for the peak of the Ninth Realm? That was the domain of Invincible Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's combat strength and power far surpassed that of Invincible Great Saints, relying on the Chaotic Taiji Dao, the universe within him, and other methods, in pure comprehension of the space-time fusion rules, he was still at the initial stage of the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Lin Yuan had entered the Ninth Realm of the space-time fusion rules too recently, just a few hundred years ago, and most of his focus and energy had been spent on comprehending the Chaotic Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "slightly slow" progress was only in comparison to Lin Yuan's other areas of rapid advancement.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Peerless Great Saints and top supreme Transcendent Experts, Lin Yuan's progress in the comprehension of the space-time fusion rules was still unmatched.</p><p></p><p>"Surpassing the Ninth Realm of space-time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression could not help but show anticipation. So far, whether it was the Chaotic Void or this Source World, the ultimate limit for comprehension of the space-time fusion rules below the Thirteenth Realm was the peak of the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The only exception was His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mysterious Emperor's ability to further advance in the comprehension of the space-time fusion rules relied on his own accumulation, as well as the Thirteenth Realm weapon, the Heavenly Void Cauldron, he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even before obtaining the Heavenly Void Cauldron, the Mysterious Emperor had already reached the peak of the Ninth Realm in his comprehension of the space-time fusion rules. The operation of the Dao rules within the Heavenly Void Cauldron only played a supporting role, with the key still being the Mysterious Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>"Surpassing the Ninth Realm of the space-time fusion rules will have a profound impact on my comprehension of the Chaotic rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself. Space originates from Chaos, so improving space-time would also, to a certain extent, be improving Chaos.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level, the cultivation systems complemented each other perfectly, and improving any one aspect would benefit the others.</p><p></p><p>Within the Precious Land, while Lin Yuan was comprehending the primal source of the Source World, he also manifested a clone to begin collecting various treasures from different locations.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Mist</p><p></p><p>The golden mist is a rare treasure produced in this precious land. It is scattered in the secret places of the precious land, and even after thousands of years of searching by the supreme immortal masters of the major ancient countries, a large part of it has still not been discovered. However, after Lin Yuan refined all the core celestial pillars, he gained complete mastery over the precious land. These golden mists hidden in secret places are naturally as clear as the lines on his palm to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These are weapons, armaments, treasures, and rare items."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and a large amount of spoils appeared before him, all left behind by the supreme immortal masters of the major ancient countries who had fallen at his hands.</p><p></p><p>Since they had entered the precious land to compete, the supreme immortal masters did not bring many treasures with them, but the sheer number of them was staggering.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal masters who had fallen at Lin Yuan's hands, including their multiple main combat bodies, were estimated to exceed a hundred.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal masters from the six major ancient countries participating in the competition for the precious land, added together, were only about seventy or eighty, but each of them had several main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred main combat bodies of supreme immortal masters, even if they only carried weapons and armaments, would still be an enormous wealth, at least hundreds of items at the supreme immortal master level.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, these supreme immortal masters are all high-level figures of the major ancient countries, and they are not allowed to be captured alive, so they cannot be ransomed," Lin Yuan shook his head inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he did not wish to kill the main combat bodies of these supreme immortal masters, as it would be better to keep them for ransom. But those who had cultivated to the supreme immortal master level all had their pride. They would rather lose a main combat body and die in battle than bear the disgrace of being captured.</p><p></p><p>Especially Fuxu Immortal Master, as the strongest immortal master, there had never been a precedent in the history of the six major ancient countries for the strongest immortal master to be captured.</p><p></p><p>"The golden mist."</p><p></p><p>Among the abundant spoils, there was naturally no shortage of golden mist, as it was a rare treasure produced in this precious land, and every supreme immortal master had obtained some.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the golden mist, Lin Yuan's gaze turned to the last part of the spoils.</p><p></p><p>This was the most valuable spoil to Lin Yuan - the foundation-destroying weapons of the major ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the precious land, the major ancient countries had bestowed some foundation-destroying weapons to their top supreme immortal masters.</p><p></p><p>These foundation-destroying weapons originated from the ancestors, and although they were far inferior to the thirteenth-tier weapons and armaments, the threshold for activating them was relatively low.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation-destroying weapons of the Great Fuxu Country."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn as he looked at a portion of them.</p><p></p><p>The foundation-destroying weapons of the Great Fuxu Country mainly came from Fuxu Immortal Master, the strongest immortal master, who was the hope of the Great Fuxu Country in competing for this precious land and carried the most and strongest foundation-destroying weapons.</p><p></p><p>"The ancestor of the Great Fuxu."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at a wooden sword. This wooden sword was extremely simple, but it contained the ultimate sharpness within. Once activated, even Lin Yuan would have to temporarily avoid its edge.</p><p></p><p>"Was this wooden sword carved by the ancestor of the Great Fuxu?" Lin Yuan speculated inwardly. He had not discovered the source of the sharpness of the wooden sword or what essence it contained, only feeling that it would be best for him not to collide with it.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation-destroying weapons of the Great Fuxu Country can only be activated by the strong ones of the Great Fuxu Country. Even if I obtain them, they would be useless to me," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The foundation-destroying weapons of the major ancient countries all carried the aura of their corresponding ancestors, and only the descendants of that ancestor could activate them.</p><p></p><p>"I'll keep them to exchange for other treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a while, thinking that even though these foundation-destroying weapons were useless to him, the corresponding ancient countries would certainly want to redeem them, as the loss of their ancient country's foundation-destroying weapons would be a disgrace to them. Lin Yuan could take the opportunity to propose some "excessive" conditions.</p><p></p><p>There were still two hundred years until the competition for the precious land ended.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules of previous precious land appearances, the supreme immortal masters of the major ancient countries would usually be at the brink of a great battle during this time period.</p><p></p><p>But now, the precious land was empty.</p><p></p><p>Only eleven supreme immortal masters of the Lieyang Country were wandering around.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme immortal masters of the other five ancient countries have all withdrawn."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Lotus Immortal Master observed for a while and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Silver River Immortal Master is too terrifying. He is truly the undefeated immortal master as recognized by all."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Immortal Master spoke with a sigh. He was the previous guardian of the Black Jade Nest and was the first among the present supreme immortal masters to have had contact with Lin Yuan. However, his shock was even greater.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that the young core imperial clan member at the time would grow to such a degree? Blazing Sun Immortal Master was quite relieved that he did not give Silver River Immortal Master any trouble back then. Otherwise, his future days would certainly be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the undefeated immortal master."</p><p></p><p>The other supreme immortal masters were shocked and in awe.</p><p></p><p>"Undefeated immortal master" was not a realm, but a title.</p><p></p><p>It was the title for the Silver River Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>Meaning that he was undefeated among all immortal masters.</p><p></p><p>This title had not appeared since the founding of the Great Fuxu Country and the subsequent establishment of the five major ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, the six major ancient countries had indeed produced certain extremely powerful supreme immortal masters in certain aspects, but they were far from being truly undefeated.</p><p></p><p>The two words "undefeated" not only carried an ultimate sense of oppression but also the despair of the other strongest immortal masters towards the Silver River Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with a small cauldron the size of a palm floating before him.</p><p></p><p>The true body and primal self in the Source World were contemplating the operation of the Source World's primal origin, while the true body and primal self in the Chaotic Void were contemplating the operation of the great dao rules within the Heavenly Void Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan could not comprehend the operation of the primal origin of the Chaotic Void, his thirteenth-tier time and life certainly could comprehend the operation of the great dao rules within the thirteenth-tier weapon Heavenly Void Cauldron, which must have borrowed from the primal origin of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Heavenly Void Cauldron, even if not as good as directly comprehending the primal origin of the Chaotic Void, was not much inferior.</p><p></p><p>"The Source World, the Chaotic Void." Lin Yuan carefully observed the Heavenly Void Cauldron, while also comparing it to the operation of the primal origin of the Source World, and endless insights kept emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The essential nature of different dimensions of space-time." Lin Yuan felt that his comprehension of the fusion rules of space-time was soaring, far surpassing his single-handed comprehension of the Heavenly Void Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the space-time comprehension, Lin Yuan's comprehension of other rules was also rising at an unimaginable speed, with the operation of the primal origin of the Source World on one side and Lin Yuan's extraordinary perceptiveness on the other.</p><p></p><p>The effect was far greater than one plus one.</p><p></p><p>This was a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Day after day passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two hundred years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

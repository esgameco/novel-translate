            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched the operation of the Source World's primal origin.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years passed, and the irregular fissure connecting the Source World's primal origin had shrunk by nearly a tenth, but it still did not affect Lin Yuan's observation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Threads of talisman energy intertwined in front of Lin Yuan, trying to replicate the Source World's primal origin within the irregular fissure.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless talisman threads collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly, but he was not overly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although in theory, the Talisman Way could replicate all things, theory is one thing, and reality is another.</p><p></p><p>Given the vastness of this Source World's primal origin, unless Lin Yuan advanced to the Thirteenth Realm and became a Time Life, there was no possibility of successfully replicating it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's attempt to replicate it using the Talisman Way was mainly to deepen his participation in the operation of the Source World's primal origin.</p><p></p><p>Even though the replication failed, it was not without gain, as he clearly understood the reason for the failure, which further clarified his insights into the operation of the Source World's primal origin, making subsequent comprehension easier.</p><p></p><p>"The rare treasures produced in this treasure land can nurture a time-based constitution, making it easier to comprehend the power of time, and can even vaguely see one's own future timeline."</p><p></p><p>After fully refining this treasure land, Lin Yuan gained a deeper understanding of the rare treasures it produced. Through years of diligent comprehension, he also grasped the true purpose of the golden mist.</p><p></p><p>The ability to vaguely see the future timeline is considered a monstrous and heavenly power, belonging to the authority of the Thirteenth Realm Time Life.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, it was not of much use.</p><p></p><p>His future was constantly monitored by the Six Patriarchs, so there was no need to use this method to observe it.</p><p></p><p>Not only would the vision be blurred and the information fragmented, but it would also be extremely taxing on his mental and spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need it, but the other Celestial Sovereigns may be different."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred. The many Celestial Sovereigns of the Six Ancient Kingdoms did not have the constant attention of the Six Patriarchs like he did. They must be extremely curious about their own futures.</p><p></p><p>And seeing the blurred future timeline could also serve as a warning to them. Lin Yuan was invincible against the Six Ancient Kingdoms and did not care about any dangers, but ordinary Celestial Sovereigns were not the same.</p><p></p><p>In the full-scale wars of the Six Ancient Kingdoms, the number of Celestial Sovereign-level powerhouses who perished was not small.</p><p></p><p>If they could foresee their impending downfall and take preventive measures, wouldn't that avoid a disaster? Even for Celestial Sovereign-level experts, they all had various life-saving techniques and would not be completely annihilated, but being able to salvage their main combat body would still be a great advantage.</p><p></p><p>"These golden mists can be traded out to obtain resources for opening up particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a plan in mind. The resources required for the Second Source World True Body Sovereign to open up countless particle worlds had exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Having this treasure land to supplement the resources would greatly alleviate the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, given Lin Yuan's status in the eyes of the Six Patriarchs, as long as he spoke a word, even if the resources were abundant, the Patriarchs could retrieve them.</p><p></p><p>But all of this would require repaying favors, and the Patriarchs would not give unconditionally. When Lin Yuan requested from the Patriarchs, he would have to bear the consequences and repay them in the future when he advanced to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yun Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In addition to opening up particle worlds, Lin Yuan was also comprehending more cultivation systems in this Source World.</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Three Realms, with Carefree as the main focus, this level of experts is equivalent to the Great Saint Celestial Sovereigns. The experts of the Third Realm of Carefree are even on par with the Invincible Great Saints, the strongest Celestial Sovereigns."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The division of the Great Saint realm in this Source World was clearer than in the Chaotic Void and the First Source World, explicitly stating the power standard of the Third Realm of Carefree.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that in the central heavens and earth, the strongest inheritors of the Eternal Sects have the power to sweep through the Third Realm of Carefree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. According to the description, these strongest inheritors of the Eternal Sects should possess strength close to that of the Abyss Dragon. In this Source World, due to the Talisman Way, the cultivation threshold was much lower than in the Chaotic Void and the First Source World, and the comprehension of the Dao of the Rules was easier, resulting in the birth of more powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Dragon, a life form born from the places where the Source World was opened, in this Source World, among the Twelfth Realm lives, if not surpassing or matching, at least they could approach it.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not have much of a feeling about this.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the Abyss Dragon?</p><p></p><p>Even a thousand years ago, Lin Yuan's direct offensive methods had already surpassed the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after experiencing a thousand years of cultivation and enlightenment, the so-called Abyss Dragon was just a trivial matter in the face of Lin Yuan, who had already opened up hundreds of billions of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The Talisman Inheritance of the Eternal Sects' forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan greatly desired this. Even though he had already far surpassed the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>But he had to admit the tremendous power of this primordial life form. The strongest inheritors of the Eternal Sects in the central heavens and earth, being able to reach the level close to the Abyss Dragon, the Talisman Inheritance they cultivated must be far more exquisite than Lin Yuan's current level.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could they make up for the gap between the later generations and the Abyss Dragon, this primordial life form.</p><p></p><p>After all, before the great changes in the heavens and earth, the physical bodies of the beings in this Source World were still normal. Reaching the level close to the Abyss Dragon under such circumstances was already considered extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly, the Talisman Inheritance of the Eternal Sects? After I finish opening up the endless Asoka particle worlds, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind and immersed himself in cultivation once again.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Far, far away from the sacred Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>A towering, massive 'Demon' was striding forward.</p><p></p><p>It had a pair of immensely huge wings, and its body was covered in countless, innumerable giant mouths, with a surging demonic aura constantly pouring into these mouths from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Its pair of jet-black wings spanned over countless trillions of miles, and this was after it had condensed its demonic body as much as possible. If it were to unfurl its wings without restraint, its size would be hundreds, thousands, even millions of times greater than it is now.</p><p></p><p>"Source!"</p><p>"Source!"</p><p>"Source!"</p><p></p><p>As the giant Demon walked, countless demonic spirits and even great Demons prostrated themselves, calling out to it in a peculiar language.</p><p></p><p>"Source?"</p><p></p><p>The giant Demon halted its steps, and a sudden thought emerged from its muddled mind -</p><p></p><p>It wanted to become the Source.</p><p>To become the Source Demon.</p><p>It was just a step away.</p><p></p><p>The Demon's heart was filled with this idea. </p><p>In its current state, it was just a step away from becoming the Source Demon.</p><p></p><p>As an innate 'Demon', it did not have the urge to devour its own kind in order to transcend.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Qi!"</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the giant Demon had devoured the surrounding Demonic Qi, and then began striding towards the area with an even higher concentration of Demonic Qi.</p><p></p><p>"That way?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon looked in a certain direction, where the Demonic Qi density was slightly higher than the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>Driven by its instinctual craving, the giant Demon continued to devour the Demonic Qi as it headed towards that region of higher Demonic Qi concentration.</p><p></p><p>Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples were orderly entering and exiting the sacred mountain, clearing the areas where Demonic Qi had gathered, to prevent the birth of powerful 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I found that clearing the Demonic Qi isn't dangerous at all, it's very easy."</p><p>"Yes, over the past few hundred years, I've cleared it dozens of times, and never encountered any obstacles."</p><p></p><p>The many disciples of the Sacred Sect discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be careless."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a disciple with more seniority spoke up: "It's true that we've rarely encountered Demonic Spirits in the past few hundred years, but we can't let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>This disciple swept his gaze across the other disciples: "Otherwise, if we encounter Demonic Spirits, the casualties will be devastating."</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, when the disciples of the Sacred Sect went out to clear the Demonic Qi gathering spots, any who were not extremely cautious would face disaster if they encountered Demonic Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Any Demonic Spirit had strength close to the Longevity Realm, and while they might not pose a threat to the Elders, for ordinary disciples, once they were contaminated by Demonic Qi, it would be a matter of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"The number of Demonic Spirits has decreased, perhaps the 'Demonic' calamity outside is disappearing?"</p><p></p><p>An optimistic Sacred Sect disciple couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The other Sacred Sect disciples were about to join the discussion.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive sensation spread in an instant.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all the Sacred Sect disciples felt a sense of suffocation, as if facing an unprecedented, massive entity.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>At the highest peak of the sacred mountain.</p><p></p><p>The array formations began to glow.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Sacred Sect and the Elders appeared here.</p><p></p><p>"Array formation alert? Is there a great Demon approaching? No, ordinary great Demons wouldn't trigger this many array formations, is it a peak great Demon? Or a Demon close to the Source Demon level?"</p><p></p><p>The Elders' hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>A peak great Demon would still be manageable, with the current defenses of the sacred mountain, there would be some hope of holding them off.</p><p></p><p>But a Demon close to the Source Demon level? If it was truly a Demon of that caliber, the only thought in the minds of the Sect Master and Elders was to hope that the Demon wouldn't discover Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>"Look."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Sacred Sect flipped his hand, and the array formations converged, forming a series of images.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, they saw a towering giant Demon with massive black wings on its back, its body covered in countless giant mouths, rapidly striding forward.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the Demon went, the Demonic Qi flowed like a river towards the countless mouths.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Sacred Sect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in seclusion, cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The suffocating aura enveloped him, and he too sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"This aura is...?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A great Demon, an incredibly powerful great Demon, a Demon close to the Source Demon level?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed, in the past thousand years, he had hunted hundreds and thousands of great Demons, but had never encountered one with such strength.</p><p></p><p>"Over there?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rose to his feet, looking towards the direction of the Demon, and his figure suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>At the highest peak of Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master and Elders of the Sacred Sect were watching the image of the giant Demon in the array formation, their hearts filled with fear and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The array formation that created these images was a secret technique of the Sacred Sect, said to originate from the Eternal Sect at the center of the heavens and earth, allowing them to silently observe the traces of Demons from afar.</p><p></p><p>"This giant Demon, based on its path, it won't pass through our Mount Qingyun, so there shouldn't be any danger."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, the Sect Master concluded, and the rest of the Elders let out a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>No one wanted to face this terrifying Demon that was already approaching the Source Demon level, the pressure would be too great.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the Elders were feeling more at ease, a few who were still intently watching the image in the array formation suddenly changed expression, as if they had discovered something utterly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Xia Qin Zhi Qiang Zhe (Xia Qin, the Powerful One), and he was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Since the discovery of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, countless 12th-stage Ultimate Cultivators have tried to refine the secret realm, but none have succeeded.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even locate the exact coordinates of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, let alone refine it. </p><p></p><p>Now that he had become the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it would indeed shock all the 12th-stage Ultimate Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"When I entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to explore, I managed to reach the deepest part of the secret realm by chance," Lin Yuan casually explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Xia Qin, the Powerful One, smiled. He didn't care how Lin Yuan had refined the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he was only concerned that the secret realm now belonged to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" </p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan, you may not know this, but the Xuanhuang Secret Realm holds great significance for human civilization!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Powerful One, sighed deeply and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Significance for human civilization?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the 12th-stage Ultimate Cultivators wanted to refine the Xuanhuang Secret Realm because they speculated that there were important inheritances within that could be crucial to their evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>And this was indeed the case. The three great secret cultivation techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage would greatly benefit not only the 12th-stage Ultimate Cultivators, but even the Dominator Realm and the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the significance for human civilization? </p><p></p><p>To prevent the three great Xuanhuang secret techniques from being widely disseminated and having their counters discovered by enemies, the Emperor of Xuan had made a rule to prohibit passing them on to other powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't figure out what great significance the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had for human civilization? The Xuanhuang Beasts? The Xuanhuang Crystals? The Xuanhuang Crystals did have considerable value, but in terms of human civilization as a whole, they were merely a scarce resource, not something of profound significance.</p><p></p><p>"For human civilization, the most precious thing is the secret realm itself," Xia Qin, the Powerful One, looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The secret realm itself?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the secret realm itself," Xia Qin nodded. "The Xuanhuang Secret Realm can isolate causality and space-time. Even we 12th-stage cultivators cannot interfere with or influence anything within the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"And now, the top ten peak forces in the universe are maintaining a certain level of war, but the undercurrents are turbulent. Those alien races are constantly keeping an eye on any genius evolutionary talents that appear in human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Those at the 6th-stage and above are still manageable. Even if they perish, they can be revived through the Life Imprint."</p><p></p><p>"But those below the 6th-stage? Many genius evolutionary talents at that level, just as they start to rise, are directly cursed to death by the alien races, without any chance of revival."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Powerful One, said.</p><p></p><p>"That's true," Lin Yuan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>He had also been targeted by alien curses before, but his identity had been well-hidden, so the alien races could only do a broad-spectrum cursing, and even then, they had only managed to curse a 3-eyed tribal genius from among the candidates of the Seven-Star Cave trial.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had been lucky, and with the Crimson Kirin Star Lord's prior experience, his junior disciple from a millennium ago had not died at the hands of the alien races.</p><p></p><p>But what about the other genius evolutionary talents of human civilization? Every year, countless talents below the 6th-stage were cursed to death.</p><p></p><p>Among the peak alien races, there were specific 10th-stage and 11th-stage experts who specialized in cursing the 4th-stage and 5th-stage talents of human civilization. For the 10th-stage and 11th-stage, the cost they paid was not too high, and it was all recoverable.</p><p></p><p>The Supremes were unable to do much about this situation. After all, human civilization only had nine Supremes, and their main focus had to be on the 12th-stage alien races. They couldn't possibly keep track of every evolutionary talent in the civilization.</p><p></p><p>And human civilization had also never stopped assassinating important talents from other alien races.</p><p></p><p>"So what is the Supreme's intention?" Lin Yuan understood what Xia Qin, the Powerful One, wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, with the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, we can store a wisp of the spiritual will of our human civilization's important evolutionary talents below the 6th-stage."</p><p></p><p>"This way, even if they encounter curses, they can still survive," Xia Qin, the Powerful One, said.</p><p></p><p>The essence of life lies in the spiritual will. The core of the Divination Technique is also to branch out a portion of the spiritual will into a new body.</p><p></p><p>As long as the spiritual will remains, the physical body and soul can be quickly restored.</p><p></p><p>"Although the pillars of our human civilization are the 10th-stage and 11th-stage cultivators, and us 12th-stage, they all grew from the weak to the strong. If the talents below the 6th-stage can survive, then our human civilization will have a future," Xia Qin, the Powerful One, said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yuan, he had grown from the 1st-stage to the 2nd-stage to the 3rd-stage.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>For any tribe, the foundation has always been the lower levels. Only when the lower levels are numerous can there be a constant stream of middle, high, and top-level talents.</p><p></p><p>Among the ordinary tribes in the cosmic starry sky, there were many that concentrated all their resources to nurture a single powerful expert, but these tribes lost their vitality, and if that expert encountered any mishap, they would face total destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will set a threshold. Those who want to store a wisp of their spiritual will in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm will have to pay a price. If some evolutionary talents can't afford it for now, they can owe it and pay it off later when they can afford it," Xia Qin, the Powerful One, had considered this comprehensively.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was Lin Yuan's private property, so it couldn't be used for free.</p><p></p><p>"That's a small matter," Lin Yuan shook his head, not caring at all.</p><p></p><p>It's not like he was opening up the entire Xuanhuang Secret Realm, just carving out a corner to store some spiritual wills. That was too simple for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Lin Yuan was the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Xia Qin, the Powerful One, did not continue to urge Lin Yuan to go to the Central Star Realm in person.</p><p></p><p>In terms of safety, the ancestral lands of human civilization were definitely not as secure as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the clashes between human civilization and other peak tribes were most intense, many ancestral lands had been conquered, and the Central Star Realm had even become a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Secret Realm? It had remained untouched until now, no matter how the 12th-stage alien races probed it, they had gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's true body in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he would definitely be much safer than in any place of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, Xia Qin, the Powerful One, still reminded Lin Yuan to be careful. Those 12th-stage alien races might not make a move.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan had already grown tremendously, and with the protection of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, even Xia Qin, the Powerful One, couldn't think of a way to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>But if the 12th-stage alien races did make a move, it would definitely be with great confidence, and that would be the most dangerous.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver Galaxy's Main Star.</p><p></p><p>A figure silently appeared outside the main star.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the main star of the Silver Galaxy Lord?" The figure, shrouded in a black robe, did not reveal any aura, only quietly gazing at the planet below.</p><p></p><p>"Go see the Silver Galaxy Lord," the black-robed figure did not forget their mission and immediately entered the Silver Galaxy's Main Star through the star platform.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Galaxy's Main Star had now become the core of dozens of surrounding star alliances, with a constant flow of citizens from human civilization and alien races.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe passed through the customs smoothly, with proper procedures and legitimate identity, without encountering any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the figure in the black robe arrived at the central Star Lord's Palace on the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Lord's Palace, the red-skinned and green-eyed members of the eighth-level alien race reported, "Master, there is a member of the Jie Clan who wishes to see you."</p><p></p><p>"The Jie Clan?" Lin Yuan opened his eyes, slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Jie Clan was the most mysterious and powerful of the Twelve Supreme Clan Forces, with two Transcendent Dao Realm experts at its core, enough to make the other eleven Supreme Clan Forces tremble. Even if these two Transcendent Dao Realm experts were ultimately unable to act normally, they were still at the Transcendent Dao Realm, and who knows what methods they possessed.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Jie Clan held the highest status among the Twelve Supreme Clan Forces in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment. "Let him come in."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the figure in the black robe entered the Star Lord's Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Galaxy Star Lord," the figure in the black robe said respectfully, bowing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the figure in the black robe carefully stole a glance at Lin Yuan and noticed a young man sitting cross-legged in the distance, holding a hazy, power-shrouded book.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at the book, the figure in the black robe felt his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Galaxy Star Lord?" the figure in the black robe thought anxiously. He was also an eleventh-level being, and a member of the Jie Clan at that, but facing the eleventh-level Galaxy Star Lord, he had a sense of facing his ultimate ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"The Jie Clan has sent you to come here secretly. What is the matter?" Lin Yuan's book disappeared, and he glanced at the black robe worn by the figure.</p><p></p><p>This black robe was a rare spatial-temporal treasure that could isolate any aura, and even a Twelfth-Level Ultimate Being would have difficulty detecting it if they did not observe it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's understanding of the spatial-temporal realm had reached the seventh level, and he could see the purpose of the black robe. The figure had come so cautiously, so he must not want others to know, not even the strongest beings of human civilization, that a Jie Clan eleventh-level member had come to the Galaxy Star.</p><p></p><p>"Responding to the Galaxy Star Lord, the ancestor has sent me to tell you something," the figure in the black robe said quickly after calming himself. "The Tian Yu Clan, the Insect Clan, the Yu Clan, and other Twelfth-Level beings are planning to join forces and use that strange blood to deal with you, the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Strange blood?" Lin Yuan's mind stirred, immediately thinking of the mysterious creature that had fallen into the universe at the time of its creation.</p><p></p><p>This matter had not involved the strongest beings of human civilization, as human civilization had not yet been born, but they knew of the terrible nature of that mysterious creature through some records.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Insect Clan's Myriad Transformation Empress obtained a drop of that strange creature's fresh blood?" Lin Yuan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," the figure in the black robe said. "That drop of strange fresh blood is the source of chaos and pollution, and it is fatal to any being below the Twelfth Level."</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Galaxy Star Lord will be very careful," the figure in the black robe said immediately, revealing the conspiracy plans of the Twelfth-Level alien clans.</p><p></p><p>There might be differences among them, but the core point, that drop of strange blood, would not change. It was one of the few things that could affect Lin Yuan's true body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had no worries at all.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Clan and other Twelfth-Level alien clans believed that drop of strange blood could deal with Lin Yuan, based on the foundation of Lin Yuan's display of power on the vast battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After his journey to the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan's strength had increased immeasurably, not weaker than a normal Twelfth-Level Ultimate Being. To be precise, after obtaining the treasure of the Mastery Realm peak expert "Cang Wei Yang", Lin Yuan's combat power was estimated to be close to the level of the Myriad Transformation Empress and the Xuan Yuan Strongest.</p><p></p><p>That drop of blood from the strange creature was certainly terrible, but it was obviously not enough to deal with a Twelfth-Level being, otherwise the Myriad Transformation Empress would not have kept it unused for so many years.</p><p></p><p>The key was that to make that drop of strange blood effective, they would have to completely suppress one of Lin Yuan's divine souls or incarnations, but this was impossible.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current mental will and soul strength, even a Mastery Realm expert would be unable to suppress him without him being able to react.</p><p></p><p>"Why did your Jie Clan choose to tell me this?" Lin Yuan's thoughts scattered, and he finally glanced at the figure in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's own people knew about his affairs, but the Jie Clan did not know, so why would they voluntarily reveal this secret?</p><p></p><p>"My clan's ancestor did not say why," the figure in the black robe said softly.</p><p></p><p>He was also puzzled as to why the ancestor had told him to come, but in the Jie Clan, the ancestor was like the heavens, and whatever they said had to be obeyed.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the figure in the black robe immediately retreated.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can't stay on the Galaxy Star anymore," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the conspiracy of the Twelfth-Level alien clans posed no threat to Lin Yuan, if they truly united and came to attack, the aftermath of the battle would not be good for the countless citizens on the Galaxy Star and the surrounding celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>The battles between Twelfth-Level Ultimate Beings would destroy areas light-years in size.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally had to consider the countless citizens on the main star.</p><p></p><p>But the Twelfth-Level alien clans would not care about that.</p><p></p><p>And the strongest beings of human civilization were also stationed here, so if the Twelfth-Level alien clans slaughtered one star system today, they would be slaughtered by the human civilization's strongest beings in ten star systems tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, my two divine souls and numerous incarnations will wander in the desolate star domains as much as possible," Lin Yuan decided.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during this time, Lin Yuan would use his understanding of the Dao to conceal the aura of his divine souls and incarnations.</p><p></p><p>Even for Twelfth-Level Ultimate Beings, it would be difficult to lock onto his exact location with his current Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>As for having his divine souls and incarnations hide in the Xuan Huang Secret Realm? The Xuan Huang Secret Realm could indeed isolate the causal time-space, but one could not sense the fluctuations of the Dao within it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was certainly not willing to confront the Twelfth-Level alien clans, but that did not mean he was afraid of them.</p><p></p><p>"At most, it will take me a hundred years to reach the pinnacle with the transformation speed of the world within me, and then I can assault the Ultimate Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Within a hundred years, if those Twelfth-Level alien clans managed to find one of Lin Yuan's incarnations through causal connections, Lin Yuan would not mind playing with them a bit.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't lock onto him, then in a hundred years, Lin Yuan would directly break through to the Twelfth Level.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 286: No matter, the Lord of the Silver Galaxy is watching over us, just fight with all your might (please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue had already greatly underestimated Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>Over two thousand years old--</p><p></p><p>Cultivated to the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Comprehended dozens of cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>As well as more than ten advanced cosmic powers. </p><p></p><p>And one primordial-level cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>Such a monstrous genius, no matter which universe he was in.</p><p></p><p>Could be described as earth-shattering and unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, it shouldn't be possible to comprehend the laws of space so quickly, right? </p><p></p><p>Those aren't ordinary laws, but pillar laws!</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue found it hard to believe. It knew that the "Void Interpretation" left behind by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower would definitely bring great help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But at most it was just help, not the owner of Magic Jade Tower personally comprehending the laws of space. It mainly depended on Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>The "Void Interpretation" was abstruse and hard to understand. If one couldn't comprehend it, let alone helping, it might even be counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, how could there possibly be such a..."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji muttered to itself, seemingly unable to find the words to describe Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan used absolute space to isolate the inside from outside, dissipating and eliminating all the pressure bearing down.</p><p></p><p>He quickly walked through one-third of the way.</p><p></p><p>As he continued deeper, the pressure around him became increasingly heavy and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, illusory creatures condensed and pounced towards Lin Yuan as if baring fangs and brandishing claws.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold back anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart sank and he immediately began to activate cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly endless pressure kept surging. Even relying on absolute space, it was difficult to completely isolate it. Stronger methods had to be used.</p><p></p><p>Phew...</p><p></p><p>Various cosmic powers continuously combined, with more than ten advanced cosmic powers as the main body and the primordial-level original power as the core. All the cosmic powers perfectly fused together.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Lin Yuan often used the pressure from the second floor of the Black Tower to temper himself and his use of cosmic powers. Naturally, it wasn't without gains.</p><p></p><p>The current method of fusing all cosmic powers was Lin Yuan's greatest achievement. It could make the power of each cosmic power nearly double in its eruption.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, withstanding the attacks of the illusory creatures, strode towards the center.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji closely watched the situation on the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"If relying only on these, it will be very difficult to pass the second floor..."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji muttered to itself. It used "very difficult" to express its opinion.</p><p></p><p>Very difficult, but not impossible.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan comprehended the laws of space in just a few short years, the humanoid stone statue Shengji didn't dare to be too certain about anything, lest it gets slapped in the face afterwards.</p><p></p><p>No choice, Lin Yuan had already created too many miracles.</p><p></p><p>So now it left room in any of its opinions.</p><p></p><p>"The pressure will get greater and greater after the second floor..."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji thought inwardly. Many 9th stage lifeforms could often walk through the first two-thirds of the way.</p><p></p><p>But in the last one-third of the way, they would be crushed, leading to the failure of the trial.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current state, there was a high possibility he would be similar to these 9th stage lifeforms that failed the trial.</p><p></p><p>After all, the 9th stage lifeforms that could pass the second floor of the Black Tower all passed through the first two-thirds very easily.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's steps gradually slowed. When he reached the last one-third of the way, the terrifying pressure was like substance, filling every inch of the void.</p><p></p><p>"Without using the 'Strengthening' divine ability, it will be very difficult for me to pass the second floor by relying on my own power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inwardly sighed. This second floor of the Black Tower was indeed specially prepared for 9th stage lifeforms. He had comprehended the complete laws of space and grasped so many cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Yet still had no hope of passing through.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see."</p><p></p><p>"Walk a few more steps."</p><p></p><p>"If the timing is right, I'll use the 'Strengthening' divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. This kind of divine ability could only be maintained for ten breaths of time, so he had to get as close as possible. Otherwise, if the duration of the divine ability ended and he was still a bit short of passing through, wouldn't that be a terrible loss.</p><p></p><p>The 'Strengthening' divine ability was not like absolute space, cosmic powers and other methods. It required Lin Yuan to pay a price for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>It would be bad if he didn't pass the second floor and fell into a weakened state himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>After nearly half an hour, he reached a position about fifty meters from the central area.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan could almost be said to be struggling with each step. The extremely heavy pressure locked Lin Yuan in place.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for absolute space and the many fused cosmic powers isolating him, Lin Yuan estimated he would be crushed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Still fifty meters..."</p><p></p><p>"It's enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan composed himself and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>On the main planet of the Silver Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's real body opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Strands of blood-colored aura intertwined and collided, forming a complex divine ability imprint.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this divine ability imprint appeared, it quickly merged into Lin Yuan's flesh body. In an instant, the strength of Lin Yuan's flesh and blood began to surge, increasing tenfold.</p><p></p><p>The flesh led the soul, the soul led the mind and will. In a flash, all of Lin Yuan surged tenfold.</p><p></p><p>Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>On the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The instant he actively activated the 'Strengthening' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>This thread of Lin Yuan's mind and will also surged tenfold.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the power of absolute space and the power of dozens of cosmic powers soared together.</p><p></p><p>The 'Strengthening' divine ability only acted on Lin Yuan's flesh, soul, mind, will and other aspects. It did not have an amplifying effect on the comprehension of laws and the power of cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>But the surge of the mind and will would also affect these aspects.</p><p></p><p>The mind and will were fundamental. For example, with the same level of comprehension of the laws of space, when wielded by an 8th stage lifeform versus a 9th stage lifeform, the power displayed would be completely different.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>After the mind and will were amplified tenfold, Lin Yuan immediately felt that the originally suffocating pressure had vanished.</p><p></p><p>As if breaking free from shackles, his whole being became extremely unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately strode forward.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the pressure bearing down from the second floor of the Black Tower no longer posed any obstruction to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only in the last five meters did he pause for a moment. In the end, with only four breaths of time remaining, he passed the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"He really passed through?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the nine-story Black Tower, the humanoid stone statue Shengji fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Even though it had predicted this possibility early on... After all, based on Lin Yuan's performance of comprehending the laws of space, it seemed that passing the second floor of the Black Tower as an 8th stage wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p></p><p>But when this scene truly appeared before it, the humanoid stone statue Shengji's heart still surged with shock.</p><p></p><p>"His aura soared at the end. Did he use some kind of eruption secret art?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengji guessed inwardly. The owner of the Magic Jade Tower left behind a rule that during the tower challenge, the use of any 'external force' was prohibited.</p><p></p><p>But eruption-type secret arts completely originated from oneself and did not count as 'external forces'.</p><p></p><p>So in the end, Lin Yuan passing through...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Passing the second floor of the Black Building, in compliance with the rules.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue of Shen Ji disappeared and reappeared in the central area of the second floor of the Black Building. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also standing here at this moment. He had passed through the last part of the second floor in just four breaths' time, with the duration of the enhanced "Divine Power" lasting six more breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shen Ji, can I go challenge the third floor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not plan to waste the last six breaths. At present, he felt unprecedentedly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? You can." </p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji also saw Lin Yuan's state and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately went up the black stairs towards the third floor.</p><p></p><p>There were still four breaths of duration left.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan entered the third floor, he felt the ubiquitous terrifying pressure.</p><p></p><p>This pressure was so great that it seemed as if a universe was collapsing, and even though Lin Yuan's power had surged tenfold, he still felt absolute emptiness around his body, and dozens of universal forces rapidly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned quickly.</p><p></p><p>Even during the duration of the "Enhancement" divine power, it was so strenuous. Once the "Enhancement" ended and he fell into weakness again, the outcome was imaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the difficulty of the third floor, Lin Yuan decisively retreated.</p><p></p><p>This time entering the third floor, he had no intention of passing through at all. He just didn't want to waste the duration of the "Enhancement" divine power and planned to go up and take a look and try it out.</p><p></p><p>"The third floor of the Black Building is specially prepared for extremely powerful existences among ninth-level lives and tenth-level lives. It's perfectly normal that you can't pass through it."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji couldn't help but say when he saw Lin Yuan come back down.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful existences among ninth-level lives were similar to the invincible eighth-level beings.</p><p></p><p>They had battle power that surpassed their own level.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. Let alone passing the third floor, even staying on the third floor, he was unable to resist the pressure coming from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too big.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Since you passed the second floor, according to the rules set by the master back then, you will receive a treasure from the second-floor reward treasury."</p><p></p><p>"The value of the treasure depends on your performance when passing the second floor."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue looked at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>"Treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>He had seen many treasures in the second-floor reward treasury of the Black Building, many of which were rare items unheard of in the main world.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of your speed performance in passing the second floor, you can only be considered average among the practitioners who have passed the second floor in the past."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>"The speed was indeed not fast."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. In the last fifty meters, he basically didn't stop when activating the "Enhancement" divine power, but it wasn't fast before that. On average, it matched the stone statue's evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"But in terms of strength..."</p><p></p><p>Eighth level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was only at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>Yet he passed the second floor. Even during the most prosperous period of the Magic Jade Building, this had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed eighth-level lives that challenged the second floor and even walked halfway, but they all failed in the end. No one had passed through like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, based on the overall evaluation, you can choose any treasure from the second and third floor reward treasuries of the Black Building."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Compared with when Lin Yuan passed the first floor and could choose three treasures from the first and second floors...</p><p></p><p>This time Lin Yuan could only choose one, but it should be noted that the selection range here was expanded to the third floor.</p><p></p><p>Any item taken out from the third-floor reward treasury would surpass the second and first floors by who knows how much. The stone statue Shen Ji opening up the third-floor reward treasury to Lin Yuan was, strictly speaking, somewhat against the rules.</p><p></p><p>But the stone statue Shen Ji believed that even if the master of the Magic Jade Building returned, he would not have any objection to his decision. Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude were too monstrous.</p><p></p><p>"Here is the reward list. Take your time to choose."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji waved his hand, and one after another treasure phantoms appeared in front.</p><p></p><p>Number B0001 Alien Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Solar Yuan Shen finally arrived at this battlefield, near the largest permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>"That rift..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the terrifying rift spanning under the sky in the distance, over 30,000 meters long, emitting a deep and distant aura that made one's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the amplification effect on the accumulation of boundary-breaking power..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately approached and carefully sensed it. The medium-sized alien battlefield where the Lunar Yuan Shen was located only had a permanent spatial rift of 10,000 meters in length.</p><p></p><p>Far inferior to the 30,000-meter-long permanent spatial rift before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now the speed of accumulating boundary-breaking power is... one thread every 150 days?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The initial accumulation speed of boundary-breaking power was one thread every 333 days.</p><p></p><p>Finally, going to the medium-sized alien battlefield and relying on that 10,000-meter-long permanent spatial rift, it only took 200 days to accumulate one thread of boundary-breaking power.</p><p></p><p>Now it only took 150 days.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the war with the Feather Tribe comes to an end, I must station a Yuan Shen clone on this battlefield in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even on the B0001 battlefield where the intensity of war remained high all year round, there would be no threat.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two years passed.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the B0001 battlefield, both the Feather Tribe and human civilization deployed vast armies of powerhouses on both sides.</p><p></p><p>The White Cloud Star Lord and other human eighth-level invincible evolved beings stood under the sky, watching the Feather Tribe's side with solemn gazes.</p><p></p><p>"White Cloud, the Feather Tribe must be determined to win this time. In such a short time, they have launched an all-out battlefield, obviously with the confidence of certain victory."</p><p></p><p>An eighth-level invincible whispered.</p><p></p><p>If they were only evenly matched in strength or did not show overwhelming superiority, the Feather Tribe would not launch the decisive battle so quickly. They would definitely accumulate strength as much as possible to increase their chances of winning.</p><p></p><p>Now that the other party was so impatient, they were apparently quite confident and believed they could devour the human civilization's deployment on this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As fellow top tribes, even if the Feather Tribe was slightly weaker than the human civilization, the gap was not big, and they often had the upper hand on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, if it weren't for our human civilization being tied down by the Insect Tribe Grand Alliance and the Starry Sky Grand Alliance, making it impossible to mobilize powerhouses to come over, how could the Feather Tribe seize the opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Another eighth-level invincible said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization generally had the advantage on the battlefields they opened up to the outside, but there would also be local disadvantages.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, the human civilization decided to support several other battlefields, so it was impossible to take care of everything, which would lead to insufficient support for the remaining battlefields.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>The White Cloud Star Lord was at ease. "The Silver River Star Lord has already arrived at the battlefield and is probably paying attention to us now. You all just fight with all your might later."</p>

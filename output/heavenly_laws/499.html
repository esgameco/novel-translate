        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Territory of the Calamity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe quickly returned after leaving the main star of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>The black robe he was wearing was bestowed by the Ancestor, which could conceal all auras. Unless one stared at him intently, even a Twelfth Realm Ultimate would overlook him unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the territory, there was a secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe arrived at this place.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" At this moment, a voice silently reached his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I have informed the Lord of the Milky Way of everything."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe immediately said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"That's good." The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe said.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I don't quite understand." The figure in the black robe thought for a moment and couldn't help but say, "Those Twelfth Realm powerhouses from the peak tribal forces are going to join hands to deal with the Lord of the Milky Way, and we don't need to participate. Why did we still actively inform the Lord of the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>This was also the biggest confusion for the figure in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt about the potential of the Lord of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the fact that the Calamity Tribe did not join the plan to deal with the Lord of the Milky Way could be roughly understood as they disdained to take action.</p><p></p><p>But directly informing the Lord of the Milky Way? What was the reason for this? After all, if the Lord of the Milky Way were to perish or fail in the breakthrough to the Ultimate Realm, it would also benefit the Calamity Tribe, at least there would be one less peak expert in the Dao Severing Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the Lord of the Milky Way is so easy to deal with?" The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he?" The figure in the black robe was a little confused.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen Twelfth Realm Ultimates had joined forces to plan, even resorting to that strange blood. With such a large formation, even if they couldn't completely kill the Lord of the Milky Way, they could definitely have a great impact on him.</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand."</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell anyone about this."</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe didn't want to explain further and stopped talking after saying this.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe immediately bowed his head.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious and unknowable place.</p><p></p><p>A plain and ordinary wooden house stood there.</p><p></p><p>A figure sat in front of the wooden house, with a deep gaze, looking into the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the gaze that recently peeked into this place came from that little fellow, the Lord of the Milky Way?" At this moment, a voice came from inside the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe outside the wooden house spoke.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" The voice inside the wooden house was unbelievable, "To be able to peek into this place, one needs to have at least the peak understanding of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time, and it can only be done through a spatial-temporal treasure. But the Lord of the Milky Way is only at the Eleventh Realm, how could he..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget the many rule models contained in the Eleventh Realm of the Dao." The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe outside the wooden house said.</p><p></p><p>"Those rule models, we have not seen them, so we cannot prove how high the rule understanding of the Lord of the Milky Way is." The figure inside the wooden house still found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings of human civilization had seen the many rule models contained in the Eleventh Realm of the Dao and confirmed that Lin Yuan's rule understanding surpassed theirs.</p><p></p><p>But other Twelfth Realm aliens had not seen them with their own eyes, so they could not judge the level of the Lord of the Milky Way's rule understanding.</p><p></p><p>"The rule understanding of the peak of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time is not easy to achieve. In all these years, no one at the Twelfth Realm has touched it, but it appeared before the Eleventh Realm of the Dao was even born?" The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe outside the wooden house smiled and said, "I don't think this is a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"If the Lord of the Milky Way really has the peak understanding of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time, those Twelfth Realm experts won't be able to suppress him at all, let alone use that strange blood to influence him."</p><p></p><p>"I informed the Lord of the Milky Way of this intelligence in advance, which is a win-win situation."</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate of the Calamity Tribe outside the wooden house said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>To suppress the Lord of the Milky Way, they must first seal his space-time domain, but the Lord of the Milky Way possesses the peak understanding of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time, which has deprived them of the prerequisite for the space-time seal.</p><p></p><p>Without the seal, the Lord of the Milky Way would have the ability to scatter his divine sense and incarnations, rendering the strange blood useless.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"After the eleventh time of traversing, I still haven't gone to the Magic Jade Space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about the reward on the seventh floor of the Black Tower in the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the solar divine sense walking in the cosmic starry sky descended into the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade Space was as quiet as ever, and Lin Yuan directly appeared in front of the nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>As one of the remaining sequence members of the Magic Jade Tower, Lin Yuan had high authority in this Magic Jade Space and could appear at any location at will.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh floor?" Lin Yuan looked at the majestic Black Tower in the distance. Before his eleventh traversal, he had tried to break through the seventh floor of the Black Tower, but failed in the end.</p><p></p><p>The understanding of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time was indeed in the Twelfth Realm Dao Severing domain, but Lin Yuan was not truly a Twelfth Realm Dao Severing expert. As for the seventh floor of the Black Tower?</p><p></p><p>Only Twelfth Realm Dao Severing experts had a chance to break through it.</p><p></p><p>It was a chance, not that all Twelfth Realm Dao Severing experts could break through it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan had stopped at the last part of the seventh floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Planning to try the seventh floor again?" The smiling stone statue of Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what Lin Yuan wanted to try was not the seventh floor, but the eighth floor.</p><p></p><p>With the Space-Time Seventh Realm and the Chaos Rules, Lin Yuan had no doubt about his ability to break through the seventh floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's begin." The stone statue of Shen Ji did not say more.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see how Lin Yuan would break through the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>After all, the nine-story Black Tower built by the Master of the Magic Jade Tower, the seventh floor could only be broken through by some Dao Severing experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was only at the Eleventh Realm, but he had stubbornly broken through most of the seventh floor. "Good." Lin Yuan directly appeared at the beginning of the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>"Too simple." Lin Yuan glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the eyes of Lin Yuan, who had reached the Seventh Realm of Space-Time, the various space-time mazes and barriers of the Seventh Floor were as simple as children's play.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took nine consecutive steps. Each step covered a large portion of the Seventh Floor of the Black Tower, until the ninth step appeared at the 'end' of the Seventh Floor.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Outside the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower, the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji was a bit confused. He had planned to watch how Lin Yuan would get through the various space-time mazes of the Seventh Floor, but Lin Yuan had directly reached the 'end'.</p><p></p><p>How could this be? The human-shaped stone statue could not understand. If he had not confirmed that Lin Yuan had started climbing the tower, he would have suspected that Lin Yuan had used the privileges of a Sequence member to directly appear at the 'end' of the Seventh Floor.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the realization of the Seventh Realm of Space-Time?" </p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue kept looking back and finally confirmed this.</p><p></p><p>To get through the Seventh Floor of the Black Tower, the requirement for the understanding of the rules of space and time was at the peak of the Sixth Realm or close to the peak of the Sixth Realm. But Lin Yuan had only taken a few steps and reached the end, which could only mean one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, Lin Yuan's understanding of space and time was far beyond the peak of the Sixth Realm. He had reached the Seventh Realm of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>This made the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji feel as if he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when Lin Yuan descended into the Magical Jade Space this time, the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji had already mentally prepared for Lin Yuan to get through the Seventh Floor.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had passed the previous six floors in this way.</p><p></p><p>But the human-shaped stone statue at most thought that Lin Yuan's understanding of space and time had reached the peak of the Sixth Realm, and the Seventh Realm? The understanding of space and time of the Lord of the Magical Jade Tower was only at the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was only an Eleventh-Rank life form, and his realization of the Sixth Realm of space-time was already shocking and unbelievable, let alone the Seventh Realm? Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji appeared at the 'end' of the Seventh Floor.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan with a complex gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I still want to try the Eighth Floor," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji thought for a moment and did not say anything else.</p><p></p><p>If it were other members of the Magical Jade Tower, even if they were at the Dao-Splitting Realm of the Twelfth Rank, the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji would still try to persuade them.</p><p></p><p>Only those at the Dao-Splitting Realm had a chance of getting through the Seventh Floor of the Black Tower, while the Eighth Floor required the peak of the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower? That was the peak of the Chaotic Realm. To get through the Ninth Floor of the Black Tower, one's strength, even if not yet at the level of a Chaotic Saint, would not be too far off.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji felt that he should not say too much.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately entered the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji began to watch attentively.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Floor of the Black Tower was filled with endless space-time vortices. Lin Yuan carefully observed for a while, and with the understanding of the Seventh Realm of space-time, he easily passed through most of it.</p><p></p><p>"The back part."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the latter half of the path, where the space-time vortices were even more dense. Even with the understanding of the Seventh Realm of space-time, it would still be difficult to get through.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of my life is still a bit weak." Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Eighth Floor of the Black Tower did not test the essence of one's life, but even so, Lin Yuan was aware of the gap between his life essence and those at the peak of the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and immediately, surges of Chaotic Qi emerged from the depths of the void. These Chaotic Qi quickly condensed into forms, empowering the incarnation of Lin Yuan's will, rapidly elevating the essence of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Chaotic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji in the Seventh Floor fell silent again. </p><p></p><p>What had he seen? The Chaotic Realm?</p><p></p><p>If this were during the prosperous times of the Magical Jade Tower, seeing the Chaotic Realm would not be a strange occurrence.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Realm?</p><p></p><p>And it was seen on the body of an Eleventh-Rank life form?</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji felt that his understanding was being shattered.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>With the aid of the Chaotic Qi, Lin Yuan swept through the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower with ease, until he reached the final one-hundredth part of the path.</p><p></p><p>"Here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped, carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>"If the essence of my life were a bit stronger, I should be able to get through." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Floor of the Black Tower had very low requirements for the essence of one's life. Basically, as long as one was at the Mastery Realm, they could reach it.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was only at the Eleventh Rank. The Lord of the Magical Jade Tower himself probably never imagined that the Eighth Floor of the Nine Floors of the Black Tower he had opened would one day be challenged by an Eleventh-Rank climber.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"I'm ashamed, I couldn't get through it." Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji's expression was stiff.</p><p></p><p>An Eleventh-Rank life form almost got through the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower? And he was ashamed?</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji did not know how to respond to Lin Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"This is the reward list for passing the Seventh Floor." The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji calmed down and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look." Lin Yuan's eyes lit up, and he immediately began to browse through the list.</p><p></p><p>The reward list for the Seventh Floor of the Black Tower was mostly Mastery Realm treasures and secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>After careful selection, Lin Yuan ultimately chose a secret technique called the "Abyss Eye".</p><p></p><p>This secret technique was not a physical attack technique, nor was it a soul attack technique, but rather a mental will attack technique. With Lin Yuan's current mental will strength, activating the "Abyss Eye" would greatly impact even other Twelfth-Rank ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's various incarnations roamed through the various parts of the universe and the Chaotic Void, perceiving the fluctuations of different rules.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan was also pondering how to get through the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower. He was only a hair's breadth away from the 'end' of the Eighth Floor and could step over it at any time.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

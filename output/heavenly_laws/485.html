            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 485 - Shatter (Returning tomorrow, seeking Wave Moon's initial monthly ticket guarantee)</p><p></p><p>Compared to a thousand years ago, the "egg" within his body, nurtured by myriad rules, has now solidified into a tangible form. Even Lin Yuan could feel the vast fluctuations within this "egg".</p><p></p><p>"What has been nurtured inside should be the Chaos Rules," Lin Yuan thought as he gazed at the majestic giant "egg".</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, this "egg" was the fruition of his comprehension over the past millennium, or more precisely, the culmination of his understanding of various rules.</p><p></p><p>The complete solidification of the majestic giant "egg" indicated that Lin Yuan was infinitely close to awakening the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>At least now, the Chaos Rules were no longer vague and elusive to Lin Yuan, but concrete, just like the "egg" in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Chaos Rules," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the attainment of the Chaos Rules at the 11th Realm was considered a legendary legend. Even for existences at the level of the Mysterious Emperor and the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master, they had only heard of it, never having witnessed it in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Because the attainment of the Chaos Rules at the 11th Realm was truly arduous.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan possessed a transcendent comprehension and had the Gate of Myriad Worlds, allowing him to traverse and descend upon the myriad realms, leveraging the differences between dimensions and the opportunities in various worlds, ultimately reaching this point.</p><p></p><p>For others at the 11th Realm? How many detours would they have to take? How many resources would they have to expend to awaken the Chaos Rules?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps having a Chaos Realm expert demonstrate the complete Chaos Rules in person could be of some help in awakening the Chaos Rules," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The 12th Realm Chaos Realm experts had essentially awakened the Chaos Rules and could fully manifest their understanding of the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>But being able to manifest it and enabling an 11th Realm life to awaken it were two completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>The heavens, the earth, the universe, the Chaotic Void - they were all filled with endless profundities, yet how many lives could truly reach the end of it?</p><p></p><p>"The 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm"</p><p></p><p>Fragments of the 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had begun attempting to open up the 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm when he was still at the 10th Realm, and after entering the 11th Realm, he formally perfected it.</p><p></p><p>But it was only in the recent decades, with the help of the myriad rules at the core of the Immortal Realm's source, that Lin Yuan was finally able to completely perfect the 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm was the ultimate leap, the last boundary, a summation and refinement of the previous ten realms.</p><p></p><p>The 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm that Lin Yuan had opened up was based on the Space-Time Fusion Rules, specifically establishing 33,333 space-time models from the Space-Time First Realm to the Space-Time Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rule models were how the evolution scholars of human civilization expressed the rules of heaven and earth in a form that was easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>Just like the various physical and mathematical formulas - they did not exist inherently, but were summarized by those great scientists through constant calculations.</p><p></p><p>The rule models were the same. They were the painstaking distillations of the most fundamental rules of the universe by the evolution scholars of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rule basic model, the spatial rule core model, and the temporal rule model that Lin Yuan initially comprehended were all like this.</p><p></p><p>However, the evolution scholars of human civilization, limited in their vantage point, could only summarize at most thousands of temporal rule models.</p><p></p><p>And even if they were to fully awaken all these thousands of temporal rule models, they would still be far from truly comprehending the Temporal Rules.</p><p></p><p>The rule models mastered by human civilization only reached the level of Temporal Rule models. As for more advanced Space-Time Rule models? They were simply unable to materialize them.</p><p></p><p>This was not because the evolution scholars of human civilization were hoarding knowledge, but because their vantage point constrained them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was different. With his transcendent comprehension, his understanding of the rules quickly surpassed the collective efforts of all the evolution scholars of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>And this trip to the Immortal Realm, with his core insights from the source, had taken Lin Yuan's understanding of the rules to unprecedented heights.</p><p></p><p>With the comprehension of hundreds of millions of pillar-level fusion rules at the Space-Time Seventh Realm and beyond, he had finally opened up the rule model of the Space-Time Fusion Rules, encompassing the Space-Time First Realm to the Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that opening up a corresponding rule model and truly awakening the corresponding rule were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Even among the 11th Realm perfected evolution experts of human civilization who had attained the Space-Time Fifth Realm comprehension, not a single one had been able to open up even a single-realm Space-Time Fusion Rule model.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Supremes were the same - their Space-Time Fusion Rule comprehension had reached the Sixth Realm, but to open up a rule model applicable to all evolution experts was still as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Space-Time Fusion Rule model, Lin Yuan had also added some other rule models to the 11th Realm Martial Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>These rule models were for some special rules that Lin Yuan had perfected and opened up in his spare time.</p><p></p><p>"The 33,333 Space-Time Fusion Rule models will make it easier for future Martial Dao evolution experts to comprehend space-time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>These tens of thousands of Space-Time Fusion Rule models could also be applied to other evolution paths, but the effect would be most optimal for Martial Dao evolution experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even with these clear rule models for reference, awakening all the Space-Time Rule models was still no easy task.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Gao Wuyou (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Gatekeeper of the Gate of Myriad Worlds]</p><p>[Bound Talent: Transcendent Comprehension]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: Bloodline Rebirth】</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: Moving Mountains】</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: Strengthening】</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: Elemental Body】</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: World】</p><p></p><p>【Spiritual Abilities: Tearing the Heavens】</p><p></p><p>【Current Status: Consciousness Descends】</p><p></p><p>【Remaining Residency Time: 98 Years】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the illusory text below his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>"There are still 98 years of residency time left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a while, and his figure disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Kaiyuan Martial City.</p><p></p><p>This is the first martial city in the Immortal Realm, corresponding to the major immortal cities of the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand years, the number of martial cultivators in the 33 immortal domains of the Immortal Realm has become countless, and Kaiyuan Martial City is the sacred place in the hearts of all martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>Because the opening of this martial city was with the guidance of the Ancestor of the Martial Way, the first lord of the martial city was also the direct disciple of the Ancestor of the Martial Way.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the martial city.</p><p></p><p>The majestic Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>At the highest seat, a figure silently appeared and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Below, Li Qing seemed to have sensed something and immediately excitedly bowed to the figure on the throne.</p><p></p><p>In over a thousand years, Li Qing had only seen Lin Yuan a few times.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang, Nie Yun, and other Martial Dao Ninth Realm cultivators were also greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>They all came from the Spirit Realm and had followed Lin Yuan to traverse through various realms multiple times.</p><p></p><p>"You may all rise."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the strongest martial cultivators are people like Li Qing, who are Martial Dao Ninth Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and the details of the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures poured into the minds of Li Qing and the others.</p><p></p><p>Rather than saying that the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures were opened up by Lin Yuan, it would be more accurate to say that they were recreated based on his own insights, which is quite similar to the evolutionary paths of the ancient gods in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The "ancient god" evolutionary paths spread by the ancient gods were also recreated based on their own experiences.</p><p></p><p>In passing down the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures, Lin Yuan had no worries.</p><p></p><p>For example, would future martial cultivators quickly borrow the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures to cultivate to the Eleventh Realm perfection and then surpass Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside whether this kind of thing can happen given Lin Yuan's cultivation speed, even if it did happen, as long as Lin Yuan, the founder of the Martial Dao, did not die, future martial cultivators would not be able to surpass him.</p><p></p><p>This was also a certain realization that Lin Yuan had recently, as the number of martial cultivators had increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Any evolutionary path or cultivation system, if the founder dies, naturally everything will be free.</p><p></p><p>Any cultivator of that evolutionary path or cultivation system may have the chance to break through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>But as long as the founder is still alive, the fundamental imprint of the evolutionary path will be on the founder, suppressing all the cultivators of the same evolutionary path in the current world.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures?"</p><p></p><p>The minds of Li Qing and the others were in a muddle, and they spent a lot of time barely digesting the Martial Dao Eleventh Realm Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved more than 30,000 space-time fusion rule models, as well as many other rule models, which was still too difficult for Martial Dao Ninth Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not actively sealed most of the content and only allowed Li Qing and the others to unseal the seal after reaching a certain realm, they might have had their spiritual will shattered long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this..."</p><p></p><p>After barely recovering, a sense of unease began to rise in Li Qing's heart.</p><p></p><p>Given her level, she should be far from qualified to access the Eleventh Realm Scriptures, so why did Lin Yuan pass on such a precious cultivation path to her?</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will enter seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"It will be for a long time, and I will not interfere in the affairs of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was also the truth, as there were still 98 years left before the end of his traversal.</p><p></p><p>During these 98 years, Lin Yuan planned to concentrate all his mind and spirit, putting all his efforts into comprehending the rules.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to try to break through to the Chaos Dao before the end of his residency.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing and the other martial cultivators immediately bowed and responded.</p><p></p><p>After giving a few more instructions, Lin Yuan's avatar disappeared from the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared in the vast void outside the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This place was no longer within the Immortal Realm, but in the boundless void outside the worlds.</p><p></p><p>In this void, the Immortal Realm was undisputedly the highest world, and countless subordinate worlds floated below it.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan kept rising, observing the Immortal Realm from above.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, the Immortal Realm was vast and immense, formed by the constant interweaving and influence of countless rules.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan's other divine sense was located at the core of the Immortal Realm, observing the fundamental rules of the Immortal Realm from the most microscopic perspective.</p><p></p><p>The two combined.</p><p></p><p>It was like the collision of heaven and earth, and all things began to be reborn in destruction.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, the hundreds of millions of rules Lin Yuan had comprehended seemed to have undergone a certain transformation, slowly collapsing and merging into one.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>A slight cracking sound echoed in Lin Yuan's spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The majestic "egg" formed by the interweaving of countless rules that had been hovering in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, a crack had appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

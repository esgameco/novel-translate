            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Two-Dimensional World.</p><p></p><p>Snow was falling heavily, the world a vast expanse of white. </p><p></p><p>Inside Sea Moon City, Lin Yuan strolled along the streets, occasionally stopping to sit at a roadside table and savor the city's delicacies.</p><p></p><p>"Sea Moon City was established by the Sea Moon tribe, far away from the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms. There is little conflict here, as the Sea Moon people dislike fighting amongst themselves and are very friendly towards outsiders."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sampled the food, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Over the span of ten thousand years, Lin Yuan had basically explored this two-dimensional world thoroughly. This was his second visit to Sea Moon City, the previous one being eight thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was only willing to visit a place or city twice if he was particularly fond of it. </p><p></p><p>The cuisine of Sea Moon City was quite distinctive, and the main reason for Lin Yuan's return was to savor these delicacies once more.</p><p></p><p>"Eight thousand years have passed. The original residents have gone through dozens of generations, but the taste of this food hasn't changed much," Lin Yuan remarked, sipping a beverage made from dozens of special fruit juices with a uniquely delicious flavor.</p><p></p><p>"The snow is getting heavier."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan set down his drink and gazed up at the snowflakes drifting down from the celestial heights.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, each snowflake was like a work of art, resembling translucent gemstones.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan extended his hand to catch the falling flakes, carefully observing their intricate internal structures. Like a maze, each strand was incredibly complex, yet together they formed a perfect snowflake - a simplified version of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan studied them, the more entranced he became, his entire consciousness immersed in the snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is celestial, observing the essence of snowflakes, accumulating ever deeper insights.]</p><p></p><p>Utterly absorbed in the perfection of the snowflakes' structures, Lin Yuan paid no heed to the intensifying snowfall. Other people had retreated indoors, leaving only Lin Yuan sitting outside.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, is that person an outsider?" a young girl inside a shop asked curiously, observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His attire clearly distinguished Lin Yuan from the other Sea Moon City residents, immediately marking him as an outsider.</p><p></p><p>"That outsider is so silly. The snow is falling so heavily, yet he doesn't even come inside to take shelter," the little girl remarked, blinking her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't judge others so casually," the girl's mother gently chided, though her tone was rather meek.</p><p></p><p>This was a trait of Sea Moon tribe women - appearing gentle and frail, yet the city's residents, men and women alike, were quite fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes," the little girl obediently lowered her head in apology, looking aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"But if that person keeps letting the snow pour down on him, he'll surely fall ill," the mother said with a furrowed brow, glancing at the snow-covered Lin Yuan with some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At that moment:</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is celestial, observing the essence of snowflakes, breaking through to the Shaman Ancestor's 136th Realm.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he felt his inner energy shift. Unable to contain himself, he burst into boisterous laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Despite Lin Yuan's attempts to restrain his aura, the terrifying sound waves still sent rippling shockwaves through the air, causing all the residents of Sea Moon City - even the City Lord, a Shaman Emperor - to display looks of horror.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone inside the shop also covered their heads, faces contorted in pain.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yuan noticed in time and immediately stopped laughing, preventing any serious harm to the city's residents.</p><p></p><p>"Time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around and vanished.</p><p></p><p>Inside the shop, the little girl and her mother finally recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, that outsider's laughter was so terrifying," the girl trembled, huddling against her mother.</p><p></p><p>"That outsider must be an extremely powerful expert," the mother's voice quavered. She then glared at her daughter, "How many times have I told you not to judge others rashly? It's fortunate that powerful expert didn't take offense."</p><p></p><p>The mother felt a lingering sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>Just his laughter alone had caused such a reaction - even the strongest City Lord was likely incapable of such a feat.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had taken issue with her daughter's earlier words, it could have meant disaster for them both.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Mother," the little girl replied, eyes brimming with tears, clearly aware of her mistake.</p><p></p><p>Outside Sea Moon City.</p><p></p><p>A figure hovered in midair.</p><p></p><p>The heavy snowfall rapidly melted within a hundred meters of this figure, evaporated by the immense blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years, the Shaman Ancestor's 136th Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It had taken him over three hundred years to progress from an ordinary person in this two-dimensional world to the 50th Shaman Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, advancing from the 50th to the 136th Shaman Ancestor Realm had required ten thousand years of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied with this. From the 50th Shaman Ancestor Realm onward, each breakthrough was no longer a normal advancement, but a struggle to break free from the shackles and suppression of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan had planned to reach around the 100th Shaman Ancestor Realm within ten thousand years. Attaining the 136th Realm far exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Over these ten thousand years, the number of powerful experts from the myriad races has dwindled."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan hovered, gazing at the endless snowfall, his thoughts turning inward.</p><p></p><p>By his estimate, the total number of powerful experts from the myriad races in this two-dimensional world could not exceed one thousand now.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the other experts had been hunted down, but rather most realized there was no way out of this place. Instead of dying of old age here, they chose to...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This two-dimensional world, it would be better to give up and voluntarily extinguish the avatar early on. </p><p></p><p>Within the two-dimensional world, one cannot comprehend many rules. No matter how long one stays, it brings no improvement to the true self outside.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to go to Tian Shan Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. There was half a year left until the Tian Men (Celestial Gate) would open again.</p><p></p><p>The Luochuan Gathering Place.</p><p></p><p>After ten thousand years of evolution, the former Luochuan Gathering Place had long become the Luochuan City. The city lord position was taken by the descendants of Cha Ran Gu from back then.</p><p></p><p>As for Cha Ran Gu himself? He had died of old age long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Lin Yuan's relationship with him, Cha Ran Gu had lived an extremely comfortable life before his death, even his lifespan was longer than other cultivators of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Before heading to Tian Shan Mountain, Lin Yuan intentionally stopped at Luochuan City.</p><p></p><p>"The place where I lived back then is still preserved, without the slightest change." Lin Yuan saw at a glance the cave dwelling where he had secluded himself in cultivation long ago.</p><p></p><p>"In this two-dimensional world, I no longer have any familiars left." After staying in the ancient city of Luochuan for a short while, Lin Yuan left directly.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan went to the capital of the ancient Xueyuluo Nation.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Luochuan City, the emperor of the ancient Xueyuluo Nation had changed many generations. The title of Prince of Zhenbei that he once held had also been reclaimed by one of the later Xueyuluo emperors.</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand years, things and people change. Even for the strongest cultivators, most could hardly survive that long. One must know that the normal lifespan of a cultivator at the Wuzhu (Sage) level is only two to three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>To live past ten thousand years, one must at least reach the twentieth level of Wuzhu. Basically, only the minority of top-tier tenth level and eleventh level experts could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently observed all of this, and finally left the capital of the ancient Xueyuluo Nation.</p><p></p><p>With this departure, even if he still could not push open the Celestial Gate, Lin Yuan would not return again.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Tian Shan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from various races arrived early.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the 'liveliness' when the Celestial Gate opened for the first time, the peak of Tian Shan Mountain was much quieter this time.</p><p></p><p>Only a few hundred experts from various races had gathered sporadically.</p><p></p><p>"After ten thousand years, my excavation of the supreme weapon within my body far exceeds what it was ten thousand years ago. I estimate I can match the sixtieth level of Wuzhu."</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Tian Shan Mountain, the Four Celestial Kings stood silently, their eyes flickering with a hint of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Within this two-dimensional world, after cultivators from various races reached the tenth level of Wuzhu, they would be suppressed and limited by the heavens and earth here, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>But this limitation was for cultivators of various races. The suppression on supreme weapons would definitely be 'relaxed' a lot. The supreme weapon within the Four Celestial Kings' bodies contained part of the essence of a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Excavating the might of that supreme weapon was far easier than improving their own cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Without this supreme weapon, even if they had tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, the Four Celestial Kings could never have cultivated to the sixtieth level of Wuzhu.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I should be able to compete with the human 'Xueyuluo'," the Four Celestial Kings were full of ambition. "Human Xueyuluo, back then you didn't kill me, that was your biggest mistake."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings calmed their minds, their eyes surging with burning fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>At the central position of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared, no one knew when.</p><p></p><p>"The human Xueyuluo."</p><p></p><p>"The human Xueyuluo has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of various races around were startled, all looking over.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most of the experts came here just to see Lin Yuan once more, to see if he could push open the Celestial Gate this time.</p><p></p><p>"Human Xueyuluo!"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' fighting spirit soared as they looked towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something, glancing towards the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Just that one glance caused the Four Celestial Kings' minds to rumble. Their legs trembled uncontrollably. If they didn't forcefully borrow the power of the supreme weapon within their bodies, they might have directly collapsed to the ground at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"How could he be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings couldn't help roaring inwardly. Just one glance reduced them to such a sorry state, meaning the gap between them and Lin Yuan was far greater than ten thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>At least ten thousand years ago, facing Lin Yuan's one glance, they were not reduced to this state.</p><p></p><p>"How could human civilization give birth to such a freak." The Four Celestial Kings finally retreated several steps before barely managing to stand firm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced back at the Four Celestial Kings, also sensing the burning emotions they had towards him.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan didn't really care about the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, the Four Celestial Kings were far from being his match. After another ten thousand years, the gap between them would only grow larger.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan now, the only opponent in this two-dimensional world was the Celestial Gate itself.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, intense spatial fluctuations emerged once more in the sky above the peak of Tian Shan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Gate gradually took shape and manifested before the many experts of various races.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>In the vast space before a huge scroll painting, a half-meter-tall old man yawned and slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand years in this two-dimensional world was merely a short nap to him, an extremely brief moment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how far things have progressed in ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man stretched lazily and looked towards the huge scroll painting in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Clouds swirled within the painting, containing a vast, real world.</p><p></p><p>"This...?!"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man was dumbfounded at what he saw, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

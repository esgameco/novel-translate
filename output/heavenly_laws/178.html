        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Actually, it is not entirely accurate to call it an ultimate powerful weapon. </p><p></p><p>But at the very least, it is a rare treasure at the level of the twelfth celestial rank.</p><p></p><p>Only existences that transcend the eleventh celestial rank can defy the rules of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze compass must have appeared in this two-dimensional world a very, very long time ago. Was it left behind from the past?" Lin Yuan guessed.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world he is currently in has a primordial form of a 'white paper', ejected from the extremely distant ruins of the Great Abyss outside the universe. </p><p></p><p>Traversing the vast chaotic void, it eventually squeezed into the human civilization's universe.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, this 'white paper' absorbed who knows what, like how it absorbed Lin Yuan and other lifeforms, as well as how many powerful beings and treasures it absorbed.</p><p></p><p>But one thing is certain.</p><p></p><p>Only twelfth-rank lifeforms that have transcended the river of time can escape being flattened into two dimensions.</p><p></p><p>As for twelfth-rank treasures, rare items, and weapons, if they do not have a master controlling them and completely fall into the two-dimensional world, they may end up like this bronze compass - their divine might concealed, with only a faint mysterious aura circulating.</p><p></p><p>Even for a supreme being, if they do not resist and allow themselves to be absorbed into the two-dimensional 'white paper' world, their strength will likely be suppressed significantly.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze compass? Is it a twelfth-rank rare treasure? It may even be an ultimate powerful weapon?" Lin Yuan could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, twelfth-rank rare treasures are extremely precious, especially ultimate powerful weapons which are the foundations of the peak clans.</p><p></p><p>Wielding an ultimate powerful weapon can unleash attacks of the supreme level, which is how the permanent spatial rifts on small and medium-sized alien battlefields are created.</p><p></p><p>So far, the only opportunity Lin Yuan had to come into contact with twelfth-rank rare treasure weapons was when he passed through the fifth floor of the Demon Jade Space Black Building.</p><p></p><p>As a ninth-rank comprehender of the rules of time, Lin Yuan's reward for passing the Black Building's fifth floor included several twelfth-rank treasures and rare items that he could choose from.</p><p></p><p>Even so, until now Lin Yuan has not made a decision, because this opportunity is too precious.</p><p></p><p>And now, a bronze compass that is highly likely to be an ultimate powerful weapon has so easily appeared before him?</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan believes this bronze compass is probably an ultimate powerful weapon is because it is clearly man-made and did not form naturally, otherwise it could not have taken the distinct shape of a compass.</p><p></p><p>An ultimate powerful weapon is often refined from several or even dozens of twelfth-rank rare treasures and items as raw materials.</p><p></p><p>"If I can successfully leave this world, wouldn't that mean I can take this bronze compass out with me?" Lin Yuan's heart pounded with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Could this be a rare treasure weapon from the twelve celestial realms? In the two-dimensional world, it was ordinary, with only a faint mysterious aura circulating. But once leaving the two-dimensional world and appearing in the main universe, it became a treasure weapon of infinite divine power. </p><p></p><p>Within the main universe, because of that extradimensional aurora, the strongest human civilization was almost provoked into battle against the strongest pinnacle races, showing just how precious a treasure of this level is.</p><p></p><p>"Not only this bronze compass, but the blood rain tea tree from the Blood Rain Ancient Nation should also be a rare twelve-celestial treasure," Lin Yuan suddenly thought. </p><p></p><p>Just some tea leaves emanated a slight mysterious aura, so the blood rain tea tree that was the mother plant must be an existence no less than the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"Do the powerful races know about this?"  Lin Yuan pondered silently. At least he had not heard about it from the Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's acquisition of this bronze compass was also an extremely accidental occurrence. Even if the powerful races had similar experiences, they would definitely keep it secret.</p><p></p><p>As for the national treasures of the ancient nations, like the blood rain tea tree of the Blood Rain Ancient Nation, currently among the powerful races, the strongest was just the Shaman Emperor, with none having crossed into the Shaman Ancestor realm yet. </p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, they could not directly challenge the authority of the ancient nations. But Lin Yuan speculated that this day would not be too far off.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, there would be many powerful races becoming Shaman Ancestors. Even those eleventh-stage lifeforms, by mastering their own power, could forcibly surpass Shaman Ancestors by a large degree.</p><p></p><p>At that time, rare twelve-celestial treasures like this bronze compass would definitely be unable to remain hidden.</p><p></p><p>"In this two-dimensional world, there should not be few such rare twelve-celestial treasures," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just the twelve ancient nations alone each had their own national treasures, not to mention those scattered in various places, like this bronze compass Lin Yuan possessed.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."  </p><p></p><p>"At least for now I have obtained one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not think too much about the other twelve-celestial rare treasures. At this moment, his full attention was focused on the bronze compass before him.</p><p></p><p>"Using this compass requires fresh blood?" Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative, as when he first discovered this compass, he noticed traces of fresh blood on it.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and squeezed out more than ten drops of fresh blood onto the compass.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the copper needle suspended in the center of the compass began rapidly spinning.</p><p></p><p>Not long after...</p>

            <p>Chapter 214: Replacing the Will of Heaven with One's Own Heart, Return! (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The body of the Primordial Demon Tree grew increasingly robust, and an ancient, profound aura rushed forth. No matter how far away they were, as long as the living beings of the Qingqing World looked up, they could see that sacred tree supporting heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's cultivation had also reached a critical juncture. </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, you have comprehended many world secrets, and your own accumulation is gradually deepening]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, you have comprehended many world secrets, and your own accumulation is gradually deepening] </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, you have comprehended many world secrets, and your own accumulation is gradually deepening]</p><p></p><p>Creating a method to replace the world's secret techniques should have been impossible, equivalent to an ant climbing to the peak of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even with heaven-defying comprehension, it still requires a foundation and nourishment. The many secret techniques related to the world's consciousness in this realm are the most precious nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few hundred years, through trading with other foreign evil gods, Lin Yuan obtained many world consciousness secret techniques, pointing out specific directions for the deduction of his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension defies the heavens, you have comprehended many world secrets, and created a method to replace the world consciousness]</p><p></p><p>Numerous inspirations exploded in Lin Yuan's mind, and a complete secret technique took shape.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally done."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, a trace of emotion flashing in them.</p><p></p><p>For a full one hundred and eighty years, he was single-minded. </p><p></p><p>He no longer deduced the path of martial arts evolution.</p><p></p><p>He also no longer comprehended the core space model.</p><p></p><p>It was all for the sake of comprehending a method to replace the world consciousness before his stay limit arrived.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's plan, even if he couldn't comprehend the method to replace the world consciousness this time,</p><p></p><p>When he returned to the main world, he would still wait six or seven years,</p><p></p><p>Accumulating ten strands of boundary-breaking origin force, and descending to the Qingqing World again.</p><p></p><p>After all, completely possessing a world was too tempting, and being able to descend to the Qingqing World at any time with minimal cost was something Lin Yuan couldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>You should know,</p><p></p><p>The place Lin Yuan descended to wasn't just the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>It was the boundless foreign void that included the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>It encompassed countless foreign evil gods and worlds similar to the Qingqing World, and even had terrifying evil gods that had grown to the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he noticed the vast void outside the Qingqing World that Lin Yuan was determined to obtain the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>"This secret technique..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to focus on the method of replacing the world consciousness that he had just created.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique indeed had the potential to allow the instinctive consciousness of the Primordial Demon Tree to replace the Qingqing World's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Qingqing World's consciousness must have no ability to resist, that is, it must be in a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>It was also necessary to grasp the means to influence the world consciousness, which could be done by relying on the world sword.</p><p></p><p>The many limiting conditions could be said to be specially targeted at the current Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>From another perspective, the state of the Qingqing World was indeed a rare opportunity, with many conditions appearing at the same time, as if it had been specially prepared for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, if this kind of secret technique was used in the main world, I'm afraid it would be crushed to pieces by the vast consciousness of the main world the moment it was used..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>If we're talking about replacing the world consciousness, the best target would naturally be the main world.</p><p></p><p>If he could replace the consciousness of the main world, Lin Yuan would become the undisputed number one powerhouse among the myriad races in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Even the invincible supreme experts would have to bow their heads.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the prerequisite for using this secret technique was that the world consciousness had to be in a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>As for how to make the main world's consciousness fall into a deep slumber... Lin Yuan couldn't even imagine how to do it.</p><p></p><p>A battle between supreme experts?</p><p></p><p>Using the means of supreme experts and going all out,</p><p></p><p>It could cause permanent spatial rifts spanning millions, billions, or even trillions of miles.</p><p></p><p>But with the vastness of the main world, mere billions or even trillions of miles of permanent spatial rifts... even if they spanned billions of light years, they would be negligible to the main world.</p><p></p><p>"There's about ten years of stay time left."</p><p></p><p>"Let's start trying to replace the world consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't rest. After creating the secret technique, he immediately began to use it.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness began to sublimate and merge into the ocean of origin within the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>This was an innate ability of the Primordial Demon Tree, but Lin Yuan's merging here wasn't for the purpose of devouring the origin.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was in preparation for the upcoming replacement.</p><p></p><p>"It's so wonderful... Is this the most fundamental region of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed. He could feel the endless energy fluctuations, and everything that happened in the Qingqing World was reflected here.</p><p></p><p>"Those foreign evil gods are really too foolish. Such a perfect place, yet they all think about devouring it instead of comprehending and controlling it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the Primordial Demon Tree's desire for the Qingqing World's origin, that desire to devour it clean, and he couldn't help shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the thought of almost all foreign evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Devour.</p><p></p><p>Devour.</p><p></p><p>Devour.</p><p></p><p>However, in Lin Yuan's view, this was almost the most foolish course of action.</p><p></p><p>For example, if you have a chip that has gathered the crystallization of various high-tech achievements, but you end up melting it down to make iron?</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had overestimated those foreign evil gods.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to sense many wonders from the world's origin region because he had heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But foreign evil gods didn't have much comprehension. They were mostly driven by instinct. How could they look as deeply and as far as Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gently exhaled, and his own consciousness began to expand and sublimate.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, Lin Yuan's consciousness was dispersed to every corner of the origin region.</p><p></p><p>If the world consciousness hadn't been asleep, but was awake, it would have easily crushed Lin Yuan's consciousness at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest suspense.</p><p></p><p>A consciousness dispersed into countless tiny parts simply couldn't withstand the crushing of the vast world consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But the world consciousness was asleep.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this scene never happened.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lin Yuan was still extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>Even if the world consciousness was asleep, dispersing his consciousness like this still carried the risk of assimilation.</p><p></p><p>Once assimilated, Lin Yuan would completely lose himself. Although he would still replace the world consciousness in the end, it would essentially be no different from the consciousness being replaced.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan was very vigilant.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a trend of assimilation,</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Myriad Realms Gate would automatically operate and absorb all his consciousness into the gate, transmitting it back to the main world.</p><p></p><p>This was also Lin Yuan's greatest confidence in daring to attempt replacing the world consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He had the Myriad Realms Gate, which could avoid the most extreme situations.</p><p></p><p>At most, he would just return early, and the loss would be negligible to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>During these three years, Lin Yuan's consciousness, following the operation of the origin force, merged into every part of the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing World began to subtly change in some way.</p><p></p><p>This change was so subtle that even the Qingqing Alliance Leader, a peak seventh-stage expert, only sensed a tiny bit of it and wasn't very certain.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens above, there seemed to be...</p><p></p><p>A gigantic face appeared, which was Lin Yuan's face. His eyes were over a million miles wide, overlooking every detail of the Qingqing world.</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean I have successfully replaced it?" Lin Yuan thought to himself. At this moment, with just a single thought, he could appear anywhere in the Qingqing world.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to appear to be able to sense everything happening within the world.</p><p></p><p>"Am I the lord of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned, back inside the body of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Qingqing world, I am invincible," Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this very moment, he had completely replaced the world consciousness of the Qingqing world. The entire Qingqing world was like his body, which he could control at will.</p><p></p><p>"This power is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but gasp. The feeling of controlling a world was truly shocking, with the power of the world at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that if he were to face the invasion of the Ancestral Demon Tree now, there would be no pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the original world consciousness, the biggest difference with Lin Yuan was that he had specific thoughts and ideas and could take any action.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing world and the foreign evil gods were equivalent to herbivores and carnivores.</p><p></p><p>The world consciousness of the Qingqing world only had a general instinct. When facing the invasion of foreign evil gods, it only knew to take out all its power without any control over the details.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan replaced the original world consciousness and controlled everything. As long as there weren't dozens or hundreds of foreign evil gods, they could be directly ignored.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Essence Gold..."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, the Origin Essence Gold appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After nearly five hundred years of nurturing, the shape of the Origin Essence Gold had been completely finalized. It was a "bell shape" with many natural patterns engraved on the surface, ancient and vast, with traces of the passage of long years.</p><p></p><p>"My requirement for nurturing the Origin Essence Gold is defense, absolute defense. Not only physical defense but also spiritual and soul defense." Lin Yuan carefully examined the Origin Essence Gold.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Origin Essence Gold was precious lay in its growth potential and plasticity.</p><p></p><p>The latter plasticity meant it could be shaped into any kind of weapon. Lin Yuan possessed a heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was given time, he could grow to an unimaginable height. Therefore, the shaping of the Origin Essence Gold naturally focused on preserving life.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that nurturing the Origin Essence Gold does consume a lot of the world's origin. In five hundred years of nurturing, the world's origin has been reduced by at least 5% to 10%..." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate 5% to 10%. With the volume of the Qingqing world, even a small percentage would be enough to bankrupt an 8th-stage evolutionist in the main world.</p><p></p><p>"But it's worth it."</p><p></p><p>"After hundreds of years of nurturing, the Origin Essence Gold is almost fully formed. It should be usable after returning this time." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Origin Essence Gold, its defensive strength in the soul aspect was not inferior to an 8th-stage soul defense treasure.</p><p></p><p>The most valuable thing was that the Origin Essence Gold could be stacked with other weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan could simultaneously use an 8th-stage soul defense treasure and the Origin Essence Gold to guard his soul.</p><p></p><p>Under the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Alliance Leader and the various Deputy Leaders, Protectors, and Elders gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"Master." The Qingqing Alliance Leader said respectfully to the figure in front of him, his posture humble.</p><p></p><p>The others were the same.</p><p></p><p>"You may all rise." Lin Yuan waved his hand. The incarnation he manifested in front of everyone now was condensed from the power of the world.</p><p></p><p>After replacing the world consciousness and becoming the true master of the Qingqing world, Lin Yuan could mobilize the power of the world for his own use.</p><p></p><p>Condensing an incarnation was just a matter of a single thought.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will be in closed-door cultivation for an indefinite period of time. It could be hundreds of years, thousands of years, or even tens of thousands of years," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In a few years, Lin Yuan would reach the time limit of his stay and return to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had become the lord of the Qingqing world, the cost of descending again would be much lower. But due to the different flow of time between the two realms, Lin Yuan's next descent might be hundreds or thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Master is going into seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>"Thousands or tens of thousands of years, that's too long."</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Alliance Leader and many of his subordinates couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"During my seclusion, the governance of the Qingqing world will follow the measures and principles I have left behind..." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The measures and principles he spoke of came from the human civilization of the main world.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme race of the universe, human civilization had a long history and rich experience in governing the lives on a planet.</p><p></p><p>Those measures and principles were all borrowed by Lin Yuan from the main world.</p><p></p><p>As long as these measures and principles were implemented and maintained with strong military power, the Qingqing world would usher in a long period of prosperity.</p><p></p><p>And this would also greatly benefit the martial dao. The more prosperous, the greater the quantity and quality of martial dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"You may all leave now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>In the next few years, Lin Yuan simply gave up on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he used the power of the world's lord to travel to every corner of the Qingqing world.</p><p></p><p>"The operation of the world, life is the key."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood on a high mountain, with a village wreathed in cooking smoke below.</p><p></p><p>Without life, even if it contained many comprehensive rules, it would still be lacking something.</p><p></p><p>"Life Rule..."</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, there was a hint of green flowing.</p><p></p><p>Like the Space Rule, the Life Rule was also one of the pillar rules. It was the most critical link in the derivation of the world—</p><p></p><p>How to give birth to life.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the proliferation of life deepens your understanding of the Life Rule.]</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that in the last few years, I would actually comprehend the Life Rule to the entry-level?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The Life Rule and the Space Rule were at the same level. Back then, Lin Yuan had put in a lot of effort to comprehend the Space Rule to the entry-level.</p><p></p><p>But now, entering the Life Rule seemed much easier.</p><p></p><p>This was partly because Lin Yuan's current height was far higher than when he comprehended the Space Rule in the past, and also because as the lord of the world, he could more delicately and meticulously perceive the myriad states of life.</p><p></p><p>"It's time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind gathered in his mind, seeing the Door of Myriad Realms suddenly shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>"All the preparations and arrangements have been made."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up in the direction of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had already exchanged the instinctive consciousness of the Ancestral Demon Tree with his own consciousness. Even if he left this realm, this world would still be under his control.</p><p></p><p>It had been deeply imprinted with Lin Yuan's own life mark. The next time he descended, he could instantly obtain all the rights to the world.</p><p></p><p>"Going back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his gaze, his figure quickly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>His own consciousness turned into a point of light and entered the Door of Myriad Realms.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 557</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the ninety-nine demonic deities were revived once again.</p><p></p><p>Unlike three years ago, these ninety-nine demonic deities were now numb.</p><p></p><p>From the initial loud commotion to the current silent stillness.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, they... had died enough.</p><p></p><p>In the initial battle, after constantly self-destructing to death, Qi Yuan finally discovered the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had opened the lock of blood!</p><p></p><p>This was the only explanation!</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan was not afraid, as he had many uncles and a bit of demonic origin.</p><p></p><p>Foolish but wealthy.</p><p></p><p>So they continued to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Then... the problem became serious, and they dared not self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that the power Qi Yuan displayed was far stronger than that of ordinary peak mythological beings.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Constant instant kills.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that at some point, the human in front of him had actually broken through to the realm of Solar Deities.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable and incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>An exhausted mythological being, suddenly breaking through to the realm of Solar Deities in the midst of battle.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an ordinary person on the Blue Star, after defecating in the wild after eating a watermelon, grew a watermelon vine, and in the end, this vine became the Heavenly Vine! After Qi Yuan became a Solar Deity, the battles also became utterly certain.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan began... to threaten, plead, and tempt, using the Realm Lords as uncles to scare Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was useless, as Qi Yuan simply couldn't be bothered to listen to them, and directly... instant killed.</p><p></p><p>The instant kills after becoming a Solar Deity were much faster than the instant kills during the mythological era.</p><p></p><p>Almost as soon as they were revived by the demonic origin, they were instantly slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The once boastful Qi Yuan also became numb.</p><p></p><p>Over these three years, he had died and revived countless times, perhaps over a hundred million times? Even a person... no, even a deity would be unable to endure such suffering.</p><p></p><p>Now, those numb demonic deities, if they were still thinking, must be wondering... Lord Qi Yuan, don't you have too much demonic origin? True death is now the only liberation.</p><p></p><p>This constant revival is truly torturous.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan had the same feeling, as this was the first time he felt pain over the abundance of his demonic origin.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were numb, and Qi Yuan was also somewhat numb.</p><p></p><p>"Now, how am I any different from the 9,996 people screwing bolts in the factory? No, I'm not as tired as them, but my work hours are longer, working all year round, and most importantly... I don't get paid?"</p><p></p><p>Who stole his wages? Looking at the ninety-nine demonic deities reviving again, Qi Yuan casually blew a breath.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, these ninety-nine demonic deities fell once more.</p><p></p><p>The faint experience points flowed in, and Qi Yuan was already unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just a mosquito's leg, with trillions of tons, it's enough."</p><p></p><p>This was Qi Yuan's current mindset.</p><p></p><p>If you dared to think it, he would just casually blow them away and kill the demonic deities, and now... his combat power had already reached the level of... the peak of the Sixth Realm in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Or even stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for game levels and such, they had been solidified into realms.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Yuan had a data panel, it would show that he was at the third layer of Solar Deity, the Realm of Laws.</p><p></p><p>However, his Realm of Laws was different from the other Solar Deities at the third layer, as for the Realm Lord of the Cosmic Realm, they needed to fuse with the cosmic laws to truly become the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Wood Cosmos was different, as the cosmic laws were scattered among the Mandate Bearers, and unless all the Mandate Bearers were slain and sacrificed to the Cosmic True Spirit, someone could fuse with the cosmic laws and step into the Realm Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"Something is strange," Qi Yuan casually slaughtered these demonic deities, a trace of puzzlement flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Through slaying enemies and gaining experience, the cultivation obtained was naturally more stable than the step-by-step cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When the experience was sufficient, and he stepped into the peak of the second layer of Solar Deity and into the third layer, Qi Yuan's mind inexplicably gained a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>This was normal, as when stepping into the Yin Deity realm, the Yin Deities would also gain knowledge of the future path.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the path of the third layer of Solar Deity, one needed to fuse with the cosmic laws to truly ascend, transforming the ultimate truth into cosmic laws, with words becoming reality.</p><p></p><p>"Strange... I didn't fuse with the cosmic laws, yet... my ultimate truth seems to have condensed into... laws, or something like that."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the ultimate truth Qi Yuan had condensed, with the ability to do as he pleased and absolute adaptability, would only be able to display its full power in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>When coming to other cosmoses or lineages, its power would be significantly reduced.</p><p></p><p>But this time, not only did it not decrease, but it was even evolving.</p><p></p><p>Normally, for the ultimate truth to evolve into cosmic laws, one needed to actively fuse with the cosmic laws.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan...</p><p></p><p>He didn't fuse with the cosmic laws, yet he inexplicably formed cosmic laws.</p><p></p><p>This was a very strange thing.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I didn't fuse with the laws of the Godly Wood Cosmos, yet it doesn't resist me?"</p><p></p><p>Normally, other Realm Lords rashly going to other cosmoses would be targeted by the cosmic will.</p><p></p><p>The strange things were not just one.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I'm a shareholder of the Godly Wood Cosmos, the cosmic laws... aren't they my money? Why do I need to fuse with them?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan felt that everything was easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Wood Cosmos was a company, and he was a shareholder.</p><p></p><p>Why bother fusing?</p><p></p><p>It was already his.</p><p></p><p>Resist him? Dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh... you all revive too slowly."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Qi Yuan slew countless of them again.</p><p></p><p>Now he could easily leave this world, but a mosquito's meat is still meat.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to comprehend a time law, to make them revive faster and die faster."</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Qi Yuan casually waved his hand, shattering this world.</p><p></p><p>He and the ninety-nine demonic deities appeared in the sky above the Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>Now, he sat in the heavens, his form not visible, continuously slaying these demonic deities.</p><p></p><p>Due to the speed of the revival and death of these demonic deities being so fast, even exceeding human visual perception, even cultivators would not see them reviving and then being instantly slain.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, three months went by.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan picked up a communication talisman and said to Xian Ling Yingjun, "Ah, cultivation is so difficult..."</p><p></p><p>Far away in another world, Xian Ling Yingjun saw this and a look of pride appeared in his eyes: "Cultivation is indeed difficult. After three years, I've just stepped into the Great Venerable realm."</p><p></p><p>He was also showing off a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had always been suppressed by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qi Yuan, what difficulty have you encountered this time?" Xian Ling Yingjun asked.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Qi Yuan contacted him, it was to ask for help, and he had already gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>A mature NPC guide would proactively ask the player what they needed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I recently discovered that killing is too slow, so I'm trying to comprehend a time law, but after three months... I still have no clue."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was also a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when comprehending other laws, he could usually grasp the basics quickly.</p><p></p><p>The time law, which should not be the most difficult among the One-ÂìÅ Cosmic Laws, but he still could not make any progress.</p><p></p><p>"Killing too slow... wait a minute, a time law, you, a Yin Deity, are trying to comprehend a cosmic law? Aren't you just creating trouble for yourself?" Xian Ling Yingjun replied helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Even with a genius like Feng Ti, they could only comprehend the rudiments of the laws.</p><p></p><p>Directly comprehending a cosmic law was something a Realm Lord should do.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, after three years of arduous cultivation, I finally broke through to the Realm Lord realm, thinking I could come and play around with the time rules, but... " Qi Yuan's hair was almost turning white with worry, "I thought I was a genius, and that it would only take me three months to comprehend the time rules, but... I got nothing."</p><p></p><p>In another world, the handsome Immortal Spirit was stunned, somewhat doubting his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with the transmission talisman I gave you? Why does it show that you've become a Realm Lord?" The handsome Immortal Spirit couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not broken, I really have become a Realm Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Brother... don't lie to me, you know I'll believe anything you say!" Even though the Immortal Spirit was a Yin Deity, his heart was now racing frantically, pounding loudly.</p><p></p><p>What Qi Yuan said was just too frightening.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was incomprehensible, unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he fell into a time rift and traversed an entire era? "I'm not lying to you, I really have become a Realm Lord. Do you have any introductory techniques for the time rules?" Qi Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!" The Immortal Spirit suddenly realized something, "You're not a Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Qi Yuan was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>He's not a Realm Lord? "Once one becomes a Realm Lord, they don't need to comprehend the time rules, as they will automatically understand them upon reaching the Realm Lord realm." The Immortal Spirit had discovered something and felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>He almost got fooled.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Yuan had even started lying!</p><p></p><p>"Why is that? Don't you have to comprehend the rules?" Qi Yuan was curious and surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Upon reaching the Yang Deity realm, one can sever the past body, shape the present body, and welcome the future body... the past, present, and future all reside within. Upon reaching the third layer of the Yang Deity realm, one will automatically comprehend the time rules." The Immortal Spirit explained.</p><p></p><p>This was no secret, anyone whose ancestors had produced a great figure should know this.</p><p></p><p>It's like someone who has never seen an emperor, but knows that the dragon robe is usually yellow.</p><p></p><p>"This... I don't seem to have a past body or a future body." Qi Yuan felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"That's normal, it means you're not a Yang Deity, you're still a Grand Venerable!" The Immortal Spirit became more and more excited and animated as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing Qi Yuan is a Grand Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If he really was a Realm Lord...</p><p></p><p>Well, he doesn't want his brother to suffer, but he's afraid his brother might blaze a trail.</p><p></p><p>"You... have a point, in the game I'm a Realm Lord, but in reality, I'm just a small Purple Mansion, not even an Yin Deity." Qi Yuan sighed, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>He was starting to feel a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating so hard for all these years, he's only a Purple Mansion.</p><p></p><p>If he had fans, those fans would surely be on the verge of tears, saying, "Brother has tried so hard, but he's only a Purple Mansion, it's not fair!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Immortal Spirit looked at the dim gray display and suddenly slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I forgot to remind Brother Qi Yuan, Wu Dong is coming to trouble him!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Where is he hiding?"</p><p></p><p>In the Quejin Realm, the blue-robed man had been searching for months, but couldn't find a trace of Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the Devilish Gods, this place was also an occupied area, so he didn't dare to be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>However, over these few months, his patience had been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"I need to act quickly and decisively, kill him, and then... swiftly return to the Radiant Universe!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wu Dong no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>A special talisman appeared, and he flew into the sky, his entire body emanating scorching golden light.</p><p></p><p>Like a blazing sun rising in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that there is a person named Qi Yuan in this realm, who has comprehended the rules and is an Extreme Yin Deity. I admire him. Today, with the clear sky and bright moon, I have crossed realms to take his head!"</p><p></p><p>Under the empowerment of this talisman, Wu Dong was like an eternal blazing sun, hovering in the sky.</p><p></p><p>All the beings in the Quejin Realm saw him, and heard his voice.</p><p></p><p>He hovered in the sky, his blue robe shimmering with golden light.</p><p>That dazzling golden color instilled fear, as if a mortal had glimpsed a divine being.</p><p>Invincible, unmatched! Wu Dong fully unleashed his spiritual essence and displayed his immense power.</p><p></p><p>In the Quejin Realm, countless beings looked up at Wu Dong, their eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"This person is so strong... ordinary Devilish Gods probably can't be his match!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Qi Yuan that has drawn someone to cross realms to challenge him?"</p><p></p><p>Some were confused and worried, afraid that they would be implicated.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, near the Cloud Blood City, Wu Xiang's eyes were filled with shock: "So he has come to challenge... Master Qi. But is Master Qi... safe?"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>With the Devilish God Qi gone missing, he didn't know if Master Qi was still safe.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had this thought, he seemed to hear a familiar and lazy voice.</p><p></p><p>"Always obstructing my path to become mortal, do you think I'm just mud to be molded!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was calm, like a gentle breeze blowing across the silent dead sea.</p><p>The wind suddenly became fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>It was as if someone had lightly spat, a very common sound.</p><p></p><p>The eternal blazing sun that was Wu Dong was swallowed up.</p><p>All his brilliance vanished without a trace.</p><p>As if he had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Dong's true spirit also perished in that moment.</p><p>He didn't even have time to react.</p><p>He didn't even get a chance to fight back... before meeting a complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>All the beings in the Quejin Realm were stunned, their expressions bewildered.</p><p>The eternal blazing sun in the sky had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>As if it had never appeared at all.</p><p>Everyone was puzzled, astonished.</p><p>Could it have been an illusion?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Radiant Universe, the Three Wood Realm Lord opened his eyes, a look of shock on his face: "Wu Dong is dead?"</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then recalled that Wu Dong had gone to the Divine Wood Universe to challenge that person who had defeated the Phoenix Cry.</p><p></p><p>"The Causal Extraordinary Treasure has also been shattered?"</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Realm Lord was utterly perplexed.</p><p>He had once given this disciple a Causal Extraordinary Treasure, the lowest grade, but it was still a Causal Extraordinary Treasure.</p><p>Unless a Realm Lord intervened, no one could destroy a Causal Extraordinary Treasure.</p><p>The Divine Wood Universe did not have a Realm Lord, this was a well-known fact.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to trouble the Time Realm Lord to fish Wu Dong's true spirit out of the Cosmic Mother River and find out what exactly happened."</p><p></p><p>The Three Wood Realm Lord vaguely felt that something momentous must have occurred in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>About ten thousand breaths later, the Three Wood Realm Lord was respectfully waiting in a grand hall.</p><p>The master of this hall was the Time Realm Lord, a being at the Myriad Things Realm.</p><p>It was rumored that this Realm Lord had cultivated in the mortal realm for three eras, and had already reached the perfect Myriad Things Realm, one step away from the legendary Opening Heaven Realm.</p><p>The Three Wood Realm Lord had once helped the Time Realm Lord's mortal cultivation, so they had a bit of a relationship.</p><p>Otherwise, though both were Realm Lords, with only a small realm difference, the Three Wood Realm Lord normally wouldn't have the opportunity or qualifications to interact with the Time Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Three Wood, Wu Dong's true spirit is not in the Cosmic Mother River," the ancient voice came, like an old tree.</p><p>Hearing this, the Three Wood Realm Lord's face showed shock: "His true spirit is not in the Cosmic Mother River? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps... he has been devoured by the Black Sky." The Time Realm Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

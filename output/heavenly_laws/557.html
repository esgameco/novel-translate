            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning, countless thoughts raced through Feng Wanxing's mind, but his anxiety did not diminish in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>What if? What if the Purple Dream Realm had a way to bypass the Burning Heaven Sect's grand formation?</p><p></p><p>Or could they lure out the Sect Master of Lin? Too many unexpected things could happen.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Feng Wanxing had doubts about this operation of the Purple Dream Realm, and the cost of delaying the Blue Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it only allowed a few hundred puppet masters at the peak of the Sovereign Realm to rampage in the city?</p><p></p><p>This completely defies logic.</p><p></p><p>A few hundred puppet masters at the peak of the Sovereign Realm, the cost has already been very high.</p><p></p><p>If deployed on the battlefield, they would have formed a formidable army.</p><p></p><p>But in the city? At most, they could only rampage and plunder.</p><p></p><p>They could not bring much damage to the Blue Burning City.</p><p></p><p>A losing proposition.</p><p></p><p>Would the Purple Dream Realm do this? And now, he sensed the profound spatial-temporal fluctuations coming from the Burning Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing immediately had more speculations and thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the ultimate goal of the Purple Dream Realm is the junior disciple? Although this possibility is equally inconceivable, the Blue Burning Marquis certainly values Lin Yuan greatly, but a junior disciple who is not even at the Dao Realm, is he worth the Purple Dream Realm paying such a price? "Disciple Ruan, you take over my position."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing's expression was solemn, and he immediately made a decision.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal fluctuations coming from the Burning Heaven Sect made him too uneasy, he had to go there in person to take a look.</p><p></p><p>As for the core of this grand formation? The Sovereign Realm powerhouses suppressed here are not just him, but also other fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>If he let go, the defensive strength of this formation core would indeed decrease somewhat, but compared to the safety of the junior disciple, Feng Wanxing still leaned more towards the latter.</p><p></p><p>In the worst case, it would just be the Purple Dream Realm's ploy to lure them away, and this formation core would be breached.</p><p></p><p>But the Blue Burning City has a total of twelve formation cores, only one being breached would not have a major impact on the city.</p><p></p><p>However, if something happens to Lin Yuan, Feng Wanxing dared not imagine the consequences when the Blue Burning Marquis finds out.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, are you leaving now?"</p><p></p><p>Disciple Ruan's expression clearly changed, he also sensed the spatial-temporal fluctuations from the Burning Heaven Sect and was quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>But the task the Blue Burning Marquis gave them was to guard the formation core, Feng Wanxing's departure was tantamount to dereliction of duty, and the consequences afterwards would not be good.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take responsibility for everything, you just keep guarding this formation core well."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing shook his head and left directly towards the Burning Heaven Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial-temporal fluctuations haven't stopped yet?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing became increasingly uneasy, from sensing the spatial-temporal fluctuations from the Burning Heaven Sect to now, several breaths have passed.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, what exactly happened in the Burning Heaven Sect, is the junior disciple still alright? The Purple Dream Realm...</p><p></p><p>In the secluded abode of the thin man Kuang Zhen, a crystal-clear stone floated, emanating a faint soul fluctuation. At this moment, a stream of soul force surged out from within the stone, coalescing into the figure of the thin man Kuang Zhen.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The abode had already prepared a backup, a large amount of energy converging to form a physical body.</p><p></p><p>"My true body."</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen's expression was grim.</p><p></p><p>His true body had perished, and a wisp of his soul was suppressed by Lin Yuan. He immediately realized something was amiss and unhesitatingly extinguished that suppressed soul.</p><p></p><p>Then he "revived" through the backup he had prepared.</p><p></p><p>As a disciple of the Purple Dream Marquis, the thin man was well aware that even facing a great Venerable, the other party could hardly kill him through a karmic curse, as there were specialized defenses around the abode to weaken such karmic killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>But if even a wisp of his soul fell into the hands of a great Venerable, the consequences would be much more dire.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the thin man Kuang Zhen decisively extinguished that wisp of his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable, the Blue Burning City actually hid another great Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen's expression was filled with terror. His physical body and constitution were unparalleled in the Purple Dream Realm, and the only one who could easily slay him like this was a great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"The other fellow disciples..."</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen immediately began contacting his fellow disciples, learning that their true bodies had all perished and died, and they had also actively extinguished the souls suppressed by Lin Yuan, finally reviving through their backups.</p><p></p><p>"The senior sister is not dead yet."</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen did not feel relieved. The purple-haired woman was the strongest disciple under the Purple Dream Marquis, almost reaching the realm of a true great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the thin man Kuang Zhen did not believe the purple-haired woman had the strength to withstand a great Venerable, but as the leader of this operation, she carried many trump cards and backups, and even facing a great Venerable, she could still hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>But it would only be for a while, if the opponent was a great Venerable, death and destruction were inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"This mission should have failed."</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen thought to himself, a great Venerable hidden in the dark was too decisive for the situation, especially within the Blue Burning City, catching them off guard.</p><p></p><p>"A great Venerable, toying with us like this!"</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen was indignant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In his view, when they first started their operation, that great Venerable had probably already known. But he did not act, watching them step by step recreate the formations in the city, probably wanting to wait until the last moment to strike, letting them experience despair.</p><p></p><p>"That Vu Yan's information, it must have all been deliberately leaked by the Blue Burning Marquis, the talk about valuing his disciples, coming from the Vu family, it's all fake, all lies!"</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen's expression was filled with grief and indignation.</p><p></p><p>"No, I must immediately inform the Sect Master, this mission has failed, not because of us, but because of the cunning Blue Burning Marquis."</p><p></p><p>The thin man Kuang Zhen immediately contacted the Purple Dream Marquis, as for this plan targeting the Blue Burning City, it originated from the ancient capital, and the failure would certainly invite punishment.</p><p></p><p>But he did not mention that there was another great Venerable hidden in the Blue Burning City? If they had known this information earlier, the Purple Dream Realm would certainly not have implemented the current plan, dealing with a great Venerable hidden in the dark would require a complete overhaul of the entire plan.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Burning Heaven Sect, the space-time coalesced, like amber restraining all directions.</p><p></p><p>"This Vu Yan, is he a great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was equally despairing. She never imagined that when they came, hoping to be able to casually deal with a future threat to the Purple Dream Realm, the opponent turned out to be a great Venerable? Their group of Sovereign Realm masters actually thought they could resolve a great Venerable?</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's right hand pierced through the void, reaching towards her.</p><p></p><p>This right hand encompassed all space-time, just now the purple-haired woman's many fellow disciples and sisters had all perished under this right hand, even the thin man Kuang Zhen with the strongest physical body and constitution was destroyed in body and soul by this right hand.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Formation Crystal."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the absolute threat of death, the purple-haired woman no longer cared about anything, directly invoking this precious treasure bestowed by the ancient capital.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Formation Crystal could replicate any post-heaven formation, profoundly mysterious, but it did not mean that the Myriad Formation Crystal only had the use of replicating formations.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Myriad Formation Crystal also had other miraculous uses, it could activate the formations replicated within it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these directly activated formations would only have one-tenth or even one-hundredth the power of the original formations.</p><p></p><p>But it was very convenient, after all, setting up a formation required various materials, the protective city formation of the Blue Burning City was formed through the accumulation of countless years.</p><p></p><p>And the Myriad Formation Crystal could directly materialize the formation, incredibly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>A grand formation containing an infinite spatial-temporal labyrinth enveloped the purple-haired woman, Lin Yuan's reaching hand directly grasped at empty space, sinking into the overlapping space-time before finally withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>"This formation? Quite interesting." Lin Yuan carefully observed it, especially the crystal floating in front of the purple-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could feel that the spatial-temporal grand formation enveloping the purple-haired woman originated from this crystal.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable, why bother using force against a mere ant like me?" The purple-haired woman was trembling in fear, the spatial-temporal grand formation she had activated was the strongest defensive formation she could muster.</p><p></p><p>Even so, she could feel the spatial-temporal grand formation trembling slightly under Lin Yuan's previous grab.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was not the true owner of the Myriad Formation Crystal, unable to activate the strongest formations within it, even if she was the owner, without reaching the realm of a great Venerable or Celestial Venerable, she could not activate them.</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Formation Crystal could bypass the need for countless materials and directly materialize formations, to activate the formations within, one still needed to have at least a basic comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"You initiated an attack on me, so I can't retaliate?" Lin Yuan continued observing the Myriad Formation Crystal.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, observing the source of formations, gaining insights into the many profundities of formations】</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, if he truly acted, he could forcibly break through the spatial-temporal grand formation and slay her.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman inside.</p><p></p><p>However, this would most likely damage the crystal. Lin Yuan had browsed countless ancient texts and inheritances in the 13th floor of the Fentian Courtyard, knowing that this crystal should be the Crystal of the Myriad Formations.</p><p></p><p>This treasure is invaluable, and even if Lin Yuan didn't use it himself, he could keep it to exchange for the resources he wanted.</p><p></p><p>So he planned to slightly comprehend the spatial-temporal formation activated by the Crystal of the Myriad Formations, and then directly break through the formation to kill the purple-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Crystal of the Myriad Formations would be unharmed, and Lin Yuan would also gain something.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the few suppressed souls have all self-extinguished."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. At the peak of the Sovereign Realm, a single thought could extinguish one's own soul, which Lin Yuan found difficult to stop.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know where the great lord is," the purple-haired woman said with a sigh of relief when she saw that Lin Yuan did not immediately attack.</p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't attack, there was room for negotiation.</p><p></p><p>"I see that the great lord is not from the Raging Sun Ancient Country. I wonder what price the Cyan Flame Marquis paid to have you stationed here? I, the Purple Dream Domain, am willing to pay double."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman immediately spoke up. She was well aware of the importance of this plan, as it was related to the start of the battlefield between the ancient countries. Even if there were unexpected changes, she still had to complete it as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Are you done?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already completely comprehended the spatial-temporal formation activated by the Crystal of the Myriad Formations with his transcendent insights, and attacked again.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's right hand extended out again, delving into the depths of the layered spatial-temporal formation.</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, you..." </p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman trembled, but when she saw the Crystal of the Myriad Formations in front of her, she calmed down a bit. "We can't drag this on any longer. If we keep dragging it, the Cyan Flame Marquis will break free from the master's methods, and then with the two great lords joining forces, along with the formation of Cyan Flame City..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was thinking when she suddenly realized that Lin Yuan's right hand, which had extended into the spatial-temporal formation, did not retract, but continued to reach towards her.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal formation contained countless layers of space-time, and even a Sovereign Realm expert might be trapped for a short time. But Lin Yuan's right hand passed through the countless layers of space-time as if they were nothing. The spatial-temporal formation centered on the Crystal of the Myriad Formations was like thin paper before Lin Yuan's right hand.</p><p></p><p>"No!" The purple-haired woman inside the spatial-temporal formation widened her eyes. The Crystal of the Myriad Formations could not stop Lin Yuan, and she had no resistance against a Sovereign Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the purple-haired woman was caught in Lin Yuan's right hand, and layers of suppressing force enveloped her, causing her thought processes to slow down.</p><p></p><p>"You want to suppress and capture me?" </p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman immediately realized Lin Yuan's intention and without any hesitation, actively extinguished her own soul consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his right hand, leaving only the purple-haired woman's corpse, which began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and the Raging Sun Divine Fire surged, actively burning the corpse to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a drop of deep purple tear condensed and expanded into a woman in a purple dress.</p><p></p><p>"Which great lord are you?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in the purple dress was the Purple Dream Marquis. She had left a backup plan behind the purple-haired woman, and could temporarily manifest a manifestation at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>When the emaciated man Kuangzhen informed her of what was happening in Cyan Flame City, the Purple Dream Marquis realized something was wrong and immediately planned to descend.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, she was still too late. The purple-haired woman had already died completely, and the situation had developed too quickly for the Purple Dream Marquis to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Which great lord am I?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was not a great lord at all.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he not a great lord, he was not even at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the essence of life, he was equivalent to the Self-Dao Realm in the source world.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's foundation was too profound, and his methods were too terrifying, especially after awakening the Raging Sun Divine Body, with the Raging Sun Divine Fire spreading with every move, making him indistinguishable from a normal great lord.</p><p></p><p>"I know all the great lords with the Raging Sun Divine Body in the Raging Sun Ancient Country, but there is no one like you," the Purple Dream Marquis shook her head.</p><p></p><p>There were not many in the Raging Sun Ancient Country who possessed both the Raging Sun Divine Body and the strength of a great lord.</p><p></p><p>"As a mere marquis, how would you know all the great lords of the Raging Sun Ancient Country?" Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>No matter the Raging Sun Ancient Country or other ancient countries, there must be hidden experts.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Marquis fell silent, as Lin Yuan was right. Just because she didn't know him didn't mean he didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it seems the Purple Dream Domain has failed. However, that Crystal of the Myriad Formations does not belong to me. Please return it, and I am willing to exchange it for other treasures."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Marquis thought for a while and spoke up. Knowing that the plan had failed, what she wanted to do now was to minimize the losses as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The Crystal of the Myriad Formations was bestowed by the country, and if it was lost, the Purple Dream Marquis would also have to bear the punishment, so she spoke up to get the Crystal back.</p><p></p><p>"What are you? A mere manifestation, and you dare make demands with me?" Lin Yuan's eyes were filled with the Raging Sun as he extended his right hand to press down on the Purple Dream Marquis.</p><p></p><p>The right hand suddenly expanded, covering the sky. The Purple Dream Marquis' expression changed, and her form directly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>She was just a manifestation that had descended, without a physical body, appearing and disappearing at will.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space-time suddenly began to contract, and the dissipated body of the Purple Dream Marquis was 'forced' to re-condense, facing the palm that Lin Yuan had slammed down.</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember you."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Marquis stared at Lin Yuan, and the next moment she was crushed under his palm.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't show any sincerity at all, just wanting to get the Crystal of the Myriad Formations back? Do you think I don't know anything?" Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The preciousness of the Crystal of the Myriad Formations was even above ordinary great lord secret treasures and weapons. The Purple Dream Marquis only descended a manifestation, and yet she wanted to exchange the Crystal? Lin Yuan was not a fool.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, any ancient country would not have enough of the Crystal of the Myriad Formations, and Lin Yuan could easily trade it with the Raging Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"The Crystal of the Myriad Formations?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his hand, and a crystal appeared, vaguely revealing the operation of countless formations.</p><p></p><p>The biggest harvest from this attack on the group of Sovereign Realm experts who had infiltrated Cyan Flame City was the Crystal of the Myriad Formations, in addition to many other treasure trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Since they dared to infiltrate Cyan Flame City, this group of Purple Dream Domain experts must have made sufficient preparations, and they even brought in the precious Crystal of the Myriad Formations, so they wouldn't mind preparing more.</p><p></p><p>Near the Fentian Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, you must not get into any trouble."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing was anxious. He would rather have a core of a formation destroyed than have Lin Yuan get into any trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Before he got close, Feng Wanxing saw a woman in a purple dress standing quietly in front of the Fentian Courtyard as the space-time condensed.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Purple Dream Marquis?"</p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple of the Cyan Flame Marquis, Feng Wanxing was naturally very familiar with the great lords of the opposing domains, and he recognized the other party's identity at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"The target is indeed my little junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Purple Dream Marquis outside the Fentian Courtyard confirmed Feng Wanxing's guess.</p><p></p><p>A great lord of a domain appearing here, the target could only be Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What happened next.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing witnessed an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>He saw the little junior brother standing at the gate of the Fentian Courtyard directly extend his right hand, which suddenly expanded, covering the sky with an ancient and majestic aura.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Marquis had no resistance at all in the face of this palm, and was directly crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing's gaze was dazed.</p><p></p><p>This is my little junior brother?</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Flame Marquis sat in meditation, his consciousness immersed in the dream woven by the Purple Dream Marquis.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Flame Marquis' aura surged, and he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Purple Dream, your dream weaving is not that great."</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Flame Marquis immediately spread his senses to roughly check the situation in Cyan Flame City. The twelve core formations were unharmed, and then he looked at the Purple Dream Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Flame Marquis' brow furrowed slightly, because the Purple Dream Marquis in his eyes had an unpleasant expression, staring at him intently.</p><p></p><p>This made the Cyan Flame Marquis somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You suddenly attack me, and yet you have this expression? Cyan Flame, good methods, you actually prepared in advance and hid a great lord. Good methods, really good methods."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Marquis said, and then voluntarily dissipated this manifestation. This operation had resulted in heavy losses for the Purple Dream Domain, and the Purple Dream Marquis still had to face the punishment of the ancient country.</p><p></p><p>"Good methods?"</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Flame Marquis was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Prepared in advance? </p><p></p><p>Hid a great lord? He himself didn't even know about it.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

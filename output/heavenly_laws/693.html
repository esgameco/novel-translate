        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden figure was slightly taken aback. </p><p></p><p>The origins of this relic site were unfathomable. Even a peak Xiao Yao Third Realm expert would be unable to resist it. </p><p></p><p>One would be forcibly dragged into the test space.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The golden figure carefully observed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the young man's methods, his life force fluctuations were at the normal Xiao Yao Third Realm level.</p><p></p><p>Yet he had easily blocked the dragging force.</p><p></p><p>"Is his comprehension of space-time that deep?" </p><p></p><p>The golden figure thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The essence of his forceful dragging was to utilize the rules of space-time. </p><p></p><p>If the other party was equally proficient in the rules of space-time, it was normal that he could not do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>But to reach a level of space-time rule comprehension that could make the golden figure helpless was truly rare.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest inheritors claimed to be the "Eternal Sons" in the major Eternal Sects did not have such comprehension.</p><p></p><p>In this world, countless cultivators comprehended the rules through the Wen Wen Dao, lowering the threshold, but that did not mean it did not exist.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of comprehending the space-time rules only increased the deeper one went.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate he is almost beyond the space-time rules themselves."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure judged in his heart. To be beyond the space-time rules themselves meant having one foot already crossed the Nine Layers of Space-Time Realm, only then could he be unable to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I've encountered a treasure this time."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure thought, the stronger the test taker's cultivation and the higher their rule comprehension, the more hope they had of passing the test.</p><p></p><p>And his purpose was to cultivate a test taker who could pass all the tests.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that Lin Yuan had a slim chance of passing all the tests.</p><p></p><p>"I almost got dragged away."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also shocked in his heart. Just now, the symbols permeating the heavens and earth were all operating simultaneously. If he had not reached the limit of his comprehension of the space-time fusion rules, he might have been forcibly transferred away.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Yuan present here was only his Sun Primordial Spirit, many of his methods could not be deployed, and due to the need for his true body to open up an infinite granular particle world, all resources were prioritized for his true body.</p><p></p><p>So the strength of his Sun Primordial Spirit was at the level of the strongest Celestial Sovereign, the Undefeated Great Saint, equivalent to the Xiao Yao Third Realm in this world.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Primordial Spirit lacked the Yin, and the Dao of the Chaos Taiji had limitations.</p><p></p><p>If the Sun Primordial Spirit and the Yin Primordial Spirit were to fuse into the Taiji Primordial Spirit, its strength, although still not as strong as the true body, would surpass the strongest Celestial Sovereign and Undefeated Great Saint, and be on par with existences like the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, don't worry, I have no ill intentions," the golden figure said in a gentle voice, as he was very patient with a test taker like Lin Yuan who had a slim chance of success.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going to send me?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>The various sect relic sites he had discovered before had never encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>To be forcibly transferred to an unknown space where the risks and details were unknown, Lin Yuan naturally did not want to go.</p><p></p><p>"The test space, as long as you pass the test space, you can obtain the final inheritance," the golden figure said without the slightest impatience.</p><p></p><p>"Test space?" Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>The symbols surrounding this valley were clearly the work of cultivators, and Lin Yuan had already prepared for it.</p><p></p><p>"Whose sect's test space is this?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other things, just the forceful transfer technique that almost took him away was far beyond the abilities of sects like the Qing Yun Holy Sect and the Li Hong Holy Sect. Lin Yuan speculated that it should be the work of a supreme holy sect.</p><p></p><p>"Whose sect?" The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan for a moment and shook his head, "This is not the test space of a holy sect."</p><p></p><p>"Not a holy sect's test space?" Lin Yuan's face flashed with confusion.</p><p></p><p>If it's not a holy sect's test space, then whose test space is it?</p><p></p><p>"The creator of this test space is the great Wu Mountain Lord," the golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Mountain Lord?" Lin Yuan's heart shook.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Mountain Lord was the Eternal Lord of this Source World, the Thirteenth Realm Time Life.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan had obtained, the Wu Mountain Lord was extremely mysterious and did not establish an Eternal Sect, coming and going alone, crossing into the Thirteenth Realm through the Dao of Painting.</p><p></p><p>The paintings of the Wu Mountain Lord contained boundless mysteries, and it was said that in the Wu Mountain Lord's pursuit, he wanted to paint a "grand painting" that could rival this Source World.</p><p></p><p>"This test space was opened by the Wu Mountain Lord?" Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"What else could it be?" The golden figure said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Wu Mountain Lord open this test space?" Lin Yuan did not have much doubt, as the Eternal Lords of this Source World had a profound influence, and no strong cultivator would dare to impersonate an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Mountain Lord had a premonition before the 'Demonic' disaster descended, realizing that this world would fall into eternal desolation, so he opened up many test spaces in advance to cultivate capable test takers after the 'Demonic' disaster arrived," the golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Mountain Lord hopes to cultivate a new Eternal Lord, so that he can sweep away the 'Demonic' disaster."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure said these things, originally he did not need to tell the test taker, but now if he did not explain clearly, the young man in front of him probably would not enter the test space.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords could observe the future timeline, so the arrival of the 'Demonic' disaster, which was a sudden calamity for cultivators below the Thirteenth Realm, must have been seen long ago by the Time Lives.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan was curious why the 'Demonic' disaster was rampaging without the Thirteenth Realm intervening, but now it seems the Eternal Lords of this Source World had been preparing in advance.</p><p></p><p>Like this test space.</p><p></p><p>"Was the Wu Mountain Lord detained by the Demonic God?" Lin Yuan asked the question on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Compared to cultivating a new Eternal Lord to sweep away the 'Demonic' disaster, for a Thirteenth Realm Time Life to take action themselves would certainly be simpler and easier.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Lords were not easy to cultivate, in fact it could be said that Eternal Lords could not be cultivated. Even the six ancient founding nations of the Source World, the five Patriarchs after the Great Progenitor, had not received special cultivation from the previous Patriarch before reaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Mountain Lord's hope of cultivating a new Eternal Lord through the test space was really too slim.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan speculated that the Wu Mountain Lord must be preoccupied, and the only thing that could detain the Wu Mountain Lord was likely that 'Demonic God'.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic God?" The golden figure shook his head, "Although the Demonic God is powerful, it cannot detain the great Wu Mountain Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Not the Demonic God?" Lin Yuan was even more surprised, "Then who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," the golden figure said. "The Demonic God is not the 'Demonic'..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The source of the disaster." </p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've said all I can. This testing space was painstakingly created by the Lord of Wu Mountain, and the ultimate inheritance contained within it expounds on the essence of the Runic Dao."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Given your mastery and comprehension of time and space, there is still a slim hope that you can pass through. Even if you don't succeed, you can still gain some of the inheritance, which will greatly benefit you."</p><p></p><p>"Now tell me, do you want to enter the testing space?"</p><p></p><p>The golden figure inquired.</p><p></p><p>"The Testing Space of the Eternal Sovereign"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan asked, "Is there any danger?"</p><p></p><p>If there was danger, Lin Yuan planned to wait until he had cultivated to the limit before attempting it. After all, the testing space was right here, and he could try it anytime.</p><p></p><p>"Danger?" </p><p></p><p>The golden figure sighed, "When the 'Calamity' descended and countless cultivators perished, how could the Lord of Wu Mountain have set up any dangers in the testing space?"</p><p></p><p>"If you feel you cannot pass the test, I will escort you out, and there will be no harm."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure said solemnly, "If it weren't for the high cultivation threshold of the Lord of Wu Mountain's inheritance, cultivators who don't meet the requirements would not be able to comprehend it without suffering irreparable consequences. That's why the test is set up."</p><p></p><p>"To the Lord of Wu Mountain's level of existence, freely spreading the inheritance without any test would be the true malice. Setting up the test is an act of benevolence, to prevent unqualified cultivators from suffering irreversible losses."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm willing to try." Lin Yuan immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Lord of Wu Mountain, a 13th-tier time life, was naturally what Lin Yuan craved. And since there was no danger, it was practically a free opportunity. How could Lin Yuan refuse?</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Don't resist what's coming next."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ The surrounding runes resonated again, and a spatial disturbance swept in, instantly dragging Lin Yuan into a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. </p><p></p><p>This was an expansive world, and Lin Yuan was immediately drawn to the three massive "paintings" suspended in the center.</p><p></p><p>The first painting depicted a young man in golden armor, his aura so terrifying that it could be felt even from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The second was of a graceful woman in nearly transparent robes, her alluring presence posing a danger of ensnaring even Transcendent Third Realm experts who gazed upon her.</p><p></p><p>As for the last "painting", it was of a white-robed man, who, compared to the other two, did not exude any aura, but gave Lin Yuan an even more threatening impression.</p><p></p><p>"The experts depicted in these three paintings are each no weaker than the 'Abyss Dragon'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Especially the white-robed man in the last painting, who seemed to even surpass the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"These three paintings were created by the great Lord of Wu Mountain."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the golden figure appeared beside Lin Yuan, also gazing at the distant paintings.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Wu Mountain's paintings are all real, and the experts depicted in them can truly emerge from the paintings."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure said, "The experts in these three paintings each excel in different areas, specifically painted by the Lord of Wu Mountain for the testing of future inheritors."</p><p></p><p>"If you can overcome the obstruction of these three paintings and enter there..."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure pointed to the small door towering in the center of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Then you will have passed the test."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan, "But with your current strength, it will be very difficult to directly overcome the experts in these paintings."</p><p></p><p>"My advice to you is to fully enhance your mastery of the time-space fusion rules. As long as you can completely transcend the time-space fusion rules, you'll be able to easily pass the test."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>If one could completely transcend the time-space rules, they would become one with time and space itself. A single thought could place them outside the small door at the center, and the experts within the paintings would not even be able to touch them.</p><p></p><p>This was why the golden figure believed Lin Yuan had a slim chance of passing the test - if he could completely transcend the time-space fusion rules, he would be able to pass. If not, he would not be able to.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current comprehension of the time-space fusion rules was nearing the point of transcendence, but it was still a far cry from complete transcendence.</p><p></p><p>Achieving complete transcendence of the time-space fusion rules was a hope so slim it was almost impossible, even for a Planar Sovereign like the Primordial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Completely transcend the time-space fusion rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. Even the Primordial Emperor, at the peak of the Chaotic Void, had only one foot beyond the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>As for complete transcendence? Lin Yuan was confident, but he didn't know how long it would take - five thousand years? Ten thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Observing the operation of the source world's primal essence had already allowed Lin Yuan to make tremendous progress in his comprehension of the time-space fusion rules, but to completely transcend them was still extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Take your time, you have a very long time, billions or trillions of years, the test has no time limit."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>Normally, to break through the obstruction of the experts in the paintings, one would need to surpass the strength of an ordinary Eternal Scion.</p><p></p><p>This was also the threshold for inheriting the Lord of Wu Mountain's legacy. If one could not surpass an ordinary Eternal Scion, how could they become the new Eternal Sovereign? And the Lord of Wu Mountain's inheritance also required a sufficiently powerful life form to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>But with Lin Yuan's mastery of time and space, there was no need to forcefully break through. As a typical Transcendent Third Realm cultivator, he almost had no chance of reaching the level of an Eternal Scion, let alone surpassing the experts in the paintings.</p><p></p><p>"Do not underestimate them."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan and continued, "The experts in these three paintings are what the Lord of Wu Mountain considered the true limit of the Transcendent Third Realm, far stronger than ordinary Eternal Scions. So the requirement to pass the test is not to defeat them, but to break through their obstruction and enter the central door."</p><p></p><p>"They are indeed very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The first two paintings depicted experts with the strength of the 'Abyss Dragon', and the last one even hinted at surpassing the 'Abyss Dragon'. Such experts should not even exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>Since the opening of the first source world, only one Abyss Dragon had been born, attaining that level of power through countless karmic opportunities.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Scions of this source world were only approaching the Abyss Dragon's level, and even the Source Demons might only be on par with or slightly surpass the Abyss Dragon, but they could not even enter this testing space.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

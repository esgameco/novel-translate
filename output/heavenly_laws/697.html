        <h1>Chapter 697</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was boundless, like a true 'source world'.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan clearly felt that the giant painting frame had been constructed.</p><p></p><p>However, within the giant painting, there were still many blurred and blank areas that had not been painted.</p><p></p><p>"This is an unfinished painting." Lin Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>If this giant painting was completed, it would be a true 'source world'.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Lord of Wu Mountain, relying on this giant painting, would at least be able to enter the Thirteenth Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>As one's life force reaches a high level, what they pursue is all related to their own Dao. The Lord of Wu Mountain wanted to cross into the Thirteenth Realm through the Dao of Painting, and to advance further, he would need to paint a complete 'source world'.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Eternal Painting.</p><p></p><p>How vast and boundless is a source world? It was no longer a matter of size, but of encompassing countless Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>To paint a source world was equivalent to creating a source world, and the difficulty would be far greater than Lin Yuan theoretically reaching the Seventh Layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal of the 'Infinite Void' was the Chaotic Void, but although the source world was on the same level as the Chaotic Void in terms of hierarchy, the source world was more perfect than the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteenth Realm Temporal Existences in the Chaotic Void had left behind many special places to compensate for the hidden dangers of the Chaotic Void, but the source world did not need that, as it was inherently near-perfect.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not finished, it's enough for me." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the Eternal Painting. The painting itself was composed of endless runes.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Wu Mountain painted the source world encompassing the universe using runes.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary. Observing the unknown giant painting has enhanced your understanding of the Dao of Runes.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was immersed in the boundless Eternal Painting, and his entire being was being elevated in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Runes, at its core, was an auxiliary Dao that could be integrated into any cultivation system. With the help of runes, one could achieve many things that were originally impossible or difficult to do.</p><p></p><p>For example, the task Lin Yuan was currently undertaking - the opening of particle worlds. Normally, maintaining the existence of each particle world would require a small amount of mental effort. This was unacceptable for Lin Yuan, whose goal was to open an infinite number of particle worlds. The Dao of Runes solved this problem, as the runes could be used to sustain each particle world without any mental investment.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How was it?" the golden figure asked.</p><p></p><p>"It had a profound impact." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Painting had now been imprinted deeply in his mind, and he could contemplate and comprehend it at any time.</p><p></p><p>"That's all it took to have such a profound impact?" The golden figure smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure, sensing that there was more to it.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." The golden figure's face showed a faint smile. With his seniority, even the Eternal Scions would naturally address him as "Senior," but Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength was so abnormal that the golden figure did not even consider him as a life form below the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of this test space?" the golden figure asked.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate a new Eternal Lord." After some thought, Lin Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>This was what the golden figure had told him at the beginning - the test space was the Lord of Wu Mountain's arrangement before the great changes in heaven and earth. The purpose was to cultivate an Eternal Lord for this realm, so that they could clear the 'Demonic' disaster after its arrival.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the giant painting left behind by the Lord of Wu Mountain can cultivate an Eternal Lord?" the golden figure asked.</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Painting left by the Lord of Wu Mountain was profoundly abstruse. Even for other Thirteenth Realm Temporal Existences, it would require gradual comprehension. For Lin Yuan, it was even more so. Even after reaching the Thirteenth Realm, he would continue to benefit from that giant painting.</p><p></p><p>However, the essence of the painting did not mention how to cross into the Thirteenth Realm. Even if one fully comprehended the Eternal Painting, it would not provide qualitative help for breaking through the time cycle.</p><p></p><p>If one could not cross into the Thirteenth Realm and enhance the possibility of breaking through the time cycle, this Eternal Painting would not be of great significance. It would be less valuable than the martial dao Lin Yuan had disseminated, which could at least help cultivate one more practitioner and strengthen the 'anchor' a bit.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, in addition to the great Lord of Wu Mountain's own painted inheritance, there is another inheritance - the inheritance of the Lord of Celestial Light," the golden figure said, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Celestial Light?" Lin Yuan's mind shook.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the records of the Qing Yun Sacred Mountain or the other Carefree Realm Experts' legacies he had explored, they all mentioned this Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light was the earliest Eternal Lord to appear in this realm. He was also the most mysterious Eternal Lord. The reason he was called the 'earliest to appear' was that no one knew when he became an Eternal Lord - from the very beginning of heaven and earth, or even earlier? No one knew.</p><p></p><p>It was only known that when the Lord of Celestial Light first appeared before the masses, he was already an Eternal Lord. It was because of the Lord of Celestial Light that the cultivation system in this realm could flourish, and the Dao of Runes even originated from him.</p><p></p><p>"Although the great Lord of Wu Mountain also had some experience in how to become an Eternal Lord, it must be admitted that compared to the Lord of Celestial Light, he was still far behind," the golden figure continued. "If it weren't for the Lord of Celestial Light, the current number of Eternal Lords would definitely be less than half."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Lord of Celestial Light did not directly cultivate Eternal Lords, all the current Eternal Lords have inherited the karmic connections from the Lord of Celestial Light, and they have reached the pinnacle of cultivation on the foundation he established."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure's tone was full of reverence and admiration for the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Each Eternal Lord walked a different path and pursued different goals. The Lord of Celestial Light had cultivated a solid foundation of cultivation for this realm, and it was on this foundation that the various Eternal Lords had emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Celestial Light, in order to show the weak how to become Eternal Lords, specially created an inheritance with thirty-three original texts, and the great Lord of Wu Mountain obtained one of them," the golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>These inheritance original texts were written by the creator of the inheritance themselves, and while they could be copied, the essence would be diminished. In terms of the impact on cultivators, the original inheritance texts were the most direct and authentic.</p><p></p><p>"This is that inheritance." The golden figure flipped his right hand, and a book appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"An inheritance specifically created to help breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm?" Lin Yuan was highly excited. So far, any inheritance he had obtained had not been directly related to reaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Realms Inheritance are all about accumulating the foundation to enhance one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>As for specifically aiming to break through to the Thirteenth Realm Inheritance? There is no such thing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has very limited understanding of how to break through to the Thirteenth Realm and break the time loop.</p><p></p><p>He only knows clearly that by spreading his own path of evolution and allowing more beings to cultivate, it will form an 'anchor' and 'beacon' for his own self trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>And the time loop he will face when breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm will be a challenge he has never encountered before. If he fails the first time, the relevant memories will be erased, and the same loop will repeat.</p><p></p><p>This is why it is called the 'time loop'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately picked up the booklet in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The booklet was very thin and had a jade-like blue color.</p><p></p><p>"You can only ponder on this Inheritance Tome here, don't take it out," the golden figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>There is only one copy of the Inheritance Tome, if Lin Yuan takes it out and doesn't return it, it would be the same as the cultivator who passes the trial losing this Inheritance for contemplation in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of leaving a clone here for an extended period.</p><p></p><p>It's not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Celestial Light's Understanding of Breaking Through the Thirteenth Realm"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was full of anticipation as he immediately began to flip open the booklet.</p><p></p><p>The moment the jade-blue booklet was opened, a flood of information surged into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The information coalesced into a majestic figure.</p><p></p><p>It stood under the boundless firmament, radiating infinite brilliance that illuminated in all directions, a radiance vastly different from the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>The illumination of the progenitor of the First Source World was an extremely powerful erosion, where everything under the sunlight was dominated.</p><p></p><p>But this infinite brilliance was one of inclusion, encompassing everything without the slightest sense of erosion or oppression.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the majestic figure standing in the heavens, and he felt an overwhelming sense of 'warmth and comfort'.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Lord of Celestial Light?" Lin Yuan immediately understood that this majestic figure radiating infinite brilliance was the Lord of Celestial Light, or more precisely, the imprint left by the Lord of Celestial Light to carry the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the majestic figure did not give him any sense of oppression, Lin Yuan instinctively felt that the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun was not as powerful as the Lord of Celestial Light. Even the other five Progenitors of the First Source World were not as powerful as the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light's strength had already transcended the need for a sense of oppression, reaching a higher level.</p><p></p><p>"How to become the Eternal Sovereign, how to transform into a temporal life form." The Lord of Celestial Light smiled and said, "The most important thing is how to break through the time loop."</p><p></p><p>"The time loop is the greatest obstacle for all lives in the infinite dimensional realms to transform into temporal life forms."</p><p></p><p>"Lives trapped in the time loop will face challenges they have never encountered before, and their past abilities and skills will become useless."</p><p></p><p>"So, there are two choices when breaking through the time loop," the Lord of Celestial Light smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"One is to do nothing, since the challenges of the time loop are something you have never encountered before, no matter how you prepare, it will be meaningless."</p><p></p><p>"The other is to strive for the ultimate, as the Dao is infinite yet finite, as long as you can prepare for all the trials and reach 'omniscience and omnipotence', you can easily break through the time loop."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light spoke in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>The information the Lord of Celestial Light was talking about was something Lin Yuan already had a general understanding of, it was just a basic introduction to breaking through the time loop.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will tell you how I broke through the time loop."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light smiled and said, "First, what do you think runes are?"</p><p></p><p>"What are runes?" Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The rune inheritances he had encountered were all just a kind of technique and method, with almost 'universal' usefulness.</p><p></p><p>They could maintain the existence of the particle world.</p><p>They could enhance the power of killing techniques.</p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>"In your view, runes should only be a means, and if you are proficient in runes, then you will not be able to use them in the time loop." The Lord of Celestial Light said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had already prepared for the loss of all his means and abilities when trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>Runes? </p><p>The cosmic force within his body?</p><p>His physical body and constitution?</p><p>The more proficient he was, the more unusable they would become when trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>"But for me, runes are not just a means, they are the foundation of all things in the world, and even time can be replicated with runes, so even if trapped in a time loop, runes can still be used."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light continued.</p><p></p><p>"Runes can be used in the time loop?" Lin Yuan's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What means do you use to condense runes? Mental power? Spiritual power? Vital energy? Or other various forces?" The Lord of Celestial Light said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>He condenses runes with the power of the cosmic force within his body.</p><p>This is one of the main methods Lin Yuan has mastered.</p><p></p><p>"The time loop will indeed bypass the sealing of the means you are proficient in, for example, if you are proficient in condensing runes with mental power, then the time loop you are trapped in will not be able to use any mental power."</p><p></p><p>"If you are proficient in condensing runes with spiritual power, then spiritual power will be sealed, and vital energy will be the same."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light looked at Lin Yuan with a gentle gaze, "But the runes themselves will not disappear."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the means you use to activate the runes will become unusable, which will create the illusion of the runes disappearing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan absorbed the Lord of Celestial Light's teachings in the booklet with great fascination. The other's understanding of runes was simply beyond Lin Yuan's imagination, no wonder 'Lihong' would think that among the Eternal Sovereigns, the Lord of Celestial Light was undisputedly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only 'Lihong', but Lin Yuan also felt this way.</p><p></p><p>"This is the essence of runes." Lin Yuan's eyes were filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance recorded in the booklet did not directly enhance Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>It was far inferior to the rewards of opening a particle world.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan felt that his understanding of runes had risen by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, runes were a sharp sword for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But now, runes are not just a sword for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Shield? Longsword? Mace? Lin Yuan can easily possess any weapon.</p><p></p><p>"If I can truly use the power of runes in the time loop, the possibility of breaking through the time loop will definitely be greatly increased." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In a time loop where all the rules are constrained, being able to use the power of runes is equivalent to cheating.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Runes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly felt that his understanding of runes was different, no longer limited to a certain method, but to all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Gather."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and runes gathered, forming a clone.</p><p></p><p>This clone had a terrifying aura, permeating through layers of space-time, possessing strength almost comparable to an Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>This was just Lin Yuan's external application of runes, and in terms of enhancing his own strength, he had gained unimaginable improvements.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

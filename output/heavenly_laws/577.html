        <h1>Chapter 577</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ding Seven War Defense Line Region.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly arrived at the war line region he was to command.</p><p></p><p>The border between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain formed a long war defense line, and each great lord needed to command the corresponding war line region to defend against enemy attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Ding Seven war line region commanded by Lin Yuan was located on the edge, and the senior great lords and peak great lords of the Zimen Domain would mostly choose to attack the core war line regions.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the Qingfeng Marquis believed that the opponent Lin Yuan would face would be the Great Lord Leige.</p><p></p><p>Among the great lords openly displayed by the Zimen Domain now, there were only two or three newly promoted great lords, and Great Lord Leige was the most likely to attack the Ding Seven war line.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just the most likely scenario, not a definite one. But even if it was other great lords, they would be at a similar level of newly promoted great lords. As for the senior great lords or peak great lords, attacking the edge defense line regions would be a complete waste, even if they broke through, what difference would it make? It would not have a major impact on the overall war situation, after all, it was just an edge defense line, and the Qingfeng Domain could adjust in real-time.</p><p></p><p>However, the core defense line was different. Once the core defense line set up by the Qingfeng Domain was breached, the war situation would become one-sided.</p><p></p><p>If the Zimen Domain mobilized a senior great lord or peak great lord to attack the edge defense line, the Qingfeng Marquis would probably be quite happy. With one less senior great lord or peak great lord attacking the core defense line, the pressure on the Qingfeng Domain would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"In this war, the Qingfeng Domain will focus on defense, and the Crimson Pine King should lean towards 'conservatism'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, through the Qingfeng Marquis' arrangement of the war situation, he could see the thinking behind the 'Crimson Pine King'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite in agreement with this. The Radiant King was currently showing his prowess, but to clash head-on with the opponent at this time? There was no benefit in that.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could withstand the first few attacks from the Zimen Domain, the war situation would naturally turn around, and whether to attack the Zimen Domain would then depend entirely on the Crimson Pine King.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Great Lord."</p><p>"Greetings, Great Lord."</p><p></p><p>Soon after Lin Yuan arrived at the Ding Seven defense line, several figures came to see him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was responsible for commanding this war defense line, and it was not just him alone.</p><p></p><p>Numerous war machines were ready to be mobilized by Lin Yuan at any time.</p><p></p><p>Between the great domains, the war was mainly fought using war machines, unless it involved the great lords.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Self-Realization Realm and Sovereign Realm were far inferior in strength to the great lords, and could only pose a threat to the great lords by relying on the power of war machines.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of Sovereign Realm experts, with the power of war machines, could unleash attacks that would make even the great lords change color.</p><p></p><p>"Report the situation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the few figures standing respectfully before him.</p><p></p><p>These figures all had peak Sovereign Realm strength, and were under Lin Yuan's command on this defense line.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord, we currently have one medium-grade Class-B war machine, six low-grade Class-B war machines, and thirty-six Class-C war machines of high, middle, and low grades."</p><p></p><p>The one in the lead, a figure with a single horn named Luo Peng, respectfully reported to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>War machines were divided into three levels: Class-A, Class-B, and Class-C.</p><p></p><p>Class-C war machines could accommodate tens to hundreds of Sovereign Realm experts, and the combined power they could unleash could slightly restrain a great lord.</p><p></p><p>Class-B war machines, divided into high, middle, and low grades, could accommodate thousands to tens of thousands of Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>As for Class-A war machines, they could accommodate over ten thousand Sovereign Realm experts, and the attacks they unleashed would even require caution from peak great lords.</p><p></p><p>The Ding Seven war defense line was on the edge, so the highest-level war machines here were only middle-grade Class-B. The high-grade Class-B and Class-A war machines were mostly in the core defense line regions, as these precious war machines would only appear on the most important battlefields.</p><p></p><p>Of course, being precious was one aspect, but whether there were enough Sovereign Realm experts was another.</p><p></p><p>This war between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain had actually gathered the elite forces of dozens of surrounding great domains, and could already be considered a fierce war.</p><p></p><p>"War machines."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was said that above the Class-A war machines, there were even higher-level war machines that could accommodate great lord-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific deployment, you should do as you see fit. If there are great lord-level enemies, I will also take action."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said simply, without interfering too much in the details.</p><p></p><p>As the commander of this defense line, Lin Yuan only needed to grasp the overall situation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The single-horned man Luo Peng respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"Take me to see the war machines."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Luo Peng and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"See the war machines?" Luo Peng did not suspect anything and immediately said, "Great Lord, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived in front of a massive war machine.</p><p></p><p>This war machine was a Class-C war machine that could accommodate 368 Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The entire war machine was thousands of miles tall, and once the 368 Sovereigns entered and the war machine was fully operational, its size could expand a hundredfold or even a thousandfold.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a war machine?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the war machine. On the surface, there were countless secret patterns, and it was through these secret patterns that the power of hundreds of Sovereigns could be fully integrated.</p><p></p><p>Gathering the power of hundreds of Sovereigns, each walking a different path, and not causing collisions or even explosions when fusing them together was already no easy feat, let alone truly integrating them. And if they just combined the power of hundreds of Sovereigns without any amplification, it would still be far from enough to threaten a great lord.</p><p></p><p>After all the power was integrated, it would then be amplified by the war machine, and the final attack unleashed would increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>This was the essence of a war machine.</p><p></p><p>"These secret patterns..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed them carefully.</p><p></p><p>【Your innate talent is extraordinary, observing the unknown patterns has increased your understanding of the Chaos Dao.】</p><p></p><p>Numerous insights flashed in his mind, ultimately elevating Lin Yuan's understanding of the Chaos Dao.</p><p></p><p>"These secret patterns can directly enhance my understanding of the Chaos Dao?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was astonished.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, the way Lin Yuan had been improving his understanding of the Chaos Dao was by constantly comprehending and mastering other Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>It was by pushing forward these Dao principles that his understanding of the Chaos Dao was elevated.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Contemplating the secret patterns on the war machine was also able to produce a similar effect? "The essence of the secret patterns is the fundamental veins of the Chaos Dao."</p><p></p><p>"No matter which world or realm, there are no specific Chaos Dao, because the moment the heavens and earth were created, the Chaos Dao had already differentiated into countless Dao principles."</p><p></p><p>"To directly comprehend the Chaos Dao? There is no such opportunity."</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan was comprehending the secret patterns on the war machine, he was also thinking.</p><p></p><p>"But these war machines have actually condensed the fundamental veins of the Chaos Dao? Just who created this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was greatly amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now, his understanding of the Chaos Dao had reached the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>But still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ability to condense the dual-layered chaotic rule context is something that even a single-layered realm cannot achieve.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, what one has realized and what one can express are two different things. "No wonder the war machine can perfectly integrate the power of countless Sovereign Realm experts, no wonder, no wonder."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuansi's thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>When he first learned about the effects of the war machine, he was extremely incredulous.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the broader the vision, the more unbelievable such means of integrating various power rules become.</p><p></p><p>It was only after personally witnessing the war machine that he accepted it. Only the source rule of the Chaotic Rule, which can give rise to countless Dao rules, can bear and contain vastly different power rules.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Dao rules originate from the Chaos and will also return to the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"In my comprehension of the Chaotic Rule, I have only just entered the dual-layered realm. To use the Chaos as a foundation and evolve the Yin-Yang Taiji power of the Chaos, I would at least need to reach the peak of the dual-layered realm, or even the triple-layered realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty in evolving the Yin-Yang Taiji power of the Chaos exceeded Lin Yuan's expectations. Originally, he thought that the dual-layered Chaotic Rule would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the triple-layered Chaotic Realm, even just reaching the peak of the dual-layered Chaotic Realm, given my current rate of comprehension, how long would it take? A hundred thousand years? A million years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Improving the comprehension of the Chaotic Rule is not about improving the comprehension of a single rule, but about improving the comprehension of all rules.</p><p></p><p>This requires a tremendous amount of time and effort.</p><p></p><p>"Too long," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the Chaotic Saints knew of Lin Yuan's thoughts, they would likely be so ashamed that they would choose to reincarnate immediately.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand years or a million years to elevate the Chaotic Rule from the dual-layered realm to the peak of the dual-layered realm? Many Chaotic Saints have spent thousands or even tens of thousands of universe cycles, yet they still have a high probability of not being able to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>A large portion of Chaotic Saints are still at the initial stage of the dual-layered realm in terms of Chaotic Rule comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"It's just these war machines."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the war machines in front of him, his expression lively.</p><p></p><p>Through the Chaotic Runes on the surface of the war machines, Lin Yuan could directly improve his Chaotic Rule comprehension, which was incomparably simpler than the conventional method. And with his Chaotic Rule comprehension enhanced, his comprehension of the myriad Dao rules would naturally also improve.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I didn't leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was quite joyful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, before the war had even started, the Qingfeng Marquis had suggested that Lin Yuan temporarily leave the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingfeng Marquis' eyes, Lin Yuan was a core member of the royal family with immense potential. As long as he crossed into the Grand Venerable Realm, he would be able to quickly sweep through many Grand Venerables.</p><p></p><p>But before that, it would be best for him to remain as low-key as possible, without getting involved in the war between the two major domains.</p><p></p><p>However, after careful consideration, Lin Yuan rejected the Qingfeng Marquis' proposal.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the Qingfeng Marquis treated him well, and Lin Yuan was not too willing to leave at this critical juncture.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, as someone who knows his own family's affairs, Lin Yuan felt that unless the Ancestors of the major Ancient Nations intervened, it would be difficult for him to die.</p><p></p><p>Whether he left the Qingfeng Domain or not, it didn't make much difference to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seems that Lin Yuan's decision was very correct.</p><p></p><p>If he had left the Qingfeng Domain, he definitely would not have had the chance to come into contact with these war machines.</p><p></p><p>Each war machine, even if just a Class C war machine, is a top secret of the major Ancient Nations. Unless a war breaks out, they would not appear outside. Even if a war did occur, outsiders would not be able to approach or even get close to the war machines.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the ruler of this defensive area, Lin Yuan could observe the war machines up close under the pretext of "inspection".</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you can leave now," Lin Yuan glanced at the unicorn-horned man Luo Peng standing beside him and casually said, "I'll stay here for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The unicorn-horned man Luo Peng immediately stood up and left.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure flashed as he entered the interior of the war machine. The Chaotic Runes permeating this place were becoming increasingly complex and profound, and their assistance to Lin Yuan was also becoming increasingly significant.</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Dream Domain, the war machines were operating, and many Grand Venerables were heading to different defensive areas.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful Grand Venerables were basically going to the core battle areas, as the core battle areas had the greatest impact. Once they were captured, it would play a decisive role in the war situation.</p><p></p><p>In the high heavens, in the depths of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a deep blue-green armor, the Spiritual Might King's aura, which was inadvertently emitted, caused the surrounding space-time to distort and collapse.</p><p></p><p>"The Scarlet Pine King of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation has no ambition and will not obstruct me at all costs," the Spiritual Might King calmly observed the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He dared to choose the Qingfeng Domain for the war, in addition to the fact that dozens of major domains around it had his arrangements, another reason was that he had deduced that the Scarlet Pine King was most likely responsible for the defense.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Pine King, with a carefree nature, this could be seen from the fact that he chose to leave the national capital and roam in his domain.</p><p></p><p>For a major ancient nation, the national capital is the most core place. As long as a royal family member has any ambition, they would never leave that place.</p><p></p><p>"The Scarlet Pine King will most likely invite his Sixth Elder Brother to take action," the Spiritual Might King thought, having considered various possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, if it weren't for that Silver River, the smooth planning and implementation, capturing the Qingfeng City would have been much, much simpler."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King sighed. Even though he had meticulously calculated everything, he had never expected that the Qingfeng Marquis had secretly cultivated a Grand Venerable disciple.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Venerable disciple, willing to hide in the Qingfeng City? </p><p></p><p>If he wasn't certain that his planning would not be exposed, the Spiritual Might King would have even thought that there was a traitor on his side, informing the Qingfeng Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"This way is better. Only through war, by thoroughly and openly conquering the Qingfeng Domain and the dozens of surrounding major domains, can my prestige be the highest."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King's gaze turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Although war only cares about victory and defeat, overwhelming with sheer strength is very much in line with the sentiments of those old fossils in the national capital.</p><p></p><p>This would also greatly benefit his chances of becoming a candidate for the imperial throne.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to become the emperor of the ancient nation, being a candidate for the imperial throne is just the beginning. But without becoming a candidate for the imperial throne, one doesn't even have the qualification to compete for the imperial throne.</p><p></p><p>In the Ding Seven Defensive Area.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged inside the war machine, his vast perception enveloping and covering every Chaotic Rune.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary. Observing the unknown patterns has improved your Chaotic Rule comprehension.】</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the flashes of insight in Lin Yuan's mind gradually decreased.</p><p></p><p>"I've pretty much comprehended it all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes. The Chaotic Runes engraved on a single war machine were, after all, limited.</p><p></p><p>A mere Class C war machine could not possibly have too many Chaotic Runes engraved on it, otherwise it would no longer be Class C, but Class B or even Class A.</p><p></p><p>"Next one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out and headed towards the next war machine.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

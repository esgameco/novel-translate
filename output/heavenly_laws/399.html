        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Truly a demonic genius!"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man inwardly exclaimed in admiration. When Lin Yuan was in the two-dimensional world, he had noticed that Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time-space fusion rules was not high. </p><p></p><p>He was still an immeasurably long distance away from comprehending the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>This time, when he threw the comprehension of the extracted time-space fusion rules to Lin Yuan, he found that the other had fallen into an epiphany, at most guessing that he would take a huge step towards comprehending the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that he would directly comprehend the time-space fusion rules?</p><p></p><p>"If he can cross the hurdle of the twelfth stage of life, perhaps in the future he will have the hope of growing to approach the height of a perfect time life?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Approaching a perfect time life was already the highest evaluation he could think of. As for a true perfect time life? They could easily roam among many timelines, and if they wished, could reverse the past and change the future.</p><p></p><p>A perfect time life was an existence that transcended dimensions, indescribable by normal understandings of life.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan comprehended the time-space fusion rules, his consciousness immediately descended into the world within his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the complete fusion of time and space, the world within his body began to undergo a metamorphosis. In terms of direct size, the world within his body did not increase, but in terms of the number of spatial layers, it instantly reached a trillion levels.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in an intangible way, various aspects of the world within his body had achieved significant enhancements.</p><p></p><p>"If I undergo another primordial chaos void infusion into my current inner world, the primordial essence I can withstand will be more than a million times greater than when I broke through from the ninth to the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew in his heart that comprehending the time-space fusion rules had brought about too great an improvement for him. If this were placed among eleventh-stage lives, it would also be a qualitative change, entering the fourth tier of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"That crystalline sphere of light..." Lin Yuan's mind was exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>Within the crystalline sphere of light was contained the comprehension of all the powerful experts of the myriad races who had fallen into the two-dimensional world regarding the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, this included the comprehension of legendary eleventh-stage perfected lives like the Four Celestial Kings and the skinny old man regarding the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>And these legendary lives had all reached the fifth level of attainment in the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the lower limit of that crystalline sphere of light was to elevate Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time-space fusion rules to the fifth level of attainment.</p><p></p><p>As for the upper limit?</p><p></p><p>With the different 'facets' of understanding of the time-space fusion rules from over a billion powerful experts of the myriad races, the quantitative change could lead to a qualitative transformation, perhaps allowing Lin Yuan to directly enter the sixth level of attainment in the realm of the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that fusion rules are divided into first to ninth levels of attainment.</p><p></p><p>The seventh level of attainment of ordinary fusion rules is the extreme limit that eleventh-stage lives can reach.</p><p></p><p>As for the seventh level of attainment of pillar-level fusion rules, that is the realm of ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the seventh level of the supreme time-space fusion rules, even the sixth level - only ultimate existences could comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could cultivate to the sixth level of the time-space fusion rules, it would be equivalent to being able to match ultimate existences in certain aspects.</p><p></p><p>"The sixth level of the time-space fusion rules is still too distant."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind. The so-called directly entering the sixth level of the time-space fusion rules was only theoretical.</p><p></p><p>It was true that a quantitative change could lead to a qualitative transformation, but if the understanding of the time-space fusion rules by just over a billion powerful experts of the myriad races could reach the sixth level, wouldn't the realm of ultimate existences be too cheap?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the vast majority of these billion-plus powerful experts were at the eighth and ninth stages, with very one-sided understandings of the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>On the white paper.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the time-space fusion rules, Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and slightly bowed to the half-meter-tall old man, saying, "Many thanks to the senior."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had obtained the comprehension of the powerful experts of the myriad races regarding the time-space fusion rules based on the rules of the lower-dimensional space, it was still proper to be polite.</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me."</p><p>"These are what you deserve."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man looked deeply at Lin Yuan. With the same comprehension of the time-space fusion rules, other experts might spend hundreds or thousands of years absorbing a portion before comprehending the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had only spent a short half hour.</p><p>The gap was something anyone could see.</p><p></p><p>"This game is over. Those participating players who died, their physical essence and mysteries, comprehension of other rules, soul cores, and so on - I have no use keeping them. Do you want them?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man was silent for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p>"I can have those?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the half-meter-tall old man, somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Wasn't it said that only one could be chosen? How could everything be chosen now?</p><p></p><p>"The rules state only one can be chosen, but I have the authority to deal with the rest. Leaving them here would just be a waste."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man said.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>This was no joking matter.</p><p>With the astonishing effect of observing the crystalline sphere earlier, if Lin Yuan still hesitated, he would truly be foolish.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to a great opportunity falling from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give them to you."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man did not hesitate, waving his right hand, and another four crystalline spheres of light appeared, flying towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous crystalline sphere representing the comprehension of the time-space fusion rules...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>These four clusters of crystalline light were much 'murkier', far from being as pure and flawless as the previous ones. </p><p></p><p>"I did not intentionally refine these four portions, so if you try to comprehend them, you may experience some interference," the half-meter-tall old man warned.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were 'murkier', it would still be far easier than directly comprehending and fusing the rules, equivalent to a heavenly shortcut.</p><p></p><p>"If possible, grasp the Chaos Rules before breaking through to the twelfth stage," the half-meter-tall old man pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Rules?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan retracted the five clusters of crystalline light and looked towards the half-meter-tall elder sitting in front of the giant scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time Lin Yuan had heard of the Chaos Rules. Shen Ji from the Magic Jade Space, the Profound Spirit from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, and the peerless experts like Xia Qin had all mentioned the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you don't need to pursue the Chaos Rules too much, after all... after all, for life forms below the twelfth stage, it is merely a legend," the half-meter-tall old man said.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension ability Lin Yuan currently displayed, coupled with the rule comprehensions of over one billion experts, gave the half-meter-tall old man an inexplicable confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Grasping the Chaos Rules would be greatly beneficial for breaking through to the ultimate stage. If he could comprehend it, Lin Yuan would naturally do his utmost to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"This game has ended, and I should leave as well," the half-meter-tall old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>He controlled the 'white paper', staying within this universe. On the surface, it seemed that he was prevented from leaving by the actions of many peerless experts.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was because he had absorbed enough life into the scroll painting, and then the game began. Stopping now was just going with the flow.</p><p></p><p>"Leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the half-meter-tall old man.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Do you plan to leave directly, or should I send you to a secluded location?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man asked.</p><p></p><p>Outside the painting, many twelfth-stage beings were watching, and he had naturally already noticed them.</p><p></p><p>That was why he asked Lin Yuan specifically.</p><p></p><p>"Please send me to a secluded location," Lin Yuan said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Leaving directly would be equivalent to exposing himself in front of numerous ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the myriad powerful experts from various races in the two-dimensional world were still alive, it might not have been a big deal. As long as the nine peerless experts of human civilization concealed Lin Yuan's aura in time to prevent his tenth-stage aura from leaking out, it would have been fine.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, apart from Lin Yuan, all the other powerful experts from various races had perished, becoming 'nourishment' for Lin Yuan's growth. His ability to comprehend the space-time fusion rules was inseparable from the support of special beings like the Four Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>If he left now, it wasn't that the nine peerless experts of human civilization couldn't protect him, but it would definitely trigger a great war among twelfth-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had methods to conceal himself from the perception of twelfth-stage experts. Previously, when he sent out the native life forms from the two-dimensional world who had entered the Heavenly Gate, he did so silently, undetected by any ultimate being.</p><p></p><p>Outside the painting.</p><p></p><p>Numerous peerless experts had surrounded the mysterious scroll, and ever since their clansmen died in the two-dimensional world, and after the peerless expert Xia Qin guided them towards the idea that the 'white paper' was a 'living being', many peerless experts had planned to use coercive measures against the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>To the shock of all the peerless experts, the slowly unfolding mysterious 'scroll painting' actually began to sway slightly.</p><p></p><p>Each sway sent ripples of space-time disturbances spanning millions of light-years, tens of millions of light-years, and hundreds of millions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"This 'white paper' wants to leave."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the numerous peerless experts changed drastically as they immediately sensed the 'white paper's' intention.</p><p></p><p>But it was to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Even if all the peerless experts joined forces to suppress it, they still couldn't stop the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Vast space-time forces surged as the 'white paper' quickly broke free from the peerless experts' suppression and began flying at a terrifying speed through the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>A huge rift appeared, and this 'white paper' easily charged into the rift, leaving this universe.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The numerous peerless experts rushed over and looked towards where the 'white paper' had disappeared, their expressions turning unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Peerless experts received too many boons from the universe. Once they entered the Chaos Void, they would face a backlash from the entire universe, so no peerless expert dared to pursue it.</p><p></p><p>"This is a huge loss," the peerless expert from the Stellar Alliance lamented inwardly. This time, many special life forms of the Stellar Alliance faced fundamental losses, and even the Four Divine Kings, who had hope of reaching the ultimate stage, would have their chances of breaking through reduced due to this incident.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Stellar Alliance also lost a peerless weapon - the peerless weapon that the Four Divine Kings had brought into the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed into the distance at the spatial rift where the 'white paper' had departed.</p><p></p><p>This 'white paper' had squeezed into the universe and now escaped from it, all within a little over a hundred years. Yet it had profound impacts on the myriad stellar races.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the losses in peak strength suffered by other major stellar races and clans, Lin Yuan's gains could be described as -</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua, the Jie Clan didn't agree?" The Yuzong Ultimate's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>If things had gone smoothly, and the two Jie Clan Ultimates had agreed to fight against the Galactic Overlord, Wanhua's mother queen wouldn't be in this state.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Those two directly refused me."</p><p></p><p>Wanhua's mother queen was a bit helpless. She didn't say a word, and was simply chased out by the two Jie Clan Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>The two Jie Clan Ultimates didn't even give her a chance to speak, clearly having no intention of confronting the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" </p><p></p><p>The Yuzong Ultimate found it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, the Jie Clan could only live comfortably if the various major forces were balanced. </p><p></p><p>If these peak clan forces collapsed, wouldn't it be the Jie Clan's turn?</p><p></p><p>Did the Jie Clan not even understand this principle of mutual destruction?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either," Wanhua's mother queen shook her head.</p><p></p><p>She truly couldn't understand why, if the Jie Clan wanted to seize the opportunity to make demands, they didn't even give her a chance to speak.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was different.</p><p></p><p>Neither Wanhua's mother queen, the Jie Clan Ultimate, nor the other Twelfth-Level Ultimates knew that the two Jie Clan Ultimates had already expressed goodwill towards the Galactic Overlord in advance.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Jie Clan not participate in the plan to deal with the Galactic Overlord, they had directly notified the Galactic Overlord of their plans.</p><p></p><p>In this case, when the Galactic Overlord eventually reached the Twelfth-Level, the Jie Clan wouldn't have too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>The key was that the two Jie Clan Ultimates had speculated that the Galactic Overlord might be the reincarnation of a certain Peerless Great Saint. How could they dare to confront the Galactic Overlord, who was an unrivaled Peerless Great Saint in the chaotic void?</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, one of the Twelfth-Level Ultimates spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the surrounding Twelfth-Level Ultimates looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>What could they do? If the two Jie Clan Ultimates at the Transcendent Dao Realm truly didn't want to get involved, then they would completely lose their greatest foundation to contend with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>As for now starting an all-out war against human civilization? It was indeed a solution, but the difficulty of actual implementation was too great.</p><p></p><p>The outbreak of war would require a huge amount of time, especially for an all-out war. The various peak clan forces would likely have to spend hundreds or thousands of years preparing.</p><p></p><p>By the time that much time had passed, the Galactic Overlord would probably have already broken through to the Ultimate level, rendering it meaningless.</p><p></p><p>And dozens of the strongest experts taking action and attacking the human civilization domain was also not very realistic.</p><p></p><p>The nine Strongest Experts of the human civilization didn't even need to engage in direct combat, they could just hide within their Clan Weapons.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the existence of these Twelfth-Level Ultimates, they were also unwilling to do this. If they really pushed the nine Strongest Experts of the human civilization to the brink, and they fought to the death, could they on this side emerge unscathed? The only use of this would be to interfere with the Galactic Overlord's breakthrough to the Ultimate level, but how much could they really interfere?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there is another way," </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Zhozu Clan Ultimate spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Twelfth-Level Ultimates immediately perked up and turned their gaze towards him.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord is indeed very strong, but even if he's strong, there's still a chance he could fail in his breakthrough to the Ultimate level," this Zhozu Clan Ultimate slowly said, "We just need to wait for the Galactic Overlord's breakthrough to the Ultimate level to fail."</p><p></p><p>As long as the Galactic Overlord's breakthrough to the Ultimate level failed and he was completely destroyed, the balance of the Twelve Great Peak Forces in the universe would be restored.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for the Galactic Overlord's breakthrough to the Ultimate level to fail?" Wanhua's mother queen fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just leaving everything to the whims of fate?</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Wanhua's mother queen spoke up again, "But what if the Galactic Overlord succeeds in breaking through to the Twelfth-Level?"</p><p></p><p>"Succeeds in breaking through to the Twelfth-Level?" The Zhozu Clan Ultimate shook his head, "Then I'll be out of options."</p><p></p><p>Although the "solution" proposed by this Zhozu Clan Ultimate was not really a solution at all, in a certain sense, it was the only hope left for all the Twelfth-Level Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through to the Ultimate level, one would face the suppression and backlash of the long river of time and the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful one's life essence was, there was still a possibility of complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>And this was the only way for the Galactic Overlord to be completely destroyed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all aspects of him had reached the pinnacle, reaching perfection, and he was completely ready to break through to the Ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into his sea of consciousness, gazing at the majestic and grand Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the coordinates of the first Source World were vaguely visible, a boundless and vast world, no less than the Chaotic Void, with a surging aura.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've stabilized after breaking through to the Twelfth-Level, I'll carry out the Twelfth Traversal."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Why did he have to wait until everything was stable before carrying out the next traversal? The time flow in the Source World was the same as the Chaotic Void, where one year there was equivalent to about three hundred years in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>And as long as Lin Yuan stayed in that Source World for a few years, thousands of years would have passed in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan had to wait until there were no more hidden dangers on his side before carrying out the Twelfth Traversal.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he was in the middle of a traversal and something happened in the universe, wouldn't he have to abort the traversal?</p><p></p><p>In the previous eleven traversals, the time flow in the universe was slower than the time flow in those traversal worlds, so no matter how long Lin Yuan stayed in the traversal worlds, not much time would have passed in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that after breaking through to the Twelfth-Level, the Gate of the Myriad Realms will undergo some kind of change," Lin Yuan thought with anticipation, as his comprehension of space-time had reached the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The coordinates of the thirteen source worlds.</p><p></p><p>And when the level of life completely crosses into the twelfth stage, the secrets of the gates of the myriad realms will be revealed before him.</p><p></p><p>After all, at the twelfth stage of life, even if one still cannot bear the main body of the gates of the myriad realms, one can still receive much information about the gates of the myriad realms, and even abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start the assault now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuansi collected his thoughts and immediately began to contact the nine supreme experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The assault on the ultimate for any life form is of utmost importance, and it is best not to be disturbed by anything.</p><p></p><p>Virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw the nine supreme experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Overlord."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme expert looked at Lin Yuan, with a vague guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since the Silver Galaxy Overlord's battle with the ancestor of the Tianyu Clan, the nine supreme experts have not disturbed them at all.</p><p></p><p>They want to give Lin Yuan more time to adjust his own state.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has actively contacted them, "I plan to assault the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, having realized the seven-layer time-space boundary and nurtured the chaos rules, etc.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan believed that he had reached the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>"Assault the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts, including the Xuanyuan supreme expert, looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had long anticipated this possibility, they couldn't help but feel nervous.</p><p></p><p>Even more so than when they assaulted the ultimate themselves.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts were very clear that Lin Yuan's entry into the twelfth stage would have what kind of impact on human civilization.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it would lead human civilization to become the most powerful force in the universe, and the other eleven peak clan forces would have to join forces to barely resist.</p><p></p><p>If he becomes stronger, then it would be the sole ruler of the entire universe, with no one to oppose him.</p><p></p><p>This would be far more significant than human civilization producing another supreme expert, or even five or ten supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Even if human civilization produced ten more supreme experts, or twenty supreme experts, at most it would just force the several peak clan forces to join hands.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan becomes a twelfth-stage being? That would be the peak of the Dao Realm, the undisputed strongest combat force in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan only has two abnormal, unable-to-fully-unleash peak Dao Realm experts, yet they can occupy the most prosperous territories with the least number of clan members.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization having one more peak Dao Realm combat force? The nine supreme experts dared not even imagine it.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Overlord, why don't you wait a little longer, the great destruction of the universe is still far away, there's no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme expert thought for a moment and suggested.</p><p></p><p>He was really worried that Lin Yuan would fail in the assault on the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>A life that fails in the assault on the ultimate cannot be revived by the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Xuanyuan supreme expert vaguely realized that even if Lin Yuan did not fail, as long as he perished, they, the twelfth-stage beings, could not revive him.</p><p></p><p>The essence of reviving past lives by the twelfth-stage beings is to use their own massive life essence to fish out the life imprint from the depths of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? The Xuanyuan supreme expert had personally witnessed the partial size of Lin Yuan's body within the river of time, which could drag the ancestor of the Tianyu Clan down with just one hand.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan perished, the ultimate existences of the twelfth stage would not be able to fish out Lin Yuan's life imprint, even though that life imprint is in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"No need to wait any longer."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>His current state has reached the pinnacle, even if he waits another thousand years or ten thousand years, it would still be the same.</p><p></p><p>Without entering the twelfth stage, even if Lin Yuan undergoes the twelfth crossing, in that source world, he would still have to assault the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>Rather than doing so, it would be better to assault it in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The Xuanyuan supreme expert nodded.</p><p></p><p>"We nine will definitely fully protect your path."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme expert said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>A certain area of the human civilization domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the auras of the nine supreme experts faintly emerged around him.</p><p></p><p>Before assaulting the ultimate, Lin Yuan would definitely tell the supreme experts the location of his assault.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure merged into the deep spatial layer and sat down in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>"First, use the Time-Space Heart." Lin Yuan's mental thought moved, and the Time-Space Heart obtained from the Demon Jade Palace appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The Time-Space Heart was a precious treasure prepared by the Demon Jade Palace Master for his direct disciple, to assist in the assault on the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan believed that his foundation had reached the pinnacle and the assault on the ultimate was almost certain, he didn't mind an extra layer of protection.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swallowed the Time-Space Heart, and immediately felt his heartbeat change, subtly merging with the surrounding time and space.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was time and space, and time and space were Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he roughly knew how the Time-Space Heart could increase the probability of assaulting the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>One is to extend the time he can stay on the river of time.</p><p></p><p>The other is to merge with time and space, thus reducing the pressure of the river of time and even the universe's backlash.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts turned.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan released the suppression of his own life essence leap.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts of human civilization stationed around him had a slight change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they vaguely felt that the void of the universe had changed, as if returning to the origin, as if going back to the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The void of the universe within the vision range of the nine supreme experts was directly torn apart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

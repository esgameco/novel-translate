        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Before the Heavenly Gate, Lin Yuan moved closer to observe, with the two separated by less than half a meter. </p><p></p><p>Behind him, a thin black aura line, as if substantial, blocked the Four Celestial Kings and eleven other legendary perfected experts from entering.</p><p></p><p>This scene was extremely shocking. Even supreme experts like the Four Celestial Kings had uncertain expressions on their faces, not daring to cross that thin line rashly.  </p><p></p><p>Below the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred thousand experts from various races opened their eyes wide.</p><p></p><p>In the scene they witnessed, the Four Celestial Kings and five other experts were originally locked in frenzied combat.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, they all stopped fighting and retreated together. Then, a figure appeared before the Heavenly Gate. </p><p></p><p>With a casual wave, he drew a line, leaving behind the words 'Crossing this line means death.'</p><p></p><p>What was most unbelievable was that the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts did not actually cross that thin line?</p><p></p><p>They just let that suddenly appeared figure stand before the Heavenly Gate?</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation now?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Four Celestial Kings stop fighting?" </p><p></p><p>"That figure appearing before the Heavenly Gate, is it the mysterious expert from the human civilization from two hundred years ago during the Blood Rain Ancient Nation? He suddenly took action and deterred the Four Celestial Kings?"</p><p></p><p>"So domineering, 'Crossing this line means death'? He's not regarding the Four Celestial Kings at all!"</p><p></p><p>The experts from various races discussed rapidly. They were currently at the middle of the mountain and could not sense the aura fluctuations at the peak, so they could only judge based on the reactions of the Four Celestial Kings and others.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The many perfected experts at the eleventh level who had not retreated yet looked at Lin Yuan in utter shock.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong."</p><p></p><p>"How is this 'Blood Rain' from the human civilization so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"With just a move from him, the Four Celestial Kings didn't dare continue fighting?"</p><p></p><p>One perfected expert after another moved closer, sensing more, and became even more astonished.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that with the Four Celestial Kings having refined the ultimate weapons, he was the strongest among all the experts of various races.</p><p></p><p>Even the five other legendary perfected experts at the eleventh level like the Skinny Old Man had to join forces to barely contend with him.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan suddenly appeared? It's known that in the outside world, Lin Yuan was evaluated to be at the level of the Nine Great Experts.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a considerable gap between him and top experts like the Four Celestial Kings and the Skinny Old Man.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Blood Rain..."</p><p></p><p>On the side of the human civilization's evolutionary experts, Xuanyuan Du and others were dazed.</p><p></p><p>Over a month ago, when they learned that Lin Yuan also came from the human civilization, they were exceptionally delighted.</p><p></p><p>Based on the strength Lin Yuan displayed two hundred years ago, even if he was not as powerful as supreme experts like the Four Celestial Kings, he should have the ability to compete for the second, third, or fourth opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>As for the first opening of the Heavenly Gate? To be honest, Xuanyuan Du had never had any expectations. She only followed Lin Yuan here to take a look at what the Heavenly Gate was like.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was very clear about the immense power of the Four Celestial Kings. Even if the Skinny Old Man and others joined forces against the Four Celestial Kings, the one most likely to enter the Heavenly Gate would probably have nothing to do with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So -</p><p></p><p>From the very beginning, Xuanyuan Du never felt that this opening of the Heavenly Gate had anything to do with the human evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>This was a competition between those innately powerful, special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>Many supreme experts were also closely watching the events unfolding at the peak of the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>They could not see the scenes within the two-dimensional world, but they could observe the shared memory scenes of the experts from various races at the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings are indeed powerful."</p><p></p><p>"This opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate should belong to the Four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the unique special lifeforms in the universe, the treasures of the Stellar Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts carefully deduced the outcome of the battle through the memory scenes, finding nothing unexpected.</p><p></p><p>They had known that the Four Celestial Kings should be the eventual winners, as compared to experts from other races, having refined weapons perfectly suited for themselves gave them a huge advantage.</p><p></p><p>The forces behind the experts of various races had also considered eliminating the Four Celestial Kings in advance, but as a result, the Feather Race was slaughtered and eliminated early on.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Just as the supreme experts continued observing, they were stunned when they saw Lin Yuan appear through the memory scenes, forcing the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this an evolutionary expert from the human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"How is he so powerful? He even surpasses the combined strength of the Four Celestial Kings?"</p><p></p><p>One supreme expert after another showed astonished expressions. As twelfth-level ultimates, even the Four Celestial Kings were not considered much in their eyes, at most being young ones with the hope of becoming ultimates.</p><p></p><p>What surprised the supreme experts was the unexpected variable in the situation.</p><p></p><p>There was actually someone even stronger than the Four Celestial Kings? And this expert was from the human civilization?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert from the Stellar Alliance frowned, as he was observing through the memory scenes of the Four Celestial Kings, so he understood more about the aura emanated by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you, Xia Qin, were unwilling to cooperate with me."</p><p></p><p>"Your human civilization hid things really deep."</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert from the Stellar Alliance glanced at the Xia Qin supreme expert with some displeasure, muttering softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood why the Xia Qin supreme expert had been so dismissive before.</p><p></p><p>It was because the human civilization did not need to rely on the Four Celestial Kings at all to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Although the Four Celestial Kings and others did not directly fight Lin Yuan, through perception alone, one could deduce that the latter's strength far exceeded theirs.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, he was much stronger.</p><p></p><p>For this opening of the Heavenly Gate, the one with the highest hope of entering had changed from the Four Celestial Kings to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Over these two hundred years, he had never asked Lin Yuan about his actual strength, feeling that it would put pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether he asked or not, Lin Yuan's strength would not be affected.</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert felt it was better to just let Lin Yuan perform naturally.</p><p></p><p>"At least the thirty-fifth level of the Demonic Ancestor realm."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert judged inwardly that for Lin Yuan to easily force the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts to retreat, when those six were at the thirtieth or thirty-first level of the Demonic Ancestor realm, merely being two or three levels higher would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"How did the human civilization get so lucky?" In the distance, the few Patriarchs of the Feather Race looked at each other, feeling a bit sour in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Their Feather Race had been eliminated early on after descending, so they didn't even bother coming for this opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"This expert from the human civilization, based on his performance in the two-dimensional world surpassing even the Four Celestial Kings, his future hope of crossing into the ultimate realm is probably not small."</p><p></p><p>The Queen Mothers of the Insect Race were quite worried. The human civilization and the Insect Race were absolute mortal enemies with no possibility of reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance and the human civilization still had the possibility of cooperation, but the Insect Race and the human civilization? Upon meeting, even if they didn't fight, cooperation was impossible.</p><p></p><p>And in the eyes of the Insect Race's Queen Mothers, if the human civilization produced another supreme expert in the future, the pressure they would have to bear would also increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Heavenly Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings, the Skinny Old Man, and the other four experts had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>They were closest to Lin Yuan, so they were very clear about the level of expert they were facing.</p><p></p><p>"How is he so much stronger than me?" The Four Celestial King's heart was overwhelmed by towering waves.</p><p></p><p>For over three hundred years, he had not had a single day where he did not cultivate bitterly, unceasingly exploring the ultimate weapon integrated into his body.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that he was invincible in this two-dimensional world. Even against a legendary perfected expert at the eleventh level like the Skinny Old Man, the Four Celestial King had confidence in being able to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a great sense of dread kept surging in the Four Celestial King's mind.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that he absolutely could not defeat the other party.</p><p></p><p>If he insisted on taking action, there was even a possibility of facing a life-or-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?" Not far away, the Skinny Old Man glanced at the Four Celestial King.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the five of them were opposed to the Four Celestial King, but when facing a more powerful enemy, they did not hesitate to join forces.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial King was also somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>The Skinny Old Man's meaning was clear.</p><p></p><p>Should the six of them join forces to probe Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Or should they just leave directly?</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave." The Four Celestial King took a deep look at Lin Yuan, then slowly retreated towards the middle of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>He truly sensed a sense of life-or-death crisis from Lin Yuan, so he decided to give up on this opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>For the Four Celestial King, he did not need to risk his life against Lin Yuan to compete for this chance at the Heavenly Gate. As long as he lived, when the next Heavenly Gate opened, he would still have a chance to enter.</p><p></p><p>As for why he had previously fought the Skinny Old Man and the others? It was simply because the Four Celestial King had no pressure and was very confident in defeating those five experts.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"But now?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings had no confidence at all, and there was even a chance of being defeated here. Naturally, the Four Celestial Kings knew how to make their choice. </p><p></p><p>"Leave?"</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man and the other four powerful experts saw the Four Celestial Kings' actions and looked at each other, also starting to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The five of them found it extremely difficult to deal with even the Four Celestial Kings. Now facing Lin Yuan, who the Four Celestial Kings didn't dare confront, they knew they would lose without even fighting.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the one entering the Heavenly Gate this time would not be any of us," the skinny old man thought heavily, his expression also showing a sense of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The voluntary retreat of the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts made the many powerful experts from various races who were watching tremble in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Retreating without a fight is the behavior of the weak.</p><p></p><p>But were the Four Celestial Kings and the others weak?</p><p></p><p>How could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>The pressure they exuded alone forced ninety-nine percent of the powerful experts from various races to retreat from the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the residual shockwaves from the frenzied battle between the six of them earlier made even many eleventh-level experts' scalps go numb, and they dared not remain on the mountain peak any longer.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings and the other five chose to retreat voluntarily, giving up the opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>The only possibility was that the human 'Blood Rain' currently standing in front of the Heavenly Gate had strength exceeding the limits the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts could handle.</p><p></p><p>It made the Four Celestial Kings not even have the idea of testing him.</p><p></p><p>"Just leave like that?"</p><p></p><p>Most of Lin Yuan's attention was focused on the Heavenly Gate in front of him, but he was still paying attention to the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is right here, and you're not even going to try to test it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised. The words "Whoever crosses this line will be killed" were completely meant to provoke the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Four Celestial Kings and the others possessed many "wondrous treasures" on them.</p><p></p><p>Other powerful experts from various races didn't dare carry "wondrous treasures" with them for fear of being robbed, but the Four Celestial Kings, the skinny old man, and the other eleventh-level perfected lifeforms naturally had no such worries.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in order to maintain their strength, these six experts carried multiple wondrous treasures on them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, from the beginning to the end, Lin Yuan never intended to let these six experts go.</p><p></p><p>But if he directly attacked and killed them, there were many powerful experts watching from outside the painting, and the Four Celestial Kings belonged to the Vast Celestial Alliance, whose relationship with human civilization was not too bad.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't even ask and just directly killed them, it would inevitably look rather unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Killing Tuoba Gushen and the other special lifeforms was just killing, as these special lifeforms had very little hope of reaching the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>But the Four Celestial Kings? Lin Yuan knew that the Four Celestial Kings were the treasures of the Vast Celestial Alliance, with a status no less than his own to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan made that move earlier, drawing the line to provoke the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were provoked and crossed the line to confront Lin Yuan together, just like the skinny old man and the other four experts joined forces against the Four Celestial Kings earlier, Lin Yuan would have a reason to kill them and seize their wondrous treasures.</p><p></p><p>He said whoever crossed the line would be killed, and since they all crossed the line, then it wouldn't be excessive for him to kill them, right?</p><p></p><p>But now Lin Yuan didn't expect the Four Celestial Kings and the other five experts to be so cowardly.</p><p></p><p>"Did the aura I released scare them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reflected on himself and probably figured out the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I won't pretend anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed, no longer caring about appearances.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the "black line" that originally encircled most of the mountain peak suddenly began to expand.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, it encircled the Four Celestial Kings, the skinny old man, and the other four experts.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings were originally planning to retreat from the mountain peak and leave Lin Yuan behind.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, they discovered that the black line drawn by Lin Yuan was rapidly expanding, and before they could react, they found themselves already within the area encircled by the black line.</p><p></p><p>"How can this line move?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings were somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the skinny old man and the other four experts also failed to react in time.</p><p></p><p>They were retreating from Lin Yuan, but now they had all fallen within the black line.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings and the other experts immediately realized something and turned to look at Lin Yuan in front of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you've all crossed the line, don't blame me for taking action."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly turned around, his gaze calm as he said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to take action, don't look for excuses."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' eyes gradually became crazed. With their speed of thought, they now realized that Lin Yuan had never intended to let them go.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' four arms began to glow, emanating a might far exceeding their earlier battle with the skinny old man and the other four experts.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently appeared in front of the Four Celestial Kings and gently pressed down with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>There was no violent collision, not even residual force waves scattered. It seemed like just a light touch, but the Four Celestial Kings' four arms began to twist and deform, their limbs and bones seemingly collapsing into powder as their entire body was sent flying and slammed heavily into the edge of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme weapon is indeed not without reason for its reputation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. If it weren't for the protective force erupting from the Four Celestial Kings' four arms, his palm strike would have likely reduced them to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the current Four Celestial Kings had basically lost sixty percent of their combat strength.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the skinny old man and the other four experts, who had originally planned to see if they could join forces with the Four Celestial Kings, no longer dared to remain after witnessing the latter being severely injured by Lin Yuan. They fled in different directions.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light breath, and a terrifying aura erupted from his body, a dense bloody force spreading out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the areas covered by the bloody force, even the air became viscous. The skinny old man and the other four experts moved as slowly as tortoises, as if bearing the weight of a huge mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, any transcendent force like domains or realms would be suppressed and reduced in dimension.</p><p></p><p>The bloody force field that Lin Yuan was currently displaying was not a domain or realm, but rather a natural force field produced when one's bodily blood vigor reached a certain level of strength.</p><p></p><p>It was like in the cosmic universe, where the greater the mass of a celestial body, the larger the area it naturally influenced - this was a pure physical rule that also applied in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh?"</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man suddenly turned around, because Lin Yuan had already appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>"I have defensive treasures, you can't kill me." The skinny old man didn't continue fleeing but stopped to receive Lin Yuan's attack instead.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings had supreme weapons perfectly suited for them after refinement, so they looked down on the wondrous treasures of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Because in the eyes of the Four Celestial Kings, with their strength, there would never be a day when they needed to use those defensive treasures.</p><p></p><p>But the skinny old man was different - he wore two defensive treasures, believing that no matter how strong Lin Yuan was, it would be difficult for him to kill him.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan struck out with his palm again.</p><p></p><p>Squelch.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force permeated the skinny old man's two defensive treasures, with only one ten-millionth of the force landing on his body.</p><p></p><p>But even one ten-millionth was more than the skinny old man could withstand. In an instant, most of his internal organs were shattered, and he completely lost the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instantly appeared behind the third expert and struck with another palm.</p><p></p><p>The fourth, another palm.</p><p></p><p>The fifth, another palm.</p><p></p><p>"This..." The powerful experts from various races who were observing the battle were struck speechless when they witnessed this one-sided slaughter.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed that legendary eleventh-level perfected lifeforms as powerful as the Four Celestial Kings and the skinny old man would have a day when they would be slaughtered like this.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the supreme experts high above, who else could accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>This place could no longer be considered part of the two-dimensional world, but rather a more hidden layer of space.</p><p></p><p>On a vast expanse of land, an old man only half a meter tall was lying leisurely in a recliner chair, his eyes squinting.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was a huge "painting" on display.</p><p></p><p>Clouds drifted within the "painting", as if containing a vast, real world.</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man was originally napping but was suddenly disturbed by something, opening his eyes and glancing at the huge "painting" in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through thirty world limits in just over three hundred years, have I stumbled upon a treasure this time?" The half-meter-tall old man's gaze showed astonishment as he observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>"No, this talent and aptitude is too monstrous. Let me continue observing..."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man thought for a moment. "I'll keep observing for another ten thousand years and see just how far you can go."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

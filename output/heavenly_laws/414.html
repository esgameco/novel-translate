        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Within the scroll space, there was only an area of a thousand miles in radius. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around with one glance.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that in the central position, there were two tall platforms seated.</p><p></p><p>At the same time. </p><p></p><p>Two messages were transmitted from within the two tall platforms.</p><p></p><p>The message from the platform on the left was: "Any of my boundless void beings can use this token to enter the void secret realm and slay the void creatures."</p><p></p><p>This message was very simple. </p><p></p><p>It was purely just a message, without any pressure or profoundness. However, the first sentence "Any of my boundless void beings" had a somewhat arrogant tone.</p><p></p><p>The boundless void was vast and expansive. Demon gods belonged to the boundless void beings, and some other special existences were also boundless void beings. </p><p></p><p>Simply put, as long as a life was born in the boundless void, it was considered a boundless void being.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan himself was considered a semi-boundless void being. </p><p></p><p>This martial ancestor golden body of his was also nurtured from the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>"The void secret realm? Slay void creatures? What are these void creatures? Is it just simply slaying them?" Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If there were no benefits, why would those selfish demon gods bother fighting so-called "void creatures"? But in Lin Yuan's soul search of the Black Demon Lord, he sensed both fear and desire towards that void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"There should be some great benefit," Lin Yuan thought secretly. The Black Demon Lord's memories about the void secret realm were also obscured. </p><p></p><p>But from his emotional fluctuations, Lin Yuan could deduce a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>"The void secret realm should be in that direction," Lin Yuan's gaze looked towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The message transmitted from the left platform also contained the specific coordinates of the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Black Demon Lord's memories also had the approximate location of that void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>...Compared to the brief message from the left platform, the message from the right platform was much more complex.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a secret technique? A body refining secret technique?" Lin Yuan's eyes flickered with a strange light. He himself cultivated the 'Profound Yellow Body' technique, which was a supreme body refining secret technique.</p><p></p><p>When cultivated to the utmost, it could dominate the twelve levels.</p><p></p><p>"The details are not as good as the 'Profound Yellow Body', but the upper limit seems not low, and requires an extremely deep comprehension of the laws of physics."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly browsed through it.</p><p></p><p>The laws of physics were one of the pillar rules, the foundation of all matter. Flesh and blood naturally belonged to matter as well.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the 'Profound Yellow Body' also required the laws of physics, but Lin Yuan had long comprehended the laws thoroughly.  </p><p></p><p>"So the Black Demon Lord did not cultivate deeply into this body refining secret technique, otherwise he would have crossed into the tenth level long ago. Was it because his comprehension of the laws of physics was insufficient?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. The demon gods of the boundless void possessed many innate abilities, essentially being incarnations of rules themselves. But for these demon gods to comprehend other rules was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Many demon gods could not even maintain their sanity at all times.</p><p></p><p>"This body refining secret technique can still be referenced and learned from," Lin Yuan nodded slightly. Although not as good as the 'Profound Yellow Body', the two were from completely different angles of tempering the flesh, so there were still things to be gained.</p><p></p><p>...Next, Lin Yuan took the opportunity to inspect all the remaining spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>Then he began watching the remaining memories of the three demon gods.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Lord and the other three demon gods stood at the pinnacle of this region, so they naturally understood the surrounding information very well.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the memories of the Primordial Demonic Tree itself, Lin Yuan immediately had a general impression of the vast boundless void.</p><p></p><p>First, the boundless void had no end. Even for demon gods, its actual size and range were still unknown until now. </p><p></p><p>According to the memories of a few demon gods, the boundless void was divided into void domains. The void domain where the Azure World was located was called the "Three Yin Void Domain".</p><p></p><p>The strongest demon god in the Three Yin Void Domain was the "Three Yin Domain Lord", infinitely close to the ninth stage demon god.</p><p></p><p>Even the Black Demon Lord and the other three demon gods were nominally subordinates of that "Three Yin Domain Lord".</p><p></p><p>"The Three Yin Domain Lord?" Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn. In the Black Demon Lord's memories, there was immense dread towards that Three Yin Domain Lord, even fear.</p><p></p><p>"That Three Yin Domain Lord has at least peak tenth level strength, or has half a foot into the eleventh level?" Lin Yuan was only slightly solemn. With his current strength, activating the divine ability "World", even if all aspects were inferior to his main universe true body, he could still subdue early and mid eleventh level beings.</p><p></p><p>Unless an actual ninth stage demon god appeared before him, Lin Yuan had no fear at all. Even against a ninth stage demon god, the threat to Lin Yuan was very limited - if he couldn't win, he could simply retreat safely.</p><p></p><p>...After organizing everything, Lin Yuan moved his mind slightly, and the Myriad Realms Gate deep in his consciousness rippled lightly as the mysterious gourd slowly descended across dimensions.</p><p></p><p>"While cultivating, I'll take the opportunity to elevate my inner world to the limit," Lin Yuan picked up the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Under the premise of realm sharing, for this martial ancestor golden body and two spiritual souls to absorb the seven colored liquids within the mysterious gourd was not difficult at all and could be done in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The current size and foundation of his inner world had an increasingly profound impact on Lin Yuan's strength. The power of the "World" divine ability was completely determined by his inner world.</p><p></p><p>...In a certain place of the Three Yin Void Domain, within a majestic palace, the Three Yin Domain Lord sat high on the throne, with many subordinate demon gods kneeling below.</p><p></p><p>As the ruler of a void domain, the Three Yin Domain Lord's strength was unquestionable. Among demon gods, prestige had to be slaughtered out, without any shortcuts.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that I'm only one step away from the ninth stage," the Three Yin Domain Lord's gaze flickered with desire as it looked at the many kneeling demon gods below.</p><p></p><p>If it devoured these demon gods, it could advance one more step.</p><p></p><p>The Three Yin Domain Lord would not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, for demon gods to grow from the eighth stage to the ninth stage, simply devouring had limited effect, and other aspects of accumulation were needed.</p><p></p><p>"My mind and will are already strong enough with the help of that void secret realm, but my comprehension of rules? We demon gods are innately powerful, how can we comprehend rules?"</p><p></p><p>The Three Yin Domain Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the demon gods below seemed to receive some information and immediately spoke: "Great Domain Lord, your subordinate 'Black Demon' has perished. According to the intelligence, it died outside a world."</p><p></p><p>"Black Demon?" The Three Yin Domain Lord looked down. "So it was him."</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years ago, Black Demon had personally come to the palace and submitted to the Three Yin Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>This was a rule set by the Three Yin Domain Lord - any demon god within the Three Yin Void Domain that reached a certain strength had to come pay obeisance. Otherwise, they would be enemies of the Three Yin Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It also had a token to enter that void secret realm, but died so quickly," the Three Yin Domain Lord thought to itself. It had some impression of the Black Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Because the Black Demon Lord and the Three Yin Domain Lord were kindred spirits who could enter that mysterious void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the Three Yin Domain Lord had entered that void secret realm much earlier than the Black Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while the Three Yin Domain Lord was quite familiar with the Black Demon Lord, the Black Demon Lord did not know that its greatest secret had already been seen through by the Three Yin Domain Lord.</p><p></p><p>The gap in their strength was too vast.</p><p></p><p>"How did Black Demon die?" the Three Yin Domain Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Regarding that void secret realm, in the eyes of the demon god domain lords of the boundless void, it was not much of a secret. They basically all held tokens to freely enter and exit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, demon gods below the domain lord level also had a small chance of obtaining tokens to enter that void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Three Yin Domain Lord felt some regret. The Black Demon Lord possessed a token to enter and exit that secret realm, so its future growth potential should not be low. Perhaps there was hope for it to approach the Three Yin Domain Lord's level? Of course, the Three Yin Domain Lord did not feel any grief - to it, the Black Demon Lord was just a tool.</p><p></p><p>If it grew well in the future, then the Three Yin Domain Lord didn't mind using it.</p><p></p><p>If it even grew close to a domain lord level demon god, the Three Yin Domain Lord wouldn't mind taking action to devour it for a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>Devouring other demon gods had no help in becoming a ninth stage demon god, but it was a delicacy - the stronger the demon god, the better it tasted.</p><p></p><p>"Domain Lord, please look at the memory footage from the observer at that time," the demon god below immediately raised its hand, and a series of scenes appeared, depicting the Black Demon Lord and three other demon gods coming to the outside of the Azure World, intending to attack from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Three Yin Domain Lord watched the memory footage, and its expression suddenly changed, somewhat incredulous. "Disappeared? I didn't even see..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand how they disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"This Black Demon Lord, what enemy did he provoke?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Three Yin Domains was somewhat alarmed. </p><p></p><p>Although the memory scenes came from the observing Demon God and could not reproduce the real scenes 100%, the disappearance of the powerful Black Demon Lord and three other Demon Gods without reason still made the Lord of the Three Yin Domains feel like facing a formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>"It must be some rule, it must involve some rule. The Demon God who took action is even closer to the ninth stage than me, perhaps it was a ninth stage Demon God?"</p><p></p><p>Towering waves surged in the Lord of the Three Yin Domains' heart. Even if this was just a guess, unless he had seen it with his own eyes, the Lord of the Three Yin Domains dared not confirm whether it was a ninth stage Demon God that took action. But it was enough to make his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, what...what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The kneeling Demon Gods below could not help but ask.</p><p></p><p>In the Three Yin Void Domain, the Lord of the Three Yin Domains was the absolute ruler. The Black Demon Lord, as a subordinate Demon God of the Three Yin Lord, fell without reason, which was equivalent to slapping the Lord of the Three Yin Domains in the face.</p><p></p><p>In order to command more Demon Gods, the Lord of the Three Yin Domains would occasionally make gestures to help his subordinate Demon Gods take revenge.</p><p></p><p>Absolute strength alone could not make all Demon Gods completely submit. When necessary, he had to show "favors and benefits."</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Three Yin Domains looked grim. Regardless of whether the being that took action against the Black Demon Lord was a ninth stage Demon God or not, it was undoubtedly more powerful than the Lord of the Three Yin Domains himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let all the Demon Gods in my Three Yin Void Domain avoid that area."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the Lord of the Three Yin Domains immediately ordered.</p><p></p><p>With such an existence in the area he ruled, the Lord of the Three Yin Domains could only helplessly restrain his subordinate Demon Gods from approaching and provoking it.</p><p></p><p>"Avoid that area?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other Demon Gods below looked at each other and immediately realized that the being who took action against the Black Demon Lord must be extremely powerful. Otherwise, the great Lord of the Three Yin Domains would not retreat like this.</p><p></p><p>...Just over a month later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body and the inner worlds of his two primordial spirits had all reached the extreme, each spanning 2.3 billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>"Those Demon Gods who were secretly watching have all disappeared?" Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he looked out beyond his world.</p><p></p><p>Ever since his return to the Tian Qing World, with the invasions of the Demon Gods Moeye and Wantouchflow, Lin Yuan had sensed the feeling of being watched from a distant location.</p><p></p><p>It should be other Demon Gods watching the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>This was very normal. To Demon Gods, the Tian Qing World was like a delicious food. Even after the incident with the Black Demon Lord and three other Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>Other Demon Gods realized the Tian Qing World was not easy to provoke, but if they couldn't defeat it, it was perfectly normal to take a look when they had nothing better to do.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan keenly noticed that even those watching gazes had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." Lin Yuan felt some regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to send out the two primordial spirits to sweep through and kill some Demon Gods after his own strength reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>Killing powerful Demon Gods like the Black Demon Lord had given Lin Yuan a taste of the sweetness. Even if the other Demon Gods were not as wealthy, at least they would be better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Is this related to the Lord of the Three Yin Domains?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed in his heart. According to the Black Demon Lord's memories, only the highly exalted Lord of the Three Yin Domains could command so many Demon Gods at once.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I should focus on improving the Tian Qing World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly stood up. For the past month or so, most of his mental efforts had been devoted to comprehending the "World Talisman Imprint" and the rules of space-time fusion.</p><p></p><p>And as time passed, Lin Yuan increasingly felt the limitations the Tian Qing World imposed on him.</p><p></p><p>As the Lord of the World, the Tian Qing World could not reject Lin Yuan, but the gap in their levels was too large.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the inner worlds reached 2.3 billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>It was like the relationship between a sword and its sheath.</p><p></p><p>The sharpness and aura of the sword alone could tear apart the sheath.</p><p></p><p>They did not quite match.</p><p></p><p>"With my current understanding of the essence of the world, elevating the level of the Tian Qing World should not be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Qing World had now become his backyard and base. Raising its level would allow it to accommodate more martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would also be able to live more comfortably inside.</p><p></p><p>There were only benefits and no drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan walked out of the Martial Hall, High Priest Qing Yao and some other elders of the Tian Qing World respectfully bowed and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and calmly said, "Next, I will elevate the level of this world, you all take note."</p><p></p><p>Before he finished speaking, Lin Yuan disappeared from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>In the high skies of the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>Here, space was distorted. Lin Yuan stood towering, looking down at the entire Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>From this vantage point, the diameter of the Tian Qing World exceeded 10 billion miles, which was quite vast. But to a tenth stage peak life like Lin Yuan, it was clearly a bit cramped.</p><p></p><p>"Expand, expand, expand!"</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, the origin of the entire Tian Qing World immediately seethed, beginning to wildly absorb power from the boundless outer void.</p><p></p><p>The endless power that even Demon Gods could not directly absorb rushed into the Tian Qing World, causing it to rapidly expand. The lands extended, the oceans grew larger, and new lands emerged from the depths of the oceans.</p><p></p><p>During the active elevation of the Tian Qing World's level, Lin Yuan also gained immensely. With each expansion of the world, Lin Yuan's comprehension increased as well.</p><p></p><p>[Your aptitude is heaven-defying. By leading the world's expansion, your comprehension of the essence of the world has increased...] In just a few days, Lin Yuan's understanding of the "World Talisman Imprint" soared by one-tenth. According to estimates, for Lin Yuan to normally reach this level of progress, it would take at least decades.</p><p></p><p>"This should be enough for now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly stopped his comprehension and looked at the Tian Qing World, which had swelled tenfold in size.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? The rules of space-time fusion have reached the third level realm?" Lin Yuan raised his brows.</p><p></p><p>Even before the tenth spatial jump, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the space-time fusion rules had neared the peak of the second level realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, during the active elevation of the Tian Qing World's level, he had directly advanced the space-time fusion rules into the third level realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that worlds also have limits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed in his heart. The reason the Tian Qing World could expand tenfold in just a few days was mainly due to the accumulation over the past tens of millions of years. Under the "management" of the Primordial Demon Tree, the foundation of the Tian Qing World had been slowly improving until it all erupted now.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was also related to Lin Yuan's own realm. His understanding of the "World Talisman Imprint", as well as his comprehension of the space-time fusion rules and many other fusion rules, had all merged into the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>From now on, for the Tian Qing World to continue expanding, Lin Yuan's own realm would need to increase further, and the world's intrinsic foundation would need to accumulate to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was not something that could be achieved in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>High Priest Qing Yao and the many elders of the Tian Qing World had witnessed the entire process of the world's transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The world...the world has changed. The sky has become higher, the earth thicker, and the space more vast."</p><p></p><p>The elders gulped. Although they had long regarded the Martial Ancestor as their ultimate faith to worship, when they actually witnessed this scene, the shock in their hearts was still indescribable.</p><p></p><p>...After elevating the level of the Tian Qing World, Lin Yuan returned to the depths of the Martial Hall once more.</p><p></p><p>"Now this is much more comfortable."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. At this moment, the Tian Qing World could finally accommodate him.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the boundless void was actually more suitable, but as the "Heavenly Dao" of the Tian Qing World, being within the world was the safest for him.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of the Tian Qing World's origin, Lin Yuan's combat strength would be at its peak.</p><p></p><p>"You go to that void secret realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Sun Primordial Spirit and took out the "scroll", handing it over.</p><p></p><p>Now that the two primordial spirits had completely absorbed the liquid from the mysterious gourds, their strength had reached the limit and could be sent out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan placed great importance on that void secret realm, so he let the Sun Primordial Spirit go there first to see if there was anything special about it.</p><p></p><p>"As for you, search for more worlds and spread the martial path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Moon Primordial Spirit. The boundless void was filled with worlds.</p><p></p><p>And these worlds were the best targets for Lin Yuan to spread the martial path.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, while searching for more worlds, the Moon Primordial Spirit could also hunt some Demon Gods for research.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's true body, he would naturally preside over the Tian Qing World and rule over all.</p>

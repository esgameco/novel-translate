        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Thump! Thump! Thump!!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart beat slowly, each beat pumping blood to his limbs and throughout his entire body. </p><p></p><p>For a powerful cultivator at Lin Yuan's level, the heart was no longer a mere organ.</p><p></p><p>It gathered an immense amount of energy, so the term 'beating' was not quite accurate - it was more like 'inhaling and exhaling'.</p><p></p><p>It was the root of the physical body, the foundation of his corporeal form.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Martial Ancestor Golden Body was cultivated entirely according to human standards. With each inhale and exhale of his heart, the deepest information or 'imprint' in his bloodline became more and more concentrated.</p><p></p><p>Until it was completely formed.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!!</p><p></p><p>An indescribably complex imprint of divine abilities was born, causing all the power in his bloodline to surge.</p><p></p><p>Aided by this newborn divine imprint, Lin Yuan seemed to see the initial birth of the Azure World, even scenes from before the Azure World's creation, like an epic.</p><p></p><p>The most minute structures of the world, any changes, all flooded into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The birth of the world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched, entranced.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, eighth-rank evolved beings opened inner worlds within their bodies.  </p><p></p><p>But this 'opening' completely relied on the space-time structure of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to establishing a remarkably similar world on the 'template' of the main universe.  </p><p></p><p>After further evolution, when cultivators comprehended the laws of time, mastering space-time, their inner worlds became 'independent' and 'complete'.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how 'independent' or 'complete', they originated from the main universe.  </p><p></p><p>Just like a newborn separated from the mother's womb - although free of the mother's body, everything about the child came from the mother.</p><p></p><p>To open a complete world from nothing, without relying on any 'mother' -  </p><p></p><p>Not even eleventh-rank beings could do it. Perhaps only the most supreme beings had that hope.</p><p></p><p>Replicating is easy.  </p><p></p><p>Creating is the most difficult.</p><p></p><p>But now, as Lin Yuan observed the divine imprint coalescing in the depths of his bloodline, he faintly witnessed the process of the world's birth from nothingness.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the imprint of the world's birth, your understanding of the world's essence has increased.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in watching, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>The divine imprint deep in his bloodline contracted, streams of information transmitting out from this imprint.</p><p></p><p>"My fifth physical body divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind shook, and he immediately began observing the information gushing out from the divine imprint.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the four previous divine imprints Lin Yuan birthed, the manifestation of this current imprint was absolutely the greatest, even involving scenes from before the Azure World's creation.</p><p></p><p>Those were scenes that even Lin Yuan, as the 'Heavenly Dao' of the Azure World, could not trace back to - yet they appeared in his mind after this physical body divine ability coalesced.</p><p></p><p>"Physical body divine ability - World!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly understood his fifth physical body divine ability.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability's power was extremely formidable. Once activated, with Lin Yuan at the center, it would form a world of the same size as his inner world.  </p><p></p><p>In simple terms, this divine ability could temporarily transform Lin Yuan's inner world into an outer world.</p><p></p><p>This was not a world illusion or the power of worlds, but a truly real world enveloping him. As the world's master, Lin Yuan could easily control the world's primal forces, each of his moves amplified tenfold or a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>While his enemies would be suppressed by the world itself, their speed plummeting, strength dropping drastically, weakened in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, truly outrageous."</p><p></p><p>Even with great expectations for this physical body divine ability, thinking it might become his strongest,</p><p></p><p>After understanding the information about the 'World' divine ability, Lin Yuan still felt an inexplicable shock.</p><p></p><p>Because this divine ability was simply too heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>It's well known, when are cultivators at the eighth rank and above in the main universe at their strongest?</p><p></p><p>Activating forbidden secret techniques?  </p><p></p><p>Wielding powerful weapons?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>Neither of those.</p><p></p><p>It's when they are within their inner worlds that their power peaks.  </p><p></p><p>Within the inner world, they can freely wield the vast forces of the world - a complete home-field advantage.</p><p></p><p>Even ninth or tenth rank beings would not dare easily enter an eighth rank being's inner world.  </p><p></p><p>With a tenth rank being's strength, even inside an eighth rank's inner world, they cannot be suppressed by the vast world forces. But what if that eighth rank being detonated their inner world?</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of a world exploding could severely injure even a tenth rank.</p><p></p><p>An eighth rank severely injuring a tenth rank - at any other time this would be an unthinkable fantasy. But if that tenth rank entered the eighth rank's inner world, it could very well happen.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The home-field advantage of the inner world is powerful, but has a fatal flaw.</p><p></p><p>Unless the power gap is as vast as heaven and earth, it's almost impossible for one side to pull the other into their inner world.  </p><p></p><p>You have an inner world, I have an inner world.</p><p></p><p>Just activate the forces of our inner worlds, mutually canceling each other out to resist being pulled in.</p><p></p><p>It's like two magnets of the same polarity - no matter how much larger one is than the other, the same magnetic repulsion prevents them from sticking together.</p><p></p><p>In battles between eighth and ninth ranks, they often try to shatter the other's inner world from the outside. As for shattering from the inside?</p><p></p><p>No one is that stupid to easily enter the other's inner world, right?</p><p></p><p>But the 'World' divine ability Lin Yuan birthed can instantly coalesce an outer world.  </p><p></p><p>Whether you want to come in or not, it directly envelops the area in his world, equivalent to forcibly turning any place into a complete home-field advantage for himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 'World' divine ability is not without flaws - its duration is very short, only about six seconds.  </p><p></p><p>But that cannot conceal how heaven-defying it is. Six seconds is enough to do many things.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the same rank falling into the other's inner world for six seconds? Who knows how many times they'd be battered and crushed.</p><p></p><p>"Too excessive." Lin Yuan's eyes burned slightly.  </p><p></p><p>Compared to his previous four physical body divine abilities, the 'World' divine ability was purely for offense.</p><p></p><p>Once the outer world coalesced, Lin Yuan could not move, only trying his utmost to defeat the enemy within the world's duration.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, even the 'Strengthening' divine ability had a self-preservation aspect, like activating it to drastically increase speed for escaping.</p><p></p><p>"But I like it."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.  </p><p></p><p>The 'World' divine ability completely depended on his inner world, because the outer world it coalesced was based on his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The more formidable his inner world, the more powerful the coalesced outer world.</p><p></p><p>And the inner world was precisely Lin Yuan's greatest strength. Leaving aside spatial depth for now, just the visible size was over twenty times larger than other cultivators of the same rank in the main universe.  </p><p></p><p>This 'over twenty times' referred to the diameter. If calculated by volume, who knows how many times larger.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was simply tailor-made for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The most powerful use of the 'World' divine ability is self-detonation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The outer world lasted six seconds. If he couldn't defeat the opponent in the first five seconds, then in the sixth second he would detonate it directly.</p><p></p><p>Although the outer world was completely modeled on his inner world, it was ultimately not the inner world, but a replica instantly coalesced based on the 'World' divine ability using his inner world as the 'template'.  </p><p></p><p>The size and might were the same.</p><p></p><p>But they were not the same entity in the end.</p><p></p><p>If the outer world self-detonated, it would not be equivalent to his inner world detonating.  </p><p></p><p>At most, Lin Yuan would suffer some backlash, far less cost than detonating his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Detonating the inner world was basically a mutually-assured destruction technique.  </p><p></p><p>While detonating the outer world would only result in some backlash.</p><p></p><p>The difference in severity was clear.</p><p></p><p>"With the foundation of my true self's inner world, coalescing an outer world, if it self-detonates, even legendary eleventh rank perfected beings like the Four Divine Kings would undoubtedly perish."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, "While I would only suffer some backlash?"</p><p></p><p>This was with his true self at the tenth rank. If he advanced to the eleventh rank and again received an infusion of the primal chaos void essence, drastically increasing his inner world's foundation...</p><p></p><p>The might of the self-detonating outer world he could then coalesce was beyond Lin Yuan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>"This move can only be used once."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew. His true self's inner world in the main universe spanned two billion miles in diameter, so the coalesced outer world would be that size too.  </p><p></p><p>For eleventh rank experts, as long as they understood this move's principles, staying over two billion miles away from Lin Yuan would be safe.</p><p></p><p>An eleventh rank's attack range was measured in light-years.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Let's calculate, a distance of over two billion li is nothing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's easier said than done. Lin Yuan could completely conceal his aura, sneak within two billion li of the enemy, and then directly activate the divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>"Next, the most important thing is to fully comprehend the imprint of this divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was slightly solemn. </p><p></p><p>Only by fully comprehending the divine ability's imprint could he bring it to the main world and etch it onto his true spirit's body.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to elaborate on how much this divine ability would enhance Lin Yuan's combat strength. Even if it meant sacrificing time to comprehend the rules of space-time fusion, he had to first fully comprehend this divine ability imprint.</p><p></p><p>He could comprehend the rules of space-time fusion anywhere - the main universe or other traversed worlds.</p><p></p><p>But the divine ability imprint of 'World' could only be comprehended on this ancestral warrior's golden body.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In the vast, boundless void.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master and three friends were rapidly heading towards the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Enormous and terrifying auras were emanating from these four demonic gods from outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, even at a great distance, it made other demonic gods from outside the realm tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Sect Master, is that the Black Demon Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Black Demon Sect Master, there are three other demonic gods of the same powerful level!"</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Wasn't the Black Demon Sect Master in seclusion?"  </p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, the Black Demon Sect Master must be going to the Azure World. Two members of the Black Demon Sect previously fell in the Azure World."</p><p></p><p>Many of the demonic gods from outside the realm gazed from afar. The Black Demon Sect Master's influence was truly immense, instilling fear in numerous demonic gods. What's more, the powerful demonic gods accompanying the Black Demon Sect Master this time were no weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Black Demon, what secret does that world hold for you to be so cautious?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, what is it that requires us to join forces to go there?"</p><p></p><p>"Black Demon, we'll follow your lead in joining forces, but we can't go on a futile trip."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master's three 'friends' rapidly communicated while rushing towards the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>As demonic gods from outside the realm, they never acted without profit. It was impossible for them to help the Black Demon Sect Master take revenge for free.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the secret contained in that world is no small matter. It can rapidly increase the power of the world's origin force. As long as we take that world, I'm willing to share this secret with you all."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master glanced at his three 'friends' and continued, "Furthermore, I can let you enter that void secret realm with me to explore the opportunities within."</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon is still generous."  </p><p></p><p>"I'll definitely help you with this grudge."</p><p></p><p>The three demonic gods from outside the realm were overjoyed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the secret of the Azure World for now, they had long coveted the void secret realm guarded by the Black Demon Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Demon Sect Master held the 'key' to that secret realm. Without the Black Demon Sect Master leading the way, they could never enter.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master didn't respond upon hearing this and continued rushing towards the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Azure World's secret of greatly enhancing the world's origin force, it was no loss for the Black Demon Sect Master if more demonic gods knew about it.</p><p></p><p>As for the void secret realm he guarded, even without the matter of the Azure World, the Black Demon Sect Master had planned to invite the other three demonic gods there.</p><p></p><p>Over the past tens of millions of years, the Black Demon Sect Master had reached a bottleneck in exploring that void secret realm. From now on, relying solely on his own strength, it would be difficult to make any further gains.</p><p></p><p>So joining forces with the other three demonic gods to explore was almost inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Black Demon Sect Master and the other three demonic gods from outside the realm stopped and gazed at the distant Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the world?"</p><p></p><p>"The world's origin force is indeed abundant."</p><p></p><p>"It looks quite delicious."</p><p></p><p>The other three demonic gods from outside the realm carefully examined it. As demonic gods, they were innately able to sense the level of origin force contained within a world.</p><p></p><p>And the Azure World before them could undoubtedly be described as 'bountiful'.</p><p></p><p>"Black Demon, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you called us here, you can give the orders."</p><p></p><p>Although the three demonic gods from outside the realm were eager to devour the Azure World, they also understood that for the Black Demon Sect Master to call them over, the Azure World must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this joint effort was led by the Black Demon Sect Master. They had only come to help, lured by the temptation of the void secret realm. So the three demonic gods were very obedient.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to approach that world. Just attack it from a distance."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master said. Although the Azure World itself had an abundant origin force, it was limited by being a world and could not actively attack areas outside the world.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Black Demon Sect Master only needed to attack from afar, and the Azure World would be a sitting target.</p><p></p><p>This was also the advantage that allowed demonic gods from outside the realm to treat worlds as food - the origin force contained within a world was undoubtedly far greater than an individual demonic god.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, worlds could not actively retaliate.</p><p></p><p>It was like the difference between herbivores and carnivores.</p><p></p><p>No matter how large an herbivore was, it could never resist a carnivore.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The three demonic gods from outside the realm nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Azure World's martial palace, Lin Yuan was sitting cross-legged, comprehending the imprint of the divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Sect Master is taking the initiative to come?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced outside the world.</p><p></p><p>By relying on the power sculpture from the Black Demon Sect Master, Lin Yuan could easily lock onto the Black Demon Sect Master's location through the causal resonance.</p><p></p><p>So from the time the Black Demon Sect Master started moving until he approached the Azure World, everything was within Lin Yuan's grasp.</p><p></p><p>"He even brought three demonic gods?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately sensed the auras of the three demonic gods besides the Black Demon Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect."</p><p></p><p>"I can try out the divine ability 'World'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Black Demon Sect Master didn't come, Lin Yuan had planned to try activating the 'World' divine ability to get familiar with controlling the details.</p><p></p><p>Compared to perceiving the 'World' divine ability, dealing with the Black Demon Sect Master and the other three strongest demonic gods from outside the realm in this area was merely incidental.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the secret of the 'World' divine ability would be exposed, those powerful experts in the main universe had avatars. If Lin Yuan used the 'World' divine ability, he couldn't completely kill them, so it was possible they would discover something.</p><p></p><p>But those four demonic gods outside? According to Lin Yuan's causal resonance, they didn't have any avatars. As long as he thoroughly dealt with them, the secret naturally wouldn't be exposed.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the boundless void, other demonic gods from outside the realm were also paying attention to the Black Demon Sect Master and the other three.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Demon Sect Master is really cautious, not even planning to approach the Azure World."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there are great horrors within the Azure World. 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' couldn't even escape. The Black Demon Sect Master naturally wouldn't underestimate it."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, attacking from a distance is wise. Once the Azure World is breached, the great horrors inside will naturally reveal themselves."</p><p></p><p>Many demonic gods from outside the realm rapidly discussed, eagerly anticipating what scene would unfold after the Black Demon Sect Master and the other three demonic gods tore open the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of all the demonic gods, the outcome of the Azure World was almost predetermined.</p><p></p><p>With the Black Demon Sect Master and three other powerful demonic gods attacking, and being so cautious, the Azure World had no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"Begin the attack."</p><p></p><p>"Don't hold back at all."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master's eighteen arms gathered terrifying energy fluctuations as he instructed his three 'friends'.</p><p></p><p>Under the full power attack of the four allied demonic gods, it would take at most a moment to completely tear open the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>After all, just one of the Black Demon Sect Master's power sculptures was able to rip a huge crevice in the Azure World's barrier.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was personally attacking, joined by three other 'friends', tearing apart the Azure World would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely."</p><p></p><p>The three demonic gods from outside the realm also swiftly took action.</p><p></p><p>A lion pouncing on a rabbit uses full force. These demonic gods who emerged from endless slaughter naturally understood this principle.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the expressions of the Black Demon Sect Master and the other three demonic gods changed.</p><p></p><p>In the vast void, they were no longer in the boundless void, but had entered another realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this??"</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Sect Master's expression changed drastically. In this realm, he could no longer sense the aura of the boundless void at all, as if it had been cut off.</p><p></p><p>The other three demonic gods from outside the realm were in the same situation.</p><p></p><p>But before the Black Demon Sect Master and the three demonic gods could react, the overwhelming force of the world bore down on them. Their physical and spiritual bodies shook, leaving them with no strength to resist as their consciousness fell into darkness. They were then enveloped along with the surrounding realm and shrunken into the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"All the weapons, treasures and rare items combined sold for a total of 42,000 chaos stones," Lin Yuan thought as he returned to the inn, feeling slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>With 42,000 chaos stones, buying that golden box shouldn't be a problem. </p><p></p><p>The starting price for the golden box was 30,000 chaos stones. Without knowing its origins, even a Chaos Lord wouldn't spend 30,000 chaos stones to buy it.</p><p></p><p>Although Chaos Lords could condense chaos stones from the endless chaos void, it still required effort. 30,000 chaos stones wasn't much for a Chaos Lord, but to buy a golden box of unknown origin that might be worthless? Chaos Lords may be wealthy, but they're not foolish.</p><p></p><p>If that golden box didn't have fluctuations of Chaos Realm aura inside, it probably wouldn't have even made it onto the Thousand Treasures list.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe after buying that golden box, there will be some chaos stones left over to purchase other treasures," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Besides the golden box, there were many other items on the Thousand Treasures list that Lin Yuan found quite tempting. </p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just tempted - everything centered on the golden box.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Ming Chuan Chen's Thousand Treasures Auction began smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"So many 12th level powerhouses," Lin Yuan remarked as he arrived at the Thousand Treasures Tower, the venue for the auction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had deliberately arrived early, but still found a large number of 12th level powerhouses. The vast majority were at the Path-Breaking Realm, with very few at the Sovereign Realm, and not a single one at the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Well, Chaos Lords are on a whole other level," he thought.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Lords occasionally passed through the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, but only occasionally. Most of the time there were none.</p><p></p><p>When a Chaos Lord did pass by, Ancient Ming Lord would have to make an appearance to receive them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan casually entered the Thousand Treasures Tower, faintly emanating an aura of the peak of Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Path-Breaking Realm, he was already considered a powerhouse among the many 12th level beings present, second only to the few at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Stay away, that one seems to be at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Many at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm are just one step away from breaking through to the Sovereign Realm. We can't offend him."</p><p></p><p>"Best not to get too close."</p><p></p><p>Various 12th level beings spoke in low voices. In the chaos void, strength was supreme. Except for places with order and constraints like the Chaos Continent, it was survival of the fittest everywhere else.</p><p></p><p>So any 12th level being who had survived was very cautious. Let alone provoking the strong, they wouldn't even get close, eliminating any possibility of offending or clashing with them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually found a hall to sit in. The interior of the Thousand Treasures Tower was extremely spacious, enough for each participant to have an independent hall.</p><p></p><p>"With my strength at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm, I should have no problem securing an item worth 30,000 chaos stones," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>On the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, anyone could purchase treasures. This place was under the protection of Ancient Ming Lord, so no one dared to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>But outside the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent was a different story.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan displayed an aura of peak Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>If someone at the early stage of Path-Breaking Realm bought that golden box and caught the attention of those with ulterior motives, they might get some ideas.</p><p></p><p>But for someone at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm? They'd have to consider if it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>To rob and kill someone at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm would require at least a Sovereign Realm powerhouse, and that cost was not small.</p><p></p><p>Just for a golden box of unknown value? Sovereign Realm powerhouses had much better targets to rob.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Soon the Thousand Treasures Auction was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in the hall, observing the various auras nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Over 40 Sovereign Realm powerhouses," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Among these 40 Sovereign Realm powerhouses, three had auras faintly reaching the peak of Sovereign Realm, close to Senior "Cang Wei Yang".</p><p></p><p>"Everyone," a silver-haired woman appeared in the center of the Thousand Treasures Tower. Faint dragon scales flickered on her face, clearly indicating her extraordinary bloodline. Many powerhouses in the chaos void had the blood of various chaos beasts flowing through them.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Realm," Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn. That silver-haired woman's aura was hidden, but she was clearly a Sovereign Realm powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"I will be presiding over this Thousand Treasures Auction," the silver-haired woman said briefly, directly taking out a bracelet-like treasure.</p><p></p><p>"A defensive treasure for those at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm. When worn on the body, it will automatically activate when danger is encountered, able to block attacks from those at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm for ten breaths," the silver-haired woman explained quickly, while beginning to display the appearance and aura of the bracelet treasure.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The silver-haired woman continued: "The starting price is 100 chaos stones, with each bid increase no less than 10 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>The normal price for Path-Breaking Realm treasures ranged from tens to hundreds of chaos stones. For this bracelet treasure to have a starting price of 100 chaos stones was firstly because it was indeed top-quality, and secondly because it had the guarantee of the Thousand Treasures Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Treasures Tower was an official organization of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent. All treasures sold had relevant endorsements and there was no possibility of fraud or deception.</p><p></p><p>So the treasures at the Thousand Treasures Auction were priced slightly higher than usual, but as long as they were genuine and the quality was guaranteed, many powerhouses were still willing to buy.</p><p></p><p>"120 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>"150 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>"180 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>Before long, the price of that bracelet treasure had reached 200 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>200 chaos stones had already reached the range of normal top-quality Path-Breaking Realm treasures. The bracelet treasure was indeed good, but it couldn't compare to top-quality Path-Breaking Realm treasures, so</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this point, there were far fewer powerful beings bidding.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>This bracelet treasure was sold for 210 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>One treasure after another was brought out, sparking rounds of competition among the many 12th-level beings present.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not made any moves yet. Before the golden box appeared, he had to save all his chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Treasures Auction proceeded quickly. The bidding for Sovereign-level treasures soon came to an end.</p><p></p><p>Next came the Chaos-level treasures. </p><p></p><p>Instantly, the dozens of Sovereign-level powerhouses in the venue became energized.</p><p></p><p>This was what they had come for.</p><p></p><p>"A golden box, containing fluctuations of Chaos-level energy inside, suspected to be a Chaos-level treasure. Starting price is 30,000 chaos stones," the silver-haired woman announced, her voice carrying throughout the venue as she held up a tarnished golden box.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, silence fell over the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Those ordinary Path-breaking realm experts, though curious about the golden box, simply couldn't produce so many chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sovereign-level experts, their targets were the Chaos-level treasures coming later, so they had no interest in this golden box either.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no reaction from the crowd of experts, the silver-haired woman continued her introduction: "This golden box is made of an extremely mysterious material that ordinary Chaos-level attacks cannot destroy."</p><p></p><p>She went on describing it for a while.</p><p></p><p>The silver-haired woman sighed inwardly, "Still no takers?"</p><p></p><p>This golden box had already appeared at more than one Thousand Treasures Auction, with the starting price dropping from 100,000 chaos stones initially to the current 30,000.</p><p></p><p>Just as the silver-haired woman was about to put away the golden box and move on to introducing the next treasure,</p><p></p><p>A hesitant voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"30,000 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>The silver-haired woman looked over. The source of the voice came from a palace near the front. Her face immediately broke into a smile, "30,000 chaos stones. Is anyone else interested?"</p><p></p><p>"A peak Path-breaking realm expert bought this box of unknown origin?"</p><p></p><p>"30,000 chaos stones... As expected of a peak Path-breaking expert."</p><p></p><p>"He's probably just curious about the box, otherwise he wouldn't have waited until the last moment to bid."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Thousand Treasures Tower, the 12th-level experts discussed in low voices. It wasn't strange for a peak Path-breaking expert to produce 30,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, this golden box belongs to you, sir," the silver-haired woman promptly put away the golden box and began introducing the next treasure.</p><p></p><p>Treasures purchased at the Thousand Treasures Auction would all be delivered to their respective owners after the auction ended.</p><p></p><p>"Got it," Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had been worried that some peak Path-breaking expert or even a Sovereign-level powerhouse would compete with him.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed everything went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>30,000 chaos stones was no small sum. A Chaos Venerable could easily produce it, but even Sovereign-level powerhouses would feel the pinch.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Treasures Auction continued.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also made a few more purchases of treasures worth several hundred or thousand chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the auction came to a successful conclusion.</p><p></p><p>As the auction ended, the silver-haired woman standing on the high platform did not leave, but quietly looked at the crowd of experts.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, my master has instructed me to make something public," the silver-haired woman spoke. Her master was Venerable Guming, the ruler of the Guming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Make something public?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Something Venerable Guming is making public?"</p><p></p><p>The experts' expressions changed slightly, with some feeling uneasy, thinking of the recent tense situation on the Guming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Next, my master will activate the Chaos Continent to relocate, leaving this region," said the silver-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>"Relocate?"</p><p></p><p>"Why relocate?"</p><p></p><p>The experts were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>How massive was the Guming Chaos Continent? To move such a huge Chaos Continent would consume an unimaginable amount of chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, this region will become the battlefield between Great Saint Nine Phoenix and Great Saint Shadow Demon. The aftershocks of the battle between two Chaos Great Saints will cover the surrounding area, and everything will be destroyed when the time comes," the silver-haired woman said.</p><p></p><p>"Battlefield of two Chaos Great Saints?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Great Saints?</p><p></p><p>Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how large an area will be affected by the aftershocks of the battle between the two Chaos Great Saints?" a Sovereign-level expert inquired. His cave dwelling was nearby, so if what the silver-haired woman said was true, he would need to leave to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Roughly this area," the silver-haired woman raised her hand. A map of the Chaos Void appeared, with parts of it marked in red.</p><p></p><p>"This is trouble," Lin Yuan stared at the red area on the Chaos Void map. If the map's orientation was correct, his home universe was clearly within the range of the two Chaos Great Saints' battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, within this range, including universes born from the Chaos Void, all will be destroyed, entering the Great Destruction prematurely. If you want to survive, you can apply to reside permanently in Mingchuan City," the silver-haired woman continued.</p><p></p><p>The reason she mentioned universes was to remind the experts present not to harbor any false hope. If even universes couldn't withstand the aftershocks of two Great Saints fighting, nothing else could.</p><p></p><p>"Even universes will be destroyed, entering the Great Destruction prematurely?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became solemn as he realized the gravity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

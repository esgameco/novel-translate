        <h1>Chapter 663</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, the surroundings became completely clear, with only various weapons, treasures, and precious items floating about.</p><p></p><p>"Before entering the Chaos Realm, my strength was on par with the mightiest Sovereign Immortals like Fuxu Immortal Sovereign, at most slightly stronger. But after entering the Chaos Realm, the essence of my life has been transformed. So-called Sovereign Immortals? They are no match for me at all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that if it weren't for the independent time-space of the treasure land, prolonged use of the 'World' divine ability would have conflicted with the treasure land's time-space, affecting the future cultivation of precious items.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't even need to refine one core celestial pillar after another, he could simply envelop the entire treasure land with his external universe.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Fuxu Immortal Sovereign and many other peak Sovereign Immortals had scattered and fled that Lin Yuan was able to briefly use his external universe to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>The use of the 'World' divine ability didn't last long, and with Lin Yuan's careful control, it didn't have any impact on the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and he retracted his external universe, as well as the spoils left behind by the peak Sovereign Immortals.</p><p></p><p>For this display of strength that exceeded the understanding of the Six Ancient Kingdoms, Lin Yuan had already prepared an explanation, attributing it all to the Ancestor's bloodline at the Sovereign Immortal level.</p><p></p><p>As the first existence in this source world to have excavated the Ancestor's bloodline to the Sovereign Immortal level, aside from Lin Yuan, no other Sovereign Immortal knew the effects of the Ancestor's bloodline reaching that level.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't everything still under Lin Yuan's control? As for when the second Sovereign Immortal-level Ancestor's bloodline would be born, that would be tens of thousands of years later, by which time Lin Yuan would have already entered the Thirteen Realms and be deeply entrenched in the time loop, unaffected by the outside world.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without the Sovereign Immortal-level Ancestor's bloodline as an excuse, no one would dare to question Lin Yuan. The Six Ancient Kingdoms revered strength, and with the combat power Lin Yuan had displayed, the Ancestor not intervening meant he was invincible. Those mightiest Sovereign Immortals didn't dare to appear before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ancestor? The Ancestor was lofty and aloof, and while Lin Yuan's strength surpassed the mightiest Sovereign Immortals, to the Thirteen Realms Ancestor, he was merely a slightly larger ant, not worthy of much attention.</p><p></p><p>Currently, aside from the Multiverse Gate, all of Lin Yuan's trump cards wouldn't be taken seriously by the Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteen Realms inheritance? It originally came from the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen Realms weapons and treasures? The Ancestors had them as well.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly inspected the spoils left behind by the peak Sovereign Immortals, then took a step and appeared before Crimson Flame Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, Silver River Sovereign." Crimson Flame Sovereign was inwardly shaken, barely suppressing it, his expression reverent and his posture very low as he looked at Lin Yuan: "I never imagined that your strength, Silver River Sovereign, would be so powerful, single-handedly sweeping away Fuxu Immortal Sovereign and many other top peak Sovereign Immortals. When the Emperor mentioned you earlier, I had some doubts, but now I realize how foolish that was."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign felt somewhat ashamed when he thought about his previous 'disdain' for Silver River Sovereign, and a sense of trepidation also arose.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign didn't have any personal motives; his doubts about Lin Yuan's strength were for the sake of the Vermilion Sun Ancient Kingdom, after all, in the competition for a precious treasure land, the participating Sovereign Immortals' strength had to be up to par.</p><p></p><p>If a certain participating Sovereign Immortal had dragged them down, causing the failure to seize the treasure land, that would have been detrimental to the entire ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan sparred with Scarlet Lotus Sovereign and proved his strength, Crimson Flame Sovereign didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Crimson Flame Sovereign looked up and saw more than ten figures suddenly appear in the distance, which were the twelve peak Sovereign Immortals of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the battle here, or more accurately, feeling the one-sided crushing of Silver River Sovereign, the peak Sovereign Immortals of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom, although finding it hard to believe, could only muster the courage to come over.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't come, were they supposed to wait for Silver River Sovereign to come to them?</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>Savage Kun Sovereign was inwardly shaken. Through sensing the aura, he clearly understood that Fuxu Immortal Sovereign and many other top peak Sovereign Immortals had been swept away by Silver River Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>It was an absolute sweeping; even Fuxu Immortal Sovereign, whose strength Savage Kun Sovereign disliked, was utterly crushed by Silver River Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Savage Kun."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also looked towards Savage Kun Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The core celestial pillars occupied by the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom were mostly concentrated in the upper half of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan started pushing from the corner, he didn't encounter the core celestial pillars occupied and refined by the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Sovereign, our Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom is willing to hand over all the core celestial pillars," Savage Kun Sovereign immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fate of the other ancient kingdoms' peak Sovereign Immortals, whose main combat bodies had fallen one after another, in this situation, the wisest choice was to honestly hand over the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>At least they could preserve their main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>As well as the harvests they had accumulated in the treasure land over the past one or two thousand years, the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom's peak Sovereign Immortals had collected quite a few of the golden mists.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can leave now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and didn't make things difficult for Savage Kun Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>He had shown no mercy towards the peak Sovereign Immortals of the Yin Ancient Kingdom, the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom, and others, because they were enemies of the Vermilion Sun Ancient Kingdom, and had even demanded dozens of core celestial pillars as an astronomical price.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Silver River Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Savage Kun Sovereign felt a little relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At least this time in the treasure land competition, the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom's peak Sovereign Immortals had gained some harvests, not ending up with a net loss.</p><p></p><p>Compared to powerhouses like Fuxu Immortal Sovereign, Ancestral Yin Sovereign, and Nether Hell Sovereign, the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom was already considered fortunate.</p><p></p><p>The other eleven peak Sovereign Immortals of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom looked at each other, not knowing why a sense of relief was welling up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when new treasure lands were born and fought over, the many peak Sovereign Immortals of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom who participated often ended up in failure, their hearts filled with resentment and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>But now, including Savage Kun Sovereign, the twelve peak Sovereign Immortals actually felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Savage Kun Sovereign came quickly and communicated well with Silver River Sovereign, so they were able to be spared.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would have met the same fate as the peak Sovereign Immortals of the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom and the others.</p><p></p><p>In the competition for treasure lands, death and annihilation were the most normal occurrences. Even if Silver River Sovereign hadn't spared them, there would have been nothing wrong with that.</p><p></p><p>With Silver River Sovereign's permission, the twelve peak Sovereign Immortals of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom quickly left the treasure land entrance.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the ten peak Sovereign Immortals of the Vermilion Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan, and for a moment, they didn't dare to approach.</p><p></p><p>The victory had come too easily and too unbelievably. Just a moment ago, they had felt desperate, believing that the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom's alliance with the Yin Ancient Kingdom, the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom, and the Thunder Roar Ancient Kingdom meant that even with the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom on their side, the Vermilion Sun Ancient Kingdom's hope of seizing the treasure land was slim.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Supremes of the Four Great Ancient Kingdoms, with the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom as the leader, were all overwhelmed by the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way. The absolute crushing power that this had caused in the hearts of the ten Supremes of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way actually sparred with me for so long back then," </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereign of the Scarlet Lotus sighed inwardly. Before entering the Treasure Land, he had sparred with the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way, ending in a draw.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way had just been toying with him.</p><p></p><p>"The Peerless Celestial Sovereign like the Fallen Void is utterly powerless against the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way. What is the current strength of the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way? Is he still the Strongest Celestial Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereign of Vast Scorching and the Celestial Sovereign of Eternal Sun, these two top-tier Peerless Celestial Sovereigns, were thinking even further. Since the birth of the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom, the Strongest Celestial Sovereign has been the mightiest combat force under the Ancestor, which is also the ultimate realm that the Celestial Sovereigns can reach.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way has clearly broken this iron rule. Calling the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way the Strongest Celestial Sovereign is clearly no longer appropriate.</p><p></p><p>If the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way is the Strongest Celestial Sovereign, then what are the other Strongest Celestial Sovereigns? They are all inferior to the Great Fallen Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient existences were startled, and many who had disappeared for a long time, and whom the outside world thought had broken through to the Ancestor realm, the Strongest Celestial Sovereigns, opened their eyes and descended a trace of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign stood among them, and scenes flashed by in the distance, which were the scenes of the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way starting to overwhelm from that corner core pillar in the Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>Until the end, he transformed into the Scorching Sun and slaughtered the Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign and other Peerless Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen Void, you lost?"</p><p></p><p>"With your strength? You actually lost?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns one by one spoke up. The Strongest Celestial Sovereign is just at the pinnacle of Celestial Sovereign strength, it doesn't mean they can't lose. But the Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign lost too easily? Losing without a doubt to the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way? Even using the ancient kingdom's profound killing art, he still lost?</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign was calm in his heart, or even icy. If he had lost to other Strongest Celestial Sovereigns, he would definitely be constantly reflecting and replanning, thinking about how he could do better if he had another chance.</p><p></p><p>But losing to the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way?</p><p></p><p>In the brief clash, the Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign only felt overwhelming despair.</p><p></p><p>His fight with the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way was like an ant trying to shake the heavens, there was no need to reflect at all, even if he tried a million times or ten million times, the Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign would still lose.</p><p></p><p>The Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns of the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom also began to watch the flashing image scenes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most of the ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns descended at the moment of watching the image scenes, and the ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns who raised questions were just asking casually.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns who had watched all the image scenes were silent.</p><p></p><p>These ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns had different auras and cultivated different paths of Chaotic Force, and their inherited secret techniques of the Thirteen Realms were also different.</p><p></p><p>But after watching the various image scenes, all the ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns were almost unanimously silent.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were not on the battlefield, only separated by the image scenes, these ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns also felt an incomparable oppressive force from the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>"This Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way, his physical body and foundation are profoundly unfathomable, and the path of Chaotic Force he has cultivated is also extremely terrifying. Is this the Ancestor bloodline at the Celestial Sovereign realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Ancestor bloodline at the Celestial Sovereign realm, although it has never appeared, must not be this strong."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Ancestor bloodline at the Celestial Sovereign realm, even if it's the strongest, can only be considered a Thirteen Realms inherited secret technique, equivalent to the Strongest Celestial Sovereign realm at most. The strength of the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way is definitely not just the Ancestor bloodline."</p><p></p><p>After a period of silence, the ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns began to discuss.</p><p></p><p>With the vision and realm of the Strongest Celestial Sovereigns, they had basically seen through the essence of the bloodline. The Ancestor bloodline is indeed powerful, but it is only simply powerful, while the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way's understanding of the laws of heaven and earth, and the path of Chaotic Force he has cultivated, is far beyond just the Ancestor bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Now discussing this is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the Strongest Celestial Sovereigns of the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom spoke: "The strength of the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way has completely surpassed us. Even if we old fellows have no shame and join forces to deal with the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way, in the end, we will probably still be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>These words came out.</p><p></p><p>The many ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns looked at each other, and although this conclusion was very uncomfortable for them, it was the truth. The strength of the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way has almost exceeded the 'limit' of the Celestial Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>"How did this Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way cultivate? We all think that we have cultivated everything to the extreme, and there is no further progress, but how can the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way be so much stronger than us?"</p><p></p><p>An ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereign sighed. Why do they call the level of strength like the Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign the 'Strongest' Celestial Sovereign? It is because they have already reached the limit in various aspects, such as physical body, understanding of the laws, the path of Chaotic Force cultivation, and spiritual will, etc.</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way? If they were not sure that he was still under the Ancestor realm, they might have thought that Lin Yuan had already crossed into the Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>"In the long years to come, before the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way breaks through to the Ancestor realm, the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom should minimize conflicts with the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, prohibit any high-intensity wars from happening, and if really necessary, just ask the Ancestor to intervene. In any case, we absolutely cannot give the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way a chance to act."</p><p></p><p>The ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns looked at each other, and with the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom having the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way as its pillar, if they were to clash with the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom, wouldn't that be courting their own destruction? "Just endure it, with the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way's accumulated foundation, I believe he will soon break through to the Ancestor realm, and then we will be much more at ease."</p><p></p><p>The many ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereigns sighed. With the strength of the Great Fallen Ancient Kingdom, they had never been so embarrassed before, but there was no choice, their strength was inferior to the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>Even if they carried the ancient kingdom's profound killing art, they would not be a match for that Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that what realm does the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way belong to now? Is he still the Strongest Celestial Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>An ancient Strongest Celestial Sovereign couldn't help but ask. If the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way is still the Strongest Celestial Sovereign, then they, the Strongest Celestial Sovereigns, would have to retreat a step.</p><p></p><p>Who dares to continue to be called the 'Strongest Celestial Sovereign' alongside the Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way?</p><p></p><p>The silent Fallen Void Celestial Sovereign suddenly spoke, his expression faintly complex: "Unrivaled Celestial Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>Unrivaled Celestial Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>These four words came out.</p><p></p><p>All the Strongest Celestial Sovereigns present immediately felt that this was extremely 'appropriate'.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way is not unrivaled, who is unrivaled? The many Strongest Celestial Sovereigns looked at each other, inwardly acknowledging this title.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Sovereign of the Milky Way is the first Unrivaled Celestial Sovereign since the opening of the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms, and probably also the last.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 347: Does the Tower Master Want Me to Temper the Galaxy Master? (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Master Star. üê∏‚òÜ‚ûÖ‚ûà≈üƒ§ÔΩï‚ìß.ùí∏·ªñùì∂‚ô¢üç¨</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years." Lin Yuan opened his eyes and gazed towards the vast, boundless starry universe. </p><p></p><p>Among the myriad races of the main universe, the stronger one was, the less sensitive they were to the passage of time. Closing off for meditation for hundreds or thousands of years was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>Just twenty years was hardly even a nap.</p><p></p><p>But these twenty years brought about exceptionally great changes for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>First, in the cultivation of the 'Xuanhuang Strike' and the 'Xuanhuang Body', he had reached the third stage.</p><p></p><p>By operating the 'Xuanhuang Strike', Lin Yuan could constantly maintain a strength four times beyond his own limit. The force he could unleash with every move and action was estimated to be formidable even for an ordinary tenth-level Ding cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan had yet to cross hands with any tenth-level cultivator. He could only roughly gauge his position from the recorded battle videos of tenth-level fights in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, for a ninth-level cultivator to battle tenth-level experts, and not even those at the initial "Ji" level of the tenth stage, was already unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>The leap from the ninth to the tenth level was a major boundary transcendence, not something that could be compensated for by just opening a few billion more layers of inner spatial dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the number of spatial layers Lin Yuan had opened was not just a few billion, but over twenty billion.</p><p></p><p>"Inner World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>After twenty years of continuously absorbing the purple liquid from the mysterious gourd, Lin Yuan's inner world had now officially broken through two billion square miles in size.</p><p></p><p>"It seems like in order to completely absorb the purple liquid and reach the tenth level, it will still take some time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of absorbing the purple liquid was even greater than he had anticipated. At the current rate of absorption, Lin Yuan was still about fifty years away from completing his metamorphosis and crossing into the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years. Based on his current efficiency of absorbing the purple liquid, it was basically impossible to fully absorb it in that timeframe.</p><p></p><p>"I also don't know what changes the mysterious gourd will undergo after I finish absorbing the purple liquid," Lin Yuan's mind flickered, and the greyish-purple gourd appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>By verifying through the gourd, Lin Yuan had obtained some information, including that the gourd contained seven types of liquids.</p><p></p><p>But what changes the gourd would undergo after absorbing all seven liquids was unclear.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly but surely."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped focusing on his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Stride of Space-Time'," Lin Yuan thought of the escape technique among the three great protective secret laws of the Xuanhuang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the rapid progress in the previous two techniques, Lin Yuan's advancement in this secret law was much slower.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how slow, Lin Yuan had cultivated it to the point of being able to take a "step" spanning tens of millions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "step" spanning tens of millions of light-years had an extreme limitation - he could only take nine such steps in total.</p><p></p><p>After the ninth step, Lin Yuan would traverse nine hundred million light-years, at which point the various energies within his body would be depleted. The cost would be far greater than using his physical body's innate ability of "Reinforcement".</p><p></p><p>The depletion of power meant Lin Yuan would lose even the ability to resist, so this escape technique would generally not be used to its full extent of nine steps, as the cost would be too great.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Stride of Space-Time' is the fusion and application of the laws of time and space. For me, perhaps only after comprehending the law of time will it become easier to gain insights into it?"</p><p></p><p>One of the prerequisites for eleventh-level experts to attempt the ultimate realm was the fusion of the laws of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Normally, eleventh-level experts would have no clue how to fuse time and space, but in this secret law, Lin Yuan saw glimpses of the essence of fusing space-time.</p><p></p><p>"For the Xuanhuang Emperor to be able to reveal the essence of fusing space-time in the form of a secret law, it's too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled calmly.</p><p></p><p>Rather than calling the 'Stride of Space-Time' an escape technique, it would be more accurate to describe it as a "shortcut" to fusing space and time.</p><p></p><p>It's known that even the strongest experts, despite having fused space-time, could not necessarily explain it. The space-time they fused was their own - unless one had an inconceivable understanding of the essence of space-time, it was impossible to expound it to others.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Xuanhuang Emperor had achieved this.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful being would also disappear? Would also die?" Lin Yuan found it hard to comprehend. Supreme experts who transcended the river of time only needed to be a bit careful to avoid death.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention an ultimate realm expert like the Xuanhuang Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"In these twenty years, I have gained insights into two thousand one hundred and seventy-three models of time," Lin Yuan raised his hands, with strands of temporal force swirling around his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>So far, the time law models summarized by the pioneering scholars of human civilization totaled only two thousand one hundred and seventy-three.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan had basically completed the knowledge and descriptions of the time laws put forth by those pioneering scholars of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The reason it's said "basically" is because Lin Yuan had yet to comprehend the final time law model.</p><p></p><p>"This time law model involves the reversal of time, the stopping of time, the acceleration of time...encompassing all states of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully contemplated, with flashes of inspiration surging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"If I could comprehend the law of time at the ninth level, allowing my inner world to become independent from the main universe, then during the final metamorphosis when crossing into the tenth level..."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan pondered, he also considered the implications.</p><p></p><p>The eighth-level evolved cultivators of human civilization opened inner worlds, but these inner worlds were not complete, independent worlds. Many of their rules, especially the law of time, were shared with the main universe.</p><p></p><p>To break free from this sharing required one to personally comprehend the law of time and then integrate it into the inner world.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the earlier one comprehended the law of time and integrated it into the inner world, the greater the benefits would be when undergoing a major boundary transcendence.</p><p></p><p>A major boundary transcendence would lead to the metamorphosis of the inner world, and a complete, independent inner world would undergo a far greater degree of metamorphosis compared to one dependent on the main universe.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan comprehended the law of time at the ninth level and made his inner world "independent", then in the future when he broke through to the tenth and eleventh levels, he would have two opportunities for metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>In this aspect, he would far surpass those who only comprehended the law of time at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>An eleventh-level expert who comprehends the law of time and integrates it into their inner world, achieving "independence", would still lack the foundation of the previous metamorphoses, making their inner world's foundation much weaker.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try my best to attempt it." Lin Yuan thought. In the records of human civilization, there were examples of tenth-level cultivators comprehending the law of time, and then upon advancing to the eleventh level, their inner world's foundation was greatly elevated.</p><p></p><p>But a ninth-level cultivator comprehending the law of time? At least Lin Yuan had never heard of such a case.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-level cultivators could barely perceive the slightest fluctuations of time. For them to comprehend the law of time was extremely difficult, even for powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little more, and I'll be able to comprehend this time model," Lin Yuan continued his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped contemplating.</p><p></p><p>"Time to visit the Demon Jade Space and try to break through the fifth floor again," Lin Yuan descended into the Demon Jade Space via the Demon Jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>The fifth floor of the Black Tower tested one's comprehension of the law of time. According to the stone humanoid Shen Ji, only by fully comprehending the complete law of time could one pass through.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still some distance away from fully comprehending the law of time, but by attempting the fifth floor and experiencing its various time environments, perhaps he could gain the final insight needed to comprehend that last time model.</p><p></p><p>Although the supreme expert Xia Qin had told Lin Yuan that he could ask about any issues in his cultivation, Lin Yuan was still reluctant to trouble a supreme expert unless he truly encountered an impasse or bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>The final time model obstructing him, Lin Yuan did not consider it an impasse or bottleneck that would hinder him for too long.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>In front of the nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The stone humanoid Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan and probed, "You want to challenge the fifth floor?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Go on in," Shen Ji pondered for a moment before opening the door to let Lin Yuan enter.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>The fifth floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Shua la la...</p><p></p><p>Temporal fluctuations rippled, and various extreme time flow velocities surged forth.</p><p></p><p>If this was thirty years ago, Lin Yuan would not have been able to endure for long. The last time he attempted to rush through the third and fourth floors, when he tried the fifth floor, he had retreated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Not only could he try to advance, he could even persist indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, my insights into the law of time have made another huge leap forward. I'm not too far from fully comprehending it."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Tower, the stone humanoid Shen Ji carefully observed, without a shred of shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In just twenty or thirty years, Lin Yuan had reached such heights in the realm of the law of time. Even for an eleventh-level life form, this would be considered inconceivable, let alone a ninth-level life form like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But having interacted with Lin Yuan...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>For a long time, the stone statue Shen Ji had almost gotten used to Lin Yuan constantly breaking through various miracles.</p><p></p><p>As the stone statue Shen Ji was watching scene after scene on the fifth floor, suddenly, the stone statue seemed to sense something. His expression revealed a hint of surprise, while also looking towards another direction in the magic jade space. </p><p></p><p>In the hazy mist, a strand of spiritual will descended. "I", this strand of spiritual will, took the form of a burly man over three meters tall, looking around excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the magic jade space?" The burly man carefully examined the surrounding mist. </p><p></p><p>He came from an evolved great family in the northern star region of human civilization, an unprecedented genius surpassing dozens of star domains. </p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred years ago, human civilization publicly revealed that fragment of a body to some talents. Since then, the burly man had comprehended an evolutionary path from within that body fragment.</p><p></p><p>After countless efforts and with an extremely lucky factor, the burly man finally managed to complete that evolutionary path, condensing a magic jade imprint in the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess of Wisdom told me that completing the comprehended evolutionary path would lead to entering a mysterious space, where there would be a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>The burly man's heart pounded with excitement as he walked towards the depths, following the surrounding mist.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the burly man arrived before an imposing nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>"Another one?" The stone statue Shen Ji glanced at the burly man, instantly knowing how he had become an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Building through comprehending an ordinary demonic evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"The most common way of completing a certain demonic evolutionary path?" The stone statue Shen Ji inwardly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was no longer an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Building, but a core member.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." The burly man carefully asked upon seeing the stone statue Shen Ji.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, this is some information about this place." The stone statue Shen Ji raised his right hand, imparting all the information into the burly man's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..." The burly man frowned tightly, only gradually relaxing after a while.</p><p></p><p>"The nine-story black building, the first, second, third floor..." The burly man looked at the imposing black building before him, his expression revealing a hint of shock.</p><p></p><p>"You wait a moment, someone is going to challenge it again up ahead," the stone statue Shen Ji casually said while glancing at the burly man.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is challenging again up ahead?" The burly man felt a bit disappointed, so he wasn't the first to enter the magic jade space?</p><p></p><p>"Is it the first or second floor they're challenging?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man received the information Shen Ji passed on and knew the difficulty of passing each floor.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The fifth floor?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man looked up and saw the fifth floor of the black building glowing with a hazy light, immediately realizing the person ahead was challenging that floor.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth floor?" The burly man's eyes widened. From the information the stone statue Shen Ji gave him, he clearly knew that to pass the fifth floor, one must comprehend the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>Comprehend the rules of time? In the burly man's eyes, this was a realm that only ancient eleventh-rank experts could hope to stand in.</p><p></p><p>"Which eleventh-rank expert is challenging again?" The burly man was shaken in his heart. If it wasn't just a strand of spiritual will descending here, he would have fled far away without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>An eleventh-rank expert...if this was reality, a single thought from them could probably obliterate him billions of times over. Approaching such an expert would make anyone's hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>On the fifth floor of the black building, Lin Yuan stood near the center, sensing the surging infinite forces of time.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heavenly, you have grasped countless fluctuations of time, comprehending the 2,173rd type of time model.]</p><p></p><p>In a daze, a virtual model of the time rules coalesced before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>This time rule model had a perfect essence, as if converging the myriad variations of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the final type of time rule model?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes. After comprehending that crucial point, his understanding of the time rules had reached a certain height. To proceed further, he would need to forge his own path.</p><p></p><p>Every expert who comprehended the time rules had a different understanding of them.</p><p></p><p>The rules of space were vast and boundless, existing in many "facets". So-called comprehension of the space rules was merely comprehending one facet of the boundless space rules.</p><p></p><p>"Time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the remaining path ahead. He had not yet comprehended the time rules, so there was no hope of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared outside the black building.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"There's someone else here?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately noticed the burly man's presence.</p><p></p><p>The strand of spiritual will that descended into the magic jade space had a randomly set appearance and form, as he intended to conceal his true identity.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior." The burly man's hair stood on end as he respectfully greeted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, this young man before him was an ancient eleventh-rank expert, and he didn't even have the qualification to look at him directly.</p><p></p><p>"Hm." Lin Yuan slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could tell the burly man was human.</p><p></p><p>That was enough. If the burly man was from another race, or even a hostile human faction, Lin Yuan estimated he would use his authority as a core member to temporarily expel him.</p><p></p><p>But a human? As a kinsman, Lin Yuan didn't mind him challenging the nine-story black building.</p><p></p><p>The rewards obtained from the nine-story black building were completely dependent on the talents displayed. The rewards most cultivators received were not particularly precious.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." The burly man lowered his head, not daring to release even a shred of perception, fearing it would provoke that eleventh-rank expert who had just cleared the fifth floor.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the burly man finally mustered his courage to look up, only to find the person was long gone, with only the stone statue Shen Ji watching him.</p><p></p><p>"The senior left?" The burly man's heart finally relaxed. "The senior is also human?"</p><p></p><p>Through that fleeting glimpse, the burly man realized Lin Yuan was human as well.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which eleventh-rank cultivator from the human alliance he is?" The shock in the burly man's heart had not dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had the honor of seeing an eleventh-rank cultivator?</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy...</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xia Qinzhi told me to find him after comprehending all the time rule models." Lin Yuan remembered Xia Qinzhi's instructions and immediately connected to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>In the majestic Evolutionary Pinnacle Tower world, Xia Qinzhi's expression slightly changed as he sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow wants to see me, could it be..." Xia Qinzhi's thoughts were complicated. It had only been a short while, yet he had already comprehended all the time rule models?</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Senior." Lin Yuan slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"You've comprehended all the time models?" Although he had some expectations, Xia Qinzhi still asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded. "So I've come to find you, Senior."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Xia Qinzhi nodded, appearing calm on the surface, but his heart was quite unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending all the time models is still some distance away from truly comprehending the time rules. I need to figure out exactly where you are in that distance."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi focused and said, "This way, I'll have Nalan spar with you solely based on the comprehension of time rules."</p><p></p><p>To know where Lin Yuan stood, the simplest way was for them to fight. But as the Paramount Senior, Xia Qinzhi naturally wouldn't fight Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>So he planned to have the Vice Pinnacle Master Nalan come and test Lin Yuan's depth.</p><p></p><p>As a tenth-rank alpha about to comprehend all the time rule models, Nalan was perfectly suited to probe Lin Yuan's bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Vice Pinnacle Master Nalan also appeared beside Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Senior." Nalan slightly bowed to Xia Qinzhi, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Nalan, spar with the Galactic Prime and remember, only use the comprehension of time rules," Xia Qinzhi directly said.</p><p></p><p>"Spar?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Galactic Prime?"</p><p></p><p>Nalan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He was the formidable alpha tenth-rank, yet he was told to spar with the ninth-rank Galactic Prime?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this bullying? No matter how monstrous the Galactic Prime was at the ninth-rank, no matter how many billions of spatial layers he could open, he was still at the ninth-rank.</p><p></p><p>And the Paramount Senior's intention was for them to spar solely based on the comprehension of time rules, so the Galactic Prime couldn't even use his forte of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>This was too much bullying of the Galactic Prime.</p><p></p><p>Nalan couldn't bear to do it.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Paramount Senior mean by this?" Nalan inwardly thought, "Could it be that he sees the Galactic Prime's cultivation going too smoothly, so he wants to give him some setbacks and hardships by having me temper the Galactic Prime?"</p>

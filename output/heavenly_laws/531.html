        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even among geniuses who have condensed nine Blazing Sun Seeds, there are still differences in levels.</p><p></p><p>Condensing nine Blazing Sun Seeds at 400 years old is naturally different from doing so at 450 or 480 years old.</p><p></p><p>Those two youngsters from the Dongyang family and Yu family were considered quite good among the nine Blazing Sun Seed geniuses. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been listed as candidate disciples for Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that genius from the Yu family was secretly crippled by the Dongyang family?" The short figure on the right said in a low voice. He had learned of this from the Yuchi family.</p><p></p><p>As a first-class family, even though the Yuchi family had declined, they still had influence.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the schemes and intrigues between these second-class families are quite interesting," the short figure on the left chuckled. "But I suppose it's one way to handle things."</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis only cares about results. If that Yu family kid was really crippled, it just means he doesn't qualify to be the Marquis's disciple," said the tall figure in the middle, his tone indifferent. </p><p></p><p>Among the three figures, his strength was the most formidable, with a subtle air of dominance over everything.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in," said the tall figure in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Then they walked into the Dongyang family compound.</p><p></p><p>"The Dongyang family greets the three Qing Envoys," said the Dongyang family's Dao Realm ancestor with a slight bow. All the family's top members bowed respectfully to the three figures.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the person up," the tall figure in the middle said directly. </p><p></p><p>In the entire Qingfen Domain, there were at least 8,000 families like the Dongyang family, if not 10,000. He didn't have time to waste here.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the Dongyang ancestor immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then Dongyang Meng came forward.</p><p></p><p>"So it's you, little one." The tall figure looked Dongyang Meng over, but took no action.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the short figure on the left raised his hand and took out a scarlet mirror. The mirror's surface was inscribed with a blazing sun that seemed to be burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The short figure activated the scarlet mirror slightly and shone it on Dongyang Meng. In an instant, the mirror's surface began to ripple.</p><p></p><p>Miniature blazing suns appeared one by one.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three...</p><p></p><p>Ten miniature blazing suns quietly appeared on the mirror's surface.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Blazing Sun Seeds?" The short figure looked surprised and glanced at the tall figure.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad." The tall figure was also slightly startled, and rarely gave praise.</p><p></p><p>With ten Blazing Sun Seeds, joining Marquis Qingfen's ranks meant that given time, one's status would be no lower than theirs. It would count as being a major figure with high status and authority in the Qingfen Domain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the hearts that had been in suspense among the Dongyang family elders finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Qing Envoy say this, it was confirmed that Dongyang Meng had condensed ten Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dongyang family has done well, nurturing a ten-sun genius," the tall figure finally looked at the Dongyang family ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Discovering a ten-sun genius was also an achievement for them as Qing Envoys traveling the Qingfen Domain. They would receive additional rewards from Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>"It was Meng'er's own hard work," the Dongyang family ancestor said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Get ready now. I'll take you to see the Marquis later," the tall figure said gently to Dongyang Meng.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Dongyang Meng nodded, feeling a bit elated inside.</p><p></p><p>Even the lofty Qing Envoy was being so kind and friendly to her!</p><p></p><p>"Qing Envoy, our Dongyang family once..." the Dongyang family ancestor said carefully.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family had exposed their attack on Yu Yan through the Yuchi family, which made the Dongyang family ancestor feel somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine," the tall figure waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Dongyang Meng being a ten-sun genius, even if she wasn't, he wouldn't pursue this matter.</p><p></p><p>The strong preying on the weak was normal. The Dongyang family having the ability to cripple that Yu Yan meant it was his fate.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Qing Envoy," the Dongyang family ancestor breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In fact, once he confirmed Dongyang Meng had condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed, he wasn't very worried about this matter. After all, the difference between nine suns and ten suns was quite obvious.</p><p></p><p>But now with the Qing Envoy's guarantee, it was truly foolproof.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Song, go to the Yu family and confirm how many Blazing Sun Seeds Yu Yan condensed," the tall figure glanced at the short figure and said.</p><p></p><p>The three Qing Envoys had come this time for the Dongyang and Yu families.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had discovered an unexpected surprise in the Dongyang family, next was the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, is it still necessary to go confirm at the Yu family?" The short figure Shi Song raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>The Dongyang family ancestor had said as much, so that Yu Yan must have indeed been crippled. Plus, Dongyang Meng was a ten-sun genius.</p><p></p><p>In Shi Song's view, there wasn't even a need to go to the Yu family anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The tall figure frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>At present, it did seem unnecessary to go to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>But this was the usual process. How could they just ignore and violate it?</p><p></p><p>"Qing Envoys, why don't you go to the Yu family? It won't take much time anyway," the Dongyang family ancestor suggested tentatively.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was already sitting pretty. With Dongyang Meng confirmed as a ten-sun genius, the Dongyang family's rise was a foregone conclusion. Even if the Yu family was given a chance, what could they do?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go then," the tall figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the short figure Shi Song didn't refuse further. This was the process, and not going to the Yu family would actually be problematic.</p><p></p><p>In Shi Song's view, he was just making a quick trip that would be over in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shi Song arrived at the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"The Yu family greets the Qing Envoy," the Yu family elders bowed, all</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of the Yu family, including family patriarch Yu Chaolong, bowed respectfully to Qing Envoy Shi Song.</p><p></p><p>To become a Qing Envoy of the Qing Fen Domain, one must have at least peak Self-Path realm cultivation, with some Qing Envoys directly at the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Qing Envoys were disciples of the Qing Fen Marquis, cultivating many secret techniques and forbidden arts passed down after practicing Qing Fen. Their combat power and killing ability far surpassed what ordinary Self-Path realm cultivators outside could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Shi Song said carelessly. His visit now was just going through the motions, to avoid leaving any hidden troubles.</p><p></p><p>"Did only one Qing Envoy come?" the Yu family ancestor asked cautiously. </p><p></p><p>Normally, Qing Envoys would come in groups of two or three. Just one? The Yu family ancestor was puzzled - even among Qing Envoys, there needed to be checks and balances, and it was rare for one to act alone.</p><p></p><p>"My two senior fellow disciples are at the Dongyang family. They asked me to come take a look," Shi Song said casually.</p><p></p><p>The reason the tall figure sent him here was simply to get closer to the Dongyang family and Dongyang Meng.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Dongyang Meng developed normally, she would become a Qing Envoy in the future, and the Dongyang family would surely stand at the peak of first-class families.</p><p></p><p>"The two Qing Envoys are still at the Dongyang family?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu family ancestor's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>With the status of Qing Envoys, why would they stay at the mere Dongyang family?</p><p></p><p>Even if that Dongyang Meng was confirmed to have joined under the Qing Fen Marquis, there was no need for this!</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Nine Blazing Sun geniuses, even if they became disciples of the Qing Fen Marquis, would only be the most common disciples. At most, the Dongyang family could use this to step into the ranks of first-class families.</p><p></p><p>How could it make two Qing Envoys stay? Moreover, from Shi Song's tone, "senior fellow disciples"? Those two Qing Envoys' strength must be above his.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, the two Qing Envoys still remained at the Dongyang family, making the Yu family ancestors vaguely sense something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Dongyang family has produced a Ten Blazing Sun genius. It's quite rare," Shi Song glanced at the Yu family ancestor and said directly, not concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>With his senior fellow disciples at the Dongyang family protecting Dongyang Meng, even if he revealed this matter, it wouldn't have much impact.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Blazing Suns?"</p><p></p><p>"Dongyang Meng condensed the tenth Blazing Sun seed?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of several Yu family ancestors were extremely ugly. Dongyang Meng with ten Blazing Sun seeds would become a big figure in the Qing Fen Domain in the future. Even the Yu family would have to look up to her.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Yu family patriarch Yu Chaolong was equally incredulous. Wasn't that Dongyang Meng a genius similar to Yu Yan? How could she suddenly leap to become a Ten Blazing Sun genius?</p><p></p><p>"This is trouble."</p><p></p><p>The Yu family ancestors felt heavy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If Dongyang Meng was only Nine Blazing Suns, even if she joined under the Qing Fen Marquis, although the Yu family couldn't continue to compete with her, at least they could barely protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yu family was a second-class family, they had good relationships with many first-class families. Even if that Dongyang Meng was a disciple of the Qing Fen Marquis, she probably couldn't do anything to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Ten Blazing Suns? Once the news that Dongyang Meng had condensed ten Blazing Sun seeds spread, let alone what turmoil would occur in the Yu family, those first-class families that originally had good relations with the Yu family would definitely distance themselves first.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's begin directly," Qing Envoy Shi Song spoke. He wanted to finish here quickly and then meet up with his two senior fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, Qing Envoy," Yu Chaolong said with a heavy expression, turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong contacted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cave dwelling's door opened.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Yan, come with me to meet the Qing Envoy," Yu Chaolong said in a heavy tone.</p><p></p><p>"The Qing Envoy has arrived?" Lin Yuan's tone was slightly surprised. Neither the Yu family nor the Dongyang family knew the exact time the Qing Envoy would arrive, only a rough estimate.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific time?</p><p></p><p>No one could be certain.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Lin Yuan noticed Yu Chaolong's expression was off.</p><p></p><p>"That Dongyang Meng has condensed ten Blazing Sun seeds," Yu Chaolong said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Ten Blazing Sun seeds?" Lin Yuan looked at Yu Chaolong.</p><p></p><p>"After today, I will send you away, and the Yu family will also relocate its clan members," Yu Chaolong said.</p><p></p><p>This was also to prevent retaliation from the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong led Lin Yuan outside.</p><p></p><p>Soon the two came before the Qing Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"You are Yu Yan?" Qing Envoy Shi Song sized up Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I am," Lin Yuan was also observing the other party.</p><p></p><p>Qing Envoy Shi Song didn't waste words and directly took out that crimson mirror, like a blazing sun burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The crimson mirror emitted a faint light, instantly shining towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn. He found he couldn't dodge the mirror's illumination at all. The speed at which the mirror light descended far surpassed space and time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Qing Envoy Shi Song was casually examining the crimson mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, after the mirror light shone out, it could quickly reflect the number of Blazing Sun seeds the other party had condensed.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The crimson mirror surface had no reaction.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Qing Envoy Shi Song was slightly puzzled in his heart, but didn't show it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Qing Envoy Shi Song was about to activate the crimson mirror again.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he saw a scene he would never forget in his life.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the originally calm mirror surface finally had a reaction.</p><p></p><p>Splash splash.</p><p></p><p>In the mirror was a crimson ocean, with water flowing and surging in thousand-layered waves.</p><p></p><p>If one looked carefully, one would discover that each wave was composed of dozens of Blazing Sun seeds.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Qing Envoy Shi Song's mouth gaped open, his mind a blank.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 301: Aren't You Just a Newly Advanced Ninth-Tier? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien decided to make a move against the Galaxy Master for three reasons. </p><p></p><p>First, the Galaxy Master had just entered the ninth tier not long ago. How strong could he be? How far could his strength go? </p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien himself was a ninth-tier expert at the Ten Thousand Layers realm. No matter how exceptionally talented the Galaxy Master was, at most he just wouldn't be able to kill the alien, but the alien was fully capable of escaping unscathed.</p><p></p><p>The Insectoid Grand Alliance and the Human Grand Alliance were mortal enemies to begin with. Regardless of whether he attacked the Galaxy Master or not, the enmity between the two would not lessen in the slightest. If the Galaxy Master had a chance to kill him, he would not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>Second, this was the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm. The experts who entered this secret realm were basically all avatar clones, and the Galaxy Master must be the same.</p><p></p><p>Since it was an avatar clone, he wouldn't bring any precious treasures or trump cards. If the three-headed alien encountered the Galaxy Master's true self, he probably wouldn't act rashly.</p><p></p><p>With the Galaxy Master's innate talent, the human civilization must have left many contingencies on him. He was just a ninth-tier, so what did he have to withstand the contingencies of the peak races?</p><p></p><p>But in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm? And with an avatar clone entering, the three-headed alien felt he had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Third, there were still the rewards from the Insectoids. The Insectoids spared no effort in order to delay the Galaxy Master's growth.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily killed the hundred-meter giant bear and casually took the "Mysterious Yellow" crystal.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-meter giant bear was only at the early ninth-tier level, and its core "Mysterious Yellow" crystal was only the size of a thumb, worth no more than a few thousand cosmos crystals.</p><p></p><p>But even a mosquito was still meat. Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't mind, it was equivalent to picking it up for free.</p><p></p><p>"Whether or not I can figure out the 'summoning sensation' this time entering the 'Mysterious Yellow' Secret Realm, I'm still profiting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was joyful. </p><p></p><p>This was all money, all money ah.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to merge into the spatial layers and continue on his way.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Black fog began to permeate from all directions at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>The black fog penetrated through layers and layers of space, vaguely condensing into a black prison cage encompassing over twenty thousand spatial layers with Lin Yuan at the center.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is it an alien race?"</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, he also entered the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Although the native lifeforms of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm were powerful, their attack methods were quite rigid and wouldn't be as exquisite as the black fog, trying to trap Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master!"</p><p></p><p>The moment the black fog condensed into a prison cage, a three-headed alien walked out, smiling at Lin Yuan. "I didn't expect to encounter the far-famed Galaxy Master?"</p><p></p><p>"It's you?"</p><p></p><p>"Olefin!"</p><p></p><p>The black prison cage covered over twenty thousand spatial layers. For ninth-tier experts who had opened up less than twenty thousand spatial layers, it was difficult to easily escape.</p><p></p><p>But the number of spatial layers Lin Yuan had opened up reached forty-three thousand, far exceeding twenty thousand in spatial depth.</p><p></p><p>So escaping the prison cage was very easy.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan saw that the expert who attacked him was a three-headed alien, he immediately had other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien named "Olefin" was a ninth-tier expert of the Insectoid Grand Alliance with some fame, having opened up twenty-six thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Just based on the number of spatial layers, Lin Yuan could sweep Olefin.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Lin Yuan's true combat power was far from being measured just by spatial layers. His inner world reached over 100 million square miles, allowing Lin Yuan's true strength to be comparable to experts with hundreds of thousands to millions of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>And facing Olefin, this ninth-tier expert of the Insectoid Grand Alliance, who had killed who knows how many human evolvers on the large-scale alien battlefield, Lin Yuan also had the intention to kill.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the other party took the initiative to deliver himself, and his strength was far inferior to Lin Yuan's. There were also no ninth-tier experts from the Insectoid Grand Alliance around to support him.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien didn't waste words. He believed the advantage was his. The faster he killed the Galaxy Master the better, to avoid unforeseen developments.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The black fog permeating all directions began to contract. The three-headed alien's figure dispersed and also turned into black fog, merging with the surrounding black prison cage.</p><p></p><p>This was also the three-headed alien's ultimate move, using his racial innate ability to completely merge into the space.</p><p></p><p>This was complete integration, not entering layers and layers of space.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master, don't blame me."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the three-headed alien's face, as if he saw the Galaxy Master being crushed to dust under the contraction of the black fog.</p><p></p><p>Strangling an extraordinary human genius, even if it was just an avatar clone, brought a great sense of accomplishment to the three-headed alien.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and lightly grabbed in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This grab was not limited to the main space, but encompassed layers and layers of space. All the black fog gathered into Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien had merged into the black fog, originally thinking he had an innate invincible position. But under this grab, he also fell into Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>"This isâ€”" The three-headed alien's expression greatly changed. Facing Lin Yuan's grab, he wanted to escape into deeper spatial layers, but found that no matter which layer of space he fled into, he still had to face this grab.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his terror and unwillingness, the three-headed alien only had time to shout this sentence before he saw Lin Yuan's right hand quickly clench. All the black fog, as well as the three-headed alien himself, turned to ashes under this grasp.</p><p></p><p>The ninth-tier, Ten Thousand Layers realm three-headed alien died.</p><p></p><p>"With this level of strength, you still wanted to come kill me?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the three-headed alien had seen Lin Yuan and took the initiative to flee, he might have been able to survive. After all, in this Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, Lin Yuan didn't want to make too big of a commotion.</p><p></p><p>But taking the initiative to come, Lin Yuan wouldn't be polite in accepting it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the spatial bracelet." Lin Yuan took out the spatial bracelet from the three-headed alien.</p><p></p><p>When crushing the three-headed alien, Lin Yuan had specially left some leeway, worried about crushing the spatial bracelet as well.</p><p></p><p>Once the spatial bracelet shattered, the many treasures inside would randomly scatter into the layers and layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan could find them one by one, it would waste a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>"So poor, a ninth-tier Ten Thousand Layers realm, only two ninth-tier secret treasures?"</p><p></p><p>"And a few Mysterious Yellow crystals totaling over 200,000 cosmos crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept a glance and sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood. Entering the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm was full of dangers. No one could guarantee they would walk out alive, so naturally they couldn't bring too many treasures on them.</p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yuan, besides three ninth-tier secret treasures, he also didn't bring other treasures. Precious items like origin essence gold were definitely kept on his true body to be safe.</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien's target should have been the inner regions or even the core area of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm. He didn't deliberately seek out the native creatures in the outer regions to kill, so it was normal not to have many "Mysterious Yellow" crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again entered the depths of the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Following the increasingly clear "calling sensation," he quickly flew towards the core area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a distant desolate star region.</p><p></p><p>Three powerful alien beings emerged from a certain star in their true forms.</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Star Lord, wasn't he just a newly advanced Ninth Stage?" The three-headed alien looked furious, "You call this newly advanced Ninth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had no idea what technique the Galaxy Star Lord used to kill him, because everything happened too fast.</p><p></p><p>But judging from the numerous spatial layers he had just escaped to, which were all easily sealed off by the Galaxy Star Lord, it could be seen that the number of spatial layers the other party could open up was definitely not lower than his own.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the three-headed alien had stepped into the Ninth Stage for hundreds of thousands of years, what about the Galaxy Star Lord? More than ten years?</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien was filled with unwillingness. If he had known that the Galaxy Star Lord had such strength, he would never have taken the initiative to deliver himself to the door even if it meant death.</p><p></p><p>"This is a big loss."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien took a deep breath. The death of his clone was not a huge loss for him. As for the two Ninth Stage secret treasures carried by the clone, Olifen could accept it.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the three-headed alien Olifen, it would take at most a few decades to condense a new clone, plus another ten to twenty years to raise the clone's strength to a level close to the true body.</p><p></p><p>Adding the two together, it would be around a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years in the long life of a Ninth Stage powerhouse was just the time to take a nap.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was the opening time of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>And from the opening to the closing of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it was only a hundred years in total.</p><p></p><p>In other words, with the loss of this clone, the three-headed alien was equivalent to having no chance to enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time.</p><p></p><p>Unless he was willing to directly enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm with his true body.</p><p></p><p>But the three-headed alien Olifen didn't have the guts to do so. If a clone entered the secret realm and died, it could still be condensed again.</p><p></p><p>But if the true body died, it would be a thorough death. Olifen's race was only a powerful race, without a supreme being presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>To wait for the supreme being of the Insect Race to "resurrect" him, who knew how long it would take, and whether he could be resurrected in the end was another matter.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Secret Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien Olifen's heart was bleeding. Originally, he had planned to take advantage of the opening of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time to make a big profit. With his strength, as long as he didn't enter the core area and stayed far away from those few key locations in the inner area, he basically wouldn't die.</p><p></p><p>As long as he didn't die and walked out of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm alive, he could at least obtain treasures worth hundreds of millions to billions of universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was all gone.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.</p><p></p><p>"About to enter the inner area."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully hurried through the layers upon layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was boundless, with the outer area being the smallest and the inner area being much larger than the outer area.</p><p></p><p>As for the core area? So far, no powerhouse had figured out the specific scope of the core area.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, although Eighth Stage Invincibles also had the qualifications to enter, they lived quite a difficult life.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest native lifeforms in the secret realm were comparable to newly advanced Ninth Stage powerhouses, which meant that Eighth Stage Invincibles entering this secret realm would fall into a state where they couldn't beat anyone.</p><p></p><p>If they encountered slightly stronger native lifeforms, they might not even be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>This was just the threat from the secret realm itself, let alone other alien powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe's main space, the numerous Ninth Stage powerhouses were restrained by the few top races and couldn't easily make a move.</p><p></p><p>But in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm? There was no such restriction. When Ninth Stage powerhouses encountered Eighth Stage Invincibles, if they were from the same camp, it would still be fine.</p><p></p><p>If they were from different camps? They would basically be eliminated with a casual strike.</p><p></p><p>Even in the face of so many threats.</p><p></p><p>There were still a large number of Eighth Stage Invincibles pouring into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the worst result was just the death of a clone, but if they gained something, the improvement to their own foundation would be a leap forward.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the location where his teacher, the Vermilion Roc Star Lord, had obtained the Xuanhuang Evolution Path back then.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this "calling sensation" from the core area, Lin Yuan would probably go and take a look to see if he could discover any information related to the "Xuanhuang" Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now that the "calling sensation" was so strong, Lin Yuan naturally prioritized it.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to hurry on his way.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>On the earthen yellow mountain range not far away, an aura erupted.</p><p></p><p>This aura was so vast that it affected an area of several tens of billions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"A treasure has emerged?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>In various parts of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, many treasures and top-grade treasures were hidden.</p><p></p><p>These were the so-called places of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Once these treasures and top-grade treasures emerged, they would cause celestial phenomena.</p><p></p><p>Other powerhouses who sensed it and knew the location of the treasure would naturally rush over at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very clear about his position and purpose.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, his upper limit combat power was close to that of a Ninth Stage powerhouse at the level of millions of heavy realms, but he probably couldn't beat a true Ninth Stage powerhouse at the level of millions of heavy realms.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Ninth Stage powerhouses at the level of tens of millions of heavy realms.</p><p></p><p>Although there weren't many Ninth Stage powerhouses at the level of tens of millions of heavy realms who entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time, there were definitely quite a few, all wanting to find opportunities for breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>And based on the celestial phenomena caused by that place of opportunity, at least treasures at the level of ten-star universe rarities would appear.</p><p></p><p>It would definitely attract many Ninth Stage powerhouses at the level of millions and tens of millions of heavy realms to fight over it.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed a series of terrifying fluctuations coming from the direction of that earthen yellow mountain range.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks of power penetrated over tens of millions of heavy spatial layers, vast and endless, as if they would never stop.</p><p></p><p>"It should be a Ninth Stage powerhouse close to the level of tens of millions of heavy realms making a move."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>A Ninth Stage powerhouse at the level of tens of millions of heavy realms could instantly cover tens of millions of heavy spatial layers in battle, and the combat power they could erupt was terrifying. As long as you were still within these tens of millions of heavy spatial layers, you couldn't escape their attacks and suppression.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with me anyway."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to hurry towards the core area.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of such a large-scale place of opportunity in the inner area was not a bad thing for Lin Yuan, but rather a good thing.</p><p></p><p>At least it attracted the attention of a large number of Ninth Stage powerhouses at the level of millions and tens of millions of heavy realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's journey ahead would be even smoother, and the probability of encountering alien powerhouses that he couldn't deal with would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is going smoothly in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm at the moment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. His Solar Primordial Spirit had merged into the layers upon layers of space and was rushing towards the core area at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the vastness of the inner area, it would take at least ten to twenty years to traverse such a large area without the aid of teleportation or movement.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I haven't challenged the third floor of the Black Tower since I stepped into the Ninth Stage, have I?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred, and he immediately split off a thread of consciousness and descended into the Demon Jade Space along the Demon Jade imprint.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the golden box.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Lin Yuan's avatar had brought back the golden box.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he got his hands on the golden box, it seemed to sense something and began slowly absorbing the aura of the Xuanhuang evolution path within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>This absorption continued until now.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that the golden box had slowed or even stopped absorbing.</p><p></p><p>"Is it time to open it?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden box, detecting different fluctuations in the aura inside.</p><p></p><p>"Master." </p><p></p><p>A six-armed figure appeared beside him and spoke cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Click, click.</p><p></p><p>The aura inside the golden box changed rapidly, and finally a crack appeared on the surface of the box.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the crack.</p><p></p><p>The crack grew larger and larger until the golden box opened completely.</p><p></p><p>Inside the golden box was neatly arranged a piece of beast hide.</p><p></p><p>To call it beast hide was not quite accurate, but it was definitely the skin of some powerful creature, overall bluish-green in color with an ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined the beast hide without making any rash moves.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure beside him also couldn't discern anything and knew nothing about the beast hide.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>With a slight mental command from Lin Yuan, the beast hide slowly floated up, gently drifting.</p><p></p><p>"This piece of beast hide is itself a secret treasure, a Chaos-level secret treasure," Lin Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As the beast hide drifted, a mysterious aura spread out, suppressing space and time. This aura originated from the beast hide itself.</p><p></p><p>"Just a Chaos-level secret treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked puzzled. The beast hide gave him a feeling that surpassed even the Chaos-level secret treasure left behind by the peak Sovereign-level being 'Cang Wei Yang'.</p><p></p><p>A Chaos-level secret treasure of this quality would be worth at least 100,000 chaos stones, and would be priceless on the market.</p><p></p><p>After all, the beast hide could suppress space and time, clearly a control-type secret treasure. This type of treasure was always more valuable than attack-type treasures.</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>This beast hide came from the golden box, and the golden box was from the Xuanhuang lineage. According to the six-armed figure, these golden boxes were all personally refined by Emperor Xuanhuang, and the treasures inside were likely left by Emperor Xuanhuang himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called supreme saint from eons of cosmic eras ago - how could Emperor Xuanhuang specially refine a golden box just to put a mere Chaos-level secret treasure inside?</p><p></p><p>Even a saint-level secret treasure wouldn't be worth such effort from Emperor Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there's a map engraved on the surface of this beast hide," the six-armed figure said hurriedly, seeming to notice something.</p><p></p><p>"A map?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit stirred slightly, and he immediately began to examine it.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the beast hide was an incredibly complex map involving layer upon layer of space and time. Even a Chaos Lord or Chaos Great Saint could potentially get lost in it.</p><p></p><p>"This map..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly scanned through it. The territory covered by the map was immeasurably vast, at least ten times the size of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, with numerous areas marked within.</p><p></p><p>"This map is of His Majesty's mausoleum," the six-armed figure suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Mausoleum?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at it again.</p><p></p><p>A mausoleum was similar to a tomb. For mortal beings, there was indeed a need to prepare a mausoleum, since they would eventually die.</p><p></p><p>But for Emperor Xuanhuang? Even if he was only at the Realm-Opening level, he would still have infinite lifespan. Let alone Emperor Xuanhuang as a supreme saint - preparing a mausoleum meant knowing in advance that he would die. Forget about supreme saints, even Chaos Lords rarely died.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, knowing in advance that he would die? Even if that were true, a Chaos Lord would try to avoid death, not actively build his own mausoleum like this.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure stared blankly at the map on the beast hide.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>First, Emperor Xuanhuang building a mausoleum meant he knew in advance that he would die? Knowing of his death in advance but not trying to avoid it, instead actively welcoming it - was it because this death was unavoidable? But what kind of death would be unavoidable for a supreme saint? The pursuit of a 13th-level time being?</p><p></p><p>If Emperor Xuanhuang truly faced the pursuit of a 13th-level being, he would indeed be doomed to die, and the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would certainly be destroyed along with him.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent of a 13th-level being would encompass not just Emperor Xuanhuang himself, but everything related to Emperor Xuanhuang would vanish.</p><p></p><p>Just like when Duke Qing Fen killed everyone in the East Yang family - under the spread of karma, there was no possibility of any omission.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang opened 33,333 Xuanhuang Secret Realms, which could baffle saints of the same level, but definitely couldn't hide from a 13th-level time being.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Xuanhuang Secret Realms still existed meant it wasn't a 13th-level being who acted.</p><p></p><p>The map of Emperor Xuanhuang's mausoleum on the beast hide made Lin Yuan puzzled about the disappearance of this supreme saint.</p><p></p><p>"This map is only of the interior of the mausoleum, it doesn't indicate where the mausoleum is located," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This meant the usefulness of this map was actually quite limited.</p><p></p><p>"Oh well." "Even without the map, this piece of beast hide is still a Chaos-level secret treasure..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Treasure, bought for only 30,000 chaos stones, it's definitely a profit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped thinking further. With his current foundation and strength, he could fully activate secret treasures at the Chaos Realm level. This beast skin in his hands could indeed play a very significant role.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen City, East Gate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, numerous figures had already appeared at the vast East Gate. These figures exuded terrifying auras, at least at the Sovereign Realm level, all disciples under Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen recruited disciples widely, with tens of thousands under his command, but those who could reach the Sovereign Realm were few, only numbering in the hundreds.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis told us to wait for him here, saying he's taken in a new disciple. What's this all about?" A few among the figures conversed in low voices.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Marquis Qingfen had left and then sent them a message, telling everyone to wait here.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of disciple could make the Marquis personally go to receive them?" Some powerful cultivators found it hard to believe. Since joining under Marquis Qingfen, they had never seen such a thing happen.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what kind of disciple it is, since the Marquis told us to wait, we'll just wait."</p><p></p><p>Most people didn't say much, just waiting in place.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, when the Marquis took you in as a disciple back then, it wasn't like this, was it?" At the forefront of all the figures, a young man looked at the tall man beside him.</p><p></p><p>The "Senior Brother" he referred to was Feng Wanxing, the strongest cultivator in the Qingfen Domain after Marquis Qingfen.</p><p></p><p>"No need to speak of such things." Feng Wanxing glanced at the young man. "We're all the Marquis's disciples. In the future battlefield of ancient countries, we should support each other."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, of course." The young man hastily replied.</p><p></p><p>He was just feeling a bit resentful, without any other intentions.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared in space-time not far away.</p><p></p><p>"They're here."</p><p></p><p>All the powerful cultivators who had been waiting turned to look.</p><p></p><p>They saw a space-time vortex appear, and Marquis Qingfen, wearing a green robe, walked out, followed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Who's that beside the Marquis?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be the new disciple the Marquis has taken in."</p><p></p><p>The many powerful cultivators on the scene immediately noticed Lin Yuan, secretly appraising him with their gazes.</p><p></p><p>They were all very curious about Lin Yuan. In all these years, it was the first time they had seen the Marquis attach such importance to a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed Marquis Qingfen out of the space-time passage. From the Yu family to Qingfen City was incredibly distant, equivalent to traversing half the universe in the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>In this source world, space-time was extremely stable, making spatial traversal exponentially more difficult. Even Lin Yuan at his peak would need considerable time to cross such a vast distance, yet Marquis Qingfen had brought him here in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis Qingfen's comprehension and attainment in space-time must be at least at the eighth level," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After emerging from the space-time passage, Lin Yuan also looked at the many powerful cultivators who had been waiting.</p><p></p><p>"All at the Sovereign Realm?" Lin Yuan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Marquis." All the waiting powerful cultivators bowed to Marquis Qingfen in unison.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Marquis Qingfen's face broke into a smile. He said to Lin Yuan beside him, "These are all your senior fellow disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Among my disciples, strength is respected above all. In the future, if your strength surpasses theirs, then they will all be your junior fellow disciples and must call you Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen said.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Whether in this source world, the main universe, or the chaos void, strength was supreme.</p><p></p><p>Strength was status, was everything.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qingfen turned to look at his many disciples and said, "This is my newly accepted disciple. From now on, he will live in Fentian Palace. If you have no business, do not disturb him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>All the disciples immediately responded, while waves stirred in their hearts. Fentian Palace was one of Marquis Qingfen's residences. Apart from Marquis Qingfen himself, they as disciples didn't even have the qualifications to approach it.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan was allowed to live there?</p><p></p><p>Such favor and importance was simply too great, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>After becoming acquainted with Marquis Qingfen's many Sovereign Realm disciples, Lin Yuan followed the Marquis to Fentian Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Fentian Palace is one of my cultivation places. Inside are stored countless classics and legacies, from the Qingfen Domain and other great domains, even including records from the royal family of the Lieyang Ancient Country," Marquis Qingfen looked at Lin Yuan. "By studying these classics and legacies, you will gain a general understanding of the future path of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Marquis."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, what he most urgently desired was not treasures or weapons, but knowledge and legacies.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension ability, as long as there was enough knowledge and legacy, Lin Yuan's growth speed would have no limits.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter which world, the preciousness of inherited knowledge was beyond doubt, especially the many legacy classics in Fentian Palace, which were clearly specially organized by Marquis Qingfen, making them more convenient and efficient to study and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"After you've spent a year or two in there and gained a rudimentary understanding of the cultivation path, come find me again." Marquis Qingfen smiled as he finished speaking, then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Fentian Palace."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected himself and immediately walked in.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was refining the jade gourd while continuing to cultivate and comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the source world, different from those of the chaos void, caused Lin Yuan's comprehension of rules to skyrocket at a certain speed at all times.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three hundred years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 228: Fools! (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In this Seven Star Cave trial, there were indeed many geniuses who appeared. On the new 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùô®ùôùùô™ùô≠.ùôòùô§ùô¢</p><p></p><p>Just among the Crimson Mark examinees, there were thirteen of them, and there were nearly a thousand Gold Mark examinees.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that whether it's the Crimson Mark or the Gold Mark, they are all personally recognized by the Vermilion Kun Star Lord. Although it cannot represent their full potential, to be able to become a Crimson Mark, at least the innate potential they have shown is definitely at the top of all examinees.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, under the watchful eyes of Lin Yuan and the other peak masters, one examinee after another was going all out, constantly passing through layer after layer of star caves, heading towards the final seventh star cave.</p><p></p><p>"That Crimson Mark examinee should have awakened some kind of special fire-type bloodline. His potential is not low. Do any of you want him?" The Third Senior Brother's eyes lit up as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"You can have him."</p><p></p><p>"I don't follow the fire-type rules."</p><p></p><p>"A special bloodline, huh? It looks like it should be one of those top-tier fire-type bloodlines."</p><p></p><p>The peak masters spoke one after another.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also carefully looked at that Crimson Mark examinee.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, not bad." Lin Yuan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan didn't have any special bloodlines, he had to admit that a top-notch bloodline physique was indeed quite helpful for cultivation, especially in the early stages. A top-tier bloodline could even allow one to fight across realms.</p><p></p><p>"Since Third Senior Brother wants him, I won't fight for him." Lin Yuan thought to himself. For Lin Yuan, he was only taking the Vermilion Kun Star Lord's suggestion to accept a few examinees. As for who exactly they were, there was no set number. To fight with his senior brothers over a mere examinee? Lin Yuan felt there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if anyone will pass the ultimate test in this Seven Star Cave world this time?" Second Senior Brother sighed, casually making conversation.</p><p></p><p>The so-called ultimate test was to comprehend a glimmer of the 'Xuan Huang' evolution path. Back then, Lin Yuan did just that, directly causing the Vermilion Kun Star Lord, who was in closed-door cultivation and could not be disturbed, to personally come out of seclusion and accept Lin Yuan as his thirteenth disciple.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that before this, the Vermilion Kun Star Lord had not accepted a disciple for ten thousand years. Ordinary examinees, even Crimson Marks, could not catch the Vermilion Kun Star Lord's eye.</p><p></p><p>With the talent of a Crimson Mark examinee, at most they had the hope of advancing to the sixth stage, while every one of the disciples taught by the Vermilion Kun Star Lord started at the sixth stage.</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate test?"</p><p></p><p>"In the tens of thousands of years of my Vermilion Kun lineage, only Junior Brother has emerged."</p><p></p><p>"And now you want another one to appear? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. What do these examinees have to compare with Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>The twelve peak masters chatted casually. A seventh-stage evolutioner under a hundred years old was rare not only in the Vermilion Kun Star Domain but in the entire Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened to his senior brothers' chat on the side, occasionally interjecting a few words.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, when do you plan to go to the outer star domains to take up your post?" Fourth Senior Brother Zuo Ge asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother, having entered the eighth stage, needed to fulfill the obligations of human civilization and take up a post in a star domain for five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The star domains here, of course, were not the internal star domains that human civilization was about to enter, but the newly developed star domains on the periphery.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Alliance was constantly expanding, thus the territory of human civilization was continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>The star domains where eighth-stage evolutioners needed to be stationed were the territories that human civilization had just occupied.</p><p></p><p>In these territories, the main enemies must have been wiped out by the powerhouses of human civilization, but there would still be some remnant ethnic groups and forces.</p><p></p><p>It would be up to the star lords stationed in this star domain to decide whether to leave these remnant forces and integrate them into human civilization, or to continue to wipe them out. It all depended on the star lord's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Each star lord had a different governing philosophy. Some star lords hoped for universal harmony among all races in the universe, while others believed that those who were not of our race must have different hearts.</p><p></p><p>"After this Seven Star Cave trial is over, I will set out." The eldest senior brother said.</p><p></p><p>The danger in the frontier territories of human civilization was not low, but eighth-stage evolutioners were not pushovers either.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly kill an eighth-stage evolutioner? It was very difficult to do, and at the eighth stage, they basically all had avatars.</p><p></p><p>The supreme powerhouses of human civilization, in order to encourage eighth-stage evolutioners to be stationed in the frontier star domains, had long ago made a promise that any eighth-stage evolutioner who died at the hands of alien races during their five-hundred-year tenure in the star domain would be "resurrected".</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of years ago, this Vermilion Kun Star Domain where the Vermilion Kun Star Lord was stationed was actually a frontier star domain of human civilization at that time.</p><p></p><p>It was just that after so many years of expansion, the Vermilion Kun Star Domain, which was originally located on the frontier territory, was now located within the territory of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>The examinees finally entered the seventh star cave and began to comprehend the more than one hundred statues with all their might.</p><p></p><p>And after observing along the way, Lin Yuan and the peak masters had roughly selected the examinees.</p><p></p><p>For the peak masters, they would only inform each other when selecting Crimson Mark examinees. The thirteen Crimson Mark examinees were just right for the thirteen peak masters to each take one.</p><p></p><p>As for the Gold Mark and Silver Mark examinees? They basically didn't greet each other much, because there were too many Gold Marks and Silver Marks.</p><p></p><p>Even if a small probability event occurred where two peak masters jointly selected a Gold Mark, they would let this Gold Mark examinee choose for themselves which peak master's subordinate they wanted to join.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they encountered some special Gold Mark examinees, there would also be peak masters who would inform the others in advance, but this situation was not common.</p><p></p><p>Normally speaking, the hope of a Gold Mark examinee entering the sixth stage was much smaller than that of a Crimson Mark examinee.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, have you finished selecting?" </p><p></p><p>"I've pretty much selected them. I chose three this time." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Not all examinees could be selected by the peak masters. The vast majority of examinees would not be selected, but would become members of the Vermilion Kun lineage and join a peak master's subordinates through their own efforts later on.</p><p></p><p>Just like "Fang Qing" back then, he was not part of any peak master's subordinates from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>And the three Crimson Marks from the same year had been selected by several peak masters early on.</p><p></p><p>Being selected by a peak master in advance was equivalent to taking fewer detours.</p><p></p><p>"Which three?"</p><p></p><p>Several senior brothers were immediately interested.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to know which three examinees their junior brother, who had a heaven-defying innate talent, had selected.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Li, Feng Yu, and Wu Lan." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li was one of the thirteen Crimson Mark evolutioners. When selecting this person, Lin Yuan had also informed his senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>As a Crimson Mark evolutioner, Mo Li's talent was not bad. He had condensed the "Battle Heart" at the fourth stage, and his killing power far surpassed those of the same stage. He could rank in the top three among the thirteen Crimson Marks.</p><p></p><p>The Battle Heart was a manifestation of a certain realm, skilled in killing and having a natural affinity for the laws of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Yu and Wu Lan, one was a Gold Mark and the other was a Silver Mark. Lin Yuan had just casually selected them, choosing those who caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu followed the wind-type laws and was about to enter the door. He was one of the best among the Gold Mark examinees.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Lan, she was a Silver Mark examinee. The reason why Lin Yuan chose her was simply because she followed the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial dao evolution path was extremely famous in the Vermilion Kun Star Domain, it had appeared for too short a time. Although there were some third-stage martial dao evolutioners, most of them were over a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were not over a hundred years old, they might not necessarily participate in the Vermilion Kun Star Domain's arena battles.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in this Seven Star Cave trial, it was very rare to see a third-stage martial dao evolutioner. Lin Yuan casually selected her.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother's selection seems to have a pattern," the Peak Masters said to each other, looking at each other with a mix of amusement and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>One Crimson Mark.</p><p></p><p>One Gold Mark. </p><p></p><p>One Silver Mark.</p><p></p><p>It was like he was trying to spread the favor evenly.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Except for the Crimson Mark, the other two were indeed randomly selected.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, the Gold Mark examinee you selected seems to overlap with Senior Brother's choice?" Second Senior Brother suddenly thought of something and quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Overlap?"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother was stunned for a moment. "Is it Feng Yu?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll let Junior Brother have him." Senior Brother said directly.</p><p></p><p>Just a mere Gold Mark, even if it was a Crimson Mark, if Junior Brother wanted, Senior Brother would directly give it up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother doesn't need to do this." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Let him choose for himself." After some thought, Lin Yuan felt a bit embarrassed to let Senior Brother concede directly.</p><p></p><p>"That works too."</p><p></p><p>"Let this Feng Yu choose for himself." Senior Brother had no objections upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just a Gold Mark examinee. How could that compare to the bond between them as senior and junior brothers?</p><p></p><p>The other Peak Masters present didn't find anything strange about this. A Gold Mark examinee was nothing special. There was a batch of such examinees every fifteen years.</p><p></p><p>All the evolvers who passed the Seven Star Cave Trial were teleported to a square.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Seven Star Cave Trial ended.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were only a few thousand examinees standing in the square.</p><p></p><p>From the initial 1.5 million to the current few thousand, the pass rate was only about one in a thousand.</p><p></p><p>And now, these few thousand examinees were standing there nervously.</p><p></p><p>Because next would be the moment that determined their fate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's performance in passing through the seven star caves was now in the eyes of the thirteen Peak Masters.</p><p></p><p>Based on their performance, the thirteen Peak Masters would select a group of them to take under their command.</p><p></p><p>For everyone, this was no different from an opportunity for a carp to leap through the dragon gate.</p><p></p><p>Being able to directly join a Peak Master's command, who knew how many detours it would save, allowing one to directly obtain a high position in the Crimson Roc Lineage.</p><p></p><p>Fang Qing appeared in this square.</p><p></p><p>The selection of examinees who passed the Seven Star Cave Trial was announced by Lin Yuan, and then notified by him.</p><p></p><p>"The first, Silver Mark examinee Wu Lan."</p><p></p><p>Fang Qing walked up to a nervous young girl and said gently, "The Thirteenth Peak Master invites you to join the Thirteenth Mountain Peak. If you are willing, later just walk through the thirteenth gate."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Fang Qing pointed to the thirteen gates in the distance, of which the thirteenth gate belonged to the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"I... I am willing..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan's mind went blank. After reacting, she quickly said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Oh my god.</p><p></p><p>She was actually chosen by the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>As a Silver Mark examinee, the probability of being selected by a Peak Master was very low, let alone by the Thirteenth Peak Master who was famous in the Crimson Roc Star Domain and even the Annan Star Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Before participating in this tournament, Wu Lan herself was already a fan of the Thirteenth Peak Master. She never thought that she would be able to join the Thirteenth Mountain Peak at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan was a bit dizzy from this blessing that fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The other examinees around looked at Wu Lan with envy.</p><p></p><p>But they could only envy. Which examinees the Peak Masters wanted to select was their own business.</p><p></p><p>After notifying Wu Lan, Fang Qing walked towards the next examinee, Feng Yu.</p><p></p><p>"The Thirteenth Peak Master also wants me to join?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu was a handsome man. Hearing Fang Qing's words at this moment, he looked a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"If you agree, later just walk through the thirteenth gate."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Fang Qing turned and left, walking towards the last examinee.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master..." Feng Yu had naturally heard about the Thirteenth Peak Master, an extraordinary top genius of the Crimson Roc Star Domain who entered the seventh stage before a hundred years old, simply a monster.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Thirteenth Peak Master was also the only disciple accepted by the Crimson Roc Star Lord in ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, Feng Yu should have been overjoyed to accept the Thirteenth Peak Master's invitation.</p><p></p><p>It's just that before this, the First Peak Master had also sent someone to invite him.</p><p></p><p>This made Feng Yu a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>But the First Peak Master had recently entered the eighth stage. No matter how strong the Thirteenth Peak Master's talent was, who knew how long it would take to go from the seventh stage to the eighth stage?</p><p></p><p>"Although the Thirteenth Peak Master is indeed a top genius, he is too young. How could he possibly know how to guide disciples?" Feng Yu thought to himself:</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Thirteenth Peak Master only invited me to become an outer member of the Thirteenth Mountain Peak, while if I join the First Mountain Peak under the First Peak Master, I would directly become a core inner member, and it would only be a matter of time before becoming a core member."</p><p></p><p>After much deliberation, Feng Yu finally decided to choose the First Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>After all, one was at the eighth stage and one at the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>One was inner core and one outer.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the First Peak Master, having experienced so many years and deeply received the true teachings of the Crimson Roc Star Lord, must be far superior to the Thirteenth Peak Master in guiding disciples.</p><p></p><p>Among the Crimson Mark examinees.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li sat cross-legged. As one of the thirteen Crimson Marks, Mo Li could be said to be one hundred percent valued by the Peak Masters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mo Li was pondering which Peak Master would invite him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Feng Yu, Mo Li's background was much greater, and he had an accurate analysis of the various Peak Masters.</p><p></p><p>"The Thirteenth Peak Master wants..." Fang Qing walked up to Mo Li.</p><p></p><p>"The Thirteenth Peak Master is inviting me?" Mo Li's eyes lit up, and his heart was instantly filled with wild joy.</p><p></p><p>He came from a seventh stage power in the Annan Star Alliance and specially came to the Crimson Roc Star Domain to participate in the tournament, just to join the Crimson Roc Lineage.</p><p></p><p>After analysis by Mo Li and the elders in his power, it was determined that among the Crimson Roc Lineage, it would be best to become a disciple of the Crimson Roc Star Lord, but this was not realistic.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Crimson Roc Star Lord, the seventh stage evolver in Mo Li's power repeatedly pondered and determined that it would be best to be under the command of the Thirteenth Peak Master with the least seniority.</p><p></p><p>Although the First Peak Master had entered the eighth stage earlier, with the Thirteenth Peak Master's talent and aptitude, entering the eighth stage was also just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Thirteenth Peak Master was the junior disciple of the Crimson Roc Star Lord and was already favored. In the future, he might become the second Crimson Roc Star Lord, an invincible existence at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The earlier one became a subordinate of the Thirteenth Peak Master, the more benefits one would receive. This was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>As the various Peak Masters' "butlers" finished their invitations.</p><p></p><p>The examinees began walking towards the thirteen gates in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen gates, from the first to the thirteenth, represented the first to thirteenth Peak Masters of the Crimson Roc Lineage respectively.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>After all the examinees entered the gates, they were teleported to a pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't choose the Thirteenth Peak Master?" Mo Li's mind was joyful. Becoming a subordinate of the Thirteenth Peak Master, he only felt that his future was bright.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the character "one" imprinted on Feng Yu's sleeve, he immediately felt a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>The number on the sleeve represented the examinee's choice. Mo Li's sleeve was imprinted with "thirteen".</p><p></p><p>It's just that Mo Li remembered that the "butler" of the Thirteenth Mountain Peak, Fang Qing, had invited Feng Yu. How come he didn't join the Thirteenth Mountain Peak?</p><p></p><p>"Mo Li, sir." Seeing the Crimson Mark examinee asking him, Feng Yu immediately said respectfully, "I chose the First Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>"Giving up the Thirteenth Peak Master... and choosing the First Peak Master..." Mo Li looked at Feng Yu in some shock, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he couldn't help but comment:</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!"</p>

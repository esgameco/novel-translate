        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 253 - He Was Born for the Martial Dao </p><p></p><p>On the other side of the mountain peak, the previously unenthusiastic figures were all chatting amongst themselves, paying little attention to the Martial Ancestor's Radiance sensor. It couldn't be helped - the performance of the many backdoor entrants following the first batch of invited martial arts prodigies was really poor. Their compatibility with the martial dao basically did not exceed ten percent.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the crucial Martial Ancestor's Radiance that had to be activated under their watch, they probably would have turned and left long ago. </p><p></p><p>"It's almost over," the leading figure, the Grand Elder of the Martial Temple, second in status only to the three 7th stage martial artists out on the battlefield, casually glanced at the Martial Ancestor's Radiance below.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Grand Elder's pupils suddenly contracted. In his sight, strands of Martial Ancestor's Radiance were boiling, and statues began to emit a twelve-fold radiance. In an instant, inside the walls where the seven statues were placed, the Martial Ancestor's Radiance nearly overflowed.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" The Grand Elder was shocked. There was only one possibility for actively attracting the Martial Ancestor's Radiance - the martial arts aptitude of the sensor was so strong that it caused the Martial Ancestor's Radiance to fully revive.</p><p></p><p>This had happened several times in the past 100,000 years, but the scale of the attracted Martial Ancestor's Radiance was far from today's. "The statues are emitting a twelve-fold radiance, and all seven statues are emitting it together... Am I dreaming?" another Martial Temple Grand Elder murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The seven statues represented seven different directions of the martial dao, such as being good at killing power, defense, domain, and so on. Since the establishment of the Martial Temple, there had indeed been test takers who caused several statues to emit radiance, but at most three or four, and the radiance emitted by each statue did not exceed 70%.</p><p></p><p>Like now? Twelve-fold radiance? And all seven statues were like this?</p><p></p><p>"A genius." "The strongest aptitude genius since the establishment of our Martial Temple." The Martial Temple Grand Elders quickly reacted. As 6th stage martial arts masters, they shouldn't have lost their composure like this. It was just that what was happening in front of them was too incredible.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quietly sensed the Martial Ancestor's Radiance that was emitting a meaning of submission. The so-called Martial Ancestor's Radiance was nothing more than using the traces of the Dao charm left by Lin Yuan on the seven statues, and then using external forces to stimulate it. It could sense the most suitable physique and aptitude for cultivating the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days since his consciousness descended, while recovering his strength, Lin Yuan had also been slowly transforming this body. As the former Ancestor of the Martial Dao, the direction in which Lin Yuan transformed his body was certainly the most suitable for the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor's Radiance reacting this way was nothing more than sensing the ultimate physique of the martial arts cultivation system. This kind of physique basically could not be born naturally, and would only appear with the later guidance of Lin Yuan, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, outsiders did not know about this, and even the three old ancestors at the 7th stage of the martial dao were not clear about it.</p><p></p><p>On the side, the old man in black robes was still in an unbelievable shock. He had activated the Martial Ancestor's Radiance so many times and had never felt this scene in the radiance before. Moreover, the seven statues simultaneously erupting with twelve-fold radiance also made this black-robed old man a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>A test taker who could make one statue emit a twelve-fold radiance was already considered a once-in-ten-thousand-years encounter, but you made all seven statues emit a twelve-fold radiance?</p><p></p><p>Just as the black-robed old man didn't know what to do next, several figures appeared silently beside him, all staring at Lin Yuan with burning eyes. An unprecedented martial arts genius. Heaven bless our Martial Temple. Heaven bless our martial dao.</p><p></p><p>These figures were the Grand Elders of the Martial Temple. "Grand Elders..." The black-robed old man was startled, and then immediately reacted. If even he noticed the anomaly in the Martial Ancestor's Radiance, let alone the Grand Elders?</p><p></p><p>"You may go." "Yes." The black-robed old man immediately bowed and quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend," the Grand Elder of the Martial Temple squeezed out a gentle smile and greeted Lin Yuan, then solemnly said, "I wonder if the young friend is willing to join our Martial Temple?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, including the Grand Elder, a trace of nervousness appeared on their faces. With the influence of the Martial Temple, they could naturally force Lin Yuan to join. As the "Heaven" of Xiaoyao City, who dared to refuse the will of the Martial Temple?</p><p></p><p>But that was done to outsiders. With the terrifying aptitude that Lin Yuan currently displayed, he would most likely be able to control the Martial Temple in the future. In this situation, who dared to force him? Not afraid of future retaliation?</p><p></p><p>For a peerless martial arts genius who had the potential to revitalize the Martial Temple, using coercive means was the most foolish way.</p><p></p><p>"Join the Martial Temple?" Lin Yuan looked at the Martial Temple Grand Elders. In fact, with Lin Yuan's mastery of his own strength, he could completely block the Martial Ancestor's Radiance from sensing him.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't. The purpose was to attract the attention of the Martial Temple and then join the Martial Temple to use its vast cultivation resources to quickly restore his strength.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Temple existed to pass on the martial arts cultivation system and was Lin Yuan's natural subordinate force. It even coincided with some of Lin Yuan's future plans. In this crossing, Lin Yuan also included spreading the evolution path of martial arts as one of his plans.</p><p></p><p>And with the Martial Temple, Lin Yuan could avoid many detours and did not need to start from scratch to establish a force and then spread martial arts. </p><p></p><p>"I am willing," Lin Yuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Willing?" The Grand Elder and the other Grand Elders beside him looked at each other, feeling a heavy sigh of relief in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting anxiously. The duration of the Martial Ancestor's Radiance was limited. If they wasted more time in the front, the people in the back would have less time to experience it.</p><p></p><p>Now that the previous sensor had entered for more than half an hour, if they delayed any longer, the Martial Ancestor's Radiance would probably stop.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully Chang'er won't cause any trouble," Lin Jianping's heart thumped, and he could only hope in his heart. Outside, relying on the Lin family's means, as long as Lin Yuan didn't cause too much trouble, it could basically be resolved.</p><p></p><p>But this was the Martial Temple. Anyone caught here had more background and status than the Lin family. If Lin Yuan caused trouble here, just thinking about it made Lin Jianping's scalp a little numb.</p><p></p><p>"He won't, he won't," Shen Zhen comforted in a low voice beside him, feeling the same kind of worry in her heart. The time Lin Yuan spent comprehending the Martial Ancestor's Radiance was really too long, making it hard not to think in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the old man in black robes came out and said to everyone, "Everyone, the Martial Ancestor's Radiance has ended. You can all go back."</p><p></p><p>"Ended?" "So fast?" "It wasn't this fast in previous years." Although the waiting crowd had countless grievances in their hearts, they did not dare to question it. What a joke. Questioning the Martial Temple? Did they still want to live?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Jianping's expression turned dumbfounded. "Where is my son?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he hadn't seen Lin Yuan come out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still hadn't emerged.</p><p></p><p>Was it over?</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping wanted to ask but didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>He could only stand there and continue waiting.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the others left one after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's over. Chang'er has probably encountered trouble," Lin Jianping thought, his heart turning cold. Shen Zhen's face also looked grim.</p><p></p><p>If nothing had happened, their son should have come out long ago.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two mustered the courage to inquire about what had happened, the old man in black robes quickly walked up to Lin Jianping and Shen Zhen, his demeanor slightly respectful. "You two must be Lin Chang's parents. Please come inside."</p><p></p><p>The old man in black robes spoke in a gentle tone, without any of the lofty attitude he had shown towards the others earlier.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that, based on Lin Yuan's performance while sensing the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor, his future status in the Martial Temple would be limitless.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at this moment, his attitude towards Lin Yuan's parents must not have any overstepping, or else he would be burying the roots of misfortune for himself.</p><p></p><p>"We are," Lin Jianping quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>This old man in black robes was the steward of the Martial Temple. The elders and patriarchs of the major families in Xiaoyao City were as cautious in his presence as a grandson would be before his grandfather.</p><p></p><p>But now, such a dignitary was actually speaking to him in this gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>This made Lin Jianping feel as if he were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, the old man in black robes directly said, "Lin Chang is a martial arts prodigy. You need not worry."</p><p></p><p>The old man in black robes couldn't reveal too much, only sharing some trivial information to stabilize the couple's state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping blinked his eyes, unable to react for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Shen Zhen was the same. They knew very well what kind of person their son was.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Martial Temple, several supreme elders gathered once again.</p><p></p><p>After personally escorting Lin Yuan to the top-grade cultivation cave abode of the Martial Temple, they came here.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Chang, father Lin Jianping."</p><p></p><p>Information about Lin Yuan appeared in full before the supreme elders.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's martial arts aptitude and talent left them unable to calm down for a long time, the most basic background check still needed to be done.</p><p></p><p>Even if this background check was meaningless in the eyes of the supreme elders.</p><p></p><p>No matter what hidden dangers Lin Yuan's identity might have, they decided to keep this unprecedented martial arts prodigy in the Martial Temple at all costs.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, it seems his background is clean, born and raised in Xiaoyao City."</p><p></p><p>The Second Supreme Elder looked very satisfied. Indeed, they had already prepared for the worst-case scenario, such as if Lin Yuan's identity had issues or he had some kind of enemy.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the Martial Temple would protect him.</p><p></p><p>But naturally, it was better if there were no such troublesome hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do next?" the Third Supreme Elder asked.</p><p></p><p>As a place for inheriting martial arts, the Martial Temple already had a complete set of processes for cultivating disciples.</p><p></p><p>When to do what, which cultivation methods to practice, and so on were all guided in detail.</p><p></p><p>But based on the talent Lin Yuan had displayed, the supreme elders felt that following those past sets of disciple cultivation processes would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>"How about this," the Great Supreme Elder suddenly spoke. "We few old fellows will personally teach him. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the other supreme elders readily agreed. "I also want to see what's different about a martial arts prodigy who can make the seven deity statues simultaneously emit twelve-tenths of their radiance."</p><p></p><p>In a top-grade cave abode, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation environment here is very suitable for martial arts cultivators," Lin Yuan thought with a smile after carefully sensing it for a while.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao City was not built on a spiritual vein, so spiritual energy was not very abundant, but it had a kind of blood energy that was extremely nourishing for martial arts cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Especially in this cave abode, if Lin Yuan were to absorb it freely, let alone recovering to the Eighth Stage, reaching the Seventh Stage would be a breeze, definitely not taking more than fifty years.</p><p></p><p>"Choosing to directly descend my consciousness into the Spirit Realm seems to have been the right decision," Lin Yuan thought to himself. "The cultivation environment of this world far surpasses that of the Midlands of the Lower Realm."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan could have also first descended his consciousness into the Midlands of the Lower Realm, then taken over the body of "Jun Wuji" to directly obtain Seventh Stage strength before ascending to the Upper Realm.</p><p></p><p>But this approach also had significant drawbacks. Namely, the Seventh Stage realm that Jun Wuji's body had established was a flawed Seventh Stage realm, far inferior to the perfect Seventh Stage that Lin Yuan had perfected in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, ascending to the Spirit Realm via the Ascension Platform would ultimately involve risks, and breaking through space to "smuggle" directly into the Spirit Realm from the void would also involve risks.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, directly descending his consciousness into the Spirit Realm was still the best choice. Although he would start at a lower level, with the assistance of the Martial Temple, recovering to Eighth Stage strength wouldn't take long.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the Great Supreme Elder took the initiative to visit Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel?" the Great Supreme Elder asked gently.</p><p></p><p>Other disciples who entered the Martial Temple, even core disciples, had to stay in the Martial Academy and undergo layer upon layer of trials.</p><p></p><p>But naturally, Lin Yuan didn't need to do those things. Even his teachers were the supreme elders personally.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Great Supreme Elder had come, it was with the intention of personally instructing Lin Yuan, to give him a complete impression of the martial arts cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. The environment here was indeed quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Have you read those scriptures?" The Great Supreme Elder's gaze swept over, glancing at the nearby bookshelf which held numerous jade slips recording a large amount of information related to martial arts.</p><p></p><p>One only needed to hold the jade slip to their forehead to browse and read.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The information in those jade slips helped Lin Yuan become roughly familiar with the current state of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Then tell me, what insights have you gained?" the Great Supreme Elder asked, deliberately testing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The elaboration on martial arts is somewhat one-sided," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? One-sided?" The Great Supreme Elder became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts should give birth to all things and bring all things to completion. That is the true martial way," Lin Yuan calmly stated.</p><p></p><p>"Give birth to all things and bring all things to completion?" The Great Supreme Elder's eyes flickered with unusual brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Among the various Daos in the Spirit Realm, apart from the lofty Immortal Dao, who dared to comment on their own Dao in such a way?</p><p></p><p>"What does it mean to 'give birth to all things'?" the Great Supreme Elder continued to inquire.</p><p></p><p>"Time, space, yin and yang, the five elements," Lin Yuan said in an even, unhurried pace.</p><p></p><p>More than an hour later, the Great Supreme Elder walked out of the cave abode, looking a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? How was the teaching?" "What about his understanding of martial arts?" The other supreme elders were quite curious.</p><p></p><p>"His understanding of martial arts?" The Great Supreme Elder looked around at the other supreme elders and finally said in a strange tone, "He was born for the martial way."</p>

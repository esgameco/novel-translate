        <h1>Chapter 635</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That scorching sun ancient country, on the grounds of extreme cold and northern darkness taking action, wants to obtain the 'Immeasurable Eye' for a ten-billion-year control, or a hundred catties of Immeasurable Crystals."</p><p></p><p>On the throne, the emperor of the Dark Yin ancient country spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Immeasurable Eye is a top-grade treasure land of the Dark Yin ancient country, which will produce the rare 'Immeasurable Crystals' of around ten catties every billion years.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun ancient country directly proposed to obtain the control of the top-grade treasure land 'Immeasurable Eye' for ten billion years, which is the same as obtaining a hundred catties of Immeasurable Crystals.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun ancient country is too much, the Immeasurable Eye is a top-grade treasure land, the Extreme Cold and Northern Darkness have only infiltrated that Black Jade's Nest once, not to mention they didn't succeed, even if they did, they could only obtain the output of the Black Jade's Nest once. Now the Scorching Sun ancient country wants the 'Immeasurable Eye' ten times the output of the rare treasures?"</p><p></p><p>A celestial master wearing magnificent robes spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"It is too much."</p><p></p><p>The emperor of the Dark Yin ancient country nodded: "But in this matter, we are partly at fault."</p><p></p><p>Most of the celestial masters in the venue did not speak after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The 'Immeasurable Eye' for a ten-billion-year control may sound like a huge price, but in reality, ten billion years of time is nothing to the existence at the celestial master level.</p><p></p><p>It's not like they are completely handing over the top-grade treasure land 'Immeasurable Eye' to the Scorching Sun ancient country.</p><p></p><p>"Since you all have no objections, then I will agree to it."</p><p></p><p>The emperor of the Dark Yin ancient country swept his gaze and spoke.</p><p></p><p>The many celestial masters remained silent and did not refute.</p><p></p><p>"As for you two?"</p><p></p><p>The emperor of the Dark Yin ancient country looked at the Extreme Cold celestial master and the Northern Darkness celestial master: "You will be punished to guard the Gloomy Prison for ten billion years."</p><p></p><p>The Gloomy Prison connects to a dark world, where countless dark creatures live.</p><p></p><p>Guarding such a place is not an easy task, as the dark creatures, although not strong, are troublesome and their numbers are limitless, requiring celestial master-level experts to constantly suppress them.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the Dark Yin ancient country would bestow more merits to the celestial masters guarding the Gloomy Prison, but the Extreme Cold celestial master and the Northern Darkness celestial master were being punished for their own mistakes, so naturally, there would be no rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Although the Extreme Cold celestial master and the Northern Darkness celestial master were unwilling in their hearts, they still responded immediately.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Galaxy celestial master, he didn't even consider it."</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold celestial master was furious in his heart. He and the Northern Darkness had tried to negotiate with the Galaxy celestial master, but the other party's attitude was too arrogant, directly demanding the "Dark Yin Classics".</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold celestial master refused, and the Galaxy celestial master simply stopped negotiating, not even considering their proposal.</p><p></p><p>If the Galaxy celestial master had been able to reach a deal with them, the two celestial masters would not have received such a punishment.</p><p></p><p>In Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis was in seclusion cultivation when he suddenly opened his eyes, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>"On the border between the Scorching Sun ancient country and the Dark Yin ancient country, in the top-grade treasure land Black Jade's Nest, the Extreme Cold celestial master and the Northern Darkness celestial master infiltrated it, but were ultimately left behind by the Galaxy Guardian."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis looked at the intelligence information he had just obtained. The existence at the grand celestial master level basically had connections with each other and would share intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Guardian?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis was a bit confused as he continued to look down: "The Galaxy Guardian, is the core imperial clan of the Scorching Sun ancient country. He recently appeared in Qingfan City, then went to the capital of the Scorching Sun ancient country, breaking through the shackles of the imperial clan celestial masters, reaching the celestial master realm through his bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis became more and more astonished. He had already anticipated that Lin Yuan would shine brightly after going to the capital, but he didn't expect it to happen so quickly. How long has it been?</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the two ancient celestial masters of the Dark Yin ancient country? Breaking through the shackles of the ancestral bloodline? "The Galaxy, this intelligence?" Qingfan Marquis immediately went to the Fanzhen Institute.</p><p></p><p>There was a manifestation of Lin Yuan left behind.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this is what the emperor has released to the public," Lin Yuan casually said after glancing at it.</p><p></p><p>His breaking through the shackles of the ancestral bloodline has two main impacts on the Scorching Sun ancient country.</p><p></p><p>One is that in due time, a powerful figure surpassing the peak celestial masters will be born in the Scorching Sun ancient country.</p><p></p><p>The other is that the imperial clan, which was the first to break through the shackles of the ancestral bloodline, will cause a huge shock to the other five ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>The latter significance is even greater than the former.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the emperor of the Scorching Sun ancient country naturally wanted to publicize it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he obtained Lin Yuan's permission before the announcement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he didn't publicize it, it wouldn't have much meaning, as the Dark Yin ancient country already knew about it. Rather than letting the Dark Yin ancient country secretly pass on and distort certain aspects, it's better for the Scorching Sun ancient country to openly spread the news.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Grand Celestial, now should be the Galaxy Celestial Master."</p><p></p><p>The Red Leaf Grand Celestial and many other grand celestials also received this intelligence, their expressions filled with deep emotion.</p><p></p><p>Many grand celestials had once fought alongside Lin Yuan on the two domain battlefields, but in the blink of an eye, the Galaxy Grand Celestial had already become the Galaxy Celestial Master.</p><p></p><p>And he achieved this by breaking through the ancestral bloodline, a feat unprecedented in history.</p><p></p><p>Great Spirit Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King sat cross-legged in a bamboo forest.</p><p></p><p>The war between the Purple Dream Domain and the Qingfan Domain ultimately ended in his defeat.</p><p></p><p>As the instigator of the war, the Spiritual Might King naturally received punishment, being confined in this bamboo forest for a billion years without being allowed to leave.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Celestial Master?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Might King looked at the intelligence in front of him, somewhat lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>In that war, he originally had the upper hand, but Lin Yuan had repeatedly ruined his plans.</p><p></p><p>First, he destroyed the Sovereign Realm expert he had sent to infiltrate the Qingfan Domain, shattering his plan to replicate the Qingfan City formation through the Myriad Array Crystals at the lowest cost.</p><p></p><p>Later, on the direct battlefield, Lin Yuan single-handedly turned the tide, causing the Spiritual Might King's defeat.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power was able to completely turn the situation around.</p><p></p><p>"My fate is not in my own hands."</p><p></p><p>King Lingwei sighed inwardly. Originally, he still felt that it was his own planning that was the problem. If he had invited one more supreme core royal clan, perhaps he could have held back Lin Yuan. But now it seems that this Silver River was able to break through the shackles of the Heavenly Venerable bloodline in such a short time, and he must have been hiding his true strength on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even if King Lingwei had prepared in every way, he still ended up failing in the end.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral bloodline at the Heavenly Venerable level?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to King Lingwei, the Extreme Core Royal Clan Lingsheng Wang's eyes lit up. "So the bloodline of our royal clan can actually be cultivated to the Heavenly Venerable level?"</p><p></p><p>The more one grows to the limit, the more one can feel the unseen shackles of the ancestral bloodline. Breaking through this shackle is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even many of the core royal clans see no hope, and instead turn to comprehend the Dao rules, thereby awakening the second level of the Chaotic Evolution Power, and achieving Heavenly Venerable status through this path.</p><p></p><p>Among the six ancient nations, no royal clan has given birth to a Heavenly Venerable level expert, referring to the ancestral bloodline at the Heavenly Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>"To lose to someone at the Heavenly Venerable ancestral bloodline level is not unfair."</p><p></p><p>Lingsheng Wang was full of vigor. In terms of the path, Lin Yuan's exploration of the ancestral bloodline was ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, Lingsheng Wang was convinced.</p><p></p><p>"Since that Silver River can cultivate the ancestral bloodline to the Heavenly Venerable level, then I can too."</p><p></p><p>Lingsheng Wang took a deep breath and began to meditate and cultivate his bloodline again.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, the treasury.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was carefully examining the many precious legacy information recorded in the treasury.</p><p></p><p>With a hundred million merit points in hand, Lin Yuan's vision had risen. He would not pay much attention to precious legacy inheritances worth less than a hundred thousand merit points.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Diagram?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at one of the legacies.</p><p></p><p>Named the "Blazing Sun Diagram", it was a painting created by a supreme Heavenly Venerable expert of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, who had possessed the Blazing Sun Ancestor and painted it from the Ancestor's perspective.</p><p></p><p>It contained the many insights and gains of this supreme Heavenly Venerable expert after borrowing the Ancestor's perspective.</p><p></p><p>"It's of no use to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. For other Heavenly Venerable experts, even supreme Heavenly Venerable experts, this Blazing Sun Diagram would have great reference and guidance value.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was the insights and experiences of an expert of the same level who had possessed the Ancestor. Even though he had also possessed the Ancestor, there was still a need to refer to it.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Ancestor level is too high. Before possessing the Ancestor, studying and comprehending such Blazing Sun Diagrams could have a "preventive" effect.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, he had no need for this. </p><p></p><p>Even if a Twelfth Realm life form possessed a Thirteenth Realm life form, what they see, feel, and know may not necessarily be correct. Viewing such Blazing Sun Diagrams would not be of much significance to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With this time and energy, it would be better to directly possess the Ancestor. At least he would not be "interfered with" or "misled".</p><p></p><p>And this kind of Blazing Sun Diagram is too expensive, with a single one costing several million to tens of millions of merit points, which Lin Yuan cannot afford at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Blazing Sun, Mysterious Yin, Chaos' legacy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at another legacy. This legacy was established by an ancient supreme Heavenly Venerable expert of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, who had already reached the third level on the path of Chaotic Evolution, and had walked the path of Blazing Sun Chaos.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the third level of the Blazing Sun Chaos path, this supreme Heavenly Venerable expert began to try to fuse the Mysterious Yin path, wanting to further explore the path of Chaotic Mysterious Yin, combining the two.</p><p></p><p>"This legacy is somewhat similar to my own path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred. The Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji he cultivated corresponded to the Blazing Sun Chaos Mysterious Yin. Although they were not exactly the same, they belonged to the same category. If he were to comprehend this legacy, it would not only benefit the evolution of his Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji, but also provide very high guidance for his future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The path of Chaotic Evolution Power is also divided into three levels, and it becomes more and more difficult as one progresses.</p><p></p><p>With a reference for the future path, Lin Yuan's cultivation would also be easier, and most importantly, he would not take the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>After all, previous experts have already tried it.</p><p></p><p>"One million eight hundred thousand merit points?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the merit points required for this legacy, his brow slightly furrowing.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he only had a little over a hundred thousand merit points, and that extra part was accumulated over the past period of time.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to accumulate another eight hundred thousand merit points." Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although he was eager to comprehend this legacy, without enough merit points, he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River." At this moment, the voice of the Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>As the Emperor, even though Lin Yuan was in the treasury space, he could still be contacted.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation has agreed to let go of the first-class land 'Boundless Eye' for ten billion years."</p><p></p><p>"My Blazing Sun Ancient Nation will probably obtain about a hundred jin of Boundless Crystals from this, which should be worth another million merit points for you."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's voice was gentle, and he transferred the million merit points over.</p><p></p><p>"A million merit points?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at his merit point count, finding that it had changed from just over a hundred thousand to a little over two hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Just right."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with his merit points, he could completely exchange for the legacy of "Blazing Sun, Mysterious Yin, Chaos".</p><p></p><p>"Exchange."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately made the mental request.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A flood of information immediately surged into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

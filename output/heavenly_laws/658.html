        <h1>Chapter 658</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A Gigantic Core Pillar?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the second Gigantic Core Pillar!"</p><p></p><p>Many Transcendent Supremes immediately rushed towards the source of the strange fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>When the first Gigantic Core Pillar emerged, no one was too eager to fight to the death with the Great Fugu Ancient Kingdom, after all, there were still two more Gigantic Core Pillars yet to emerge.</p><p></p><p>They could just wait a little longer.</p><p></p><p>But this second Gigantic Core Pillar... no Transcendent Supreme was willing to easily give it up, even though the first Gigantic Core Pillar had fallen into the hands of the Milky Way Supreme, the Fugu Supreme would certainly make another move to contend for the second Gigantic Core Pillar. Some top-tier Transcendent Supremes also planned to try their hand at fighting for it.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, which had long since given up on the contest, didn't mind making a move. If this Gigantic Core Pillar fell into their hands, they could offer an even higher price to the Liyang Ancient Kingdom and the Great Fugu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"This Gigantic Core Pillar must be mine, the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom's." A towering figure tore through space and rushed over quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way, the second Gigantic Core Pillar has emerged."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Supreme looked at Lin Yuan and spoke quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, "I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In less than a tenth of a breath, several figures had appeared next to the newly emerged majestic pillar.</p><p></p><p>First was the Fugu Supreme, followed by Lin Yuan, and finally a towering figure.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I arrive first?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Fugu Supreme. The location where this Gigantic Core Pillar emerged was quite a distance from the first Gigantic Core Pillar. So his speed was slightly slower than the Fugu Supreme's. The other party was closer to this Gigantic Core Pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Supreme, you've already obtained one Gigantic Core Pillar, are you still planning to snatch this one?" The Fugu Supreme smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure in the distance was also gazing at these two supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>If he could seize this Gigantic Core Pillar, that would certainly be better.</p><p></p><p>"Mancun, I suggest you go to the first Gigantic Core Pillar and wait there."</p><p></p><p>The Fugu Supreme suddenly turned his head and looked at the towering figure beside him.</p><p></p><p>This towering figure was the leading top-tier Transcendent Supreme of the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom. At this moment, his aura was powerful, permeating through space, and he seemed to have the tendency to confront the two supreme beings, obviously having activated the ancient kingdom's trump card.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the first Gigantic Core Pillar and wait there?"</p><p></p><p>Mancun Supreme's expression changed slightly as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Fugu Supreme's intention was easy to understand. If the Fugu Supreme and the Milky Way Supreme were to clash, Mancun could seize the first Gigantic Core Pillar while the Milky Way Supreme was being constrained by the Fugu Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Fugu Supreme.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he vaguely sensed that the auras of several top-tier Transcendent Supremes were approaching the Gigantic Core Pillar he had refined.</p><p></p><p>If he were to be constrained here, the Gigantic Core Pillar he had refined would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>When the first Gigantic Core Pillar emerged, why did the Crimson Flame Supreme voluntarily give up and let the Fugu Supreme have that Gigantic Core Pillar?</p><p></p><p>It was because with the Fugu Supreme occupying one Gigantic Core Pillar, he basically didn't have the ability to continue occupying the second one.</p><p></p><p>The Fugu Supreme could indeed deploy clones, but the strength of the clones was far inferior to the true body, and they would be equally difficult to defend.</p><p></p><p>As for bringing multiple main combat physical bodies? Not to mention how difficult it is to cultivate main combat physical bodies, even if he brought two or three main combat physical bodies, it would be difficult to cope with this situation.</p><p></p><p>Main combat physical bodies, clones, or even the true body itself, they all share the same consciousness and will. In this case, the strength that can be maintained by the mind and will at the same time is limited. If one side occupies too much of the mental power, the strength of the other side will inevitably be weakened.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's strength and trump cards, he could easily defend two Gigantic Core Pillars.</p><p></p><p>That is to re-condense the Yin and Yang Great Spirits within the treasure land, and fuse them into the Supreme Ultimate Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Ultimate Spirit is different from clones or main combat physical bodies, it will not occupy Lin Yuan's extra mental power, which means the Supreme Ultimate Spirit and the true body can exert their maximum combat power at the same time.</p><p></p><p>However, the Supreme Ultimate Spirit is Lin Yuan's trump card. Even if he uses it to occupy the second Gigantic Core Pillar, he still cannot make the number of core pillars he has refined exceed that of the Great Fugu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Using the Supreme Ultimate Spirit prematurely would make the Transcendent Supremes of the various ancient kingdoms more vigilant and restrict Lin Yuan's future planning.</p><p></p><p>It's not very meaningful.</p><p></p><p>And if the Supreme Ultimate Spirit is deployed, by the time the third Gigantic Core Pillar emerges, it will still be unable to prevent the Fugu Supreme from occupying and refining it.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's plan, if he has not yet broken through by the end of the contest for the treasure land, he will then condense the Supreme Ultimate Spirit and quickly occupy and refine more core pillars in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>The true body and the Supreme Ultimate Spirit, equivalent to the combat power of two supreme beings, striking at the last moment when the Fugu Supreme has no time to react or respond, have a high chance of ultimately seizing the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>If he still cannot seize the treasure land, Lin Yuan will then consider the conditions of the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom and the Daliang Ancient Kingdom, first getting a hold of the treasure land and then deciding.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why Lin Yuan has not directly rejected the offers from the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom and the Daliang Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Good idea."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Fugu Supreme and shook his head slightly, "But you make me feel disgusted, so..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have decided to cede this precious land to the Barbarian Ancient Country," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River said.</p><p></p><p>"You, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River?" The Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Yin-Yang Chaos Taiji Diagram expanded infinitely, enveloping the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, thank you, Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River!" The Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun was overjoyed, knowing that the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River planned to hold back the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void, giving him time to refine the massive core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh. Without any obstruction, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun quickly finished refining the massive core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lin Yuan also withdrew the Yin-Yang Chaos Taiji Diagram, glancing at the gloomy-faced Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void.</p><p></p><p>"Since this massive core celestial pillar now has an owner, I shall take my leave." Lin Yuan's figure disappeared, returning to the massive core celestial pillar he had refined.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereigns were approaching, such as the Heavenly Sovereign of the Scarlet Flame and the Heavenly Sovereign of the Vast Blaze, on high alert.</p><p></p><p>It was not until Lin Yuan's figure appeared again that the supreme Heavenly Sovereigns of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you did the right thing," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Scarlet Flame said, having also received the latest intelligence about the second massive core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>The threat posed by the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void to Lin Yuan was indeed deadly, but Lin Yuan was not without any choices. By actively holding back the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void, allowing the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun to benefit, he had also vented his anger.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River, no matter who this precious land belongs to, I'll treat you to a drink when we return," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun's voice transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lin Yuan nodded. "Can you hold off the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun said, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>In front of the second massive core celestial pillar, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void stared at the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun standing beside the pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void, if you attack me with full force, aren't you afraid that the Great Void Ancient Country will have its other refined core celestial pillars snatched away?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun, a pulsating heart appeared, and a powerful force gradually spread, guarding the space around the massive core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void could only turn and leave.</p><p></p><p>If he were to use his full strength here, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River from the Scorching Sun Ancient Country would most likely choose to plunder the core celestial pillars refined by the Great Void Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The core celestial pillars occupied by the Great Void Ancient Country already exceeded those of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country. Normally, they had their own guardians, so the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River had no opportunity to seize them.</p><p></p><p>But if he were to be held back here, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River would certainly not just stand by and watch. In such a case, not to mention whether he could defeat the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun, who had already refined the massive core celestial pillar, the core celestial pillars he had previously refined would certainly have a portion fall into the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River's hands.</p><p></p><p>Such a losing proposition, even if the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void was extremely angered in his heart, he would not choose to do it.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void leave, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun felt a slight sense of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Barbarian Kun," other supreme Heavenly Sovereigns of the Barbarian Ancient Country approached, their faces bearing smiles.</p><p></p><p>"This time, we were able to seize this massive core celestial pillar all thanks to the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River holding back the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void and fighting him, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun would not have had much confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River could have chosen to retreat back to the massive core celestial pillar he had refined, but he chose to hold back the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void, and for this, the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun was very grateful.</p><p></p><p>"If this time, my Barbarian Ancient Country had no hope of seizing this precious land, I would have traded all the core celestial pillars to the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River," the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun thought to himself, purely because of the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River's help this time, as well as his dislike for the Great Void Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the news that the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun of the Thunder Ancient Country had refined the second massive core celestial pillar quickly spread among the many supreme Heavenly Sovereigns in the precious land.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun refined the second massive core celestial pillar?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I know the inside story. It was the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River who deliberately held back the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void, allowing the Heavenly Sovereign of the Barbarian Kun to refine it."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River afraid of completely offending the Great Void Ancient Country?"</p><p></p><p>"So what if he offends them? With the Heavenly Sovereign of the Silver River's strength, he's not afraid of the Great Void Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, after all, he is the strongest Heavenly Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The various supreme Heavenly Sovereigns conversed with each other, and many top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereigns wanted to go and compete for the massive core celestial pillar, but by the time they arrived, it had already been completed.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Six hundred years later, the third massive core celestial pillar emerged, and the Heavenly Sovereign of the Hidden Void left in anger, successfully seizing the last massive core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the three massive core celestial pillars in the precious land were owned by the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, the Barbarian Ancient Country, and the Great Void Ancient Country, respectively.</p><p></p><p>With the emergence of the three massive core celestial pillars, the atmosphere among the six ancient countries in the precious land began to become delicate. The closer they approached the final stage of the competition for the precious land, the more tense the atmosphere became, and the most intense battles could erupt at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Chaos Void, on the Silver Chaos Continent, Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position, contemplating the Dao of the Yin-Yang Chaos Taiji.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Suddenly, Lin Yuan opened his eyes, feeling his aura gradually becoming complete and at its peak.</p><p></p><p>"I have already grown to the limit of the Sovereign Realm in all aspects." Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful, and then he let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to step into the Chaos Realm."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

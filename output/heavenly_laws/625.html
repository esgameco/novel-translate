        <h1>Chapter 625</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed.</p><p></p><p>In the dim, hazy light, a cauldron about the size of a palm could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>From the spirit of the tomb, he learned that the Mysterious Emperor had obtained a precious treasure from the dimensional gap, and thus decided to rush into the 13th Realm ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Lin Yuan thought that this precious treasure might be close to the 13th Realm in value.</p><p></p><p>But just now, the Mysterious Emperor's implication was that he was worried that if he delayed too long, the information about the precious treasure would leak out, attracting the attention of the 13th Realm's time beings.</p><p></p><p>A treasure that merely approached the 13th Realm level would not be able to attract the attention of the time beings.</p><p></p><p>To attract the attention of the time beings, it must be... "Ah, this precious treasure is a 13th Realm level weapon," the burly and mighty man said.</p><p></p><p>"A 13th Realm level weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath, and the small cauldron in the Mysterious Emperor's hazy light suddenly became unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"That dimensional gap... should be the battlefield where two 13th Realm experts fought. This precious treasure was probably left behind by one of them. I can sense that the owner of this treasure is still alive, but has simply forgotten to retrieve it."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had left behind an ordinary Saint Realm treasure when fighting with an expert of the same level, and had temporarily forgotten about it.</p><p></p><p>The 13th Realm beings are also called time beings, and their concept of time is different from the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, while a billion universes have passed for the 12th Realm, for the 13th Realm time beings, it may have only been a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 13th Realm being may have forgotten about this weapon, but if this weapon actively calls out to the 13th Realm being, reminding them, then there is a high chance that it will be retrieved.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the Mysterious Emperor immediately rushed into the 13th Realm, using the power of time loops to suppress this treasure.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can he prevent this precious treasure from calling out to its owner.</p><p></p><p>As for what happens afterwards if this weapon's owner finds out... If the Mysterious Emperor crosses into the 13th Realm, it won't be a big deal. But if he fails to cross over, this precious treasure will be trapped in the time loop, and the 13th Realm time being would have to break the time loop to help the Mysterious Emperor escape.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for a 13th Realm time being, breaking the time loop would require a great price.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Mysterious Emperor's suppression of this 13th Realm weapon essentially has no hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"By taking this precious treasure into the time loop, I can slightly break the restrictions within the time loop, raising my starting point a little," the Mysterious Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>"Slightly break the restrictions within the time loop?" Lin Yuan's gaze was filled with awe. No wonder the Mysterious Emperor was so determined to rush into the 13th Realm ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Mysterious Emperor's ability to easily break free from the time loop was likely aided by the power of this precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take it." The Mysterious Emperor looked at Lin Yuan and lightly tossed the hazy light in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instinctively caught it, and the small cauldron covered in the hazy light fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>"It's so light."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that it had no weight at all, as if he was holding a ball of air.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have reinforced and sealed this precious treasure with the power of the time loop for over 30 million universes. Even if it leaves the time loop world, the temporal force of the external seal will last for a hundred universes."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor looked at Lin Yuan: "In other words, within a hundred universes, this precious treasure will not actively call out to its owner. After that, I can't guarantee it."</p><p></p><p>"By then, if you have reached the Chaotic Realm Perfection, you should try to rush into the 13th Realm. If you haven't reached the Chaotic Realm Perfection yet..."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor thought for a moment, "But with your talent and aptitude, you should have a chance to reach the Chaotic Realm Perfection within a hundred universes."</p><p></p><p>"I will do my best," Lin Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Also, if you ever encounter danger and are about to completely perish, or if this precious treasure is about to be taken away, you can choose to activate it," the Mysterious Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>"This is a 13th Realm weapon, and with your current strength, even if you exert your full power, you won't be able to unleash much of its power. But even a sliver of its power would be enough to easily destroy any Chaotic Realm Perfection expert."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor said, "However, doing so would inevitably attract the attention of the treasure's owner, and most likely it would be taken away in the end."</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>So unless it was an absolute last resort, the Mysterious Emperor did not recommend that Lin Yuan do this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it really came to that desperate situation, and he didn't activate the treasure, it would be taken away by other experts anyway, so Lin Yuan would naturally choose to activate it without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from that, you can try to comprehend this precious treasure. This would be much more useful than comprehending the temporal bloodlines of those mediocre Phenomenon Beings," the Mysterious Emperor said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A 13th Realm weapon was forged by a 13th Realm being themselves, and the temporal mysteries contained within it were far beyond the capabilities of those half-baked Phenomenon Beings' bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any other questions?"</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor looked at Lin Yuan and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor had explained everything clearly enough.</p><p></p><p>Through this invincible Saint's experiences, Lin Yuan had gained a deeper understanding of time loops.</p><p></p><p>Time loops not only bring challenges that one has never encountered before, but also face one's deepest weaknesses and obsessions within.</p><p></p><p>"This Mysterious Yellow Universe was opened by me. If I perish completely, it will be destroyed along with me, and I cannot leave it for you."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor waved his right hand, and many precious treasures and rarities gathered in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But I have already brought you all these rare and precious treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty," Lin Yuan said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the sudden arrival of the Great Saint of Chaos and the Great Saint of Jade Unicorn, the many incarnations of Lin Yuan that had been dispatched to scour the various corners of the universe had not yet completed their task when they were forced to return.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Mysterious Emperor had taken the initiative, it had saved Lin Yuan a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me. After all, you are my disciple, so it's better to have these things in your possession than to leave them for outsiders."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor smiled slightly, then stood up. "Since you no longer have any doubts, I should go out and take a look around."</p><p></p><p>"Go out and take a look around?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"To visit an old friend, and also to prepare some more things for you."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor stepped out and disappeared from Lin Yuan's sight.</p><p></p><p>"An old friend?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression grew solemn. For the Mysterious Emperor to refer to someone as an old friend, it must be an ancient and peerless Great Saint, with an experience of at least thirty million universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious-Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The entire chaotic void suddenly erupted in thunderous noise, the Dao laws retreating, and the space-time beginning to roll back. The towering and majestic man took another step, and his figure vanished.</p><p></p><p>The Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>This was a mysterious place in the chaotic void, not located in any specific time. Even the most peerless Great Saints would find it difficult to forcibly enter, ranking alongside other mysterious places like the Nine Heavenly Thunder Pools and the Myriad Tribulation Source Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Waves splashed as the Sea of Life surged, permeated with a powerful life force, and occasionally falling life spirit stones could be seen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The space-time of this mysterious place was torn open, and a towering and majestic man walked in.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The entire Sea of Life was whipped into turbulent waves, an invisible and terrifying pressure bearing down on the towering and majestic man.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as it came into contact with him, all the pressure dissipated and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Emperor, what are you doing here?" a cold voice came from the depths of the Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>"Before I perish, I've come to ask you for a Life Source Stone," the towering and majestic man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Life Source Stone? You already stole one from here before, and now you want another one?" the voice from the depths sounded angry.</p><p></p><p>Over thirty million universal cycles ago, the Mysterious Emperor had come here to steal a Life Source Stone in order to replicate the Sea of Life and create the Life Source Star for the Mysterious-Yellow Universe. This had led to there being no more falling Life Spirit Stones for countless universal cycles afterwards.</p><p></p><p>The Life Source Stone was infinitely more precious than the Life Spirit Stones, being the very foundation distilled from the countless universal cycles of the Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I need another one," the towering and majestic man nodded. "Will you give it to me?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Sea of Life fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"You know I don't have much time left," the towering and majestic man said.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost," the Sea of Life surged with turbulent waves, and a crystal stone the size of a fist shot out from the depths.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha." </p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man laughed heartily and turned to leave the Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>In front of an ancient mine.</p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Before I die, could you give me some crystal ore?" the towering and majestic man spoke, his voice echoing throughout the ancient mine.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Emperor, you know how precious the crystal ore is," a cold voice came from the depths of the mine.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, before I die, let me see if I can topple this entire mine." The towering and majestic man said, "This is something I've wanted to do for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Moments later.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the ancient mine, a beam of crystal light shot out.</p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man took the crystal light and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Great Saint Mysterious Emperor from over thirty million universal cycles ago entered many of the mysterious places in the chaotic void, inciting the wrath of the special existences within.</p><p></p><p>One peerless Great Saint after another gazed at each other from afar, for these ancient mysterious places had existed for such an unimaginably long time, on par with special existences like the All-Seeing Eye, and even the invincible Great Saints of history would not dare to provoke them too aggressively.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the aura of the Great Saint Mysterious Emperor disappeared into the chaotic void, and no one knew where this supreme expert had gone, as all traces of his presence had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In a remote corner of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Here, the chaotic qi was sparse, a desolate void.</p><p></p><p>A heaven-born universe exterior.</p><p></p><p>Silently and without a sound, a towering and majestic figure appeared - the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor quietly looked at the distant universe, his gaze penetrating into the secret realm that was half-fused with the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>This secret realm was similar to the Mysterious-Yellow Secret Realm, but its fusion with the universe's origin was even more complete, making it almost impossible to enter.</p><p></p><p>Inside the secret realm, it was empty and desolate.</p><p></p><p>There were no rare treasures that were hard to come by in thousands of universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>Nor were there any precious rarities that numerous Great Saints would fight to the death for.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention any shocking weapons or armaments at the Great Saint level.</p><p></p><p>The only thing present in the center of the secret realm was a solitary tomb, surrounded by some blooming pink peach blossoms.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Sister."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor, separated by the universe, gazed at the tomb, a rare tenderness appearing on his face as he murmured, "Finally, we can rest together."</p><p></p><p>In the end, the figure of the Great Saint Mysterious Emperor became blurred and ethereal, the chaotic qi drifting past and turning into a shower of light that disappeared into the distant universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

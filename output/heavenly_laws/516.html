        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Deep in Lin Yuan's mind, a "brand new" Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds stood tall.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before he reached the twelfth level, the size of this Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds was no different now. </p><p></p><p>However, it was much more enriched in details, with ancient and mottled textures emerging, and an aura of endless mystery transcending the timeline permeating it.</p><p></p><p>"Now this Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds is probably more similar to the true Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds," Lin Yuan thought to himself, ripples stirring in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds gave him a feeling of transcending everything and being above all.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this change was that Lin Yuan's life level was too low before, and the projection of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds he carried was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the breakthrough to the twelfth level, his life level had also transformed, able to bear more information about the true Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds is not within the timeline. I'm afraid those thirteenth-level time beings, even if they peer into the past and future timelines, won't be able to discover it," Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth-level time beings already possessed some characteristics of perfect time beings and could observe many timelines.</p><p></p><p>For thirteenth-level time beings, basically no secrets existed. As long as they wanted to know something, they could completely trace back to the source through timelines.</p><p></p><p>But the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds? Transcending all timelines, even if those thirteenth-level time beings came to Lin Yuan's mind and stood before this Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, they wouldn't discover a thing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could see the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds and sense its aura because he was the master of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Lin Yuan, even beings as powerful as time beings couldn't glimpse the slightest trace of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what differences there are from before."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan extended a thread of consciousness, merging it into the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, and began to receive the information inside anew.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't pay much attention to the detailed changes of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, mainly focusing on what new functions and effects the current Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds had.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of information merged into Lin Yuan's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's life essence improved, he could accommodate more of the true Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, and correspondingly, he could naturally utilize more abilities of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>After a long while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the new information from the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, Lin Yuan roughly understood the new abilities of the current Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>First, for the many worlds Lin Yuan had descended into using the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, their coordinate channels were now completely locked.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to descend again in the future, he wouldn't need to pay the cost of realm-breaking source power, he could directly descend.</p><p></p><p>And after descending, he only needed to split off a bit of his mind, without needing to enter with his entire mental will.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, in the future when Lin Yuan traversed and descended into other dimensional worlds, he wouldn't need to arrange his true body and original spirit. The worlds he descended into and traversed would be more like avatars or分身, able to act simultaneously with his true body and original spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. At least in the future, there wouldn't be scenes of interrupted traversals.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the twelfth level, the reason he didn't dare to traverse source worlds was that he was worried that during the traversal, something might happen to his true body and original spirit here, causing him to need to return immediately.</p><p></p><p>The time flow rate between source worlds and the main universe differed too much, and problems could arise if one wasn't careful.</p><p></p><p>"Source worlds"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the thirty-three world coordinates deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's life essence broke through to the twelfth level, more than ten of the thirty-three source world coordinates became clear again.</p><p></p><p>"Realm-breaking source power!"</p><p></p><p>The second ability added to the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds floated in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>That was the use of realm-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan only had a few ways to use realm-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>One was to use it for traversal, and the second was to bring items from the main universe into traversed worlds, or bring items from traversed worlds into the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, realm-breaking source power had many more uses.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Lin Yuan were to traverse source worlds next, if he still chose to descend with his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>During periods of weakness, he could use realm-breaking source power to quickly recover his strength. Theoretically, as long as there was enough realm-breaking source power, he could instantly recover all his strength and replicate this physical body from the main universe into that source world.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Lin Yuan's physical body contained untold amounts of foundation. To replicate it? It wasn't a matter of resources.</p><p></p><p>But the realm-breaking source power of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds could replicate it perfectly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't just Lin Yuan's physical body. Any item, be it weapons and equipment or rare treasures, as long as Lin Yuan fully comprehended and understood them, could be replicated.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of how much realm-breaking source power was needed.</p><p></p><p>"This ability is truly terrifying," Lin Yuan marveled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Replicating all tangible and intangible things in the world? What kind of heaven-defying ability was this?</p><p></p><p>If one day Lin Yuan fully comprehended and understood the chaotic void, could he also use realm-breaking source power to replicate a chaotic void? Besides the replication ability, realm-breaking source power could also be used for escape, attack, and so on, truly an omnipotent source power.</p><p></p><p>"With my current physical body strength, to perfectly replicate it using realm-breaking source power would probably require 2.73 million strands of realm-breaking source power"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly sensed himself, the corner of his mouth twitching slightly.</p><p></p><p>2.73 million strands of realm-breaking source power wasn't actually much. At the rate of accumulating one strand every ninety days, it would only take 700,000 years.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to directly replicate the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The main effect of traversing and descending into other worlds was to comprehend the unique rules of that dimensional world and walk the cultivation path of that dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>If the physical body from the main universe was replicated there, most paths would already be fixed, and the greatest benefit of traversing and descending would be lost.</p><p></p><p>Now the effect and use of realm-breaking source power for Lin Yuan was mainly that his survival ability in the early stages of consciousness descent had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>At least in the early stages of descent, if encountering some irresistible disaster, he could use realm-breaking source power to avoid it and gain enough time to develop.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability, as long as there was enough time, he could easily grow to the limit of his potential.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can directly use the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds in the main universe," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the main universe or the chaotic void, as long as Lin Yuan consumed a certain amount of realm-breaking source power, he could slightly activate the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds and go to any place he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, no being could stop the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"This ability should not be used if it can be avoided," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds was an existence that transcended countless timelines, itself stepping out of the timeline. Therefore, those thirteenth-level time beings couldn't glimpse even a trace of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>But if the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds was activated and used in this chaotic void, even if only for an instant, it would leave slight traces.</p><p></p><p>These traces would exist in the past, and thirteenth-level time beings peering into past timelines might discover them.</p><p></p><p>Then by tracing to the present and future, even if they still couldn't lock onto the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, they could lock onto Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms is not within the timeline, but Lin Yuan still exists. Following the clues, even if Lin Yuan cannot be precisely located, an approximate range can be determined.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there would really be trouble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's dimensional traversal and descent using the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms was completed above the timeline, without causing any impact on this chaotic void. Actively triggering the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms is equivalent to bringing its aura into this chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The two have completely different meanings.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan entered the twelfth level, the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms added many abilities and effects, but mainly the above three. "It's a huge help to me," Lin Yuan was very satisfied in his heart. Now, from any perspective, the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms was much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Especially the more specific use of realm-breaking source power gave Lin Yuan another method at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>"Realm-breaking source power, I've accumulated too little of it." Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Now his total realm-breaking source power was less than 3,000 strands, mainly because Lin Yuan's existence time was too short. If it were like those twelfth-level ultimates in the main universe, existing for hundreds of billions or trillions of years, the realm-breaking source power would definitely be enough.</p><p></p><p>And according to the current abilities of the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms, as long as there is enough realm-breaking source power, many resources can be replicated for Lin Yuan to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, replicating resources with realm-breaking source power? Extremely extravagant. Unless it's a crucial resource, Lin Yuan wouldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization, No. 3 stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Inside a magnificent palace, nine figures sat on nine thrones respectively.</p><p></p><p>They were the nine supreme beings of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the center of the nine thrones, a new throne formed.</p><p></p><p>The tenth throne.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, slowly sitting on the tenth throne.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, you've come."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the face of the Xuanyuan Supreme Being, and the other eight supreme beings all looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had just become a supreme being recently, he was undisputedly the number one supreme being of human civilization. His strength at the peak of the Path-breaking realm was invincible even in this universe.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the throne, feeling somewhat emotional in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had been to the No. 3 stronghold of human civilization before.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, he could only stand below looking up at the nine supreme beings of human civilization. In the eyes of the supreme beings, Lin Yuan was just a little guy at that time.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Lord of the Milky Way is here, let's talk about the main business now," said the Xuanyuan Supreme Being, his expression becoming serious.</p><p></p><p>"Main business?" Lin Yuan realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The main business in the Xuanyuan Supreme Being's words must be something that could affect human civilization. Ordinary matters didn't need supreme beings to discuss; the three goddesses could solve them on their own.</p><p></p><p>"After the Milky Way Star Lord entered the twelfth level, those peak race groups all began to contract their domain and forces," said the Xuanyuan Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>They had naturally noticed the movements of the eleven peak race groups. Human civilization had given birth to an invincible Milky Way Star Lord, so it was only natural for those peak race groups to act this way.</p><p></p><p>"While contracting their respective forces and domains, those twelfth-level beings all contacted me, wanting to coexist peacefully with our human civilization, and are willing to pay a certain price for it," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being continued.</p><p></p><p>"Peaceful coexistence?" The supreme beings laughed.</p><p></p><p>Since they realized they couldn't resist the Milky Way Star Lord, choosing to turn hostility into friendship with human civilization was indeed a good move.</p><p></p><p>"There are also many powerful races, ordinary races, and some ancient gods who want to submit and pledge allegiance to our human civilization," said the Xuanyuan Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's existence was too intimidating. Even peak race groups with twelfth-level beings at the helm were retreating, so naturally, powerful races, ordinary races, and independent ancient gods were also afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, the decision on this matter is up to you," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being said, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Those peak race groups and twelfth-level ultimates were acting this way entirely because of Lin Yuan, so how to deal with them ultimately depended on what Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"As for the powerful races, ordinary races, and ancient gods who want to submit, as long as they don't have too great enmity with our human civilization, let's accept them all," Lin Yuan said after thinking for a while.</p><p></p><p>Although the universe is said to have ten thousand races, in reality, it's the battlefield of the twelve peak race groups. Many powerful races and ordinary races can only go with the flow, without any say.</p><p></p><p>The same goes for the independent ancient gods.</p><p></p><p>"As for those peak race groups? Except for the Calamity Race, if they want to negotiate peace with us humans, no problem. They need to hand over 90% of their twelfth-level weapons and twelfth-star level treasures, and live in the areas designated by our human civilization from now on," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The reason for skipping the Calamity Race was that human civilization didn't have much conflict with them, and there wasn't much hatred. Plus, the two ultimates of the Calamity Race had given a heads-up.</p><p></p><p>Even though the heads-up here didn't have much significance, as those twelfth-level ultimates couldn't do anything to Lin Yuan anyway.</p><p></p><p>But at least they actively showed their goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the origin of the Calamity Race was greater than imagined. That wooden house at the Chaos Realm level, Lin Yuan might not necessarily be able to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over 90% of twelfth-level weapons and twelfth-level treasures?" The Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight supreme beings looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>Too tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>The 90% of twelfth-level weapons and treasures Lin Yuan mentioned included those held by the twelfth-level ultimates.</p><p></p><p>This was practically cutting the flesh off those twelfth-level beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's probably hard for them to agree," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>"They will agree."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll tell them right away," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being nodded and immediately contacted the twelfth-level ultimates of the major peak race groups.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave out the Calamity Race," Lin Yuan added.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being nodded.</p><p></p><p>"We indeed need to be cautious with the Calamity Race," the other supreme beings agreed.</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity Race should come from the chaotic void," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic void?" The supreme beings present were shocked. They had always thought the Calamity Race originated from the previous universe era, but it turned out to be far more than that?</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Lin Yuan nodded. After entering the twelfth level, he could see more secrets, including those of the Calamity Race.</p><p></p><p>"One of my avatars has already reached the Calamity Race," Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Calamity Race's domain.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious, unknowable place.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was only an ordinary wooden cabin, floating in the deep starry sky, seeming to exist eternally.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Invisible power condensed, forming a figure.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan appeared, the door of the wooden cabin opened on its own, and two figures walked out from inside, bowing slightly to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

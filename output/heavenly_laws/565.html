        <h1>Chapter 565</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Look, the blood vessels in my body have all ruptured!" </p><p></p><p>"Especially the capillaries, they are all bleeding!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan said seriously, extending his delicate white arm to show the Ruler of the Flame Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ruler of the Flame Realm's eyelids twitched violently: "Are you mocking me?"</p><p></p><p>At this level, the injury is also a Dao injury, a rule injury.</p><p></p><p>Even if the head is cut off, it's nothing.</p><p></p><p>Capillary rupture, this is called an injury?</p><p></p><p>"No, absolutely not, I swear on my integrity, quickly dissolve the rules, I'm about to die, hurry up and fulfill me!" As always, Qi Yuan was shameless and his acting was explosive.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!" The Ruler of the Flame Realm raged, not dissolving the rules, but attacking Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qi Yuan sighed leisurely, "If you want to die, just commit suicide, why bother me?"</p><p></p><p>The current him was no longer the former him.</p><p></p><p>The Ruler of the Flame Realm had self-destructed 23 times, bringing Qi Yuan a massive amount of experience.</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in the Ruler of the Flame Realm's repeated self-destructions, the fire rules were constantly dissolving, and Qi Yuan, holding the "Fire" representative Relic of Enlightenment, had reached an ultimate level of understanding of the fire rules.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, it would have taken me a day to kill you, but now, with my mastery of all the fire in the world, I only need thirty breaths."</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, a ghostly white flame rose from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of all fires, the origin of all flames, congealed in my hand, burning eternally!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's voice, terrifying and extraordinary flames rose and spread.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Fire!</p><p>Three Realms True Fire!</p><p>Crimson Lotus Hellfire!</p><p>Solar True Fire!</p><p>Yin True Fire!</p><p></p><p>Each type of flame had an extraordinary and mysterious color.</p><p></p><p>Placed in any realm, they could create extraordinary feats, astounding the mysterious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the flames were burning, destroying everything, even able to incinerate the void, the extremes, and dark matter.</p><p></p><p>"Since you don't want to commit suicide, then let me help you!" Qi Yuan's attack was fierce.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible, how could you have mastered the true essence of fire?" The Ruler of the Flame Realm frantically resisted.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was no match for Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qi Yuan had now reached the Realm of All Things, and also grasped the same fire essence, his attacks were devastating.</p><p></p><p>"Ten, nine, eight... three, two, die!"</p><p></p><p>With Qi Yuan's words, the Ruler of the Flame Realm only lasted twenty-nine breaths before perishing.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord, quickly join forces with me, he is not at the Realm of Rules!" The revived Ruler of the Flame Realm roared.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the blocking Void Realm Lord's expression changed repeatedly, and finally said, "I only agreed to help you block his retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The lord in front of him was truly too mysterious and unfathomable, having inexplicably mastered the Ruler of the Flame Realm's rules.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to take action.</p><p></p><p>"I will die!" The Ruler of the Flame Realm roared, "After I die, it will be your turn!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Realm Lord remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Qi Yuan could even enter the Black Sky? That was impossible.</p><p></p><p>So he chose to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he took action and Qi Yuan also grasped the rules he possessed, the loss would outweigh the gain.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Ruler of the Flame Realm roared, desperately screaming, and was slain again.</p><p></p><p>Each time he died, he died faster.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the Primordial Star.</p><p></p><p>A group of Ancestral Gods were shaken: "He actually managed to slay a Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"It was all just an act just now!"</p><p></p><p>"Slaying a Realm Lord, tsk!" </p><p></p><p>These Ancestral Gods could not imagine it.</p><p></p><p>Even a Realm Lord could be slain!</p><p></p><p>With such strength, Qi Yuan guarding the Void Sea, who would dare to invade the Divine Wood Universe!</p><p></p><p>"We won, we won!" The burly bearded man was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder also revealed a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, facing the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth, the Divine Wood Universe could only retreat step by step.</p><p></p><p>"With the Ruler of the Flame Realm's demise, the Black Sky and Black Earth will certainly be wary, and in the remaining tens of thousands of years, we can focus on forging Enlightenment Treasures!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, once our Enlightenment Treasures are numerous, when facing the invasion of the Black Sky and Black Earth, we will no longer be without the means to resist!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods present were all excited.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, they hadn't been as joyful and excited as they were today.</p><p></p><p>"He's dead... the Ruler of the Flame Realm has been completely slain!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi Yuan... has killed a Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Ancestral Gods present were deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Because this time, after the Ruler of the Flame Realm's death, he did not revive again.</p><p></p><p>They witnessed the fall of a Realm Lord with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>That was a Realm Lord! Without the Relic of Enlightenment, there was no way to resist their terrifying and majestic existence.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan!"</p><p>"Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>All the Ancestral Gods cheered, having long since lost their previous arrogance and superiority.</p><p></p><p>For them, Qi Yuan's slaying of the Ruler of the Flame Realm meant that the other Realm Lords of the Black Sky and Black Earth would certainly be wary and would not dare to casually invade the Divine Wood Universe, and the Divine Wood Universe would have a period of peace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a flash of light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yuan, all the Ancestral Gods excitedly said, "Yuan, there's no need to summon Illumination Dao Master, Lord Qi Yuan has already slain the Ruler of the Flame Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Ruler of the Flame Realm was slain by Lord Qi Yuan, it was a refreshing and unrestrained battle!"</p><p></p><p>"We... are about to welcome tens of thousands of years of peace and tranquility!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods present shared their joy and excitement with Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, they could finally hold their heads high and breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also many who noticed that Yuan's expression was not very good.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... has something happened?" Sheng NÃ¼ asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>She hadn't seen such an expression on Yuan's face for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The last time, when the Black Sky and Black Earth invaded, Yuan went to the Void Sea alone, and his expression had never been this serious before.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... what happened?" The burly bearded man couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"The line... is gone," Yuan said with difficulty, his voice filled with despair and endless decline.</p><p></p><p>"Line? What line? The line is gone?!" One of the Ancestral Gods heard this and his expression became dazed, with an expression of disbelief on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible... the line still had tens of thousands of years left?" The burly bearded man murmured, with an unbelieving look.</p><p></p><p>The line being gone, all the Ancestral Gods present understood the meaning of these words.</p><p></p><p>When the line ends, it will be the awakening of the Black Sky, and its formal invasion of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>At that time... in just one day, the Divine Wood Universe will be completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The seven Relics of Enlightenment were not enough to illuminate all the worlds, unable to resist the Black Sky, they needed more and more Relics of Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"How could the good line just be gone, is it a mistake?" The white-browed elder looked at Yuan, hoping for a different answer.</p><p></p><p>Now, their great joy seemed to have been doused with a bucket of cold water, leaving them unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the Void Sea, quickly tell the Realm Lord, the line is gone!" At this moment, one of the Ancestral Gods thought of something.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky's awakening and devouring of the Void Sea would be the slowest, perhaps taking half a day.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, it would be the devouring of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, who was in the Void Sea, was now in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many Ancestral Gods sent messages to Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the next breath, all the Ancestral Gods' expressions became stagnant.</p><p></p><p>Many looked towards the Void Sea, their expressions becoming desperate.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky..."</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky has truly awakened!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>"We weren't prepared at all, even if we want to flee, we can't!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Gods were in despair.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Void Sea, even the eyes of the Void Realm Lord were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Heavens have awakened... How could the Black Heavens awaken prematurely?"</p><p></p><p>On the battleship, countless Devilish Spirits and Solar Deities were filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Their despair was not much less than that of the Ancestral Deities in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The awakening of the Black Heavens meant... everything would be destroyed, including... the Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood in the Void Sea, holding the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity in his hand, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Black Heavens awakened?"</p><p></p><p>He looked deep into the Void Sea, only to see a massive black bubble rapidly expanding and devouring everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>Even the terrifying and solid Void Sea seemed as fragile as tofu before this black bubble.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless miles of space were consumed.</p><p></p><p>Countless colors, specks of light, and lines were devoured.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, stood upon the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>Messages from the Ancestral Deities came through the communication artifact:</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens have awakened, retreat!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe has only one day left.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat?" Qi Yuan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had never fought a battle without preparation, always relying on strength to overcome weakness.</p><p></p><p>But this time, as he stared at the bubble, he felt his own insignificance for the first time.</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow was twitching frantically.</p><p></p><p>The frequency of this twitching was incomparably more violent than when he encountered the Primordial Wasteland, beyond description.</p><p></p><p>But this was his right eyebrow, which meant the utmost danger.</p><p></p><p>Billions of deaths without life.</p><p></p><p>The black bubble devoured relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>"My eyes... cannot perceive any information about the Black Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's eyes had always been able to see hidden information, which was a great asset to him.</p><p></p><p>Many times of crisis, he had relied on his eyes to break through.</p><p></p><p>Even to the point of forging Profound Dao Treasures with his Violet Palace Physique, defying the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>But now, as he looked at the terrifying, gloomy, and chaotic black bubble, he saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>Even when he faced enemies far stronger than himself on the Waning Moon Continent, he had never felt this way.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan stood in place, the speed of the black bubble's consumption was very fast.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in about an hour, it would reach his current position.</p><p></p><p>"Shall I flee?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan murmured.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he still had no useful information about the Black Heavens, the final boss of this game.</p><p></p><p>And his right eyebrow was frantically warning him, telling him that advancing was a dead end.</p><p></p><p>It was a dead lock! An unsolvable dead lock!</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a game player, and I'm even afraid of a game virus... That would be too embarrassing, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"And this is a game I've invested in. If I retreat, won't the game be over?"</p><p></p><p>"Stealing my company, a despicable business war?"</p><p></p><p>"You're asking for it!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze became determined.</p><p></p><p>"A dead end, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see just how dead-ended you can be!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity emanated boundless brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth in the Void Sea were illuminated by the radiant light, as if it were the only light in the dark and deep abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go greet this so-called Black Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Without any further hesitation, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, Qi Yuan resolutely charged towards the massive bubble.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see, just what kind of divine being this Black Heavens was.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Realm Master!" When they saw this, all the Ancestral Deities were horrified.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected Qi Yuan to attack the Black Heavens with the Enlightening Lights of Humanity.</p><p></p><p>In the consensus of everyone, the Black Heavens was invincible, impossible to match.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even the Void Realm Lord of the Zhou Universe, who had once said that if he were to incorporate the Divine Wood Universe into his own cycle, he might ascend further, did not dare to come to the Divine Wood Universe because of the existence of the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the even more majestic and unfathomable Radiant Dao Master had never descended upon the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heavens... was truly undefeatable! Yet, Qi Yuan, holding the Enlightening Lights of Humanity, charged towards the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Can he stop it?" Someone hesitated, but despair was evident in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon's Demise, this is the Dragon's Demise!" The white-browed old man's divination pieces fell, forming the hexagram... Dragon's Demise.</p><p></p><p>This was the most desperate divination he had ever made.</p><p></p><p>And it was the first time this hexagram had appeared in all his years of divination.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The burly and irritable man kicked the hexagram over with a loud thud.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of bullshit Dragon's Demise, the Realm Master is facing the Black Heavens alone, we should be thinking about... what to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Yuan is the Realm Master, holding the Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity... Perhaps he can obstruct the Black Heavens for about seven hours." The Solar Deity from the Celestial Tribe said.</p><p></p><p>When the Black Heavens descended before, the Human King had held a half-piece of the Enlightening Treasure, obstructing the Black Heavens for half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightening Lights of Humanity were Realm Master-level treasures, but they were not ordinary Realm Master-level treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Seven hours..." Yuan's expression remained calm, his voice cold, "That means we have 19 hours left."</p><p></p><p>"19 hours... too short." The other Ancestral Deities bitterly lamented.</p><p></p><p>"We can't waste any more time, we must preserve the seeds of civilization!" The burly and irritable man said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sheng NÃ¼ looked deeply into the Void Sea, her beautiful face filled with sorrowful grief.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>The seven beams of light were exceptionally massive, as if they could illuminate the heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, countless worlds and countless beings seemed to see these seven beams of light appear, and above them was the deep, dark Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The original Black Earth battleship was shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All the Black Earth Clan, including the Void Realm Lord, disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The awakening of the Black Heavens also meant the end of the Black Earth, or rather, the transformation into a new form of existence.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Qi Yuan had already approached the terrifying black bubble.</p><p></p><p>His right eyebrow was twitching frantically, and Qi Yuan also felt an extremely dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"Superstitious nonsense is not to be trusted!"</p><p></p><p>"Cut it down!"</p><p></p><p>All his ultimate techniques, absolute adaptations, and so on were unleashed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Enlightening Lights of Humanity were also playing their due role.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan unleashed the strongest strike of this world.</p><p></p><p>The mere aura that overflowed from this strike was enough to annihilate the stars.</p><p></p><p>However... the black bubble in front of him remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>And... Qi Yuan's vision had changed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Am I... inside the Black Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan scanned the surroundings, the sky.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth here were endless darkness, a blackness that defied description, and even Qi Yuan could not see any matter, distance, or flow of time.</p><p></p><p>Only within a meter of the Enlightening Lights of Humanity was there a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Just then, countless flickering specks of light suddenly appeared in the Black Heavens.</p><p></p><p>As if countless pairs of living eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan sensed that perhaps billions of terrifying beings were all gazing at him.</p><p></p><p>These were indeed the eyes of living beings! These beings were the former Black Earth Clan, or perhaps... even more horrifying existences.</p><p></p><p>"Void Realm Lord?" Qi Yuan looked towards the nearest figure, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I am and am not the Void Realm." The deep, dark figure spoke, extending a hand towards Qi Yuan, his expression cold and emotionless, "Welcome to join us!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

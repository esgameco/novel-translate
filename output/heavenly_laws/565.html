        <h1>Chapter 565</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young man who suddenly appeared in front of him had a strange aura, but gave him a faint sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that he was also a Chaos Lord.</p><p></p><p>"That kid is no longer inside the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord narrowed his eyes slightly. He had left a backup plan on Cang Yulong, so he could easily track his location.</p><p></p><p>Although Cang Yulong's cause and effect was now obscured and hidden, there was no doubt that he had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Two Lords, one forcibly took that kid away, and the other blocked me?"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord looked at the young man in the distance. If Lin Yuan had not suddenly appeared, making him feel like he was facing a formidable enemy, he could have easily locked onto and pursued Cang Yulong the moment he broke through the space-time of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's not two Lords, but the true body and a manifestation of the Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Crossing from the 11th realm of life to the 12th realm requires the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>During this ultimate leap, in order to ensure the gathering of all power to impact the 12th realm, it is necessary to withdraw all mental consciousness from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the manifestation is to cut out a portion of the main body's mental consciousness, and then form a manifestation with this part of the mental consciousness as the core, so that they can share the same consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing all mental will from the outside world means that all manifestations will be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>As for trying to condense new manifestations after crossing into the 12th realm, the difficulty will be greatly increased, and it will also have an impact on the main body in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many 12th realm beings are not willing to refine manifestations, because it will reduce the combat power of the true body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two great spirit gods, the Yin and Yang spirit gods, were present before and after breaking through the 12th realm, because the two spirit gods were not strictly speaking manifestations.</p><p></p><p>They were a certain derivative of the cultivation path of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the vast and diverse evolution paths of the Chaos Void, some special evolution paths will possess many special techniques, and the spirit gods are one of the special techniques of the cultivation path of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Countless billions of light-years away from the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly traversed the distance with Cang Yulong, and with each step, it was equivalent to crossing through layers upon layers of space-time, billions and billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong felt the distance between himself and the Nine Profound Secret Realm constantly increasing. With each step Lin Yuan took, it would take him hundreds or thousands of years to catch up at his own speed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Lord of the Space-Time Eight Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong silently felt that in terms of the overlapping and shifting of space-time, even the Nine Profound Lord was not his equal.</p><p></p><p>"What did my Stone People Clan's ancestors do to be able to have a connection with such an existence?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong calmed his mind and began to grow curious.</p><p></p><p>"We've temporarily escaped."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the location of the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Yin spirit god was responsible for helping Cang Yulong fight against the various restraints and prohibitions in the secret realm, while the Yang spirit god was responsible for holding back the Nine Profound Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now everything was going smoothly, and Cang Yulong had been successfully taken out.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was time to see how the Yang spirit god was doing.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the highest point, in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord looked at Lin Yuan, and the two faced off against each other.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, Lord, Cang Yulong has disappeared." Several Sovereign Realm subordinates immediately contacted the Nine Profound Lord. They were responsible for guarding the Realm of Karmic Retribution and torturing Cang Yulong day and night.</p><p></p><p>However, just now, they finally discovered that Cang Yulong's aura had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of useless fools." The Nine Profound Lord didn't bother to reply, nor did he reprimand his subordinates too much.</p><p></p><p>The one who acted was also a Lord, and it was a Lord who had deployed his true body and manifestation. Caught off guard, even he couldn't detect it in time, let alone those Sovereign Realm subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Profound Lord, I've taken the person away." Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Now that Cang Yulong had been taken away by him, the Nine Profound Lord basically had no way to do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>As for methods like the Karmic Retribution Curse Killing? At the Lord's realm, killing Sovereign Realm beings with such methods was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite was that there were no peers to block him. The so-called Karmic Retribution Curse Killing and such methods could be blocked by external forces, just like the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm could isolate cause and effect, isolate curse killing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm curious." The Nine Profound Lord looked at Lin Yuan. "You used your true body and main self to forcibly take that Cang Yulong away from my domain. You must also know about that mysterious space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's actions were equivalent to standing against the Nine Profound Lord. Unless there were irresistible benefits and interests, no Lord would do something like this.</p><p></p><p>At the Chaos Realm, unless it was absolutely necessary, the Lords rarely fought each other. In the Chaos Void, each Lord could be considered to be standing at the peak.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Nine Profound Lord deduced that Lin Yuan must also know about that mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>If not for that, what could the weak Stone People Clan do to attract other Lords to come to their rescue? And to do so at the cost of offending another Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I do know about it." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord's analysis was correct. If Cang Yulong had not voluntarily offered the Chaos Tree and the mysterious inheritance space with the Chaos Tree suppressing it, Lin Yuan would not have intervened to forcibly rescue him, which was equivalent to making a deadly enemy of the Nine Profound Lord.</p><p></p><p>"You took Cang Yulong away, but you should not know the specific coordinates of that mysterious space. You must need Cang Yulong to tell you, right? You must have made some demands, like rescuing him or the entire Stone People Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord stared at Lin Yuan, his gaze growing colder. "You have already taken Cang Yulong away, but you still haven't left. It must be for the sake of the Stone People Clan? Cang Yulong's condition was for you to save the Stone People Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Beings who could cultivate to the Chaos Realm had thought processes that operated at an extremely fast speed. Based on just a few clues, he could deduce Lin Yuan's purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Correct." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The reason he hadn't left yet was because the Stone People Clan was still in the Nine Profound Lord's hands.</p><p></p><p>"The lives and deaths of billions of Stone People are in my hands." The Nine Profound Lord waved his hand, and a miniature world appeared before him, containing countless imprisoned Stone People.</p><p></p><p>"I want the Chaos Tree from that mysterious space, or else all these Stone People will die." The Nine Profound Lord looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Tree?" Lin Yuan examined the Nine Profound Lord with interest. "I promised that kid that I would try to save the Stone People Clan, but I didn't guarantee that I could actually save them. The value of the Chaos Tree, you and I both understand. If I just hand over that Chaos Tree to you, wouldn't I have wasted my efforts?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was calm. "If it was just a waste of effort, why would I have intervened to rescue them?"</p><p></p><p>"Use these Stone People to threaten me? It's useless. If you want, I can just slaughter all of them right now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched the Nine Profound Lord with interest.</p><p></p><p>These words caused the Nine Profound Lord's expression to change slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could hear the indifference in Lin Yuan's tone towards the lives of the Stone People.</p><p></p><p>Now that Cang Yulong was in the other party's hands, even if all these Stone People were killed, the other party might still be able to obtain the coordinates of the mysterious space from Cang Yulong.</p><p></p><p>And if he completely slaughtered all the Stone People, he might even risk provoking Cang Yulong to voluntarily reveal the location of the mysterious space to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at this moment, the Nine Profound Lord found himself in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>"If I needed to rely on this secret realm's Realm of Karmic Retribution, you would never have had the chance to take Cang Yulong away."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord was quite resentful.</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Karmic Retribution was a unique wonder of this secret realm. Probably the entire Chaos Void didn't have an exact duplicate. He had used it to torture Cang Yulong, hoping to make him reveal the coordinates of the mysterious space as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Nine Profound Lord had already been extremely careful and cautious.</p><p></p><p>He had even anticipated extreme situations where other Lords might intervene.</p><p></p><p>Around the Realm of Karmic Retribution, the Nine Profound Lord had quietly set up numerous formations. As long as other Lords, even peak Chaos Realm Lords, were not exceptionally skilled in formations, they would be detected by the Nine Profound Lord upon approaching.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to silently take Cang Yulong away right under the Nine Profound Lord's nose. His formation skills were probably no weaker than those Lords who specialized in the Dao of Arrays.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he was a Chaos Lord, skilled in formations, and also knew about the mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>With these three conditions, the Nine Profound Lord couldn't think of anyone else in the nearby dozens of void domains who could meet these requirements.</p><p></p><p>"So, what do you want to do now?"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Lord spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"I did promise that kid that I would try to save the Stone People Clan." Lin Yuan shook his head. "But just directly handing over the Stone People Clan to you, I'm sure you wouldn't be satisfied with that."</p><p></p><p>"How about this, I'll give you a choice."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said, "We can have a duel between us. I want the Chaos Tree, but if I win, you have to hand over the Stone People Clan to me. If you win, then I'll hand over the Chaos Tree to you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you win, you will hand over all the Stone People Tribe to me. If you win, the Stone People Tribe will still be handed over to me, but in that mysterious space, I can give you a copy of the heritage that can be replicated."</p><p></p><p>"If I win, you'll just give me a copy of the heritage that can be replicated?" The Ninth Profound Venerable felt aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, this was basically no loss at all.</p><p></p><p>"That Chaos Tree," the Ninth Profound Venerable still wanted to try it.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to think about the Chaos Tree," Lin Yuan shook his head and said, "If you don't choose, I can wipe out all the Stone People Tribe right now."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable looked at Lin Yuan, and he could feel that the choice the other party was offering was the bottom line.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>After much thought, the Ninth Profound Venerable finally agreed.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Slaughtering all the Stone People Tribe had no benefits for him.</p><p></p><p>By agreeing to Lin Yuan's choice, he still had a chance to obtain that mysterious space's heritage.</p><p></p><p>For the Chaos Venerable, heritage was relatively important.</p><p></p><p>The most critical thing was, having something was better than having nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Swear under the will of the Chaos Void Origin," Lin Yuan looked at the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'oath' was a means of constraint and restriction. The will of the Chaos Void Origin was omnipresent, and swearing by the origin will of the Chaos Void would contain great cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>If he ultimately violated the 'oath', although he would not suffer any injuries, the cause and effect would weigh on him, and he would not be able to advance further.</p><p></p><p>As a newly promoted Venerable, the Ninth Profound Venerable still wanted to try the ultimate Saint Realm, and he was most likely not going to violate the oath.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if there were no other choices, no Venerable would be willing to have the cause and effect weigh on them.</p><p></p><p>Which life that could cultivate to the Chaos Realm was not fought out from countless billions of beings? The consequences of the Dao being severed were too heavy.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan and the Ninth Profound Venerable completed the 'oath'.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the oath was easily accomplished. Even if he lost in the end, it would be on the premise of obtaining that mysterious space's heritage, which he could then share a copy with the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Give me all the Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Ninth Profound Venerable and spoke.</p><p></p><p>In the upcoming sparring, if the Ninth Profound Venerable lost, he had to hand over all the Stone People Tribe; if he won, he also had to hand over all the Stone People Tribe. So Lin Yuan simply asked for it in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Here you go."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable directly threw out the micro-world, as he had no interest in these Stone People Tribe at all. If it wasn't for threatening Cang Yulong, he wouldn't have even bothered to imprison them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the micro-world, divided a wisp of his divine sense to inspect it, and found that there were a large number of anxious and uneasy Stone People Tribe inside. These Stone People Tribe also knew their fate, and a single thought from the Ninth Profound Venerable could wipe them out.</p><p></p><p>"Where shall we spar?"</p><p></p><p>After checking a few times and confirming that the micro-world had no problems, Lin Yuan put it away and casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>The killing between Venerables had tremendous destructive power, and the Ninth Profound Secret Realm, nurtured by the Chaos Void, clearly did not have the indestructible nature of the universe.</p><p></p><p>If the two Venerables fought inside the secret realm, the secret realm would not be able to withstand it and might even collapse and be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Secret Realm was the Ninth Profound Venerable's home base, and he naturally did not want to see it destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure slowly disappeared, "See you outside the secret realm in half an hour."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable saw this and was not worried that Lin Yuan would leave early.</p><p></p><p>One was because Lin Yuan had also sworn an oath under the will of the Chaos Void Origin, and violating it would bring about cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>The other was that regardless of win or lose, there was no loss at all for Lin Yuan, which was also the reason why the Ninth Profound Venerable handed over all the Stone People Tribe so readily.</p><p></p><p>"When did such a Venerable appear in the nearby void domain?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable sat on the throne, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the Chaos Venerable level, they were basically acquainted with each other, and they all knew each other, but he had never heard of this Venerable named Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he came from a distant void domain? Or is he also just like me, having just entered the Chaos Realm, and the news hasn't spread yet?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable speculated.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a few Sovereign Realm powerhouses cautiously entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable." These Sovereign Realm powerhouses did not yet know what had happened, but their Cang Yulong, whom they were guarding, had suddenly disappeared, so they were certainly guilty.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, withdraw all the gathering points outside the secret realm and fully activate the secret realm's defensive formation," the Ninth Profound Venerable ordered.</p><p></p><p>Around the Chaos Continent, there were many 'fragment worlds' surrounding it. Although the Ninth Profound Secret Realm was not as powerful as the Chaos Continent, it also had many gathering points converging there.</p><p></p><p>In the upcoming battle between the Ninth Profound Venerable and Lin Yuan, the aftershocks would definitely not be able to be blocked by these gathering points, so it was safer to bring them all back into the secret realm, and the Ninth Profound Secret Realm itself also needed to enter the highest defensive state to cope with the aftershocks of the upcoming battle between the two Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, why do we need to withdraw those gathering points?" The Sovereign Realm subordinates were surprised and puzzled, and the Ninth Profound Venerable did not blame them at all for failing to guard Cang Yulong, but instead ordered this?</p><p></p><p>"Later, I will spar with another Venerable outside."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable's words were brief, but the Sovereign Realm subordinates were shaken.</p><p></p><p>Spar? </p><p></p><p>With another Venerable?</p><p></p><p>In the distant space-time.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Primordial Spirit was standing quietly.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong was standing respectfully beside him.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>A figure condensed, which was Lin Yuan's Solar Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors?" </p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong was slightly taken aback, but immediately understood that it should be a manifestation.</p><p></p><p>"This is your clansmen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and a micro-world appeared, which was filled with a large number of Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Clansmen."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong's expression was excited, and his voice was even a little trembling.</p><p></p><p>He never thought he would have the chance to see his clansmen again.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had said he would try to save the Stone People Tribe before taking Cang Yulong out, it was just an attempt.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was not that easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>But now, </p><p></p><p>all the Stone People Tribe were in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't get too excited."</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Profound Venerable handed over these Stone People Tribe with conditions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong and then explained the agreement he had made with the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is up to the senior predecessor."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Sharing a copy of the heritage that can be replicated with the Ninth Profound Venerable?</p><p></p><p>This was also nothing to Cang Yulong, since he had already planned to hand over the entire heritage space to Lin Yuan, so naturally he would listen to Lin Yuan's decision.</p><p></p><p>When Cang Yulong was in the hands of the Ninth Profound Venerable, the reason he would rather die than submit was that he knew that even if he submitted, he would still have a hard time surviving.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ninth Profound Venerable, in order to vent his anger and take revenge, would not only kill him, but wipe out the entire Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong took away that mysterious space in front of the Ninth Profound Venerable, and the latter's fury was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to spar with the Ninth Profound Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Now you can tell me the specific space-time coordinates of that mysterious space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong and said in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>"The specific space-time coordinates." Cang Yulong took a deep breath and without any hesitation, told the space-time coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had fulfilled all the requirements, not only rescuing him, but also rescuing all the Stone People Tribe, Cang Yulong naturally did not dare to delay.</p><p></p><p>Although so far, Lin Yuan had given Cang Yulong the impression of being extremely kind, the more it was so, the more Cang Yulong revered him. To be able to force the ruthless Chaos Venerable like the Ninth Profound Venerable to retreat so much, how could Lin Yuan really be kind?</p><p></p><p>If he offended Lin Yuan, Cang Yulong felt that his fate would be countless times more miserable than falling into the hands of the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"The space-time coordinates."</p><p></p><p>After learning the specific space-time coordinates, Lin Yuan immediately began to extend his exploration based on them.</p><p></p><p>The space-time of the Chaos Void was extremely vast, with layer upon layer of space-time realms. Even Chaos Venerables and Chaos Saints could not traverse every space-time realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the space-time coordinates of the Chaos Void were very important. Without the specific space-time coordinates, even Chaos Saints could get lost in the endless space-time realms.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's vast divine sense constantly spread and expanded, and following the space-time coordinates given by Cang Yulong, he finally locked onto a mysterious space in the depths of the space-time realms.</p><p></p><p>"That space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

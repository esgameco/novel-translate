        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most precious was definitely the two-dimensional world itself, that is, the 'blank paper'. </p><p></p><p>But even for the most powerful beings, they were unable to refine that 'blank paper'.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the myriad races trapped within naturally would not have any ideas.</p><p></p><p>As for the wondrous object possessed by the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom, from what Lin Yuan knew, it was a Bloodrain Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>However, this Bloodrain Tea Tree had been taken away by the few experts of the myriad races who had crossed into the Shaman Ancestor realm nearly a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>The miraculous nature of the Bloodrain Tea Tree was no secret to the upper echelons of the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom.  </p><p></p><p>After realizing the value of the wondrous objects in the two-dimensional world, the Bloodrain Tea Tree would definitely not be ignored and had long been targeted by powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>It was something the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom could not keep.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom is hiding other wondrous objects?" Lin Yuan became interested.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom's royalty had stated they had treasures to offer, so Lin Yuan naturally associated it with this direction.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"I'll just meet them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind, since it involved a wondrous object, it was appropriate to meet them.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranggu immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Since the master has agreed to meet, I will notify them right away."</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranggu respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Without Lin Yuan's permission, even the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom's royalty would not dare enter the Luochuan gathering grounds on their own.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, even though Lin Yuan rarely took action, his minor deeds were enough to deter the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranggu went to notify the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom's royalty, and there was still some time before they could have an audience with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to take out the silver mirror and channel his spiritual power into it.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Lin Yuan expending a great deal of spiritual power,</p><p></p><p>The silver mirror in front of him gradually revealed its extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>Faint traces of silver radiance began to appear.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed an extremely familiar fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>A spatial fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>It was purely a spatial fluctuation, not involving any spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan continued to maintain the infusion of his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Only experts at the nineteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm could possess such abundant spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Those at the fifteenth or sixteenth level could not even meet the prerequisite to activate this silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a day went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Continuously maintaining the infusion of his spiritual will like this, even Lin Yuan found it somewhat unbearable.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, it would probably affect his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was considering whether to keep going,</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The silver mirror seemed to undergo some kind of qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>It actually began to slowly levitate.</p><p></p><p>The mirror surface even produced ripples like mercury.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the levitating silver mirror in front of him, his face showing astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The mirror levitating was not surprising to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, by erupting with full force, he could also briefly levitate for a short time.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a matter of making his blood essence boil, erupting with a powerful life magnetic field to counteract the earth's gravitational pull.</p><p></p><p>What truly astonished Lin Yuan was that he sensed an independent space contained within the mirror surface!</p><p></p><p>The space was not large, only ten square meters.</p><p></p><p>But it must be known that in this two-dimensional world, there was no concept of spatial depth, everything was two-dimensional, everything was a plane.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, within the mirror surface, there was an independent three-dimensional space maintained, which was an inconceivable ability in this two-dimensional world!</p><p></p><p>"The direct visible size of the world within my body reaches 2.331 billion li in circumference, with over 30 billion layers of nested spaces. Even so, after falling into this two-dimensional world, the world within my body was instantly suppressed into a 'paper', ceasing to exist."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, the silver mirror actually contained an independent space.</p><p></p><p>If this independent space returned to the main universe and fully unfolded, how vast would it become?</p><p></p><p>"With the space inside the mirror, it will be much more convenient." Lin Yuan repeatedly stroked the silver mirror, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the space inside the mirror was not large, it was more than enough to store Lin Yuan's daily necessities, especially that jet-black iron rod, which was too conspicuous to carry on his back.</p><p></p><p>Now he could put the iron rod inside.</p><p></p><p>And when he wanted to use it, he could instantly take it out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for Lin Yuan, the silver mirror also had the crucial life-saving ability.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered an attack he could not withstand, he could completely hide inside the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>As for the exposed silver mirror body itself, as one of the twelve stellar wondrous treasures and weapons, it was equivalent to an indestructible existence in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Even if the most powerful experts fell into this place and were suppressed by the two-dimensional world, unable to unleash their full power, they still could not shake the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rejoiced inwardly, with this silver mirror, his means had been enriched once again.</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll put the iron rod inside." With a thought from Lin Yuan, the nearly two-meter-long jet-black iron rod disappeared from its original spot, entering the space within the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>He then also put the bronze compass inside. This wondrous compass was of great use to Lin Yuan, so he had to always pay attention to it when carrying it on his person.</p><p></p><p>But by sending it into the space within the silver mirror, he could be much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>It did not take Lin Yuan long to understand the abilities of the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom's royalty...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>The one coming to give New Year's greetings to Lin Yuan was the current emperor of the ancient nation of Bloodrain, a middle-aged man with a rather solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, great one." The Bloodrain Emperor and the few princes and ministers behind him were very respectful, looking at the young man sitting cross-legged there. The oppressive feeling vaguely coming from the essence of life itself made the few of them under tremendous pressure, with sweat constantly seeping from their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the mysterious powerful expert hidden in my Bloodrain nation?" The Bloodrain Emperor swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>The battle that took place in the desolate northwestern region of the Bloodrain nation some time ago was not only widely spread among the powerful experts of all races, but the local Bloodrain nation had also heard about it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, based on many clues, the imperial court of the Bloodrain nation vaguely deduced that the mysterious powerful expert was none other than the young man before them.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred-plus years, one peerless expert after another had emerged from the Twelve Ancient Nations, making the imperial courts that were originally the rulers tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>If it were not absolutely necessary, the Bloodrain Emperor really would not want to get close to Lin Yuan, because the pressure was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Get up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the few respectfully standing below, his gaze lingering slightly on one of them.</p><p></p><p>This person was the Prince of Zhenbei of the Bloodrain nation. Lin Yuan's ability to obtain the bronze compass was related to him in some way.</p><p></p><p>If the Prince of Zhenbei had not pursued the eighteen bandits of Cloudy Mountain, the latter would not have fled to the vicinity of the Luochuan gathering place.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan took action to claim the bounty, he would not have been too far from the Luochuan gathering place, and in the end, he might have missed the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"Even in this two-dimensional world, there is cause and effect, but it is almost imperceptible." Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As Xia You evolved the high tower, Lin Yuan split off an incarnation to comprehend the cosmic aurora, and his understanding of the rules of cause and effect had made tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>Now, meeting the Prince of Zhenbei in this way was also a manifestation of cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>"Great one, these are the treasures we offer." The Bloodrain Emperor took out two wooden boxes.</p><p></p><p>One wooden box was large, and the other was small.</p><p></p><p>The large wooden box was half a meter long, while the small wooden box was only ten centimeters.</p><p></p><p>Cha Ranguran quickly stepped forward, took the two wooden boxes, and respectfully placed them in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the two wooden boxes with interest.</p><p></p><p>Inside the large wooden box was an axe, entirely carved from jade, exquisite and delicate, with a hint of sharp aura flowing along the blade.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small wooden box was a piece of wood. Even without touching it, Lin Yuan could sense an immense vitality from within the wood.</p><p></p><p>"These two treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged, but he was slightly excited inside.</p><p></p><p>That exquisite jade axe should be an extremely powerful weapon, similar to the jet-black iron staff.</p><p></p><p>As for that piece of wood, it was probably some kind of rare material from the Twelve Stars, which would likely provoke the pursuit of peerless experts even in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Bloodrain nation..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Bloodrain Emperor and his people below.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred-plus years, the Bloodrain nation must have been plundered by many powerful experts from all races. Even so, they still retained these two treasures, clearly possessing some skills.</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"What do you want me to do?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmly said.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Emperor and his people had traveled an extremely long distance to visit him and even offered precious treasures. They must have some request.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the pursuit in the northwestern region some time ago was related to the great one," the Bloodrain Emperor cautiously asked.</p><p></p><p>"It was me," Lin Yuan directly answered.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, there was no need to conceal anything. He might as well admit it openly.</p><p></p><p>"The great one's power is truly heaven-defying," the Bloodrain Emperor said with sincere awe.</p><p></p><p>The traces left behind from that great pursuit in the northwestern region had shattered the perceptions of the powerful experts of the Bloodrain imperial court many times over.</p><p></p><p>"Just state your business directly," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Emperor steadied himself, "I hope the great one can take the Bloodrain nation under your protection."</p><p></p><p>"Protection?" Lin Yuan glanced at the Bloodrain Emperor.</p><p></p><p>He had anticipated this request. For the native ancient nations of this two-dimensional world, facing the countless powerful experts descending upon them, their hearts must be filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, your Bloodrain nation can announce to the outside world that you are under my protection," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It's that simple?" The Bloodrain Emperor was somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"With this announcement, other powerful experts will not dare to take any excessive actions," Lin Yuan said softly.</p><p></p><p>News travels exceptionally quickly among the powerful experts of all races. Once they learned that the mysterious sixth-ranked expert was protecting the Bloodrain nation, no matter how audacious they were, they would not dare make a move.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Although the Bloodrain Emperor did not quite understand, he did not dare express any opinion.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>After the Bloodrain Emperor returned to the capital and made this announcement to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Empire indeed became much more peaceful, and those unruly powerful experts from all races immediately became much more obedient.</p><p></p><p>The numerous powerful experts from all races unanimously believed that Lin Yuan must be a legendary life form at the eleventh perfect stage from the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Facing such an existence, who would dare cause trouble within the area under his protection?</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly. Lin Yuan continued to immerse himself in cultivation, and nearly two hundred years went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>There were only two months left until the Heavenly Gate opened, which happened once every ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 484 Surpassing the Nine Great Supremes (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>In the Qingyou Immortal City, there was the Zuimeng Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As the most renowned place in the Qingyou Immortal City and even the entire Qingyou Immortal Realm, the Zuimeng Pavilion had its unique Zuimeng Immortal Wine, which could allow Golden Immortals and Jade Immortals to briefly immerse themselves in a well-crafted dream.</p><p></p><p>This immersion was not just a simple immersion, as it had great benefits for nourishing the spirit and will, and one could break free from it at any time.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that every day, Immortals from the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms would specifically come to the Zuimeng Pavilion to savor the renowned Zuimeng Immortal Wine.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation system of the Martial Dao is indeed not simple, opening up an inner celestial world and absorbing the essence of the outer celestial world, using the physical body as the foundation. From many aspects, it is no less inferior to our Immortal Dao cultivation system, and may even be..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I have an heir who is naturally endowed with divine strength and a robust physique, but his spiritual root is not good, so I had him cultivate the Martial Dao, and now he has already entered the sixth stage of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of person the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, who established the Martial Dao cultivation system, is."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, more than a thousand years ago, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had publicly preached several times, but I was in seclusion and did not go, so I never met the Ancestor of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>In the Zuimeng Pavilion, a large number of Immortals from all over the Immortal Realm had gathered, and while savoring the Zuimeng Immortal Wine, they were discussing the major events happening in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the many major events, the one that could most arouse the heated discussion of the Immortals was the Martial Dao cultivation system and the Ancestor of the Martial Dao who had suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>As for the Martial Dao cultivation system, it needs no further elaboration. After it was fully disseminated, it received the affirmation of many Jade Immortals, and its evaluation was no less than the Immortal Dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the evaluation here completely underestimated the Martial Dao cultivation system, after all, the Jade Immortals who made the evaluation were Immortal Dao powerhouses, and they must have a "filter" towards their own Immortal Dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ancestor of the Martial Dao? After more than a thousand years of dissemination, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao has already been recognized as the third Dao Ancestor-level powerhouse in the Immortal Abyss of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>By spreading the Martial Dao cultivation system and single-handedly ending the Immortal-Demon War, he has silenced the many disciples of the Immortal Dao Ancestor lineage.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestor of the Martial Dao has not made a move since the Immortal-Demon War more than a thousand years ago, one can still extract a lot of information from the reactions of the disciples of the Immortal Dao Ancestor lineage.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that in the Xuantian Immortal Realm, there is a Martial Dao powerhouse who has specially opened up an Immortal City called the Kaiyuan Martial City, where many Martial Dao powerhouses gather, and the disciples of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao all reside there."</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard that when the Kaiyuan Martial City was first opened, there were celestial anomalies, and the core disciples of the Immortal Dao Ancestor lineage all went to congratulate it."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where the Ancestor of the Martial Dao is now."</p><p></p><p>The tone of the Immortals was filled with a sense of awe. Many ancient Immortals who had lived for billions of years had witnessed countless extraordinary powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancestor of the Martial Dao was beyond the imagination of all Immortals. He was a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of the Immortal Realm, even including the one in the Immortal Abyss, there were only two Dao Ancestors, and many Immortals even felt that a third Dao Ancestor-level powerhouse would never be born.</p><p></p><p>In the VIP Palace of the Zuimeng Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This was a place specially reserved for distinguished guests of the Zuimeng Pavilion, and only the top-tier Jade Immortals were allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was sitting here, and the discussions and debates of the many Immortals in the Zuimeng Pavilion naturally did not escape his notice.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, Lin Yuan's true body and two major divine souls had naturally been cultivating and enlightening the Dao, and he had also manifested a projection to roam the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Yuan currently sitting in the VIP Palace of the Zuimeng Pavilion was one such projection, who had come here casually after hearing the fame of the Zuimeng Immortal Wine.</p><p></p><p>"The evolution of the Martial Dao is progressing well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the discussions of the many Immortals in the Zuimeng Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the past thousand years, not many Martial Dao powerhouses had emerged, apart from Lin Yuan himself, the strongest one was still Liqing.</p><p></p><p>But the number of cultivators of the Martial Dao evolution path and the breadth of its dissemination had almost encompassed the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already very satisfied with this, and with the current foundation of the Martial Dao evolution path, as long as there is enough time, be it hundreds of thousands of years or millions of years, it will eventually not be inferior to the Immortal Dao cultivation system and give birth to many Martial Dao Eleventh Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gently closed his eyes, and his field of vision suddenly turned pitch-black, with vast swaths of starry lights scattered everywhere, and each point of starlight represented a Martial Dao cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the starry lights that Lin Yuan could sense were vast and boundless, even extending beyond the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not only spreading the Martial Dao in the Immortal Realm, but also in the subordinate worlds of the Immortal Realm, such as the Spirit Realm, which had three thousand three hundred and thirty-three worlds.</p><p></p><p>Although the Spirit Realm is far inferior to the Immortal Realm, and even the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three subordinate worlds combined are not as large as a single Immortal Realm, as the saying goes, "Even a mosquito has meat," Lin Yuan will not miss any opportunity to enhance his ultimate breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if there is enough time, Lin Yuan even plans to spread the Martial Dao in the Middle Celestial Continent, which is a subordinate world of the Spirit Realm. Apart from the Middle Celestial Continent, the Spirit Realm has hundreds of thousands of subordinate worlds.</p><p></p><p>The other three thousand three hundred and thirty-two Immortal Realm subordinate worlds are similar.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the number of beings cultivating the Martial Dao evolution path is probably more than the total number of cultivators of the Nine Great Supremes evolution paths in human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just the Immortal Realm alone is comparable to one percent of the main universe in size.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization is one of the Twelve Peak Forces of the main universe, occupying an area roughly equivalent to one-twentieth to one-thirtieth of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>In terms of area, the territory of human civilization is three to four times that of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But human civilization has Nine Great Supremes evolution paths, while the Immortal Realm only has the Immortal Dao cultivation system and the Martial Dao cultivation system, as well as the evolution paths Lin Yuan had spread during his past ten crossovers.</p><p></p><p>And the humans cultivating the Martial Dao evolution path in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The total number of cultivators of the Nine Great Supremes evolution paths in human civilization is probably still not as many as the Martial Dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Martial Dao evolution path is not limited to the main universe, but extends to the boundless dimensions and realms of the Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's cultivation time is still short, and the number of crossovers he has experienced is not many, but in the future, as the worlds he crosses over to become more advanced, the spread of the Martial Dao evolution path will become even more extensive.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the more beings cultivating the Martial Dao evolution path, the lighter the suppression of the river of time on me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not so obvious before his journey to the Immortal Realm, but became clearer after the Martial Dao evolution path was fully disseminated in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The endless Martial Dao cultivators were collectively supporting Lin Yuan, and this support was not the kind of support from divine faith, but a support under Lin Yuan's control.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was examining himself,</p><p></p><p>A graceful Jade Immortal woman slowly walked into the palace.</p><p></p><p>This Jade Immortal woman was the Pavilion Master of the Zuimeng Pavilion. When Lin Yuan arrived at the Zuimeng Pavilion, he had randomly manifested a projection.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The aura emanating from him revealed a trace of the Jade Immortal realm, and he was personally welcomed by the Proprietor of the Drunken Dream Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Drunken Dream Pavilion, it was not every day that a Jade Immortal-level expert would come to visit. Jade Immortal-level experts, no matter where they were, were always honored guests.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Lord, this is my Drunken Dream Pavilion's 'Dream' grade Drunken Dream Immortal Wine. Are you sure you want to partake of this Immortal Wine?" The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor smiled slightly, looking at Lin Yuan with a gentle gaze.</p><p></p><p>The most famous Drunken Dream Immortal Wine of the Drunken Dream Pavilion was also divided into different levels. The Dream grade Immortal Wine was the 'original liquor' of the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine. Even for a top-tier Jade Immortal, if they accidentally took a sip, they would be unable to control themselves and completely fall into the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>This was a complete immersion, where the perception of the outside world would be reduced to the minimum.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even if there were Jade Immortal-level existences who wanted to taste the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine, they would not choose the Dream grade Immortal Wine, as the risk was too great. Even though the Drunken Dream Pavilion had a good reputation, if one were to completely fall into the dream realm, it would be quite embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor then personally brought the Immortal Wine to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Lord, please drink." The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor looked at Lin Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The formula of the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine was adjusted periodically based on the reactions of the Immortals who drank it.</p><p></p><p>The other grades of Drunken Dream Immortal Wine were still fine, as many Immortals would drink them, and the Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor would secretly observe and make adjustments.</p><p></p><p>But the Dream grade Drunken Dream Immortal Wine? Even if there were Jade Immortals who wanted to try the taste of the Dream grade Immortal Wine, they would buy it and drink it in their own immortal abode.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if they fell into the dream realm, they could still ensure their own safety.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortals who dared to order the Dream grade Drunken Dream Immortal Wine and directly drink it down were truly too few.</p><p></p><p>The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor did not want to miss this extremely rare observation opportunity in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan glanced at the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine in front of him and directly picked it up and drank it down.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is still decent."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan savored it for a while. The Dream grade Drunken Dream Immortal Wine could indeed nourish the mind and will.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's mind and will were already incredibly strong, so the slight hallucinatory effect of the Immortal Wine had almost no effect on him.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan came to taste the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine was to try it out, just as one would appreciate fine cuisine.</p><p></p><p>"Has the strength of the mind and will increased a bit?" Lin Yuan raised an eyebrow, not knowing whether it was due to the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine or not, but at this moment, the strength of Lin Yuan's mind and will had increased by an imperceptible amount.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for over a thousand years at the core of the Immortal Realm's origin, comprehending the rules of the Immortal Realm itself, Lin Yuan's mind and will had already reached over 3,340,000 points.</p><p></p><p>"The taste is... still decent?" The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor was slightly dazed. She even began to suspect if she had given Lin Yuan the wrong Immortal Wine? That it was not the Dream grade Immortal Wine, but an ordinary one?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could Lin Yuan still be so calm and composed in his evaluation?</p><p></p><p>In the Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor's view, after drinking the Dream grade Immortal Wine, Lin Yuan's normal reaction should have been to quickly fall into the dream realm, allowing her to carefully observe his reaction.</p><p></p><p>"This is spirit crystals." Lin Yuan left the spirit crystals for the purchase of the Dream grade Immortal Wine and disappeared from the palace.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, residing in the core of the Immortal Realm, as long as he wished, he could directly condense as many spirit crystals as he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"He really didn't fall into the dream realm?" The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor found it hard to believe. She looked at the wine cup Lin Yuan had drunk from and subconsciously picked it up and lightly licked it.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a dizzying, falling sensation surged in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Even just lightly licking it, the Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor began to lose control and fall into the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>"Drunken Dream Immortal Cultivation, my true self." The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor immediately activated her Immortal power, as the creator of the Drunken Dream Immortal Wine, she already had great resistance to any hallucinatory techniques.</p><p></p><p>Even with just a trace of the wine, it took her several days to recover.</p><p></p><p>"It was truly the Dream grade Immortal Wine." The recovered Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor was not at all joyful, but rather fell into a state of extraordinary shock.</p><p></p><p>With the Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor's ability to resist hallucinatory techniques, even the top-tier Jade Immortals were no match for her. Yet, just by lightly licking the Dream grade Immortal Wine, she almost couldn't withstand it, while the young man who drank the entire cup showed no signs of anything happening.</p><p></p><p>"Forcibly enduring the Dream grade Immortal Wine... just who is he? Even top-tier Jade Immortals can't do that."</p><p></p><p>The Drunken Dream Pavilion Proprietor's mood had not settled for a long time, and she vaguely realized that the young man who drank that cup of Immortal Wine must have a terrifying background.</p><p></p><p>In another Immortal City outside the several Immortal Realms of the Azure Mist Immortal City...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan strolled leisurely on the open street.</p><p></p><p>"After a thousand years, I still haven't been able to comprehend the Chaos Rules." Lin Yuan thought to himself as he walked, "I'm very sure I'm extremely close to comprehending the Chaos Rules."</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, the Immortal Realm's consciousness had compromised and actively allowed Lin Yuan to enter the core, directly facing many of the rules themselves.</p><p></p><p>Since then, Lin Yuan's attainment in rule comprehension had undergone unprecedented leaps and bounds, with completely new Pillar-level Fusion Rules being comprehended every moment.</p><p></p><p>This kind of rapid progress had lasted for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>From a thousand years ago to the present, Lin Yuan had newly comprehended over 3 million Pillar-level Fusion Rules, and had raised them all to the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Seventh Realm of Pillar-level Fusion Rules was normally only possible for Twelfth-Tier Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan not only reached it, but did so with over 3 million Pillar-level Fusion Rules at once.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the depth of rule comprehension, even excluding the comprehension of the Space-Time Fusion Rules, Lin Yuan believed that even the Twelfth-Tier Ultimates would be unable to match him in most aspects.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lin Yuan still had not completely comprehended the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I've already been very fortunate."</p><p></p><p>"If I hadn't descended into the Immortal Realm and entered the core of the origin, reaching this step would have probably taken tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, thinking inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Immortal Realm's origin had indeed greatly helped him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also because Lin Yuan's comprehension was extraordinary. For others, even the Ancestors of the Immortal Dao, if they were to cultivate in the core for a thousand years, they would not be able to comprehend over 3 million Pillar-level Fusion Rules and raise them all to the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be possible even in a billion years, a trillion years.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending so many Pillar-level Fusion Rules was not just a matter of having more time, as there were countless bottlenecks and obstacles along the way, and even the slightest delay could lead to millions of years passing by.</p><p></p><p>"The World Within."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, descending into the World Within.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a manifestation, they shared the same consciousness, so the rule comprehension was also synchronized.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the World Within was also filled with endless rule fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>All the rule fluctuations, like tangible substance, converged into a massive and majestic 'egg' that spanned the heavens.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

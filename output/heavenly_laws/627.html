        <h1>Chapter 627</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, what do you call the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>Master Xia Qin, the Supremely Strong One, suppressed the shock in his heart, even though he was certain he had not misheard.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming, being at the Chaotic Realm, could not have possibly misspoken, but he still wanted to confirm it one more time.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Sage?</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, in the countless void domains, there are many titles for the strong ones, but the Sage? Only those who have fully entered the Chaotic Realm and cultivated their own Chaotic Dao powers can be worthy of the title of Sage.</p><p></p><p>Below that level, to arrogate the title of Sage would invite great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The other Supremely Strong Ones like Xuanyuan also looked at Venerable Master Gu Ming.</p><p></p><p>They held their breath, not daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"So you don't know yet?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming realized this.</p><p></p><p>Likely the Milky Way Sage had not revealed his true powers to Xuanyuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>That's understandable.</p><p></p><p>If they knew the Milky Way Sage's powers, how could the human race in the Star Tear Fragment World be so low-key?</p><p></p><p>As for what happened in the Xuanhuang Universe, at most it has only been circulated among the Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Those below the Venerables? They know very little.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>In the future, as time passes, the fame of the Milky Way Sage will spread to all the void domains.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Sage," </p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming briefly explained what he knew.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't say it now, the news would reach here in a few months at most.</p><p></p><p>Since the Milky Way Sage had revealed his powers before the many Venerables, he likely no longer intends to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, the Milky Way has forcefully contended with the Dual Source Sage, the Blackstone Sage, and other great Sages?" </p><p></p><p>Master Xia Qin, the Supremely Strong One, was dumbfounded. The Dual Source Sage and the Blackstone Sage were renowned as powerful Sages. At most, he had only speculated that Lin Yuan might have fully entered the Chaotic Realm based on Venerable Master Gu Ming's previous address.</p><p></p><p>But to forcefully contend with the Dual Source Sage, the Blackstone Sage, and the others? That was far beyond just fully entering the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Dual Source Sage, the Blackstone Sage, how could they be on par with the Milky Way Sage? In the Posterior Heavenly Universe, the Milky Way Sage decisively suppressed eight Chaotic Sages, including the Blackstone Sage and the Savage Sage, and only the Dual Source Sage managed to escape."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming said.</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>the minds of the Supremely Strong Ones of the human civilization were in a complete daze.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing eight Chaotic Sages? Including powerful Sages like the Blackstone Sage and the Savage Sage?</p><p></p><p>Defeating and suppressing are completely different levels of difficulty, the latter being far more challenging than the former.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, how do you know this? Could it be a misunderstanding? Perhaps it's someone with the same name?" </p><p></p><p>Master Xia Qin, the Supremely Strong One, immediately said. It wasn't that he didn't believe in Lin Yuan's powers, but it was just too unbelievable. The human civilization had only entered the Chaotic Void for a short time.</p><p></p><p>The Supremely Strong Ones of the human civilization had basically not seen much change in their powers, yet Lin Yuan had already become a Chaotic Sage? And an invincible existence among the Chaotic Sages at that?</p><p></p><p>"It's not a misunderstanding," Venerable Master Gu Ming affirmed.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the subsequent image projections Venerable Master Gu Ming had obtained, it was basically confirmed that the Milky Way Sage was indeed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Sage available now?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming asked, not forgetting his original purpose of wanting to seek an audience with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go ask him now," </p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan, the Supremely Strong One, barely reacted and immediately inquired Lin Yuan. After a moment, he looked at Venerable Master Gu Ming and said, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming was delighted and immediately entered the Star Tear Fragment World.</p><p></p><p>After Venerable Master Gu Ming went to see Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>the few Supremely Strong Ones of the human civilization race were still standing in the same spot, not yet fully recovered from the news they had just received about the Milky Way Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Milky Way really become a Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Master Xia Qin, the Supremely Strong One, muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It should be true," </p><p></p><p>Master Feather, the Supremely Strong One, nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not yet learned of Lin Yuan's ascension to Chaotic Sage from other channels,</p><p></p><p>but from Venerable Master Gu Ming's cautious and sincere reverence just now, it was certainly not false.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Master Gu Ming was an experienced Venerable, and only a true Chaotic Sage could make him so deferential.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined our human civilization would produce a Chaotic Sage?" </p><p></p><p>Master Virtual God, the Supremely Strong One, exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>If they were still in their home universe, they might not have thought much of a Chaotic Sage, as they couldn't truly comprehend the significance of a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>But after entering the Chaotic Void, especially after residing on the Gu Ming Chaotic Continent for these years, the many Supremely Strong Ones of the human civilization had gained more understanding of certain forbidden realms.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a Sage, even just a Chaotic Venerable was a peerless expert beyond their reach.</p><p></p><p>And now, their human civilization had also produced a Sage?</p><p></p><p>"Don't associate the human civilization with the Milky Way becoming a Sage, it has little to do with us." </p><p></p><p>Master Xia Qin, the Supremely Strong One, said with a slightly wistful tone, "Given the Milky Way's talent, he would have risen to greatness anywhere. We should be grateful that the Milky Way has appeared in our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>The few Supremely Strong Ones nodded.</p><p></p><p>Aside from providing some assistance to Lin Yuan before his Twelve Tribulations, the human civilization has been completely repaying him since then.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan, the great destruction of the universe would have arrived prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How long can human civilization survive? How many of the strongest will be able to live on? One, two, or three? Even if they can endure the great destruction of the universe, when facing the predators lurking outside the universe, how many will be able to escape in the end? Entering the Gu Ming Chaos Continent, human civilization has been living under the protection of Lin Yuan. Without Lin Yuan, where would there be such an environment-friendly new homeland as the Star Tear Shard World?</p><p></p><p>"I have met the Great Saint of the Galaxy." The Venerable Gu Ming respectfully greeted and paid his respects after seeing Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, there was no need for him to hide anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Great Saint planning to open a new Chaos Continent?"</p><p></p><p>After a few compliments, the Venerable Gu Ming tentatively asked.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although the Venerable Gu Ming had speculated that Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a certain Great Saint, his strength was still at the Chaos Realm Venerable level at that time.</p><p></p><p>So even though Lin Yuan lived on the Gu Ming Chaos Continent, the Venerable Gu Ming, although under great pressure, could still accept it.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had revealed the level of an invincible Chaos Great Saint, and the Venerable Gu Ming suddenly felt an unprecedented pressure.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was an ant next to a giant dragon, deeply afraid that a single breath from the dragon would blow him far away.</p><p></p><p>"Open a Chaos Continent?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a while. Normally, those at the Chaos Realm would open a Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>One is to use it as their own cultivation ground, and the other is to review their understanding of the rules during the process of opening the Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Many Chaos Venerables and even Chaos Great Saints have often opened more than one Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>As for the peerless Great Saints, they would try to open the Postcelestial Universe.</p><p></p><p>"In a while, I will open one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was going to open a Chaos Continent, when he crossed into the realm of the peerless Great Saint, he could use the Chaos Continent as a foundation to open the Postcelestial Universe, without any waste or repetition.</p><p></p><p>"With the Great Saint's strength, once the Chaos Continent is opened, it is estimated that thousands or even tens of thousands of powerhouses from the surrounding void domains will be attracted." The Venerable Gu Ming said.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the one who opens a Chaos Continent, the more prosperous it will be. Of course, the "strong ones" here refer to the normal powerhouses, those who are inclined towards order.</p><p></p><p>As for those extremely eccentric Venerables and Great Saints, not many living beings dare to go to the Chaos Continents they have opened.</p><p></p><p>And according to the Venerable Gu Ming's understanding of Lin Yuan, he is certain that this Great Saint is not the kind of capricious one. In this case, the Chaos Continent he opens will definitely be very welcome.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Gu Ming himself even has the idea of moving to the vicinity of Lin Yuan's Chaos Continent, so that he can not only be safe, but also benefit from it.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Gu Ming Chaos Continent's Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The space-time began to twist and rotate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure walked out from within.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze around, and through the connection with the Yin Primordial Spirit, he immediately confirmed that he had returned to the Gu Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you can keep my secret."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the newly reconstituted Myriad Laws Eye and said.</p><p></p><p>His gains in the Xuanhuang Universe were truly too great. If outsiders did not know about his connection with the Xuanhuang lineage, they naturally would not think much of it. But once they knew, it might attract the attention of some peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I also don't want you to encounter any trouble."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye immediately said. It could be said to be the special existence in the Chaos Void that most hopes for Lin Yuan's smooth growth to the peak.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can the investment it made in the early stage be recouped.</p><p></p><p>Before that, the Myriad Laws Eye would even actively protect Lin Yuan and solve his troubles.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Star Tear Shard World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Primordial Spirit rose and actively merged into Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"I'm finally back."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, and his mind was joyful.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Xuanhuang Universe, his gains can be said to be unprecedented. The invincible Great Saint of Xuanhuang had given him all his accumulated achievements.</p><p></p><p>"This cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, and with a flip of his right hand, a faintly luminous glow enveloped a small cauldron that appeared.</p><p></p><p>The small cauldron was only the size of a palm, without the slightest aura leaking out, but Lin Yuan knew clearly that this was the result of the faintly luminous glow sealing and suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the faintly luminous glow was the infinite time loop power.</p><p></p><p>Only this kind of power involving the thirteenth level could barely seal this thirteenth-grade weapon.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor said that this cauldron can be comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully extended a thread of his spiritual sense, permeating into the interior of the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The faintly luminous glow that sealed and suppressed the cauldron did not prevent Lin Yuan's spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cauldron, Lin Yuan felt an immensely vast set of rules.</p><p></p><p>Vast as the sea of mist, intricate and perfect, no less than the rules of the Chaos Void all flowing and operating within the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Time and space?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan sensed the two main pillar rules in the cauldron: time and space.</p><p></p><p>The boundless and vast rules were basically all revolving around these two major rules.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>A large number of enlightened insights burst forth in Lin Yuan's mind. His previous accumulation of time and space, at this moment, underwent a qualitative change triggered by quantitative changes.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the time and space before Lin Yuan's eyes began to undergo earth-shattering transformations.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

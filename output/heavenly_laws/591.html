        <h1>Chapter 591</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is a matter of one's innate talent and natural aptitude.</p><p></p><p>And it is also a matter of external forces and influences.</p><p></p><p>Both are indispensable.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the latter may be even more important.</p><p></p><p>Without the assistance of external forces and resources, even if one's innate talent is strong, one will still encounter many detours.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, as long as there are sufficient external forces and resources, even if one's innate talent is average, the ultimate achievements will not be much lower.</p><p></p><p>Innate talent determines the upper limit.</p><p></p><p>While external forces and resources determine the lower limit.</p><p></p><p>In Chibo Wang's view, Lin Yuan's bloodline has regressed to the ancestral origins.</p><p></p><p>His innate talent needs no further elaboration - it is definitely top-tier and first-class.</p><p></p><p>But without relying on the abundant resources and guidance of the royal lineage of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, to grow to the limit on his own, and even to the point of defeating and killing the Spiritual Deity King, who is also at the pinnacle core of the royal family, is absolutely unprecedented. At least in the endless ages, the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom has never produced such a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>There have been cases in the past of ancient kingdom beings whose bloodlines regressed to the ancestral origins, and they eventually rose to prominence. </p><p></p><p>But the "rise" here refers to the subsequent rise after receiving focused cultivation from the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? Before today, Chibo Wang had never even heard of the name "Yinhe".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has risen without even having any contact with the royal family of the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>For a core royal family member to grow to the limit, isn't that already a rise? Let alone the fact that Lin Yuan not only grew to the limit, but just now also killed a fellow limit-level royal family member, the Spiritual Deity King.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe, you possess the Blazing Sun Divine Body and are a descendant of the ancestor. Now I formally invite you to join the lineage of our Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's royal family."</p><p></p><p>Chibo Wang calmed himself and immediately extended the invitation.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that Lin Yuan is a pure-blooded descendant of the Blazing Sun, Chibo Wang's first thought was to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>To completely bring Lin Yuan over to the side of the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>What a joke? With such a prodigy, not recruiting him and letting him go would be a regret for billions or trillions of years.</p><p></p><p>As for whether there might be any problems with Lin Yuan's identity, Chibo Wang didn't think much about it.</p><p></p><p>First, the rich Blazing Sun aura emanating from Lin Yuan is undoubtedly genuine.</p><p></p><p>Second, what problem could there be? The Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is one of the mightiest forces in this source world, no matter what karmic connections Lin Yuan has, they can handle it.</p><p></p><p>These two points are enough.</p><p></p><p>"Join the lineage of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Chibo Wang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without Chibo Wang's invitation, Lin Yuan had planned to visit the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom after some time.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is a 13th-level time life, which is the only confirmed 13th-level force that Lin Yuan currently has access to.</p><p></p><p>Of course, other ancient kingdoms are not within this scope.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, numerous Chaotic Saints and Peerless Saints are desperately searching for the traces of 13th-level time lives.</p><p></p><p>And in this source world, there is a clear opportunity for contact?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally would not miss this chance.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult threshold to break through from 12th-level perfection to the 13th-level is to traverse a cycle of time.</p><p></p><p>As for how to traverse the time cycle, whether there are any auxiliary means, the All-Seeing Eye frankly said there are none.</p><p></p><p>Propagating one's own evolutionary path, reinforcing anchors and signposts, to be precise, is not an auxiliary means.</p><p></p><p>But the All-Seeing Eye is only a secret treasure left by a 13th-level time life, and naturally cannot be compared to a true 13th-level life.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the All-Seeing Eye says there is no way does not mean that a true 13th-level time life has no way.</p><p></p><p>And improving the possibility of traversing the time cycle is still far away for the current Lin Yuan, whose true realm is only at the Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>Let's not discuss that for now.</p><p></p><p>The most direct and visible benefits are many, such as a wealth of inheritance resources, etc.</p><p></p><p>The importance of resources is beyond doubt, and inheritance is even more so.</p><p></p><p>The "Infinite Void" is a 13th-level inheritance, which has made Lin Yuan's foundation reach a terrifyingly horrific degree.</p><p></p><p>As a 13th-level time life, the Blazing Sun ancestor must have left corresponding 13th-level inheritances as well.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan were to obtain them, he would definitely be able to greatly enhance his strength foundation. Breakthrough to the 13th-level is still very far away, but enhancing his strength foundation? It is always needed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe, most of the powerful experts in this world, especially those Celestial Exalted Ones, have chosen to join one of the six ancient kingdoms. There is nothing shameful about this."</p><p></p><p>Chibo Wang said, "As for the other five ancient kingdoms, I won't discuss them. Our Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom has many inheritance treasures bestowed by the ancestor. How long would those Celestial Exalted Ones need to rely on their own cultivation to advance further? And whether they can ultimately succeed is another matter."</p><p></p><p>"But by joining and pledging allegiance to our Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, there is clear inheritance guidance, which makes it much easier."</p><p></p><p>Chibo Wang looked at Lin Yuan and continued, "Some Grand Exalted Ones are unwilling to be constrained, so they have not chosen to join any ancient kingdom. But as for Celestial Exalted Ones? There are almost no neutral Celestial Exalted Ones, they have all taken sides with one ancient kingdom or another."</p><p></p><p>"I know this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Like Grand Exalted Ones such as Red Leaf and Fire Axe, they have not received the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's enfeoffment.</p><p></p><p>And this is already the limit of the neutral camp's powerful experts. Without joining any ancient kingdom, the possibility of them crossing into Celestial Exalted One realm is negligible.</p><p></p><p>Even if they miraculously become Celestial Exalted Ones, after realizing that the cultivation of Celestial Exalted Ones is infinitely more difficult than that of Grand Exalted Ones, they will consciously join some ancient kingdom and seek further advancement.</p><p></p><p>"If Brother Yinhe is willing to join our royal family lineage, I will personally report to the Emperor, and the cultivation resources and guidance you receive will be the most top-tier."</p><p></p><p>Chibo Wang immediately guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Unlike those Celestial Exalted Ones who have pledged allegiance and joined, Lin Yuan's ancestral bloodline is rich, reaching the level of core royal family. He is naturally bound to the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The ancient kingdom's royal family will certainly hold back when it comes to those Celestial Exalted Ones who have pledged allegiance. Even if they grant inheritances, it is impossible to be the most top-tier and core ones.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is different. </p><p></p><p>As fellow royal family members, and both being core royal family members, as long as Lin Yuan is willing to join the royal family lineage, his status and treatment will far surpass those pledged Celestial Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'm willing to join."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hesitate and nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the benefits of joining the ancient kingdom's royal family seem to far outweigh the drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>The only hidden danger is that Lin Yuan is not a true core royal family bloodline.</p><p></p><p>However, ever since he fused and devoured the "Blazing Sun Source" within his cosmic universe, the Blazing Sun radiance has spread throughout his entire body, continuously absorbing the light of the true eternal Blazing Sun outside.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Blazing Sun bloodline is also rapidly becoming more pure, and it has almost reached the standard of a normal royal family bloodline by now.</p><p></p><p>After some time, the transformation to the concentration of a core royal family bloodline should not be a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability "Opening the Heavens with Blazing Sun" is the innate technique of the Blazing Sun ancestor. By constantly activating this divine ability, he can self-refine the Blazing Sun bloodline within him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this refinement and purification of the bloodline is only effective in this source world.</p><p></p><p>As for his true body's primordial spirit in the Chaotic Void, it is useless.</p><p></p><p>First, the true body's primordial spirit in the Chaotic Void does not possess the Blazing Sun bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The so-called bloodline refinement requires the existence of this bloodline in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Second, the Chaotic Void does not have the eternal Blazing Sun above the firmament of this source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can feel that the Blazing Sun bloodline within him...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purification and tempering mainly came from the eternal and brilliant radiance of the sun above the celestial vault. "Good! Good!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing Lin Yuan's agreement, the Crimson Treasure King couldn't help but reveal a smile on his face. "With Brother Yinhe's participation, the future of my royal clan will be able to vent its anger thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"Vent its anger?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Crimson Treasure King.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe has not been in contact with the royal clan, so it's normal that you don't know." The Crimson Treasure King explained, "The competition within the Scorching Sun Ancient Country is also very fierce."</p><p></p><p>"It's mainly the competition between the royal clan and those Celestial Exalts."</p><p></p><p>"The most precious resources are limited, and both the royal clan and the Celestial Exalts want them."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Celestial Exalts' ancestral bloodline is not as strong, their strength is formidable, and their voice in the capital is not low."</p><p></p><p>"If every generation of the ancient country's emperor didn't have to possess the royal clan's bloodline, perhaps our royal clan would be suppressed by those Celestial Exalts."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King sighed.</p><p></p><p>This matter is also not easy to manage, as it belongs to the internal affairs of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country. After all, the vast majority of Celestial Exalts also have the bloodline of the Scorching Sun ancestor, although it is a bit diluted, but they are still the descendants of the ancestor.</p><p></p><p>If it were an external enemy invasion, the ancestor could be asked to intervene and sweep them away, but for the competition between the same bloodline? The ancestor is too lazy to get involved.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became enlightened.</p><p></p><p>He had heard long ago that the Celestial Exalts looked down on the ancient country's royal clan.</p><p></p><p>This "looking down" here is probably not just a simple disdain, but also a conflict of interest.</p><p></p><p>The supreme power of the ancient country is basically in the hands of the emperor, and as the emperor, he will naturally favor his own clan, but he cannot be too biased, otherwise, it will provoke those Celestial Exalts, which would be difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the wars between ancient countries, if the Celestial Exalts of a certain ancient country collectively slacked off, it would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>So, for the sake of the overall situation, every generation of ancient country's emperor tries to maintain a certain fairness between the royal clan and the Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the core inheritance and resources of the ancient country are only eligible for competition by the royal clan, and this is also the greatest advantage of being a member of the royal clan.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that the Celestial Exalts look down on the royal clan.</p><p></p><p>"However, with your talent, Brother Yinhe, once you join the royal clan lineage and gain access to our royal clan's true inheritance and resources, you will undoubtedly make rapid progress and may be able to break through the shackles of the Celestial Exalts in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King looked at Lin Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "shackles of the Celestial Exalts" refers to the iron rule that the royal clan cannot cross into the realm of the Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>So far, no member of the ancient country's royal clan has crossed into the realm of the Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason for the constant struggle between the royal clan and the Celestial Exalts in the ancient country.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, except for the emperor and a few royal clan members who possess the ancient country's foundation, the strength of the Celestial Exalts' side is overwhelming compared to the royal clan.</p><p></p><p>If the royal clan could produce a Celestial Exalt, the situation between the two sides would be completely rewritten.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do my best."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Doing your best is enough."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King grinned, having great expectations for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Without any prior exposure to the royal clan's cultivation, Lin Yuan has already grown to this extent. Once he gains access to the royal clan's inheritance and resources, who knows what he can achieve? Any powerful figure, whether from the royal clan or the later-joined Celestial Exalts, will experience a period of rapid progress after just coming into contact with the royal clan's inheritance.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King and Lin Yuan discussed many internal affairs of the royal clan in detail, and then the Crimson Treasure King asked with some curiosity, "Crimson Jade showed me the image of your battle with the Spiritual Deity King."</p><p></p><p>"Since you were able to kill the Spiritual Deity King, I suppose you have made great progress in breaking through the shackles of the Celestial Exalts."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you could spar with me, so that I can witness your strength?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King looked at Lin Yuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>He was not doubting Lin Yuan's strength, as the fact that he killed the Spiritual Deity King was witnessed by many people and could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King, as the core member of the Great Spirit Ancient Country's royal clan, would not have staged a performance with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King was simply curious about Lin Yuan's strength, as he himself had also grown to the limit as a core royal clan member, and knew the difficulty of further advancement at this level.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see the techniques of the core royal clan members who had reached the limit in the Scorching Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Although the Spiritual Deity King was an ultimate core royal clan member, he belonged to the Great Spirit Ancient Country, and the core royal clan techniques of each ancient country might not be the same.</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's go to a higher spatial realm."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two of them arrived in a higher spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>The area here was vast, and even the aftershocks of battles between Celestial Exalts would be greatly diminished upon reaching the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yinhe, I'm making my move."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King's figure became blurred, and suddenly a great sun coalesced.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and the Scorching Sun Divine Body activated on its own, forming a vast Scorching Sun world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King also began to activate his Scorching Sun Divine Body, forming a Scorching Sun world as well. The two Scorching Sun worlds collided and clashed.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Divine Body is the strongest physique in the Scorching Sun Ancient Country. The Scorching Sun world formed by the activation of each powerful Scorching Sun Divine Body is not entirely the same, but the general aspects are similar.</p><p></p><p>For example, the ability to form a Scorching Sun world is something that all powerful Scorching Sun Divine Body cultivators possess.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Scorching Sun world is related to the foundation of the Scorching Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! The two massive Scorching Sun worlds continued to collide, and it was clear that the Scorching Sun world formed by Lin Yuan was much stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the solemn-faced Crimson Treasure King and slightly increased the strength of his Scorching Sun world.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Scorching Sun world depends on the foundation of the Scorching Sun Divine Body, as well as the cultivator's own roots.</p><p></p><p>The roots are the foundation, and with the fusion and devouring of the Scorching Sun source within his body, Lin Yuan's roots have become unprecedentedly powerful. Not only his Scorching Sun world, but even his most ordinary punch could unleash earth-shattering power.</p><p></p><p>The "Infinite Void" inheritance has enhanced Lin Yuan's overall capabilities, not just limited to a certain aspect.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King's expression changed slightly. He could clearly feel the increasing pressure from Lin Yuan's Scorching Sun world, and his own Scorching Sun world was starting to become distorted and deformed under the oppression.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of foundation is this, to make the Scorching Sun world so strong?" The Crimson Treasure King was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he still thought that Lin Yuan's effortless killing of the Spiritual Deity King might have involved some one-time techniques.</p><p></p><p>But now, through the collision of their Scorching Sun worlds, he no longer had that idea.</p><p></p><p>The collision of the Scorching Sun worlds was a pure contest of foundations, without any tricks.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Scorching Sun world originates from the Scorching Sun Divine Body, and the Scorching Sun Divine Body in turn originates from one's own self. External forces can enhance offensive and defensive capabilities, but they cannot directly enhance the Scorching Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"I concede, Brother Yinhe."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King persisted for a while, but in the end, he could no longer hold on. If he continued, he would have to resort to lethal techniques, which would go against the purpose of the sparring.</p><p></p><p>So the Crimson Treasure King unhesitatingly said, "I concede."</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

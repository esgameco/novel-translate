        <h1>Chapter 651</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of "Infinite Void" has existed for countless years, experienced by one generation of cultivators after another. There were no shortage of those who cultivated it to the fifth layer, becoming invincible great saints who could overlook the entire chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was very aware of the oppressive aura of the invincible great saints, but compared to the current situation, it was still slightly less.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child kept observing and her thoughts expanded. Her first thought was whether Lin Yuan had become an invincible great saint?</p><p></p><p>But she immediately denied it. Firstly, Lin Yuan was not even in the Chaos Realm, let alone an invincible great saint. Secondly, the cosmic space-time she sensed within him had not undergone a more detailed and microscopic-level reconstruction.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that he had not yet cultivated the third layer of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>In this case, the red-robed girl child was curious about what method Lin Yuan had used to undergo such a transformation that even she felt a sense of oppression from? Had he cultivated the second of the Thirteen Inheritance Scriptures?</p><p></p><p>Here, "cultivating" does not mean just entering the door, but at least reaching the fifth layer, just like "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>But this is also as difficult as ascending to the heavens. The Thirteen Inheritance Scriptures are not common cabbages that one can just cultivate. Each of the Thirteen Inheritance Scriptures has a large number of prerequisite requirements.</p><p></p><p>This can be seen from the fact that Lin Yuan has been cultivating "Infinite Void" for so many years, but is still only at the second layer.</p><p></p><p>And the red-robed girl child had a vague feeling that the oppressive aura she had just sensed was absolutely not due to the power transformation from cultivating a certain inheritance.</p><p></p><p>This oppressive aura was related to the essence of life or the self-dao's transformation and sublimation, such as the ultimate leap from the Eleventh Realm of Life to the Twelfth Realm, or the extreme sublimation of the Dao he walked.</p><p></p><p>The giant egg formed by the Chaos Rule Veins was now crumbling piece by piece, and a large amount of intertwined black and white power spilled out and converged in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Chaos Power Dao that I have evolved?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the black and white powers before him, feeling both familiar and unfamiliar. This was a completely new rule power that he had never grasped before, but Lin Yuan had a sense of innate familiarity.</p><p></p><p>The large amount of black and white powers kept interweaving and fusing. Each strand of black and white power contained the essence of the countless rules that Lin Yuan had mastered. Finally, as the Chaos giant egg was completely shattered, all the black and white powers converged into a Taiji diagram of black and white intertwining.</p><p></p><p>The white part contained the infinite solar power, the most rigid and yang.</p><p>The black part was the flowing and endless yin power.</p><p></p><p>The yin and yang powers formed a perfect balance, fusing and separating in every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble~~~"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Taiji diagram before him, Lin Yuan felt his consciousness roaring. In the moment the Taiji diagram formed, a miniature Taiji diagram imprint appeared between his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Not only the incarnation of the cosmic universe within him, but also his true body, his divine incarnations throughout the Chaotic Void, all converged a Taiji diagram imprint between his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Taiji?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze became more distant and profound than ever before. The black and white intertwining Taiji diagram in front of him instantly expanded countless times, merging and integrating with the entire cosmic universe within him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's cosmic universe was measured in tens of billions of light-years, but the Taiji diagram expanded to completely cover it in less than an instant, the moment the thought arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Thought arises, and it is already done.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the boundless Taiji diagram merged and integrated with the cosmic universe within him, the cosmic universe began to undergo a transformation. The space-time became more perfect, the Dao rules rapidly improved, and the size of the cosmic universe even began to expand frantically.</p><p></p><p>Why are those who have evolved the Chaos Power Dao called Great Saints in the Chaotic Void? Otherwise, they would be called Venerable Ones? Because the strength of a Chaos Great Saint far surpasses that of a Chaos Venerable One, and this superiority is all-encompassing, stemming from the evolved Chaos Power Dao.</p><p></p><p>For a Chaos Great Saint who has evolved the Chaos Power Dao, everything about themselves will be nourished by the Chaos Power Dao - their physical body, spirit, soul, will, and cosmic universe will all be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although Lin Yuan was not yet a perfected Chaos Realm cultivator, the Chaos Taiji Dao had already evolved smoothly. Naturally, it would bring about an all-round transformation and enhancement to himself.</p><p></p><p>The changes in his cosmic universe were immediately sensed by the red-robed girl child.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of change?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of the cosmic universe now was not the kind of transformation from cultivating "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>The essence of "Infinite Void" was to reorganize the most microscopic part of the cosmic universe, like turning carbon into diamond, where the particle composition is still the same.</p><p></p><p>But the current transformation of the cosmic universe was a transformation at the most intuitive level, from one to two to hundreds to thousands to millions.</p><p></p><p>Everything was being sublimated and transformed, like the sky rising and the clouds flying.</p><p></p><p>"Has he awakened the Chaos Evolution Power Dao?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red-robed girl child finally deduced the key information. The methods that could cause such drastic transformation of the cosmic universe in a short time were limited, mainly just entering the Chaos Realm or evolving the Chaos Power Dao.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Chaos Power Dao has he evolved to cause such a commotion?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child took a deep breath. She was well aware of Lin Yuan's talent and potential, and had no doubt about her new master evolving a Chaos Power Dao.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The magnitude of the cosmic universe's enhancement, as well as the immense oppressive aura she felt, made her doubt her own cognition.</p><p></p><p>What kind of Chaos Evolution Dao could have such might even in its nascent stage?</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Galactic Chaotic Continent, outside the world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in the process of his all-round transformation, feeling the Chaos Taiji Dao supporting everything like a towering pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Taiji diagram imprint between his eyebrows slowly rotated, and a mysterious fluctuation radiated out from him -</p><p></p><p>Towards all directions,</p><p>Towards the heavens and the earth,</p><p>Towards the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Is this imprinting my Dao onto this Chaotic Void?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful. Any birth of a Chaos Great Saint would go through this process, imprinting their Dao onto the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"It can be considered a kind of anchor, a Dao marker." Lin Yuan did not stop it. Imprinting his Dao onto the Chaos would establish a connection with the Chaotic Void. In the future, when he encountered time loops, this connection could play a certain role.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was this imprinting of his Dao onto the Chaos, or the propagation of the evolutionary path of his own Dao, the purpose was to establish anchors and Dao markers.</p><p></p><p>But to ultimately break through the time loops, the main thing was to rely on oneself. These methods could only play an auxiliary role at most.</p><p></p><p>However, for Lin Yuan, he would not miss any means to assist in breaking through the time loops, trying to utilize external conditions as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Raise it to the highest level before talking about anything else.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Taiji Dao quickly merged into the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The special existences hidden in various secret places of the Chaos Void seemed to have sensed something and looked towards the direction of the Milky Way Chaos Continent from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Has a Chaos Great Saint been born, and is he imprinting his Dao on the Chaos?"</p><p></p><p>"A new Chaos evolutionary power path has been born, but is this kind of Chaos power path truly newly born? How can it be much more terrifying than some supreme Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>The special existences were all somewhat unbelieving.</p><p></p><p>As special existences, they were basically related to the 13th Realm, such as the Eyes of All Laws, the spirits of various great mysterious places, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely ancient, witnessing the rise and fall of one Chaos Great Saint, supreme Great Saint, and even invincible Great Saint after another. The imprinting of an ordinary Chaos Great Saint's Dao on the Chaos did not attract their attention at all.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, as the Chaos Taiji Dao continued to spread and imprint, the entire Chaos Void was undergoing some subtle changes, and this change was so significant that it startled many special existences.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Milky Way Great Saint. Not long ago, he suppressed several other Chaos Great Saints in the Xuanhuang Universe, and at that time, his strength was only approaching that of a supreme Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>A special existence immediately recognized Lin Yuan, the one with the long sword broken into two pieces: "This Milky Way Great Saint should have cultivated the 13th Realm inheritance left behind, so he was able to sweep away the other Chaos Great Saints without having evolved a Chaos power path."</p><p></p><p>"Is it that inheritance? Indeed remarkable, but without evolving a Chaos power path, he could already approach a supreme Great Saint. Now that he has evolved a Chaos power path, and such a powerful Chaos power path, wouldn't he directly become a supreme Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>The many special existences discussed with each other. The eons they had experienced were too long, and they had little interest in ordinary Great Saints, but as for invincible Great Saints? Only one was born in a long cosmic history, and every invincible Great Saint would leave a unique mark in the Chaos Void, naturally making these special existences look up to them.</p><p></p><p>Especially for an exceptional invincible Great Saint like Lin Yuan? He just evolved a Chaos power path, and he's already an invincible Great Saint? Such a rapid transformation and evolution might not have happened since the birth of the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>"As long as this Milky Way Great Saint doesn't encounter any accidents and continues to grow smoothly, he will be able to rank among the top five, or even the top three, among all the invincible Great Saints in the history of this Chaos Void."</p><p></p><p>A special existence exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The condition for the birth of an invincible Great Saint was to sweep away all the Great Saints of the time, making many Great Saints submit to him wholeheartedly. So theoretically, there would be no scene of two invincible Great Saints fighting and deciding the winner.</p><p></p><p>But in the minds of many special existences, they had already ranked the invincible Great Saints that had appeared before. Without exception, Lin Yuan's current performance, even among the invincible Great Saints, was extremely stunning and even unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Among the many special existences, the Eyes of All Laws was deeply moved. He had already determined that Lin Yuan would at least become an invincible Great Saint in the future, but this day had come too fast. And if he continued to grow smoothly, he would rank among the top five or even the top three among the invincible Great Saints in the history of the Chaos Void? Don't underestimate this top five or top three, the Chaos Void had experienced endless eons and nurtured countless monstrous and abnormal lives, and to be able to rank among the top five or even the top three was already shocking enough.</p><p></p><p>This also included some special periods when the 13th Realm time lives were interested and personally went out to cultivate disciples, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Milky Way Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>After evolving the Chaos power path, Lin Yuan's perception had been greatly enhanced. In the moment of imprinting his Dao on the Chaos, he sensed some faint peeping.</p><p></p><p>"Are those special existences?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't pay too much attention to it. Whether it was the Master of the Magic Jade Tower or the Mysterious Emperor, he only had a sense of vigilance towards these special existences, but not a trace of fear.</p><p></p><p>Because these special existences could not take the initiative to act, as long as you don't provoke them, there won't be any problems. Even if you do provoke them, it's not certain that you will attract the attention of the 13th Realm time lives behind them.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. After the initial violent transformation, his rate of improvement had gradually slowed down, but even with the slowdown, it was still at a speed that ordinary Chaos Great Saints could not catch up to.</p><p></p><p>The degree of improvement obtained by a Chaos Great Saint after evolving a Chaos power path depends on the Chaos power path itself. The Chaos power paths of most Chaos Great Saints, although different, are not too large, so their improvements are also similar.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite requirement for the evolution of the Chaos Taiji Dao - the Chaos Dual Realm rule comprehension, has already made almost all Chaos Great Saints unreachable.</p><p></p><p>Here, the Chaos Dual Realm peak is only for Lin Yuan. For other beings, without extraordinary insight, they would need to reach the Chaos Triple Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Next to the Jade Gourd, the red-robed girl stood there, feeling the changes of the space-time Dao in every moment, and she didn't know what to say for a while.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure coalesced beside her, and he smiled at the red-robed girl.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Chaos power path did you evolve?" the red-robed girl couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of Chaos power path?" Lin Yuan fell into brief contemplation, then said, "I call it the Chaos Taiji."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl saw Lin Yuan raise his right hand, and the black and white aura intertwined, and although it was only woven between his fingers, its influence radiated to the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Taiji? This should be the most powerful Chaos power path I've ever seen."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl said, and as if she thought of something, she quickly added, "Excluding the old master."</p><p></p><p>The "old master" she mentioned was naturally the creator of "Infinite Void", the 13th Realm time life.</p><p></p><p>"I naturally cannot be compared to the great time life." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head with a smile. The more he cultivated, the more he could feel the gap between himself and the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehended the 13th Realm weapon Heavenly Void Cauldron, and felt the remnant imprints deep within, knowing that a trace of the power of the 13th Realm time life could completely destroy tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of void domains.</p><p></p><p>"Is there still Eternal Primal Gold?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the red-robed girl and asked.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Primal Gold was a special metal material used to measure the strength of the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when Lin Yuan cultivated to the second layer of "Infinite Void", he used this metal to measure the level of his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"There is still some left." The red-robed girl nodded. "What do you want the Eternal Primal Gold for?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and calmly replied, "I want to know how strong I am now."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"One-fifth of the aurora is not too much for human civilization." </p><p></p><p>The ancient supreme being spoke calmly, but eight other supreme beings' auras were unrestrained in this twisted space-time.</p><p></p><p>The other more than ten supreme beings looked at each other.  </p><p></p><p>Behind them stood other ultimates, but the combat power of the nine supreme beings of human civilization was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Very well then."</p><p></p><p>The unicorn supreme being finally compromised. </p><p></p><p>No choice.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't feed human civilization first, the subsequent division could not be completed.</p><p></p><p>The ancient supreme being waved his hand and took away one-fifth of that aurora, then disappeared from this space-time.</p><p></p><p>After the ancient supreme being left, the eight auras of the human civilization supreme beings also quickly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"My Tengu clan also suffered heavy losses," said the Tengu clan progenitor slowly, wanting to replicate human civilization's previous actions by taking away part of the aurora first.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization domain:</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings rapidly communicated with their spiritual wills.</p><p></p><p>"This segment of the aurora contains profound karmic killing power. Before refining it into an ultimate weapon, we can let those talented evolvors perceive it."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the karmic rules, though not a pillar rule, are the most mysterious and special rules. The more comprehension of karmic rules, the better with no downside."</p><p></p><p>"Then let me refine this segment of the aurora."  </p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings quickly determined the use for the aurora - to refine it into an ultimate weapon. But before that, they could properly let some talented human civilization descendants sense the aurora's primordial aura up close.</p><p></p><p>In Xia Qin Supreme Being's personal world:</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin sat on his throne, seeming deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being," Lin Yuan slightly bowed.  </p><p></p><p>The more he cultivated, the more Lin Yuan felt the greatness of the supreme beings. This greatness went far beyond just strength - their very essence of life, the heights they stood at, were unreachable by lives in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan with a smile. "How has your cultivation been going recently? Any bottlenecks?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin cared greatly about Lin Yuan, for in his eyes, Lin Yuan was the most likely evolver of this era of human civilization to break through to the ultimate realm. </p><p></p><p>If human civilization could give birth to a tenth supreme being, the pressure they bore would naturally be reduced.</p><p></p><p>"It's going well," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>More than well, in fact.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years ago, Lin Yuan had only comprehended two pillar-level fusion rules.  </p><p></p><p>But now, he grasped six pillar-level fusion rules, with the life-death reincarnation rule even reaching the second level, and the great destruction rule nearing the second level as well.</p><p></p><p>Achievements that ordinary tenth-level evolvors couldn't reach in hundreds of millions of years, Lin Yuan had accomplished in just fifty years.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that besides comprehending fusion rules, Lin Yuan had also made great progress in the space rules, time rules, and the three secret dharma protections of the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's going well," Xia Qin didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>The path of evolution was a very private matter. With Lin Yuan's talents and aptitude, he had already walked out on a path of his own. For Xia Qin to forcefully intervene would not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>What Xia Qin could do now was to resolve Lin Yuan's worries as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"In a while, there will be an opportunity to perceive the primordial body of that aurora segment. I will let you go," Xia Qin said directly.</p><p></p><p>"The primordial aurora body?"</p><p></p><p>"The aurora that shattered the large alien battlefield numbered A076?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Xia Qin nodded.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this matter.</p><p></p><p>"After negotiations between our human civilization and those alien supreme beings, we ultimately obtained one-fifth of that entire aurora segment."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>"Negotiations? One-fifth?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Among peak clans, strength reigned supreme. Negotiations? Negotiate what?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, one-fifth? According to what Lin Yuan knew, over ten supreme beings had participated in blocking that aurora initially.</p><p></p><p>And that didn't include the supreme beings who wanted a share later on.</p><p></p><p>For human civilization to directly get one-fifth, that was extremely domineering.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being, where did this aurora come from?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He knew that aurora came from outside the permanent space crevice, from the chaotic void.  </p><p></p><p>But exactly where, and why such an "aurora" existence would be born, Lin Yuan didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"This aurora should come from the 'Taiyan Ruins'," Xia Qin pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Taiyan Ruins?" Lin Yuan was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, among the areas detected within the chaotic void so far, the Taiyan Ruins rank among the nine great danger zones," Xia Qin said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan obediently listened.</p><p></p><p>It was clear Xia Qin was no longer limited to just the universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyan Ruins are very dangerous?" Lin Yuan noticed Xia Qin used "danger zone" to describe the Taiyan Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally dangerous, extremely dangerous," Xia Qin nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Even for twelfth-level lifeforms..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"With a single misstep, one could completely fall into the depths of the Taiyuan Ruins," said the Paramount Xia Qinzhi. </p><p></p><p>Even the dangers of the Taiyuan Ruins were not limited to just within the ruins themselves, but also the many forbidden items that occasionally spewed forth from the deep recesses of the ruins.</p><p></p><p>These forbidden items had varying degrees of influence, immeasurable in scale.</p><p></p><p>"In the universe, twelfth-stage lifeforms are invincible, at most just heavily injured," Xia Qinzhi said with a tone of contemplation. "But outside the universe, in the chaos of the void, even twelfth-stage lifeforms have the possibility of death."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A hundred or two hundred years ago, that corpse of a paramount that had drifted in from outside the universe had made Lin Yuan realize that even paramounts could die.</p><p></p><p>Paramounts had merely stepped out of the river of time, without lifespan limits, but that did not mean they were immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, while the chaotic void has dangers, it also has opportunities. For us twelfth-stage beings, the only slim chance to further evolve into perfect time-lifeforms lies in the chaotic void," Xia Qinzhi said.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect time-lifeforms?" Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-stage lifeforms were also called multi-spatial lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>From the ninth to the eleventh stage, they were all multi-spatial lifeforms molting towards becoming time-lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Until crossing into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth stage was the ultimate, barely qualifying as a semi-time-lifeform.</p><p></p><p>They occupied the past and present, wandering on the 'shores' of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>But even ultimate existences still had aspirations, which was to molt into perfect time-lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the goal of twelfth-stage ultimate existences was to attempt to occupy the future.</p><p></p><p>Only lifeforms that simultaneously occupied the past, present, and future qualified as perfect time-lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>It was said that perfect time-lifeforms could see the endless distant future with a single glance, and could also return to the ancient past.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as a perfect time-lifeform was willing, it could completely change past history and mold the future into whatever it wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, Lin Yuan had never heard of the existence of any perfect time-lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuanhuang Emperor and the Lord of Mojuyue Palace could not be considered perfect time-lifeforms - they were simply more powerful than most other twelfth-stage ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"The chaotic void holds great opportunity, but unfortunately, we lifeforms within the universe, even at the twelfth stage, cannot leave," Xia Qinzhi sighed, as if recalling something.</p><p></p><p>"Cannot leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The permanent spatial rift was right there.</p><p></p><p>Why could they not leave?</p><p></p><p>"The universe has a will of its own. We twelfth-stage beings have devoured so much universal energy that if we were to break free of the universe and go to the chaotic void, we would inevitably be forcefully obstructed by the universe's will," Xia Qinzhi explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>"So, the only chance for us to go to the chaotic void is to wait until the end of this universal epoch when everything is destroyed."</p><p></p><p>There was a subtle shift in Xia Qinzhi's tone.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, things were not as simple as he described.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the universal epoch when everything collapsed, the paramounts would have to endure through it in order to completely break free of the universe's constraints.</p><p></p><p>If they could not endure, they would meet their end along with the universe.</p><p></p><p>However, after the universe's destruction, there would be rebirth, which the paramounts did not have the ability for.</p><p></p><p>When paramounts ended along with the universe, all their existence would dissolve into the most primordial chaotic forces to support the birth of the next universal epoch.</p><p></p><p>Normally, of the ten twelfth-stage ultimates, at most only half could endure through the end of the universal epoch.</p><p></p><p>Only the twelfth-stage ultimates that endured the end of the universal epoch would have the fortitude to venture into the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Xia Qinzhi's personal world, Lin Yuan's mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>This time, from Xia Qinzhi's mouth, he had learned much higher-level information.</p><p></p><p>Such as the nine great dangers of the chaotic void?</p><p></p><p>And the limitations paramounts faced within the universe?</p><p></p><p>"These things are still too far away for me," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, then stopped thinking about it further.</p><p></p><p>He was only at the tenth stage now, still a long way from the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>As for the end of the universal epoch?</p><p></p><p>According to Xia Qinzhi's estimate, from the birth of the universe until now, only one-tenth of the universal epoch had passed.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there were still nine-tenths of the universal epoch remaining until the end - calculated in years, that was an unfathomable number of trillion trillion trillion years.</p><p></p><p>The time Lin Yuan had spent in the main universe so far was less than two hundred years.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the universe Lin Yuan was in, in the hazy gaseous chaos of the void, a 'white paper' was speeding in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>If observed carefully, one would realize that this 'white paper' seemed to lack the concept of 'thickness', only possessing length and width.</p><p></p><p>Within the 'white paper', mist swirled, vaguely containing a vast world.</p><p></p><p>The entire 'white paper' was like a beautiful and mysterious painting scroll.</p><p></p><p>Yet incredibly, wherever the 'white paper' passed, the space of the chaotic void began to collapse, rapidly losing its spatial thickness, with even time becoming abnormally narrow, as if suddenly dropping from three dimensions to two.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, that 'white paper' disappeared into the turbulent chaotic currents.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 452: Shift (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Galactic Overlord has other opportunities?" </p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin Grandmaster responded.</p><p></p><p>It was truly the divine ability 'World' activated by Lin Yuan that possessed an inconceivable power, completely exceeding the understanding of the Grandmasters towards the Eleventh Realm existences.</p><p></p><p>So in the eyes of the numerous Twelfth Realm ultimate existences, Lin Yuan must have relied on external means, impossible to accomplish that feat through his own power alone.</p><p></p><p>Even the nine Grandmasters of human civilization instinctively thought so, for they had indeed witnessed the earth-shattering phenomenon when Lin Yuan stepped into the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>But without reaching the Twelfth Realm, no matter how profound one's foundation is, they are still lives within the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on oneself, one cannot exert the terrifying power that far surpasses the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Actually, the Grandmasters' thoughts were not entirely wrong.</p><p></p><p>Without the divine ability 'World', even if Lin Yuan's strength could sweep through many Eleventh Realm experts, it would still require a tremendous amount of time.</p><p></p><p>If tens of thousands of Eleventh Realm experts scattered, Lin Yuan truly had no way to deal with them, after all, he was not a Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability 'World' allowed Lin Yuan to fully unleash his greatest advantage. With his inner world enhanced over 20 times by the mysterious gourd, and having gone through the scrutiny of the Chaotic Void Origin twice, these various factors led to the divine ability 'World' exceeding its standard power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the terrifying power of the divine ability 'World' was entirely due to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it were other experts, even Eleventh Realm Legendary existences, possessing the exact same 'World' divine ability as Lin Yuan, they would not be able to cause such destructive power.</p><p></p><p>An Eleventh Realm Legendary existence's inner world at most spans only a few million miles, even if they mastered the 'World' divine ability, what difference would it make?</p><p></p><p>"Probably." </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Grandmaster nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He also agreed with Xia Qin Grandmaster's view that the Galactic Overlord must have other opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord has truly brought us a great surprise."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Grandmaster glanced at the distant group of Eleventh Realm peak forces' Grandmasters, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>No matter on what scale the battlefield, when the Human Civilization Alliance clashed with other peak force factions, it usually required a brutal fight, consuming a huge amount of time for both sides to gain victory or ultimately be defeated.</p><p></p><p>Like just now, the confrontation had just begun, yet it already had an air of conclusion, which was the first time the Human Civilization had experienced.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, those fellows seem to be starting to join hands."</p><p></p><p>The Xushen Grandmaster suddenly spoke, his voice sounding in the ears of the other eight Grandmasters of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>At this time, apart from the Human Civilization, the Insect Clan, Tianyu Clan, Star Alliance and other peak force factions' Twelfth Realm ultimate existences were quickly exchanging information.</p><p></p><p>Even the usually arrogant Juexing Clan's Grandmasters had a slight change in their expressions, apparently also joining the exchange.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xushen Grandmaster did not know the specific content they were discussing, he was certain it was related to the Human Civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Normal." </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Grandmaster's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Just like in past wars, towards the later stages, other force factions would often join hands to confront the Juexing Clan's experts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, due to the Galactic Overlord's display of extraordinary combat power, he had naturally replaced the former 'Juexing Clan' and become the target of all the peak force factions' joint efforts.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Grandmaster was not surprised by this. If it were other peak force factions, and a figure similar to the Galactic Overlord appeared, the Human Civilization Alliance would also choose to join hands, not fight alone.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the core battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure suddenly appeared, carefully observing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"I remember the Insect Clan's Matriarch, carrying the Clan Pacifier Weapon 'Nightmare Realm', fled in this direction in the end."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned every inch of space, his eyes penetrating the layers of space, continuously searching for the traces of that strongest Eleventh Realm Insect Clan expert.</p><p></p><p>In the central battlefield, after annihilating tens of thousands of foreign Eleventh Realm experts,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had given a few instructions to Xuanyuan, Yu and the other human civilization Evolveds.</p><p></p><p>He then personally pursued and hunted down those over 20 strongest Eleventh Realm experts who had escaped the range of the 'World' divine ability using the Clan Pacifier Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was quite wary of the Clan Pacifier Weapons, which contained Twelfth Realm ultimate methods within.</p><p></p><p>But even without the Clan Pacifier Weapons, killing those strongest Eleventh Realm experts would still be a loss for the foreign factions.</p><p></p><p>Even if he only killed their projections, it could still weaken their foundations, as creating projections was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense the last remaining causal traces of the Insect Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm expert in this area, but I'm not sure exactly where."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, the ability to evade his perception must be due to that Clan Pacifier Weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's try the next one."</p><p></p><p>After sensing for nearly half a day without any results, Lin Yuan directly turned and left.</p><p></p><p>There were over 20 strongest Eleventh Realm experts who had escaped, and since he couldn't find the Insect Clan one for now, he might as well switch to the next target.</p><p></p><p>Long after Lin Yuan's departure.</p><p></p><p>Hiding in a certain spatial layer with the aid of the Clan Pacifier Weapon 'Nightmare Realm', the Insect Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm expert heaved a huge sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"How can this Galactic Overlord be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm expert was still trembling inwardly. The greatest effect of the Nightmare Realm was to suppress all spiritual power, even in the hands of Grandmasters it was the same.</p><p></p><p>But now, she had to use the Nightmare Realm to conceal her aura and hide herself, which was something the Eleventh Realm Insect Clan experts who had possessed the Nightmare Realm had probably never tried before.</p><p></p><p>As a Clan Pacifier Weapon, at the Eleventh Realm level, it was basically unstoppable, even when facing the Juexing Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm experts, relying on the Nightmare Realm, they could defend and resist.</p><p></p><p>But now, to become a stray dog, this was the first time.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the Matriarchs are thinking now, how should we deal with the Galactic Overlord." Even though the Galactic Overlord had left, the Insect Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm expert did not dare to move a muscle, quickly pondering in her heart.</p><p></p><p>On another part of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand, and the space rippled like a 'Milky Way', a stunningly beautiful woman with twenty pairs of wings squeezed out from the spatial crevice.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind flickered, and space converged from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu's expression changed drastically, the holy angel crown on her head emitting an extremely sacred light, piercing through the many layers of space, gathering Twelfth Realm power from all directions, and instantly breaking free from the spatial confinement, fleeing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Escaped again?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Those strongest Eleventh Realm experts wielding Clan Pacifier Weapons could escape from him multiple times, relying not on their own strength, but on the Twelfth Realm methods left behind in the Clan Pacifier Weapons.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, dealing with the Clan Pacifier Weapons of the various peak force factions is indeed a bit challenging."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This time when he was pursuing and killing those Eleventh Realm experts who had fled, it was also just a casual attempt.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If possible, it would be best to kill a few of them. Even if I can't kill them, it doesn't matter, at least I'll know the gap between myself and the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Xia Qin is summoning me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and the true self of his avatar on the Galactic Prime Star immediately sent a wisp of mental will, connecting to the virtual world and entering Xia Qin's personal domain.</p><p></p><p>The majestic Evolutionary Tower.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared below.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Supreme One." Lin Yuan slightly bowed towards Xia Qin, showing respect.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan." Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The first time he summoned Lin Yuan, the latter had just entered the Eighth Realm, a very tender and young fellow.</p><p></p><p>How long has it been since then? Lin Yuan has grown to this extent? Although the Twelve Ultimates all believe that Lin Yuan's means of annihilating tens of thousands of Eleventh Realm experts came from external forces and powers.</p><p></p><p>But to mobilize external forces and powers also requires strength. For example, to refine Supreme Weapons, one needs at least the comprehension of the Fifth Realm of Time and Space, without the Fifth Realm of Time and Space, one cannot even activate Supreme Weapons in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One, I..." Lin Yuan thought for a while, intending to tell Xia Qin the explanation he had long prepared.</p><p></p><p>"No need to tell me." Xia Qin waved his hand. Human civilization highly values privacy, and the Supremes are the same, they will not casually pry into each other's secrets.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's opportunities and secrets, Xia Qin knows them, there's no need to say them out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Although those Eleventh Realm alien experts on the battlefield have been almost completely wiped out, the war is not over yet, and you need to be even more careful going forward."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin said with a slightly solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"The war is not over?" Lin Yuan's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>Now, the forces of the Eleven Peaks still have the strongest Eleventh Realm experts barely hanging on, so it can't be considered a complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Even if these strongest Eleventh Realm experts also died at Lin Yuan's hands, those peak force groups can still endlessly send out Eleventh Realm experts to join the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"With so many Supreme Weapons and treasures falling into your hands, tsk tsk, I'm afraid those old fellows will stop at nothing next." </p><p></p><p>Xia Qin sneered, then looked at Lin Yuan and said, "According to the rules of the super-large-scale battlefield, no one is allowed to enter or leave within the hundred years the war is raging."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>That means, even though he has reaped a large number of Supreme Weapons and treasures, as long as Lin Yuan's Solar Primal Spirit dies on the battlefield within a hundred years, all those Supreme Weapons and treasures will return to the hands of the various peak force groups.</p><p></p><p>"We are now being closely watched by those old fellows, and we can't help you transfer those Supreme Weapons and treasures." Xia Qin sighed.</p><p></p><p>Those many Supreme Weapons and treasures, Xia Qin also covets them very much. As long as they could be transferred out of the battlefield, even if he didn't take a single one, those peak force groups would still suffer heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>And with so many Supreme Weapons and treasures in the hands of the Galactic Lord, it would also be a kind of enhancement and elevation for the foundation of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the various peak force groups are all on the alert, preventing the Supremes of human civilization from secretly moving Lin Yuan's Supreme Weapons and treasures out of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale battlefield can isolate the inside from the outside, and even the Twelve Ultimates cannot directly intervene. With so many Ultimates watching, the nine Supremes of human civilization will find it difficult to make any moves.</p><p></p><p>"As for those Supreme Weapons and treasures, there's no need to strive for them. If you feel you can't defend them, just abandon them directly." Xia Qin suggested.</p><p></p><p>Super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the human civilization's war base.</p><p></p><p>In the control room, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Six hundred and twenty-three Supreme Weapons." Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into the inner world, the many Supreme Weapons piled up like mountains, with a terrifying aura permeating and spreading.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, the last harvest of Supreme Weapons for Lin Yuan was only about thirty pieces, but now the number of Supreme Weapons has suddenly surged to more than six hundred.</p><p></p><p>"So many Supreme Weapons? Let me abandon them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally didn't want to, these are all precious cultivation resources. Even if he can't use them himself, he can still exchange them for the treasures and rarities he wants.</p><p></p><p>In the universe of myriad tribes, Supreme Weapons are equivalent to 'hard currency', which can be used to exchange for all kinds of resources.</p><p></p><p>For the nine Supremes of human civilization like Xia Qin, they can't think of any way to help Lin Yuan quietly transfer this batch of Supreme Weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Ultimate existences of the other peak force groups also don't believe human civilization has the ability to transfer them.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale battlefield is right under their noses, and as long as the Supremes of human civilization interfere even a little, they will immediately be discovered by all the Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>And without relying on the Supremes of human civilization, the Silver Galaxy Lord, with his long-lived life, has even less chance of transferring them.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale battlefield is isolated from the outside world in terms of time and space. Unless at specific time nodes, the lives inside cannot come out.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's a Supreme, if they forcefully break out of the super-large-scale battlefield with their powerful strength, it will trigger violent spatial-temporal fluctuations, which will then be detected by all the Ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>But what the Twelve Ultimate existences cannot do, does not mean Lin Yuan cannot do it.</p><p></p><p>In the control room of the human civilization's war base, Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and he manifested a clone.</p><p></p><p>This clone carries a wisp of his mental will and can exert the strength of the Third to Fourth Realms of the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at this clone in front of him, pondered for a moment, and took out a spatial bracelet.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spatial bracelet were more than six hundred Supreme Weapons and various precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>After all, all the harvests Lin Yuan obtained in the super-large-scale battlefield were stored in this spatial bracelet.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The spatial bracelet levitated, hovering in front of the clone, and was gently grasped by the clone.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the clone nodded slightly at Lin Yuan and gradually disappeared, vanishing from the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's clone appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, sure enough, even in the super-large-scale battlefield, I can easily enter the Mysterious Yellow Realm."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Even the Twelve Ultimate existences, if they want to leave the super-large-scale battlefield, will trigger violent spatial-temporal fluctuations. But as the master of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, Lin Yuan only needs a thought to descend into the Mysterious Yellow Realm through the Mysterious Yellow Seal, from any location in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Although the super-large-scale battlefield is isolated in time and space, it is still within the universe, and Lin Yuan can easily descend into it.</p><p></p><p>And during the period of leaving the super-large-scale battlefield, he did not cause any ripples or disturbances, for the Mysterious Yellow Realm was opened up by Emperor Xuan, a Chaotic Realm cultivator with the comprehension of the Ninth Realm of Time and Space.</p><p></p><p>And Emperor Xuan's attainments in the realm of time and space far exceed the imagination of the Twelve Ultimate existences of the various peak force groups.</p>

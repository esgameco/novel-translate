        <h1>Chapter 417</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"They fled quite quickly." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the 19 frenzied fleeing Demon Sovereigns who vanished in an instant. </p><p></p><p>He didn't pay too much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>Most of his mind was focused on the three void creatures imprisoned in the palm of his right hand. </p><p></p><p>More precisely, on the golden void creature sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The other two void creatures did not constrain much of Lin Yuan's power. </p><p></p><p>It was mainly that void creature sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this void creature sovereign was tremendously powerful, far exceeding ordinary Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not arrived early this time, the Python Sovereign, Eight-Armed Sovereign and nearly 20 other Demon Sovereigns would have charged into the void creature's nest with their numerical advantage, only to be completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>This void creature sovereign was completely hiding its strength, presenting an illusion that it could be dealt with to the 19 Demon Sovereigns outside. </p><p></p><p>It was waiting for the Demon Sovereigns to kill their way in, so it could wipe them out in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>The Python Sovereign and other demons thought they were the hunters, not realizing they had already become the prey of the void creatures.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan appeared, this void creature sovereign vaguely sensed something was amiss and tried to flee in advance.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan directly acted, capturing it with his third claw.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan ignored those 19 Demon Sovereigns - any delay might have allowed this void creature sovereign to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p>"Not lacking in intelligence either."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the void creature sovereign in his palm with interest.</p><p></p><p>From the outside world's perspective, this void creature sovereign looked feeble, tightly bound in Lin Yuan's palm.</p><p></p><p>But from the void creature sovereign's viewpoint, it was in a vast, boundless void space, like a slightly smaller void secret realm, immensely vast.</p><p></p><p>Any attacks or struggles from the void creature sovereign were unable to break free from this boundless void.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the five-fold realm of space-time fusion rules, Lin Yuan could temporarily condense a relatively complete space-time if he wished.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the foundations allowing him to completely break free from the shackles of the river of time when reaching the pinnacle of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the space-time power transformed into the power of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>The two void creatures beside the void creature sovereign rapidly turned to nothingness, and finally even the golden void creature sovereign began to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so comfortable."</p><p></p><p>Killing a ninth-stage void creature brought a significant enhancement to Lin Yuan's mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>Consecutively killing eight ninth-stage void creatures, the increase in Lin Yuan's overall mental willpower reached at least 20%.</p><p></p><p>In other words, his original mental willpower index of 10 million points had now reached at least 12 million points.</p><p></p><p>The increase was huge, but within Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>However, when that golden void creature sovereign died, the void power it released caused Lin Yuan's mental willpower index to instantly increase by nearly double, directly reaching 20 million points.</p><p></p><p>One must know, the higher the mental willpower index, the greater the difficulty in increasing it further. Although both increasing from 10 million to 12 million points and from 12 million to 14 million points represented an increase of 2 million points, the difficulty was vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Lin Yuan's mental willpower index directly jumped from 12 million to 20 million points, showing how formidable that golden void creature sovereign was. The stronger the void creature, the greater the enhancement to mental willpower upon killing it.</p><p></p><p>"20 million mental willpower points, even in the main universe, there are few beings below the twelfth stage that could reach this, right? Even those special lifeforms born at the beginning of the universe's creation, if they lived until now, their mental willpower index would be just over 10 million points. As for 20 million?"</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult!"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Without the countless void creatures in the void secret realm, he didn't know how long it would take for his mental willpower to reach its current height.</p><p></p><p>According to the ranking of mental willpower by the main universe's powerful races, 18 million mental willpower points was the limit for eleventh-stage beings. </p><p></p><p>Exceeding 18 million points entered the twelfth stage realm, the level of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>Only the most powerful could reach such heights after their mental willpower was tempered by the 'shore's' aura, far surpassing 18 million points.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the first of my abilities to reach the twelfth stage threshold would be mental willpower?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt pensive. Before this tenth traversal, he had always thought it would be the space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>With the comprehension of the space-time fusion rules from the powerful races, plus Lin Yuan's incredible aptitude, even if the space-time fusion rules didn't reach the six-fold realm after this traversal, he had high hopes of crossing over after returning.</p><p></p><p>If not the space-time fusion rules, then it would be other pillar-level fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>On the journey to the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan became the ultimate victor, obtaining everything from the powerful races, not just the comprehension of space-time fusion rules, but also many other fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>The space-time fusion rules comprehension was just the easiest to absorb after being refined by the 'White Paper' senior.</p><p></p><p>Apart from space-time fusion rules, Lin Yuan's life and death cycle rules, great destruction rules and other pillar-level fusion rules had also reached the six-fold realm.</p><p></p><p>Generally, these pillar-level fusion rules only reached the seven-fold realm grasped by the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>"However, with my current mental willpower index, even killing ninth-stage void creatures won't help much. Does that mean I'll have to seek out void creature sovereigns in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. </p><p></p><p>Void creature sovereigns? In his over 300 years roaming the void secret realm, this was the only time Lin Yuan had encountered one, only hearing about them at other times.</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of Demon Sovereigns, encountering a void creature sovereign was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, if Lin Yuan hadn't come, the fate of those 19 Demon Sovereigns would have been sealed.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Python Sovereign, who directly faced one of Lin Yuan's casual glances - that pressure akin to the void collapsing made the Python Sovereign, who had prepared many excuses and intended to slightly 'threaten' with their number of 19 Demon Sovereigns, unhesitatingly submit and flee in retreat.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened, Python? Why did you become so cowardly in the end?" The Eight-Armed Sovereign said with some dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>If the Python Sovereign hadn't led the retreat, the 18 other Demon Sovereigns would never have scattered and fled. At the very least, they could have persisted for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign could see that the Sun Sovereign was occupied suppressing the three void creatures in his right palm, presenting their opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Cowardly?" The Python Sovereign fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If he set aside the very real pressure he faced, his performance could indeed be considered cowardly.</p><p></p><p>"Not cowardly, I would have died."</p><p></p><p>The Python Sovereign said directly. Demons were always sensitive in their perception, especially ninth-stage Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Facing that casual glance from Lin Yuan, the Python Sovereign truly felt the threat of complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would he have behaved that way?</p><p></p><p>"Would have died?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign's expression turned slightly grave. He had known the Python Sovereign for a long time and was clear that on major matters, the other would never exaggerate.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Sun Sovereign that powerful?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign found it hard to believe. For any Demon Sovereign to grow, it required a long period of time, during which it was inevitable to come into contact with other Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>But the Sun Sovereign...from his first appearance until now, it had only been three to five hundred years at most.</p><p></p><p>Three to five hundred years? Not to mention Demon Sovereigns, even sixth or seventh stage demons could reach that level in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"He should have reached the perfect ninth stage Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The Python Sovereign said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign felt slightly choked. In the vast boundless void, due to the existence of the void secret realm, there were still some ninth stage Demon Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>But a Sovereign who had grown to the perfect ninth stage was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>At this level, a Sovereign possessed the strength to kill ordinary Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>For them, becoming the legendary tenth stage Demon was the ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>In the vast boundless void, the number of Sovereigns that could be considered perfect ninth stage could be counted on one's fingers, not exceeding a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign couldn't help asking. He had not realized the situation was so serious - the Sun Sovereign they had just faced was actually a perfect ninth stage Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Python Sovereign glanced at the Eight-Armed Sovereign. "What else can we do? In the future, if we encounter the Sun Sovereign, we must stay far, far away."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, stay far away."</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Armed Sovereign was startled and quickly agreed. Among ordinary Demon Sovereigns, even if there was a gap in strength, it wouldn't be enormously wide. If weaker, they would at most retreat.</p><p></p><p>But a perfect ninth stage Sovereign could completely kill ordinary Sovereigns, which carried a different meaning.</p><p></p><p>Among demons, the weak were prey for the strong. Even at the ninth stage demon level, devouring their kind no longer held much significance.</p><p></p><p>But some Demon Sovereigns simply enjoyed devouring their own kind.</p><p></p><p>The void creatures...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The scene outside the creature's lair was witnessed by as many as nineteen demon lords. </p><p></p><p>This quickly led to the spread of information about the Sun Lord's strength among the demon lords.</p><p></p><p>Especially when it involved demon lords suspected of being at the ninth stage of perfection, the many demon lords were naturally very concerned and sensitive to information about the Sun Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Lord is so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"There are nine ninth-stage void creatures inside that void creature lair? And one of them is even the king of void creatures?" </p><p></p><p>"It's a trap, this is a trap. That void creature king must be close to the ninth stage of perfection. With the home field advantage, if you dare to rush in, you will definitely suffer heavy losses and most likely be completely annihilated."</p><p></p><p>As the information spread, many details about the void lair and the appearance and size of that void creature king were also revealed, immediately making some demon lords tremble in fear. The conclusions they drew also shocked the many demon lords.</p><p></p><p>"A void creature king close to the ninth stage of perfection? It was directly dragged out from the depths of the lair by the Sun Lord without being able to resist at all?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Lord's strength is not just suspected to be at the ninth stage of perfection, but is definitely at the ninth stage of perfection."</p><p></p><p>"Besides a demon lord at the ninth stage of perfection, who else could treat a void creature king close to the ninth stage as a plaything?"</p><p></p><p>One demon lord after another felt a chill run down their spine. Especially the ten demon lords present like the Python Lord and the Eight-Armed Lord felt extremely terrified in hindsight.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Sun Lord was still their life-saving benefactor?</p><p></p><p>The discussions among the demon lords in the void secret realm and the vast boundless void quickly propelled the Sun Lord to the pinnacle of fame.</p><p></p><p>But this was already anticipated by Lin Yuan. As his strength continued to grow and he killed more and more void creatures, exposing his strength was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The current Lin Yuan was already at the peak of strength in the boundless void. Not to mention being fearless of everything, he was not far from it, so he naturally didn't care about these things.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was only his Yin Sun spirit currently at the center of the vortex.</p><p></p><p>Even if something really happened, it would only be a matter concerning his Sun spirit. It was just one spirit body; even if it perished, Lin Yuan could quickly condense a new one.</p><p></p><p>"The fortieth world."</p><p></p><p>In the dark void, Lin Yuan's Yin Sun spirit silently merged into a world and planted the demon tree seed deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Over the next three hundred years, Lin Yuan's Yin Sun spirit occupied one world after another to spread the martial cultivation system, serving as Lin Yuan's martial dao headquarters in this dimension.</p><p></p><p>"However, my occupation of these worlds has already attracted the attention of many demons, including some lords," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>To the demons, worlds were food. After occupying a world, even if they didn't immediately devour it, they would never shelter the beings in the world like Lin Yuan did, let alone spread cultivation systems.</p><p></p><p>Such abnormal behavior was difficult to conceal from the demons. Some demons had special abilities that allowed them to glimpse scenes from within the worlds.</p><p></p><p>This led to—</p><p></p><p>In the past few decades, the worlds occupied by Lin Yuan were frequently interfered with and even attacked by other demons.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, my spiritual will has grown strong enough to simultaneously maintain the combat strength of multiple avatars," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Avatars were not clones. To maintain the combat strength of avatars, one needed an extremely powerful spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will had reached 20 million points. Even before killing the void creature king, it had exceeded 10 million points, allowing him to maintain a decent level of avatar combat strength.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the demon tree itself nurtured physical bodies in the worlds. Although they didn't last long and couldn't achieve perfection like the Martial Ancestor's Golden Body, they were comparable to demon physical bodies. By infusing them with a sliver of spiritual will, Lin Yuan could form avatars that, with the home field advantage, could fend off the probing attacks of various demons.</p><p></p><p>Without these avatars stationed in the worlds, even Lin Yuan's powerful Yin Sun spirit alone would at most only be able to protect a few nearby worlds.</p><p></p><p>"If I want to spread the martial cultivation system, I have to shelter the beings in the worlds. But those beings are food for the demons, so those powerful demons would never allow their food to grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. With the strength displayed by his Yin Sun spirit, not to mention occupying forty worlds, even if he occupied four hundred or a thousand worlds, no demon would dare say anything.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, demons were the absolute rulers, and among demons, it was the law of the jungle where the strong dominated everything.</p><p></p><p>But after Lin Yuan occupied the worlds, instead of devouring the food, he cultivated it, which puzzled and even enraged many demons.</p><p></p><p>This led to the subsequent probing attacks.</p><p></p><p>"If these demons knew that I'm not a demon, but a life form nurtured by the worlds, they probably wouldn't just probe me, but try to exterminate me at all costs," Lin Yuan thought privately.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan's Martial Ancestor's Golden Body originated from the primordial essence of the Azure Heavens World, fundamentally different from the demons' life forms.</p><p></p><p>Although his Yin Sun and Sun spirits originated from the illusory spirit body and became real through the 'Illusion Becomes Reality' technique, they transcended physical bodies and were somewhat similar to demon life forms, which was why he was mistaken for a demon.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly but surely."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I drag it out, I'm bound to win."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't anxious at all. With his extraordinary comprehension, he was growing stronger every moment. As long as he stalled for time, he would eventually prevail.</p><p></p><p>"Once my space-time fusion rules reach the sixth level, I'll be the strongest in the boundless void, on par with the founder of the void secret realm. By then, spreading the martial cultivation system will be easy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules wouldn't just enhance Lin Yuan's mastery over space-time fusion, but would also trigger a corresponding transformation and leap in the world within his body. The strength of the inner world was closely tied to Lin Yuan's various abilities, especially the fifth type of physical body technique, 'World'.</p><p></p><p>In short, the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules would bring about a comprehensive qualitative change for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This descent wasn't enough for the space-time fusion rules to reach the sixth level. I'll descend again after returning. It's just a third of a strand of dimensional rift force, after all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind. Before comprehending the space-time fusion rules, there was no obvious difference between the boundless void and the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the different flow of time gave Lin Yuan more time to study other rules and secret techniques. The void creatures in the void secret realm were also beneficial for enhancing his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Descending again would definitely not be a loss.</p><p></p><p>Ten years later.</p><p></p><p>Outside a vast world.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of towering figures stood in the boundless void, their cold gazes fixed on the world in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Realm Lord, why are you cultivating those insects in the world? Wouldn't it be better to just devour them directly?" The leading demon, a three-headed black wolf with a chilling aura of a ninth-stage lord, asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I have my reasons," Lin Yuan's Yin Sun spirit appeared, gazing at the dozens of demons from afar.</p><p></p><p>Over the past three hundred years, due to Lin Yuan's Yin Sun spirit occupying one world after another, he had gained a reputation among the demons as the 'Yin Realm Lord'.</p><p></p><p>Demon titles were often related to their characteristics and behaviors. Lin Yuan's Sun spirit was called the 'Sun Lord' because it commanded flames capable of incinerating ordinary lords.</p><p></p><p>As for the 'Yin Realm Lord', it was because his attacks were shrouded in chilling coldness, and he ruled over many worlds as their lord, hence the 'Realm Lord' suffix.</p><p></p><p>"Reasons?" The three-headed black wolf sneered. "Whether these worlds or the insects inside, they are all our food. Don't tell me your reason is to cultivate this food to go against us?"</p><p></p><p>The three-headed black wolf's tone was icy. If the Yin Lord hadn't displayed such formidable strength that deterred him, he might have already attacked to subdue him.</p><p></p><p>"It's my business," Lin Yuan said calmly. As a non-demon, he naturally didn't need to consider things from a demon's perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Your business." The three-headed black wolf laughed coldly, then black mist began to spread.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a chilling coldness also began to emanate, and the two auras collided outside the world. After a moment, the three-headed black wolf was forced back a great distance, staring at Lin Yuan in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Realm Lord, your strength is probably at the top tier below the ninth stage of perfection. Why are you sheltering those insects?"</p><p></p><p>The three-headed black wolf was puzzled. With Lin Yuan's strength, shouldn't he be roaming the void secret realm, striving to become a ninth-stage perfected demon lord, and then attempting to break through to the tenth stage?</p><p></p><p>"Wait and see."</p><p></p><p>"These lords won't let this go."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed black wolf unhesitatingly turned and left, and the other dozens of demons followed suit. Their strength was inferior to the three-headed black wolf, so they naturally wouldn't act rashly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched the dozens of demons leave.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he could easily keep these demons here. However, doing so would inevitably expose his ninth-stage perfected strength.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the next time demons came to probe, it wouldn't be ordinary lords like the three-headed black wolf, but a group of ninth-stage perfected demon lords.</p><p></p><p>This didn't align with Lin Yuan's plan to stall for time, so he let these demons leave.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were no major changes in the situation, Lin Yuan would naturally delay the arrival of the final battle as much as possible to gain more time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Every extra day of cultivation time might allow Lin Yuan to comprehend the sixth level of the space-time fusion rules and sweep through everything.</p><p></p><p>"Why shelter those insects?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recalled the three-headed black wolf's final words, shaking his head slightly. "It's because you demons can't cultivate the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yuan, whether they were demons from other dimensions or beings from the worlds, anyone capable of cultivating the martial dao would receive his protection.</p><p></p><p>If demons could cultivate the martial dao, Lin Yuan would be even more inclined to shelter them, as their individual strength would allow them to make rapid progress on the martial path, quickly producing the first sixth-stage martial cultivator, seventh-stage cultivator, or even eighth-stage peerless cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The more high-level martial cultivators there were, the greater the assistance to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>After three hundred years of research, Lin Yuan realized that those demons from other dimensions were too reliant on their innate talents. It was basically impossible for them to abandon their talents and cultivate the martial path.</p><p></p><p>Each demon's cultivation path was determined at birth. To change it later would be extremely difficult, and they ultimately wouldn't achieve any significant accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>In the void secret realm, Lin Yuan continued to delve deeper, searching for void creatures.</p><p></p><p>With his spiritual will reaching 20 million points, ninth-stage void creatures were no longer of much help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But even if the help was minimal, it was still help. No matter how small, meat was meat, so Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't give it up. With his current spiritual will, as long as he could enhance it, it was a gain.</p><p></p><p>If he returned to the main universe, he wouldn't have such a good opportunity. Enhancing his spiritual will by even a little would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't an Empyrean expert who could linger on the 'shore' for long periods, experiencing the tempering of the 'shore's' aura while existing within the river of time. His spiritual will would max out at around 18 million points.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's spiritual will already exceeding 20 million points, he had basically cut off any possibility of further enhancement.</p><p></p><p>"At the current rate, if there are no major accidents or incidents in the next three hundred years, my spiritual will should reach 23 million points," Lin Yuan estimated, feeling quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue searching for void creatures...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura rapidly approached.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up to see a terrifyingly powerful demon lord gazing at him from afar.</p><p></p><p>"The Eastern Wing Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recognized him. The Eastern Wing Lord was one of the most renowned among the demon lords, a ninth-stage perfected demon lord.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Lord," the Eastern Wing Lord forced a smile, expressing sufficient goodwill towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Faced with an existence of the same level, the Eastern Wing Lord naturally didn't dare act arrogantly. Ninth-stage perfected demon lords treated ordinary demon lords with impunity, but they were quite humble when dealing with peers.</p><p></p><p>Among demon lords of this level, conflicts and battles could easily break out, especially between ninth-stage perfected lords.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that during my slumber of tens of millions of years, the boundless void would produce a powerhouse like the Sun Lord," the Eastern Wing Lord said with a hint of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sun Lord's rise only occurred in the past three to five hundred years, the Eastern Wing Lord instinctively assumed that the Sun Lord had existed for far longer than that. The three to five hundred years was merely the time when the Sun Lord revealed his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Fortune," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't mind communicating with a ninth-stage perfected demon lord. With his extraordinary comprehension, Lin Yuan could often perceive unusual information from them.</p><p></p><p>After chatting casually with the Eastern Wing Lord for half a time period, he suddenly changed the subject and asked solemnly, "I've come to seek the Sun Lord's aid in joining forces against an enemy."</p><p></p><p>"An enemy?" Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, demons were the absolute rulers. What enemy could there be?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Sun Lord has heard of the Yin Realm Lord?" the Eastern Wing Lord asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

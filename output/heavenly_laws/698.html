        <h1>Chapter 698</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The avatar and the true body share the same spiritual will, but the strength is far inferior to the original. Why is this so? First, it is because the avatar has not invested much spiritual will. </p><p></p><p>Secondly, the physical body of the avatar is only casually condensed, unable to fully display the true power of the original.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the strength of the clone is much stronger, because the physical body of the clone has been cultivated and is powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is the chaotic void, the first source world, or the second source world, the cultivators attach great importance to the clone, especially the main combat physical body. </p><p></p><p>The loss of a main combat physical body would be a waste of countless years of effort.</p><p></p><p>And now, the avatar casually condensed in front of Lin Yuan has not undergone any cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the application of the Talisman Dao, the strength of this avatar has undergone a qualitative change, reaching the level close to the Abyss Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Now, just as an avatar, my strength is on par with the Eternal Sons in the second source world, right?" Lin Yuan was quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>What are the Eternal Sons? They are the existence cultivated by a great Eternal Sect, even the Eternal Lord paid exceptional attention, and finally gave birth to them.</p><p></p><p>Their strength far exceeds the strongest Celestial Exalted in the first source world.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Mount Wu created the most perfect three grand paintings with his own Dao, and the strength of the powerhouses in the first two paintings barely reached the Abyss Dragon level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's casually condensed avatar has reached this level of combat power? "The strength of the true body and the original?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>The enhanced understanding of the Talisman Dao has allowed him to use the Talisman Dao more perfectly. If the 13th-tier inheritance "Infinite Void" only improved the universe within his body, then the current Talisman Dao has improved Lin Yuan in all aspects, including the universe within his body, the physical body and soul, the spiritual will, and everything.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the preliminary comprehension of that inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind. The inheritance created by the Celestial Lord mainly expounded on the understanding of the Talismans.</p><p></p><p>According to the Celestial Lord's division, the inheritance is divided into five levels. If one can comprehend the fifth level, they can use the power of the Talismans within the time cycle.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan has only grasped the first level.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Celestial Lord also admitted that it is unrealistic for normal cultivators to comprehend the fifth level, as it almost belongs to the realm of the Eternal Lord's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But even just the third or fourth level would be of great help in breaking through the time cycle. In terms of understanding the Talismans, even if one cannot directly use them, they can still use them indirectly.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even now, compared to the 13th-tier time life, the gap is still very large."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the strongest aspect of the 13th-tier time life is the ability to glimpse into the future timeline. The choice and decision regarding the future is greater than direct strength.</p><p></p><p>Even setting aside the ability to observe the future timeline, Lin Yuan is still far from being a match for the 13th-tier life form.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, slowly."</p><p></p><p>"With this inheritance, I feel the possibility of breaking through the time cycle has increased greatly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was joyful. The Celestial Lord believed that it is unrealistic for cultivators to cultivate to the fifth level of the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, he is naturally not included in this category.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension ability, if he truly devotes himself to the cultivation, not only can he definitely cultivate to the fifth level, he may even have a good chance of reaching the realm of the Eternal Lord's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>It is just a matter of how much effort and time he is willing to invest.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Chaotic Void, there is a rift connecting the dimensions outside.</p><p></p><p>A huge eye was gazing from afar - the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>"This dimensional rift..." the All-Seeing Eye carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void is not perfect, even with the presence of numerous time lives to maintain it, there are still dimensional rifts appearing at the edges.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rifts connect to the dimensional interstices, which have already departed from the dimension where the Chaotic Void resides.</p><p></p><p>That place is full of dangers, but also contains many opportunities.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift that the All-Seeing Eye has locked onto is connected to a dimensional interstice that contains a certain resource it needs.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain this resource, the All-Seeing Eye has mobilized the accumulated favors to send more than ten Supremely Saintly Experts.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! At this moment, a figure condensed, forming a silver-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>"Senior All-Seeing."</p><p></p><p>The silver-robed elder is named Wind Candle Saintly Expert, a Supremely Saintly Expert who was once protected by the All-Seeing Eye when he was weak, and thus owes a favor to the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" the All-Seeing Eye looked at Wind Candle Saintly Expert and asked.</p><p></p><p>"The native creatures on the small continent outside the dimensional rift are too troublesome to deal with. I'm afraid it will be difficult to obtain that Law Source Fruit," Wind Candle Saintly Expert said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>The Law Source Fruit is a dimensional treasure, floating in the dimensional interstices. The closer it gets to a dimension, the more "Dao Principles" of that dimension it can absorb.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Law Source Fruit itself contains the fundamental Dao Principles of different dimensions.</p><p></p><p>This rare treasure would greatly benefit the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the area around the Law Source Fruit often nurtures some dimensional creatures.</p><p></p><p>Dimensional creatures are born with great innate strength in the dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>And outside the dimension, the Supremely Saintly Experts of the Chaotic Void can only display limited power, unable to rely on the power of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>So even though the All-Seeing Eye has mobilized more than ten Supremely Saintly Experts to pluck that Law Source Fruit, they are still facing strong resistance.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can obtain the Law Source Fruit, I will have a great reward for you," the All-Seeing Eye said to Wind Candle Saintly Expert.</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior All-Seeing has said so, I will definitely give it my all," Wind Candle Saintly Expert nodded.</p><p></p><p>The rewards the All-Seeing Eye can offer, even for Supremely Saintly Experts, are enough to make them excited.</p><p></p><p>Just then - a slight fluctuation came from outside the dimensional rift.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift that had been fixed in place actually began to slowly contract.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"It's the dimensional tide."</p><p></p><p>The gaze of the All-Seeing Eye slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift in the chaotic void cannot exist forever. </p><p></p><p>It will occasionally recover and appear due to the influence of the external environment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the tidal force between dimensions has affected this dimensional rift, and it is about to completely heal.</p><p></p><p>"This is troublesome," the Venerable Saint of the Candle-Flame said with a grim expression.</p><p></p><p>Once this dimensional rift closes and heals, it is unknown how long it will take for this area to open up a dimensional rift again - perhaps ten thousand or even a hundred thousand universal cycles.</p><p></p><p>By then, the Venerable Saint of the Candle-Flame estimates that he would have already broken through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Venerable Saint, the All-Seeing Eye was equally anxious.</p><p></p><p>Even if it takes countless universal cycles, the All-Seeing Eye can wait.</p><p></p><p>However, the All-Seeing Eye cannot guarantee that when this place opens up a dimensional rift again, the Dao Fruit will still be there.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Fruit drifts between different dimensions, and if they miss this opportunity, it will likely drift far away, cutting off the All-Seeing Eye's chance of obtaining it.</p><p></p><p>"This dimensional rift will take about three days to completely heal," the All-Seeing Eye observed carefully, then looked at the Venerable Saint of the Candle-Flame. "As long as we can retrieve the Dao Fruit within three days, it will be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Three days?" The Venerable Saint naturally understood the All-Seeing Eye's meaning.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible," the Venerable Saint shook his head. "That small continent, just exploring the outer regions, the dimensional beings there are already extremely difficult to overcome. In just three days, to go to the core area, retrieve the Dao Fruit, and then retreat safely, I cannot do it."</p><p></p><p>This was not a matter of cost, but simply something he could not accomplish.</p><p></p><p>"I see," the All-Seeing Eye fell silent for a while, also realizing that retrieving the Dao Fruit within three days was not reasonable.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye looked at the dimensional rift again, which was now visibly shrinking.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it," the All-Seeing Eye made a decision.</p><p></p><p>In a desolate void, Lin Yuanzhen's true self sat cross-legged, drifting with the chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the power of space and time converged, forming a giant eye.</p><p></p><p>"The All-Seeing Eye?" Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye and casually said, "What business do you have with me?"</p><p></p><p>He had a deep karmic connection with the All-Seeing Eye, so it was not strange that the latter had come to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage," the All-Seeing Eye's attitude was very humble, unlike how it had treated the Venerable Saint of the Candle-Flame.</p><p></p><p>"There is a matter I would like to request your help with."</p><p></p><p>"Speak," Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, "You want to ask me to go to that dimensional rift and retrieve the Dao Fruit?" Lin Yuan understood the All-Seeing Eye's intention.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"That Dao Fruit is very important to me," the All-Seeing Eye nodded.</p><p></p><p>To retrieve the Dao Fruit within three days would be an impossible task even for an unparalleled sage.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye thought it over and felt that only Lin Yuan had a chance of accomplishing this.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Lin Yuan had displayed his strength, and he was recognized by the All-Seeing Eye and other special existences as the strongest among the unparalleled sages in history.</p><p></p><p>"Think it through carefully," Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye calmly. "Back then, you helped spread the evolutionary path of the Dao of Martial Arts in exchange for the right to make a future request of me."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to use this request on this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the All-Seeing Eye fell into thought again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the most valuable use of this request would be to wait until Lin Yuan had broken through to the Thirteenth Realm before making it.</p><p></p><p>But who knows if Lin Yuan would be able to break through to the Thirteenth Realm? If he couldn't, wouldn't it be a waste? Many unparalleled sages have appeared in history, but only a few have become masters of time and life.</p><p></p><p>And that Dao Fruit is of utmost importance to the All-Seeing Eye. If they miss this opportunity, there may not be another.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, I'm sure," the All-Seeing Eye thought it through and responded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "What is the situation like outside that dimensional rift?"</p><p></p><p>"It's quite dangerous. Even a normal unparalleled sage would have a hard time retrieving the Dao Fruit within three days," the All-Seeing Eye said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>It did not dare to hide anything in this regard.</p><p></p><p>"Is there any Thirteenth Realm existence there?" Lin Yuan rephrased his question.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Realm existence?" The All-Seeing Eye was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"No, there isn't," the All-Seeing Eye immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>What a joke! A Thirteenth Realm existence? If there was one near the Dao Fruit, he wouldn't even dare to have any thoughts about it, no matter how much he desired the Dao Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the vicinity of the chaotic void, the appearance of a Thirteenth Realm life would inevitably attract the attention of the time-life beings within.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not," the All-Seeing Eye assured Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It thought Lin Yuan was worried about him sending Lin Yuan to his death.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will send a clone to enter that dimensional rift and retrieve the Dao Fruit for you," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Galactic Sage."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye was about to express its gratitude when it suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"A clone? Galactic Sage, that dimensional rift outside is still very dangerous. Will a clone be enough?" the All-Seeing Eye asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye had a very high regard for Lin Yuan's strength, considering him the strongest unparalleled sage in history.</p><p></p><p>But just a clone?</p><p></p><p>"It will be enough," Lin Yuan glanced at the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>With just one of his clones now, he could display power close to that of the Abyss Dragon. All the unparalleled sages in the history of the chaotic void combined probably couldn't defeat one of his clones.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his true self was still observing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was looking forward to it. As long as there were no Thirteenth Realm time-life beings, who could really match him? Even the mysterious dimensional rift, did it truly have an opponent that could rival him?</p>

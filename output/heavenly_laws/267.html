            <p>Chapter 267 The Invincible Lin Yuan (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the Seventh Heaven, there was dead silence.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme Immortal Kings who were fighting, whether they were born in the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era or the Prehistoric Era, all stopped their hands.</p><p></p><p>Subconsciously, they looked towards that figure who tore through the barrier between the Seventh Heaven and the Eighth Heaven with absolute dominance and absolute power.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm, from the First Heaven to the Second Heaven, from the Second Heaven to the Third Heaven... from the Seventh Heaven to the Eighth Heaven...</p><p></p><p>There were two ways.</p><p></p><p>One was to follow the fixed entrance between each Heaven, and one could enter the higher Heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, at these fixed entrances, there existed numerous tribulations, such as endless wind tribulations, nine-layered thunder tribulations, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The second was to directly tear open the barrier between the Heavens without going through the fixed entrance, and ascend to the higher Heaven.</p><p></p><p>But--</p><p></p><p>The barriers between the Heavens were not so easy to tear open.</p><p></p><p>Even for supreme Immortal Kings, if they wanted to tear open the barrier between the First Heaven and Second Heaven, they would need to exert great effort, far less convenient than directly entering through the entrance.</p><p></p><p>And the barriers between the Heavens became more and more solid the higher one went. An ordinary supreme Immortal King could tear open the barrier between the First Heaven and Second Heaven with some effort.</p><p></p><p>But for the barrier between the Second Heaven and Third Heaven, supreme Immortal Kings would need to go all-out.</p><p></p><p>As for the barrier between the Third Heaven and Fourth Heaven? Ordinary supreme Immortal Kings simply couldn't do anything to it.</p><p></p><p>In this Heaven Ascending Battle, the reason why the Opening Heaven Immortal Kings and Grand Supreme Immortal Kings of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era chose to "ascend the heavens" from the entrance leading to the Eighth Heaven...</p><p></p><p>Was precisely because this was the simplest way. As for forcibly tearing open the barrier between the Seventh Heaven and Eighth Heaven, even if the over twenty supreme Immortal Kings like the Opening Heaven Immortal Kings and Grand Supreme Immortal Kings joined hands...</p><p></p><p>It was indeed possible, but it would take at least several days and nights.</p><p></p><p>With that much time, the supreme Immortal Kings of the Prehistoric Era in the Eighth Heaven would have long noticed. They would similarly wait above the barrier to fight at their leisure, not much different from battling at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The over twenty supreme Immortal Kings like the Opening Heaven Immortal Kings and Grand Supreme Immortal Kings joining hands would require several days and nights to barely tear open the barrier between the Seventh Heaven and Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As for the barrier between the Sixth Heaven and Seventh Heaven, although it wasn't as tough as the former, it would definitely also require the over twenty supreme Immortal Kings to join hands and go all-out for over half a day or even one to two days to have hope of tearing it open.</p><p></p><p>But just now...</p><p></p><p>That figure that suddenly descended, how long did it take to tear apart the barrier between the Sixth Heaven and Seventh Heaven? A breath? Or an instant?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this figure seemed to have torn apart not only the barrier between the Sixth Heaven and Seventh Heaven, but the barriers of the five great Heavens below were all brutally ripped apart, not letting it pause for an instant.</p><p></p><p>This kind of power was too terrifying. Even supreme Immortal Kings and powerhouses among supreme Immortal Kings like the Opening Heaven Immortal Kings and Grand Supreme Immortal Kings felt their hearts tremble at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the moment that figure appeared, a formless and terrifying qi and blood domain covered a tenth of the Seventh Heaven's area, enveloping all the supreme Immortal Kings within.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the shock of the other supreme Immortal Kings, Ling Xu Immortal King was nearly suffocating at this moment. Just by approaching that figure, the high-grade Creation Power within his body fell into silence, let alone the other six types of ordinary Creation Power.</p><p></p><p>"Who, who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>"From which era's powerhouse?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xu Immortal King asked in a trembling voice. As a supreme Immortal King of the Prehistoric Era, Ling Xu Immortal King was clear that over countless tens of thousands of years, the Spirit Realm had experienced era after era.</p><p></p><p>Before these two eras, there were even more immeasurably ancient eras.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you just ambush me earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Ling Xu Immortal King and said in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Avatar was reduced to nothingness under Ling Xu Immortal King's Dao Third Realm Great Destruction Power. Although it was because Lin Yuan took the initiative to disperse it, it was indeed due to Ling Xu Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The instant the Taiji Avatar was ambushed, Lin Yuan's true body left the Martial Shrine and directly entered the Nine Heavens, following the principle that a straight line was the shortest distance between two points, piercing through one strange sight, phenomenon, and Heavenly barrier after another, descending here.</p><p></p><p>"Ambushed you?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xu Immortal King was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, an expression of disbelief appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>That Martial Ancestor from earlier was the person in front of him?</p><p></p><p>Ling Xu Immortal King found it hard to believe. The Martial Ancestor's strength was indeed very powerful, almost above the Opening Heaven Immortal Kings and Grand Supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>But that was it.</p><p></p><p>In a one-on-one, even without an ambush, Ling Xu Immortal King was confident in suppressing the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the ambush was to quickly end the battle and eliminate the Martial Ancestor, this unstable factor, as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>For Ling Xu Immortal King who had lived through long years, he had long stopped caring about ambushes or not.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme Immortal Kings around were also closely observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice. Lin Yuan's way of appearing was too frightening. Even the mighty Heavenly barriers were no different from thin paper before him.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, he is the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? No, the auras of the two are similar, it's indeed possible they are the same person."</p><p></p><p>The many supreme Immortal Kings, especially the supreme Immortal Kings of the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era, were dumbfounded at first, but when they carefully sensed it, they vaguely discovered that the Martial Ancestor who had a good relationship with them and the person in front of them indeed had similarities in their auras.</p><p></p><p>The similarity here was a fundamental one, mastering the same Creation Powers, as well as that vast power similar to the world power of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The difference was, the previous Martial Ancestor's mastery of that kind of world power was like a Dao Realm in the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>But the current Martial Ancestor's casually released wisp of world power was the vast Three Thousand Dao Realms.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xu Immortal King muttered to himself, asking the doubt in the hearts of all the supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>The difference in strength between the previous and current Martial Ancestor was too great. Even though he knew that such a powerful expert would not stoop to lying, Ling Xu Immortal King still didn't want to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for you to know this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan lightly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, Lin Yuan's Taiji Avatar wasn't much weaker than his true body.</p><p></p><p>But the mysterious gourd brought a tenfold amplification to the inner world and physical body of the true body.</p><p></p><p>What was the concept of a tenfold amplification? The inner world expanded from a 6.8 million li square to a 70 million li square. The increase in world power was over a hundred or several hundred times.</p><p></p><p>It was by relying on the vast inner world that Lin Yuan was able to enter the Seventh Heaven in a dominating manner.</p><p></p><p>Of course, besides the physical body and inner world, the divine ability "Enhancement" mastered by Lin Yuan also widened the gap between the true body and Taiji Avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Enhancement" was a physical divine ability. Although it could increase the strength of the soul, heart, will, and intent, its foundation was still in the physical body. The Taiji Avatar that was just a primordial spirit body couldn't use this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>However, the "Enhancement" divine ability had side effects. Not unless it was absolutely necessary...</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Lin Yuan would not use this trump card.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying world power, along the seventh layer of heavenly space, directly crushed towards the Illusory Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The physical body of the Illusory Immortal King directly turned into powder, and the high-level creation power - the power of destruction, condensed into a sphere and fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>The other several types of ordinary creation powers were also absorbed by Lin Yuan into his body.</p><p></p><p>These creation powers, especially the high-level creation powers, were extremely valued by Lin Yuan. Bringing them back to the main world would transform them into high-level cosmic powers, which would greatly benefit the ninth-level path.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>After the physical body of the Illusory Immortal King was shattered.</p><p></p><p>A phantom soul body flew out. As the supreme Immortal King in the immortal cultivation system, most of his techniques were on the soul. In the battles between supreme Immortal Kings, it was rare to determine life and death, because at most the supreme Immortal Kings would just give up their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were willing to escape with their soul body, they could basically escape.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying." The soul body of the Illusory Immortal King trembled in spirit. Just now, under the crushing of the world power, he almost couldn't even escape with his soul body.</p><p></p><p>"This Martial Ancestor definitely has an extraordinary origin and must be one of those terrifying existences from the earliest eras." The soul body of the Illusory Immortal King tore through the void and escaped towards the entrance of the eighth layer of heaven.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can escape?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Next to the soul body of the Illusory Immortal King, a palm grabbed over.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Immortal King's soul body let out a sharp scream, and was immediately caught by Lin Yuan, directly searched, and then refined into the purest soul power.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Layer of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>In a winding palace complex, inside a certain side hall.</p><p></p><p>A man with a face very similar to the Illusory Immortal King opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As a supreme Immortal King who had survived since the prehistoric era, the Illusory Immortal King had many life-saving means. Even if his true body perished, he could still "resurrect" in this long-prepared body.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at this moment, the Illusory Immortal King had no joy of resurrection at all. His eyes were worried, revealing a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"That Martial Ancestor is too terrifying. I have already cultivated the power of destruction to the third level, supplemented by six other types of third-level ordinary creation powers, but in front of that Martial Ancestor, I couldn't even struggle."</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Immortal King was frightened.</p><p></p><p>In the long years, from the prehistoric era until now, he finally felt the breath of death.</p><p></p><p>It was complete death.</p><p></p><p>"With the Martial Ancestor's strength, I'm afraid he will soon enter the eighth layer of heaven." The Illusory Immortal King calmed himself down. "I have to inform the Chaotic Immortal King and the others about this."</p><p></p><p>In the prehistoric era, although the Illusory Immortal King was a top figure among the supreme Immortal Kings, he was not the strongest.</p><p></p><p>The ones who could truly be called the strongest Immortal Kings of the prehistoric era were the Chaotic Immortal Kings who led the Illusory Immortal King and the others to take over the eighth layer of heaven.</p><p></p><p>These supreme Immortal Kings mastered several types of high-level creation powers, and all cultivated them to the third level. Their strength was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>In the Illusory Immortal King's view, even if the Chaotic Immortal King and those strongest Immortal Kings were put together, they were far from being a match for that Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At least in front of the Chaotic Immortal King, he could still put up a fight for a while, but that Martial Ancestor made him not even dare to have the idea of resisting.</p><p></p><p>But now the Illusory Immortal King had no other choice. With the Martial Ancestor about to enter the eighth layer of heaven, the only ones he could rely on were the Chaotic Immortal King and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Immortal King has been studying the entrance to the ninth layer of heaven for so many years, maybe he has realized some kind of killing move that can block that Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Immortal King had experienced the strength of the Martial Ancestor and did not dare to hope that the Chaotic Immortal King and the others could repel or even defeat him.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could barely block him, it would be a blessing from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"So it turns out that the group of supreme Immortal Kings from the prehistoric era, led by the Chaotic Immortal King, the Chaotic Immortal King comprehended four types of high-level creation powers and cultivated them all to the third level."</p><p></p><p>"After the end of the prehistoric era, the Chaotic Immortal King led a group of supreme Immortal Kings to ascend to the eighth layer of heaven and has been trying to ascend to the ninth layer of heaven, but has not succeeded until now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King comprehended four types of high-level creation powers and cultivated them all to the third level. In this regard, Lin Yuan was not as good.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had also comprehended four types of high-level creation powers, they were all at the first level.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan also possessed an internal world spanning 70 million miles. Relying on the vast internal world, Lin Yuan did not take the Chaotic Immortal King seriously.</p><p></p><p>"It's been such a long time, and they still haven't ascended to the ninth layer of heaven?" Lin Yuan was very interested in the Chaotic Immortal King. The four types of creation powers he possessed probably included one or two that Lin Yuan had not comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned to the battlefield, looking at the other supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Run."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry back to the eighth layer of heaven."</p><p></p><p>The supreme Immortal Kings from the prehistoric era fled towards the entrance of the eighth layer of heaven without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>If they don't run now, are they waiting to follow in the Illusory Immortal King's footsteps?</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know exactly what kind of strength Lin Yuan possessed, just based on the means of killing the Illusory Immortal King, it was far beyond what they could deal with.</p><p></p><p>As for joining forces to resist together...</p><p></p><p>When the difference in strength reaches a certain level, numerical advantage is no longer an advantage, unless it is the "insect sea tactic" of the main world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, dozens of supreme Immortal Kings would probably be like toys in front of Lin Yuan, to be played with at will.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not stop the great escape of these supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that there was no need. The eighth layer of heaven was right above. Where could these supreme Immortal Kings escape to?</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Inside the seventh layer of heaven, only Lin Yuan and more than twenty Immortal Kings such as the Heaven-Opening Immortal King and the Supreme Immortal King remained.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Heaven-Opening Immortal King mustered up the courage to approach Lin Yuan and tentatively spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-Opening." Lin Yuan smiled slightly, took the initiative to restrain his aura, and casually greeted.</p><p></p><p>During the three hundred years, Lin Yuan had gotten along quite well with the Heaven-Opening Immortal King, the Supreme Immortal King, and other supreme Immortal Kings. At this moment, he had no intention of pressuring them with his strength.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's response made the Heaven-Opening Immortal King breathe a slight sigh of relief. At least with Lin Yuan speaking like this, he regarded him as being on his side.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have to be as frightened as those supreme Immortal Kings from the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, what kind of creation power do you actually possess?" Seeing this, the Supreme Immortal King also came over and couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>The strength Lin Yuan had just displayed was too terrifying. If it weren't for the fact that he didn't yet possess some of the legendary characteristics above Immortal Kings, they almost thought that Lin Yuan had already taken that step.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of creation power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. "It should be considered 'world power'."</p><p></p><p>The world power born from the internal world was a power completely different from creation power and cosmic power. It relied on the opened internal world.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for comprehension. As long as one opened up an internal world, one could master it.</p>

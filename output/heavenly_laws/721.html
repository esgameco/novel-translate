        <h1>Chapter 721</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mystical imprints of fundamental powers condensed from the deepest parts of the bloodline seemed illusory and dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's consciousness delved deeper, a flood of information surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the seven physical divine abilities he had obtained before, </p><p></p><p>This awakened physical divine ability was extremely special.</p><p></p><p>It was neither an 'active' divine ability,</p><p></p><p>Nor a 'passive' divine ability. </p><p></p><p>But rather a kind of... status.</p><p></p><p>The status of a Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Lord status?" Lin Yuan marveled as he sensed every detail of this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Could this divine ability have originated from the Lord of Celestial Light?"</p><p></p><p>"Did He fail in His attempt to break through to the 14th level, leading to His own demise, His status collapsing and scattering into the bloodlines of all living beings in this source world?"</p><p></p><p>"And I, through the path of martial arts evolution, refining the most fundamental power of the bloodline, inadvertently condensed this status?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated to himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Lord status represents the level and identity of a Time Lord, and is also related to part of the Time Lord's own authority.</p><p></p><p>Specifically,</p><p></p><p>After condensing this Lord status,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally mastered some abilities that only Time Lords could possess.</p><p></p><p>First, Lin Yuan's past, present and future timelines gradually began to be sealed off.</p><p></p><p>Other time beings would find it difficult to observe or peek at them.</p><p></p><p>Peeking at a Lord's timeline is much harder than peeking at the timeline of a time being of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary 13th level beings forcibly peeking at the former would suffer backlash from the timeline itself.</p><p></p><p>"My own timeline has been sealed off?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>All along, when facing other time beings in the same dimensional space, Lin Yuan had always been the target of observation.</p><p></p><p>While this observation could help Lin Yuan avoid many troubles, as those time beings would definitely not dare to be hostile,</p><p></p><p>Subsequent repeated observations were tantamount to those time beings seeing through one's underwear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't exactly resentful about it, but he certainly wasn't too happy either.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wasn't happy, there was nothing he could do about it. Without reaching the 13th level, the gap in life levels was too great.</p><p></p><p>Those time beings could easily view his timeline.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different.</p><p></p><p>With the Lord status empowering him, the difficulty of peeking at Lin Yuan's past, present and future timelines, while not quite comparable to that of a Time Lord, wasn't far off.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that in battles between 13th level time beings, the key is who can see more and further into future timelines. If one side's future timeline is unfathomable, it's equivalent to having the initiative.</p><p></p><p>The advantage is immense.</p><p></p><p>Why do Time Lords reign supreme over time beings? Apart from their direct strength,</p><p></p><p>It's because of their mastery over timelines, and their gradual sealing and convergence of timelines, making it difficult for other time beings to peek.</p><p></p><p>With the Lord status empowering him, not only was Lin Yuan's own past, present and future timeline sealed off, but his ability to view future timelines also became much easier.</p><p></p><p>As if he were the darling of countless timelines.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the Lord status can only be fully unleashed upon truly reaching the 13th level. As for now? Only part of its power can be manifested."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was elated.</p><p></p><p>With this Lord status, Lin Yuan was equivalent to half a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "half a Time Lord" refers purely to the level, as for direct power? Naturally, it was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already witnessed the power of Time Lords through the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Even just the weakest dark demon body of the Lord of Celestial Light,</p><p></p><p>Without the presence of heart and will, unable to use most of its techniques,</p><p></p><p>And with some of its demonic energy scattered across the source world,</p><p></p><p>Had fought Lin Yuan to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>As for the other half, the light body, it had held off thirteen Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>The power of Time Lords was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>"Even though I can't fully unleash the power of the Lord status, now there isn't much difference between me and true time beings. The previous gap in the essence of life levels has now been bridged by the Lord status."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled, "In some aspects, I'm even a cut above ordinary time beings, such as the sealing of my own timeline."</p><p></p><p>In fact, time beings start trying to seal their own timelines when approaching the peak of the 13th level. Once they break through to the pinnacle of the 13th level and become Time Lords, they officially begin sealing timelines and converging timelines.</p><p></p><p>This is also part of a Time Lord's cultivation. The more powerful a Time Lord, the more terrifying their ability to seal their own timeline. Some extremely powerful Time Lords can even use their fully converged timeline to travel to the past, or even slightly alter the past.</p><p></p><p>Of course, altering the past is something that even Time Lords don't dare to do.</p><p></p><p>They can, but they dare not.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the backlash is too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In the infinite dimensions and planes, each time point spawns countless future timelines. If the past of a certain time point were altered, the resulting butterfly effect would be enormous. Even Time Lords couldn't withstand such backlash.</p><p></p><p>Changing the past is fundamentally different from the resurrection of 12th level beings.</p><p></p><p>The latter's resurrection targets the 'life imprint' and has no impact on the past.</p><p></p><p>But changing the past affects the entire span of time from the past to the present.</p><p></p><p>As for the second reason?</p><p></p><p>Even if one could withstand the backlash from slightly altering the past,</p><p></p><p>Who knows if the past you've changed is what the 14th level perfect time being wants? Although so far, no time being has been able to prove whether the 14th level perfect time being truly exists.</p><p></p><p>But they also can't prove that the perfect time being doesn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Since neither can be proven,</p><p></p><p>It's best not to change the past.</p><p></p><p>If the perfect time being really exists, and the past, present, and future are all under its watch, your unauthorized intervention to change things would be equivalent to defying the perfect time being.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even the strongest Time Lord would perish.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards various parts of this source world.</p><p></p><p>The moment he condensed the Lord status,</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies of cultivators throughout this source world simultaneously dropped a notch.</p><p></p><p>Their potential also began to decline significantly at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the level before the great change in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This caused countless cultivators to feel uneasy and fearful.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the current 'demon' calamity had been mostly suppressed by Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>And that great demons, let alone demon spirits, were extremely rare everywhere,</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't have caused any losses.</p><p></p><p>"When the Lord status shattered initially, it merged into the depths of the bloodlines of the beings in this world, causing a significant boost in bloodline potential."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've recondensed the Lord status, it's equivalent to taking back this power from the depths of everyone's bloodlines, naturally everything will return to its original state."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood this point.</p><p></p><p>However, now that he had basically suppressed the demon calamity, and after breaking through to the 13th level, he would thoroughly eradicate the demon calamity.</p><p></p><p>So they hadn't really gained any advantage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, without Lin Yuan, even if their physical bodies and potential had increased significantly, what good would it do? The end result would most likely still be perishing under the endless demon calamity.</p><p></p><p>"This awakened physical [ability], imprinted on the heart and will, doesn't</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It needs to be fully comprehended and then shared with the other two true self avatars."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to sense that Lord rank.</p><p></p><p>For the previous eight divine ability imprints, Lin Yuan needed to fully comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>But the Lord rank did not require that.</p><p></p><p>In some ways, the Lord rank was not a divine ability. </p><p></p><p>It was imprinted on one's mind and will, belonging to whoever condensed it first.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment,</p><p></p><p>Not only was Lin Yuan's origin world true self avatar empowered by the Lord rank,</p><p></p><p>The true self avatars in the chaotic void and first origin world were also empowered by the Lord rank.</p><p></p><p>"This is good too."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>He was about to break through to the 13th level soon.</p><p></p><p>Naturally he wanted to focus all his energy on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for fully comprehending certain divine ability imprints? That could wait until after reaching the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>Not needing to specially comprehend it now, yet being able to share it among all true self avatars, also met Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum~ Outside the second origin world.</p><p></p><p>In a space-time enveloped by infinite light.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen towering figures were resisting the suppression of the surrounding light while quickly observing Lin Yuan's future timeline.</p><p></p><p>The future timeline of someone destined to become a Time Lord held great value for time beings, especially since Lin Yuan was not yet a time being.</p><p></p><p>Peering into it did not pose much difficulty. </p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan became a time being, it would be much harder for them to observe and peer like this.</p><p></p><p>Just as the thirteen Eternal Lords were carefully observing and peering,</p><p></p><p>All timelines related to Lin Yuan seemed to be affected by something, becoming blurry.</p><p></p><p>Even with the thirteen Eternal Lords exerting all their effort to try to observe clearly, it was to no avail. All the future timelines gradually began to be sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I see clearly anymore?"</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords were shocked one after another. For true time beings, the timelines of beings below the 13th level were as clear as looking at the lines on one's palm, visible down to the smallest detail.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's combat power rivaled Eternal Lords, he was ultimately not a time being. Logically he should not have been able to prevent their observation and peering.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River isn't an Eternal Lord yet, but his timeline can already block our observation and peering?"</p><p></p><p>"This is too freakish."</p><p></p><p>The thirteen Eternal Lords reacted one after another, not daring to continue forcefully observing.</p><p></p><p>They did not know the strength of the seal, but as time beings of the same dimensional space, the Eternal Lords still held great goodwill towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, if we can't peer then we can't peer."</p><p></p><p>Lord Infinite sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had long known this day would come, but didn't expect it so soon.</p><p></p><p>Not being a time being, yet possessing combat power at the Eternal Lord level, and now beginning to seal off his own timeline, blocking all peering gazes.</p><p></p><p>Such methods were simply unheard of. Even Lord Infinite, with his vast knowledge and many contacts with time beings outside the origin worlds, had never heard of this before.</p><p></p><p>In the first origin world.</p><p></p><p>The six Ancestors also discovered that Lin Yuan's future timeline was becoming blurry and gradually being sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly is Silver River able to do this?"</p><p></p><p>The six Ancestors were amazed. Not long ago they had just glimpsed Lin Yuan's true power from his future timeline, but before they could explore deeper, they found they could no longer peer into it.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate that very soon, Silver River's power will completely surpass mine," the Great Subduing Ancestor thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Among the six Ancestors of this origin world, his power was the strongest, and he was the first time being at the beginning of the world's creation.</p><p></p><p>But faced with Lin Yuan, this rising star, he felt a sense of despair and suffocation.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing though."</p><p></p><p>"At least not being able to see those futures means there's no pressure."</p><p></p><p>The Great Subduing Ancestor sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"We were just peering for a short while, why can we no longer continue?"</p><p></p><p>The seven 13th level time beings also sensed something, and looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Though frustrated, they knew that if they could no longer peer, it meant Lin Yuan did not want them to.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, naturally no time being would dare to forcefully peer.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding? With Lin Yuan's future of certainly becoming a Time Lord, they wouldn't do that even with ten times the courage.</p><p></p><p>Empowered by the Lord rank.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately felt his three true self avatars become more "relaxed".</p><p></p><p>This "relaxation" had no reason, no origin, but just felt relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Continue on the journey."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Taiji primordial spirit quickly headed towards the location of the Yin-Yang Twin Flower.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious dimensional interstices were truly endless, able to accommodate time beings roaming within.</p><p></p><p>"There have been quite a few gains along this journey."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in good spirits. The dimensional interstices were vast and boundless, also nurturing all kinds of dimensional treasures.</p><p></p><p>By observing his own future timeline, Lin Yuan had basically collected all kinds of dimensional treasures that were on the way.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that in order to open up the infinite sand particle worlds within his body, Lin Yuan had basically invested all the resources he possessed.</p><p></p><p>He was currently in a very "poor" state.</p><p></p><p>These dimensional treasures were like sending charcoal in snowy weather.</p><p></p><p>"There's actually such a large piece of eternal fine gold?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he looked at a golden small mountain in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Eternal fine gold was a 13th level metal. When the 13th level time being "Lord Mo Xu" of the chaotic void established the "Infinite Void" legacy, this metal was used to measure the universe power within the legacy cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But the largest piece of eternal fine gold in the jade gourd was only hundreds of meters large, while the golden small mountain in the distance was over ten thousand miles?</p><p></p><p>Eternal fine gold was not considered precious at the 13th level, but a small mountain of eternal fine gold could be considered rare.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Black and white yin-yang power swept out, pressing down towards that golden small mountain.</p><p></p><p>"There really is an issue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately sensed some resistance. There was a powerful life form within the golden small mountain, but faced with Lin Yuan's chaotic Taiji Dao, life forms below the 13th level basically had no ability to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>"A special dimensional life form?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took away the eternal fine gold mountain and also discovered the dimensional life form residing inside - a golden small bug that fed on eternal fine gold.</p><p></p><p>"I'll study it after returning."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually tossed the eternal fine gold mountain into the universe within his Taiji primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The dimensional interstices have nurtured countless treasures, and also nurtured countless dangers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite emotional. The dimensional treasures he had collected along the way basically all had dangers, but Lin Yuan was powerful enough to ignore them.</p><p></p><p>That eternal fine gold mountain was the same. The golden small bug residing inside was not simple - even an Invincible Great Saint approaching it would instantly perish.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Lin Yuan continued on his journey when he suddenly sensed some fluctuations. His expression changed as he looked in another direction, his gaze becoming pensive. "Is that the greatest opportunity I observed in many timelines that I may encounter?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 258: Taiji Rules, Power of the Universe? (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Master's parents and relatives did not break through to the Harmonious Dao Realm," Li Qing said hesitantly in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Without breaking through to the Harmonious Dao Realm, relying on the lifespan of the Void Refining Realm, at most they could live for one or two hundred thousand years. </p><p></p><p>It was impossible for them to still be alive now, which meant they had already passed away long ago.</p><p></p><p>"They're all gone?" Lin Yuan sighed in his heart upon hearing this, unsurprised.</p><p></p><p>This was the most normal situation. Breaking through from the sixth stage of martial dao to the seventh stage was extremely difficult, just as breaking through from the Void Refining Realm to the Harmonious Dao Realm was also extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Although Jun Dongjin had a mutated spiritual root, one of the rarest talents in the Central Divine Continent, it was not so outstanding after reaching the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, besides spiritual roots, there were many other types of dao bodies that determined one's talent.</p><p></p><p>Jun Dongjin cultivated to the peak of the Void Refining Realm, but ultimately failed in his attempt to break through to the Harmonious Dao Realm and suffered heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>Mu Lian'er did not cultivate to the peak of Void Refining, and neither did Jun Xiaoyao or Jun Zhilan.  </p><p></p><p>With the help of the backup Lin Yuan left behind, they smoothly entered the Void Refining Realm and ascended to the Spirit Realm, but their subsequent cultivation progress was slow.</p><p></p><p>"How were they doing?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"They were doing quite well, the Daode Immortal Sect did not mistreat them," Li Qing immediately replied. Before knowing Lin Yuan's whereabouts, the Daode Immortal Sect didn't dare have any other thoughts about Jun Dongjin and the others.</p><p></p><p>In any case, supporting Jun Dongjin and the others was not even a burden for the vast Daode Immortal Sect. Cangqing Immortal even summoned Jun Dongjin and the others several times to give them teachings.</p><p></p><p>But going from Void Refining to Harmonious Dao could not be achieved just by listening to a couple teachings and being given enough cultivation resources. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, everyone in the Daode Immortal Sect should have become true immortals, instead of only having a few dozen true immortals presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>"Before Master's parents passed away, they told me not to give up searching for you," Li Qing said, her voice a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. If he had traversed a bit earlier, perhaps the result would have been different.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if I can become an ultimate powerhouse, I can try to resurrect them," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>An ultimate powerhouse grasping complete mastery over the rules of time and space could reverse time, go against the flow, and fish out beings who died in the past to resurrect them.</p><p></p><p>Before Jun Dongjin, Jun Zhilan and the others died, they were at the Void Refining Realm, equivalent to the sixth stage. Their life essence was powerful. Even if they did not intentionally fuse their life essence into the Spirit Realm, after living for so long, their essence would have long been recorded by the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan became an ultimate powerhouse and descended upon this realm, going against the flow, he should be able to resurrect them.</p><p></p><p>As for them dying due to the exhaustion of their lifespan, even if resurrected, they would face the end of their lifespan again after a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan could completely extend their lifespan within those few breaths.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm's methods to extend lifespan were useless, but the main world had many such methods.</p><p></p><p>As for the world's backlash that would be suffered after resurrecting a life...</p><p></p><p>"Also, the descendants of Master's eldest brother and second sister are doing well in the Daode Immortal Sect," Li Qing suddenly remembered something and immediately spoke.</p><p></p><p>Relying on Lin Yuan's relationship, Li Qing, a seventh stage martial artist comparable to true immortals, was definitely the patron saint and trump card of the Jun family descendants.</p><p></p><p>As long as Li Qing was alive, the Jun family descendants could not possibly do poorly, and Cangqing Immortal was also watching over them.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Lin Yuan glanced at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you want me to have those outstanding Jun family descendants come pay you a visit?" Li Qing asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine." After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan felt that since he had some karmic ties with the Jun family, now that he had descended again, meeting them was not out of the question.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Li Qing closed her eyes and immediately began contacting them.</p><p></p><p>As a general leading the Daode Immortal Sect's external conquests, Li Qing naturally had means to directly contact the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Should the news about Master be kept secret?" </p><p></p><p>After sending the message, Li Qing asked cautiously, "Cangqing Immortal once told me that if there was any news about Master, I should inform him immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Cangqing Immortal... is still alive?" Lin Yuan became interested.</p><p></p><p>This old fellow's conduct still made him quite satisfied. At least he did not kick them while they were down during Lin Yuan's absence.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan knew, back when they were still in the Central Divine Continent, Cangqing Immortal had already lived for several hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now, after another several hundred thousand years had passed, even a peak Harmonious Dao Realm true immortal should be nearing the end of his lifespan, right?</p><p></p><p>"Cangqing Immortal passed the Spirit Tribulation, so his lifespan is much longer than ordinary true immortals," Li Qing immediately explained.</p><p></p><p>To step from the Harmonious Dao Realm into the Tribulation Transcendence Realm, immortal cultivators needed to pass two tribulations.</p><p></p><p>One was the Physical Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The other was the Spirit Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The latter was similar to the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>For immortal cultivators, the Physical Tribulation was the hardest to pass.</p><p></p><p>Most of the immortal cultivation techniques did not focus on the physical body. Facing the decay and deterioration of the body in the Physical Tribulation, they had few means to resist.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of the soul was extended to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>And for true immortals, if the physical body decayed, they could just switch to another one.</p><p></p><p>As long as the soul persisted, they could be considered undying.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to conceal it," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Conceal it?</p><p></p><p>Why conceal it?</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had recovered his full strength and progressed even further, even among Tribulation Transcendent Immortal Kings, he could be considered a peerless powerhouse, not inferior to Supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, there was no need to hide anything at all.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Li Qing responded.</p><p></p><p>After chatting a bit more with Li Qing, Lin Yuan turned his gaze to the other two, Nie Yun and Shan Yang, who were sitting solemnly.</p><p></p><p>These two seventh stage martial artists were rising stars of the martial cultivation system. Being able to step into the seventh stage with the pointers Lin Yuan left behind spoke volumes about their martial talent.</p><p></p><p>"You have never received my personal guidance, so you've done quite well. The jade slips contain my insights on seventh stage cultivation, which should be helpful to you."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, two white jade slips appeared in front of Nie Yun and Shan Yang.</p><p></p><p>Although the path these two martial cultivators took to enter the seventh stage was what Lin Yuan considered the wrong path, it was not impossible for them to remake their foundations.</p><p></p><p>"As for you..." Lin Yuan looked at Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing had already reached the peak of the seventh stage. Remaking her martial foundation was not a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan already had an idea. Just by observing Li Qing for a moment, his Heaven-Defying Enlightenment created a remaking technique suitable for her.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Defying Enlightenment depended on Lin Yuan's level. Now that he was at the mid-stage of the eighth level, creating a mere seventh stage remaking technique did not require much effort.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master," Li Qing said with immense gratitude.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the peak of the seventh stage, she had vaguely sensed that there was no path ahead. If nothing unexpected happened, she would probably be stuck here for the rest of her life.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was able to step into the...</p><p></p><p>Seventh Stage, apart from luck, what's more important is the guidance left by Lin Yuan at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang and Nie Yun walked out of the Martial Ancestor Hall with surging emotions.</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Today, they actually met the legendary Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of the Martial Ancestor, not to mention comparable to a Crossing Tribulation Immortal King, is at least much stronger than Cangqing Immortal who has half a foot in the Crossing Tribulation stage in the Moral Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Can my martial dao also give birth to such a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang was in high spirits. He returned to the cave mansion with Nie Yun, and it took a long time for him to calm down.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Martial Ancestor told them that the martial dao is not a dead end. Like the immortal dao, it is also a great dao leading to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"The jade slip given to us by the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun seemed to think of something and reminded.</p><p></p><p>Just now in the Martial Ancestor Hall, the Martial Ancestor gave each of them a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>It is said to be helpful for the future cultivation of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Right."</p><p></p><p>"Jade slip?"</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>He directly took out that white jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The jade slip was very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>It was almost no different from the low-level jade slips used by Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stage immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But Shan Yang, a seventh stage martial arts expert, held it in front of his eyes respectfully as if facing a sacred object.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang and Nie Yun finally looked at each other, and simultaneously viewed the contents of the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Shan Yang and Nie Yun were shocked, and their hearts were stirred up like stormy seas.</p><p></p><p>So this is how the cultivation of the seventh stage of martial dao is.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the seventh stage of martial dao can also be like this?</p><p></p><p>The content in the jade slip was not much, but the two seventh stage martial arts experts spent a whole day looking at it.</p><p></p><p>Every word was repeatedly pondered in their hearts. With each pondering, they could comprehend different meanings.</p><p></p><p>A day later.</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang suddenly came back to his senses, looked at the jade slip in his hand, and muttered to himself: "My martial dao is also a great dao leading to the heavens."</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun was in high spirits, his eyes flashing with divine light, "The Martial Ancestor is truly a divine being. Starting from nothing, he opened up the martial dao. Now he has made so many interpretations of the seventh stage."</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other again, stood up, shook their sleeves, faced the Martial Ancestor Hall, and respectfully bowed three times.</p><p></p><p>Thank you Martial Ancestor for the kindness of imparting the dao.</p><p></p><p>Thank you Martial Ancestor for the kindness of imparting the dao.</p><p></p><p>Thank you Martial Ancestor for the kindness of imparting the dao.</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat there, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>Giving pointers to the three seventh stage martial arts experts was just a simple matter for him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was thinking about something else in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Huailong Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said to himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Huailong Palace is a Unifying Dao level force in the Nine Rivers Domain. For hundreds of thousands of years, the Moral Immortal Sect has basically been fighting and killing with Huailong Palace.</p><p></p><p>The two major forces have become like fire and water because of that Essence of Heavenly Water.</p><p></p><p>Every few hundred or thousand years, a war will break out, and nearly ten Unifying Dao stage True Immortals will take action.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing and the other two seventh stage martial arts experts mostly fought on the battlefield with Huailong Palace.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Jun Dongjin ascended to the Spirit Realm and reached the peak of the Void Refinement stage, he was seriously injured by an ancient saint of dragon descent from Huailong Palace.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for that serious injury, Jun Dongjin might have had a chance to step into the Unifying Dao stage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a possibility. In fact, he would probably still fail the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But at least it would make the backlash lighter and allow him to live a few hundred more years.</p><p></p><p>Above the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each layer of heaven contains some kind of phenomenon, either the manifestation of the fundamental laws of the Great Dao, or some kind of "spectacle" related to the essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>The Fourth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A figure standing with its back, burning like the sun.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan's Sun Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can at most stop at the Fourth Heaven. As for the Fifth Heaven..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the sky, where dark clouds were dense and countless pale purple lightning intertwined.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Fifth Heaven, one must go through the Nine Heavenly Tribulations, which are countless times more terrifying than the physical tribulation in the breakthrough from the Unifying Dao stage to the Crossing Tribulation stage.</p><p></p><p>Although Unifying Dao stage True Immortals can roam the nine heavens of the Spirit Realm, experts of this level can at most stroll in the First and Second Heavens.</p><p></p><p>As for the Third Heaven, they basically can't enter. The Fourth Heaven is even more the domain of Crossing Tribulation Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Heaven? Probably only the strong among Immortal Kings can withstand the Nine Heavenly Tribulations and enter.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Sun Primordial Spirit is just a primordial spirit, and its combat power is far inferior to the real body. Unless the Yin and Yang primordial spirits merge to form the Taiji Primordial Spirit, rashly experiencing the Nine Heavenly Tribulations risks the collapse of the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the fusion and transformation of the Yin and Yang laws is about to end."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the power of this primordial spirit body of mine will definitely greatly increase."</p><p></p><p>Anticipation arose in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Since reopening the inner world, the Yin and Yang laws have fused to form a sphere of light, suspended in the sky of the inner world, slowly transforming.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that once the transformation was complete, the Yin and Yang laws would undergo unimaginable changes.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan quietly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness avatar appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sense of palpitation arose in Lin Yuan's heart, vaguely perceiving that the transformation inside the sphere of light had reached the final stage.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The sound of shattering that only Lin Yuan could hear suddenly rang in his ears.</p><p></p><p>The sphere of light in the sky began to gradually crack open.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Strands of brand-new power, or rather, laws, slowly revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>This power appeared in black and white, and on the surface, it seemed no different from before, but it was the same in the infinitely microscopic realm.</p><p></p><p>This meant complete fusion. The newly born power, or rather, laws, were no longer a combination of Yin and Yang, but were originally so.</p><p></p><p>The flawless power of black and white turned into the perfect power of Taiji, quickly integrating into the inner world.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>Raising his right hand, the pure black and white power of Yin and Yang emitted a dreamy glow, slowly influencing the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a sense of absolute control.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of his perception, he could control everything.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling, how is it so similar to the cosmic power of the Eighth Stage Invincible?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up. Although the Eighth Stage Invincible of the main world could not be replicated, some characteristics of the Eighth Stage Invincible were recorded.</p><p></p><p>Among them were descriptions related to the cosmic power comprehended by the Eighth Stage Invincible.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the cosmic powers comprehended by the Eighth Stage Invincible had one thing in common.</p><p></p><p>That is control.</p><p></p><p>Control everything.</p><p></p><p>Absolute control.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of Yin and Yang, transforming into Taiji, is actually the embryonic form of some kind of cosmic power?"</p><p></p><p>Joy arose in Lin Yuan's heart. At this time, even without relying on the inner world of 26 million miles in radius, without relying on various innate divine abilities and secret techniques, he could still contend against other Eighth Stage Invincible experts.</p><p></p><p>Because he was now an Eighth Stage Invincible.</p>

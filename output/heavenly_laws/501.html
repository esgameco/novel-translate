        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Homeland Universe, the Mysterious and Profound Realm, Lin Yuan opened his eyes and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Wei Yang' of the Immortal Abode allowed Lin Yuan to gain greatly, so he urgently needed a place to digest it. The Ancient and Chaotic Continent was obviously a good choice.</p><p></p><p>"First, let my avatar get familiar with it there, and when I reach the Twelfth Realm, I will bring many unused treasures and resources there to trade," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Twelfth Realm, Lin Yuan dared not let his avatar carry too precious treasures out of the universe.</p><p></p><p>And trading, compared to killing and robbing, Lin Yuan still prefers fair trade, which is the safest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is not one of those Twelfth Realm Dao Splitting cultivators with a bleak future. Relying on his extraordinary comprehension, the thing he lacks the most is a safe growth environment.</p><p></p><p>"My current inner world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided a wisp of consciousness to descend into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to a hundred years ago, his inner world had expanded several times, reaching the astonishing range of eleven light-years.</p><p></p><p>The range of eleven light-years is millions to tens of millions of times greater than the ordinary Eleventh Realm Perfected Life, Lin Yuan's inner world is simply incalculable.</p><p></p><p>"My current inner world, physical body, and soul, etc., have all reached the extreme, and the transformation brought by the Chaotic Rules has been almost completely absorbed," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Chaotic Rules is ultimately no match for the transcendence of the essence of life. The absorption and immersion of the primal energy of the Chaotic Void in his inner world is ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>"Even in the boundless Chaotic Void, am I the strongest Eleventh Realm cultivator?" Lin Yuan felt the unfathomable energy in his inner world and thought.</p><p></p><p>He was not sure about the current era of the Chaotic Void, but in the era of Xuan Huang the Emperor and the Lord of the Demon Jade Tower, he had never heard of any Eleventh Realm cultivator stronger than himself.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void is full of countless opportunities.</p><p></p><p>There have been cases where Eleventh Realm life forms have confronted Twelfth Realm cultivators. That was with the help of many external forces, but for Lin Yuan, relying solely on himself, to reach a level comparable to or even surpassing ordinary Dao Splitting cultivators, it can be said to be truly unparalleled in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"In the past hundred years, the evolutionary path of the Dao Splitting Realm has been almost perfected," Lin Yuan's thoughts fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the ultimate and enter the Twelfth Realm Dao Splitting Realm, he naturally needs to perfect the Dao Splitting Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even a hundred years ago, Lin Yuan had already perfected the initial stage of the Dao Splitting Realm, and at that time, he could have directly stepped into the Twelfth Realm without any problem.</p><p></p><p>But during the waiting period for his own transformation, Lin Yuan took the opportunity to perfect the entire Dao Splitting Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Before breaking through to the ultimate, let me see if I can pass the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower," Lin Yuan's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, Lin Yuan easily passed the Seventh Floor of the Black Tower, but was stuck at the last part of the Eighth Floor.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan realized the lack of the essence of his life.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, he was only an Eleventh Realm life form.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the expansion of his inner world several times, Lin Yuan's essence of life naturally rose with the tide, and it had also improved greatly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was still not as good as the Sovereign Realm cultivators, he had comprehended the Chaotic Rules, which surpassed the vast majority of peak Sovereign Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan directly descended into the Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Demon Jade Tower had set a rule that the rewards obtained by any tower climber were related to their performance during the climb.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan chose to pass the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower at the Eleventh Realm, and the benefits he would receive would naturally be much greater than if he passed it after reaching the Twelfth Realm Dao Splitting Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Twelfth Realm Dao Splitting cultivator passed the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower, it would still be considered extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Demon Jade Space.</p><p>The Nine-story Black Tower.</p><p>Lin Yuan's figure descended.</p><p></p><p>"You're here," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji walked out and looked at Lin Yuan with a somewhat emotional gaze.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that he would encounter such a monstrous prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan, even the Demon Jade Tower Lord, who was a Chaotic Great Saint, could be considered... mediocre?</p><p></p><p>"I'll try the Eighth Floor," Lin Yuan said in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji nodded and cleared the path to the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Lin Yuan entered the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower.</p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji immediately began to watch.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan did not hesitate and directly drew on the Chaotic Qi to empower himself.</p><p></p><p>He reached the final stage of the Eighth Floor.</p><p></p><p>"Break for me!" Lin Yuan shouted in a low voice, and his enhanced life essence finally allowed him to cross over and step into the 'end' of the Eighth Floor.</p><p></p><p>"I passed," Lin Yuan felt a slight relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had reached the limit of his own strength. If he still couldn't pass the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower, he would probably have to wait until he broke through to the Twelfth Realm Dao Splitting Realm before trying again.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you are the 142nd member to pass the Eighth Floor of my Demon Jade Tower," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji appeared and said.</p><p></p><p>"The 142nd?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Only 142 people?" Shen Ji sighed.</p><p></p><p>Those who can pass the Eighth Floor of the Black Tower are usually peak Sovereign Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the heyday of the Demon Jade Tower, it had 141 peak Sovereign Realm cultivators, as well as several Chaotic Realm cultivators, with the Demon Jade Tower Lord, who was a Chaotic Great Saint, presiding over it. This was already considered extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at the Chaotic Realm, there are very few who would submit to a Chaotic Great Saint. The Chaotic Venerable Ones can easily establish their own Chaotic Continent and live freely. Why bother following a Chaotic Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>Protection?</p><p>With the strength of a Chaotic Venerable One, unless they act recklessly, it is difficult for them to die.</p><p>It is also difficult for a Chaotic Great Saint to completely destroy a Chaotic Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Sovereign's many life-saving techniques should not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Guidance?</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Sovereign can only rely on himself to reach the Chaotic Great Saint realm. Relying on a Chaotic Great Saint would provide little help for him to step into the Chaotic Great Saint domain.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Bright Chaotic Continent's Ancient Bright Sovereigns, even the Chaotic Dragon Beasts they have reclaimed, are only nearly comparable to the Chaotic Sovereign, not equivalent to the Chaotic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it, but he still slightly underestimated himself.</p><p></p><p>At present, leaving other aspects aside, at least in the realm of rules, he has already surpassed the peak of the vast majority of Overlord Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Even the strength of the prosperous era's Magical Jade Tower could only rank within the top two hundred.</p><p></p><p>"This is the reward list for you passing the eighth layer." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji waved his hand, and a light screen appeared in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The list recorded superior Chaotic Realm treasures.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the reward for passing the eighth layer of the Black Tower would be Overlord Realm top-grade treasures, occasionally with one or two Chaotic Realm treasures.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had passed it with an eleventh-stage cultivation, and the treasures listed by the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji were the most precious among the entire nine-layer Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Even regular Magical Jade Tower members, even if they passed the ninth layer, would not have access to these treasures.</p><p></p><p>Only those Chaotic Sovereigns who had broken through the ninth layer in an exceptionally extraordinary manner, with the hope of becoming Chaotic Great Saints, would receive the same treatment as Lin Yuan who had just passed the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>"So many treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was secretly shocked. The Chaotic Realm secret treasure left behind by the peak Overlord Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang' did not even qualify as the bottom of this reward list.</p><p></p><p>For Chaotic Sovereigns, Chaotic Realm secret treasures were not particularly precious, as many Chaotic Realm secret treasures were just casually refined by them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, 'Cang Weiyang' would not have possessed three Chaotic Realm secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Unraveling Dao Realm and Overlord Realm experts, Chaotic Realm secret weapon treasures were already extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>"Which one should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a bit at a loss for a moment.</p><p></p><p>First, he excluded the weapon secret treasures. The weapon secret treasures on the reward list were the top-tier Chaotic Realm weapon secret treasures, and even if Lin Yuan broke through to the twelfth stage, he would not be able to refine them for a long time, let alone activate them.</p><p></p><p>If he could not refine them and use them, then no matter how precious they were, they would be somewhat ostentatious.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll wait until I break through to the twelfth stage before choosing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it, and since he was only at the eleventh stage now, if he chose rashly, and it turned out to be not very useful when he reached the twelfth stage, wouldn't that be a loss?</p><p></p><p>After all, he currently lacked nothing, so there was no need to choose immediately.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait and choose later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji and said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I want to go to the ninth layer and take a look." Lin Yuan looked up at the ninth layer of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>This was also the final layer of the Black Tower. Once one passed the ninth layer of the Black Tower, they were basically recognized as having Chaotic Realm peak strength, and were not far from becoming a Chaotic Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji's expression revealed a touch of strangeness, but he still nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan arrived at the ninth layer of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>There was no pressure here, nor any so-called rule tests.</p><p></p><p>The entire ninth layer was empty and desolate, which left Lin Yuan quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What is the standard for passing the ninth layer?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his mind, but there was no place resembling a "finish line" nearby.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the heavens and earth of the entire ninth layer suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a majestic figure coalescing.</p><p></p><p>He wore a black robe, his gaze indifferent, as if containing the rules of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed, and as he made eye contact with this majestic figure, he then sensed his consciousness falling, and when he recovered, he found himself outside the ninth layer of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth layer is?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"To pass the ninth layer, one must defeat the imprint left behind by the master originally." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The imprint left behind by the master of the Magical Jade Tower?" Lin Yuan was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>He had known that the ninth layer of the Black Tower would be difficult, but he didn't expect it to be this difficult. The master of the Magical Jade Tower was a Chaotic Great Saint, and his imprint would not be something ordinary Chaotic Realm experts could deal with.</p><p></p><p>After all, the experts who appeared in the Magical Jade Space were only manifestations of the master's spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that the strength of the Magical Jade Tower master should not be weaker than Emperor Xuan." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he watched Emperor Xuan open the 33,333 Mysterious Yellow Secret Realms, Lin Yuan had still felt that Emperor Xuan might be a bit stronger than the Magical Jade Tower master.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind that for now." Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, his gaze distantly gazing towards the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, Lin Yuan's two major divine souls and incarnations had been roaming the universe, frequently sensing the gaze of the fate-locking scrutiny from the Twelfth Stage alien experts.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, those Twelfth Stage alien experts were not stronger than Lin Yuan in their comprehension of the Dao of Fate, so even if Lin Yuan gave them the opportunity and actively released his two major divine souls and incarnations outside, the Twelfth Stage alien experts could not lock onto the locations of the two major divine souls and incarnations, let alone launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunities have been given to you, but it's useless."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed, at this moment he had reached the pinnacle in all aspects, and could assault the ultimate at any time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

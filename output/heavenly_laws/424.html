gift..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the vast space within the giant rock, his expression turning slightly solemn. </p><p></p><p>The creator of this secret realm had prepared this gift to celebrate the next existence to reach the tenth stage in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>They attached exceptional importance to this, so naturally the gift was extremely precious, even surprising Lin Yuan to some extent.</p><p></p><p>But in a sense, Lin Yuan could also be considered an existence at the tenth stage. </p><p></p><p>Accepting this gift was only appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined every detail of the space within the giant rock, and finally nodded slightly, saying, "Six hundred and seventy-eight in total."</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The gift prepared by the creator was void creatures. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were all perfected void creature kings at the ninth stage, totaling six hundred and seventy-eight.</p><p></p><p>Currently, they were sleeping soundly in an orderly fashion within the vast space inside the giant rock.</p><p></p><p>Void creatures were not life forms native to the boundless void, but rather came from outside it, from the gaps between dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Hence, void creatures were also called gap lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Slaying void creatures could enhance one's spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the slain void creature, the greater the increase in spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Among void creatures, the kings were undoubtedly the best for enhancing spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still remembered when he slew his first perfected ninth-stage void creature king.</p><p></p><p>It directly caused his spiritual will index to soar from 12 million points to nearly 20 million.</p><p></p><p>A single void creature king directly increased his spiritual will index by nearly 8 million points, on top of his existing 12 million points?</p><p></p><p>Such an increase was unheard of even in the main universe, according to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even speculated that if his spiritual will index had been only 1-2 million points instead of 12 million, slaying that perfected ninth-stage void creature king might have directly raised his spiritual will index to 10-20 million points.</p><p></p><p>The higher the spiritual will index, the harder it was to increase further.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how immensely valuable a perfected ninth-stage void creature king was.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>During the hundreds of years that Lin Yuan's solar spiritual soul had ventured through the void secret realm, he had only encountered one.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan's spatiotemporal fusion comprehension had reached the sixth level, he could see through the entire void secret realm with a glance, but so far he had only discovered four void creature kings.</p><p></p><p>Two of them were only at the eighth stage, while the other two were at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>These four void creature kings were hidden in extremely secluded locations within the void secret realm, places that even the perfected demon sovereigns would likely never find in tens of millions or hundreds of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>All six hundred and seventy-eight void creature kings were sleeping quietly in the space within the giant rock.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these six hundred and seventy-eight were all perfected at the ninth stage, each one capable of surpassing the sole void creature king that Lin Yuan had slain in terms of enhancing spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>"What extravagance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>So many void creature kings...perhaps all the existing void creature kings in the world since the creation of the void secret realm didn't add up to this many.</p><p></p><p>Even the Child of the Void, the overseer of this void secret realm, had likely never seen so many void creature kings.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have become the gift from the creator to congratulate the next tenth-stage existence.</p><p></p><p>At least in the eyes of the creator, so many void creature kings could have a significant effect on a tenth-stage existence.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense," Lin Yuan thought with a contemplative expression.</p><p></p><p>When the creator initially established the void secret realm and "gathered" the various gap lifeforms from outside the boundless void, they must have kept the highest quality batch for themselves.</p><p></p><p>And this was the origin of the hundreds of perfected ninth-stage void creature kings currently in the space within the giant rock.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can also temporarily break free from the boundless void and access the gaps between different dimensions to hunt those gap lifeforms," Lin Yuan mused, stroking his chin.</p><p></p><p>After his spatiotemporal fusion comprehension reached the sixth level, he felt he could escape the confines of the boundless void and travel through the void secret realm to the interdimensional gap regions.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p>"Too much of a waste of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly abandoned this idea.</p><p></p><p>How many years, tens of billions or even trillions of years, had the creator spent to capture so many void creatures? On average, it took millions of years just to obtain a single void creature king.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan's current strength did surpass the creator's to some extent, it wasn't vastly superior. Spending millions of years to hunt a single void creature king was not worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>In millions of years, Lin Yuan didn't know what heights he could reach.</p><p></p><p>The creator had done this because they had reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had no such need.</p><p></p><p>With that much time, even allowing his spiritual will to increase slowly...</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what level my spiritual will index could reach with so many perfected ninth-stage void creature kings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the myriad void creature kings in the space within the giant rock, his expression full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>According to his original plan, the upper limit of his spiritual will index in this boundless void would only be around 25 million points.</p><p></p><p>This was because there simply weren't enough void creatures available for him to slay.</p><p></p><p>Especially after passing 20 million points, only by slaying the kings among the void creatures could he make any meaningful progress.</p><p></p><p>But now, looking at the countless void creature kings in the space within the giant rock, Lin Yuan could hardly estimate his eventual spiritual will index limit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, Lin Yuan immediately started slaying the void creatures in the space within the giant rock.</p><p></p><p>He felt no pity towards these void creatures, as they did not belong to the same species. It was like ordinary people slaughtering chickens and pigs.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, nearly a hundred perfected demon sovereigns had gathered to discuss the birth of the second tenth-stage existence.</p><p></p><p>"The existence who crossed into the tenth stage is named Wuzu?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuzu wants us to cede half of our territory to those puny insects?"</p><p></p><p>"How powerful is Wuzu to be so merciful to those insects?"</p><p></p><p>"If you have objections, go discuss it with Wuzu?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, I wouldn't dare."</p><p></p><p>The various perfected demon sovereigns were all discussing this matter. Although some were dissatisfied with having to cede half their territory, none dared to argue with Wuzu. They had all grown to the perfected ninth stage, unlike those occasional bouts of madness from sixth or seventh stage demons.</p><p></p><p>Perfected ninth stage demons were extremely rational, clearly understanding what could and could not be done. Wuzu's will at the tenth stage could not be defied.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, merely ceding half their territory did not cross the bottom line for these perfected demons, so their reactions were not overly intense.</p><p></p><p>As the many perfected demons debated and discussed, the Child of the Void sat nonchalantly on his throne, casually observing the perfected demons below.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Wuzu has disappeared from the void secret realm?"</p><p>"I can't sense Wuzu's aura anywhere in the entire void secret realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void carefully sensed and speculated inwardly, "Could there be secrets about the void secret realm that even I don't know?"</p><p></p><p>Having overseen the void secret realm for ages, the Child of the Void thought he understood it extremely well.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Wuzu's aura mysteriously vanishing, he couldn't help but consider other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Child of the Void had no other thoughts, as he had failed to discover any secrets over the long ages. Even if given ten or a hundred times longer, he still wouldn't find them.</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void glanced down. By now, the many perfected demon sovereigns below had debated enough.</p><p></p><p>Ceding half their territory didn't really affect the Child of the Void. The main issue was how much each perfected demon sovereign decided to cede.</p><p></p><p>"Does Wuzu shelter those insects because they can cultivate martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void pondered silently, "When I have time, I should try cultivating martial arts too."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor valued the martial path so much, which piqued the curiosity of the Child of the Void, who decided to try it out himself.</p><p></p><p>Time passed. </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten years went by.</p><p></p><p>In the hidden space of the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on that huge rock. </p><p></p><p>His formless mental willpower swept in all directions, distorting space-time and forming a mental storm that raged through this hidden space.</p><p></p><p>"My mental willpower has finally reached the pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, and his immense mental willpower began to rapidly retract.</p><p></p><p>After ten years of absorption, continuously slaying one Void creature king after another, Lin Yuan's mental willpower finally reached the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the pinnacle meant that continuing to slay those Void creature kings would no longer significantly improve his mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>"My current mental willpower index should be between 33,300,000 and 33,400,000?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself and made an estimate.</p><p></p><p>"Is this range of mental willpower index 33,333,333?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could not determine his exact mental willpower index. Even in the human civilization of the main universe, where mental willpower could be measured, it was only a rough estimate.</p><p></p><p>But this range of 33,300,000 to 33,400,000 mental willpower points made Lin Yuan think of the number 33,333,333.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, Lin Yuan had encountered this number many times before - the number of insights needed for the Demonic Jade Tower's Demonic Evolution Path, the number of silver-white words in the 'Interpretation of the Void', and the initial time needed to accumulate a wisp of Realm-Crossing Source Power for the Door of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>And now, his mental willpower index upon reaching the pinnacle was also close to this number.</p><p></p><p>"This number must hold a great secret," Lin Yuan thought to himself, but he set this doubt aside for now.</p><p></p><p>No matter what secret it held, it was still too far from Lin Yuan's current level. At least he would need to cross into the Ultimate Realm before having the ability to explore and investigate it.</p><p></p><p>"Over 33 million mental willpower points, although at the level of the strongest, can't be considered weak, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly.</p><p></p><p>A mental willpower index of 18 million was the threshold for a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Only after a life underwent the Ultimate Leap and lingered on the 'shore' would its mental willpower rapidly surpass this line.</p><p></p><p>And over 33,330,000 mental willpower points exceeded this threshold by nearly a step, a level that even those who had just entered the Twelfth Stage of the Ultimate Realm might not immediately reach.</p><p></p><p>Increasing mental willpower by a factor was infinitely more difficult than increasing physical strength by the same factor.</p><p></p><p>"There are 203 Void creature kings left," Lin Yuan glanced again at the Void creature kings in the space within the huge rock.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan's mental willpower index had reached its limit, continuing to slay these Void creature kings would no longer produce any improvement.</p><p></p><p>It was just like how after Lin Yuan's mental willpower index exceeded 1 million points, slaying ordinary Void creatures could no longer produce any effect.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that these Void creatures originate from the interdimensional gap and cannot enter other dimensions, otherwise they would dissipate into nothingness."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought. Early on, after the Sun Primordial Mind had entered the Void Secret Realm and slain the first Void creature, Lin Yuan had discovered this rule.</p><p></p><p>That is, Void creatures could not enter the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Void Secret Realm was a 'web' formed by the Boundless Void extending into the interdimensional gap, essentially still located within the interdimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>That was why the Void creatures could exist within the secret realm - they simply could not leave.</p><p></p><p>But that was all. Any Void creature that officially entered the Boundless Void dimension would perish irreversibly, regardless of any isolation method or means.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan had never seen these Void creatures outside of the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>And if they could not even enter the Boundless Void, let alone the Chaotic Void where the main universe resided, Lin Yuan felt quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>Slaying these Void creatures could directly and greatly enhance one's mental willpower - something that would be considered an inconceivable fantasy in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Such a simple, drastic improvement, without any theory to explain it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if Lin Yuan could bring these Void creatures to the main universe, even if he was unwilling to fight them himself, just exchanging them within the human civilization would net him an unimaginable amount of merit points and priceless Twelfth Grade treasures.</p><p></p><p>There was no doubt that the Tenth and Eleventh Stage cultivators of the human civilization would spare no expense to increase their mental willpower, even if only by a little.</p><p></p><p>As for the Realm-Crossing Source Power needed to bring the Void creatures from the Boundless Void back to the main universe, as long as Lin Yuan obtained enough of it, he wouldn't mind expending it to do so.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, Realm-Crossing Source Power was also a resource, and a renewable one at that.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, since the Void creatures could not survive in any dimension, Lin Yuan's idea of trading between the two realms was doomed from the start.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not bring the Void creatures to the main universe, Lin Yuan had a way to allow the human cultivators there to enjoy the direct mental willpower enhancement from slaying Void creatures.</p><p></p><p>That was to directly bring them to descend into the Boundless Void and enter the Void Secret Realm, then have them slay those Void creatures themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Door of Myriad Realms could transport physical bodies as well as items from the main universe into the worlds it traversed. Naturally, it could also bring other lifeforms to descend into the traversed worlds.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a matter of expending some Realm-Crossing Source Power.</p><p></p><p>Since the Void creatures could not leave, he would bring the human cultivators from the main universe in instead.</p><p></p><p>But this method carried great risk and could easily expose the secret of the Door of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>The means to traverse different dimensions was something even existences approaching the Perfect Time Life could not directly achieve, yet Lin Yuan had casually accomplished it - and was even bringing people along?</p><p></p><p>The Door of Myriad Realms was Lin Yuan's greatest trump card, far surpassing the Mystery Yellow Secret Realm, the Demonic Jade Space, and so on. He absolutely could not let even a shred of its secret leak out.</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that, although this method was highly feasible and the gains could be considered outrageous profits, relying on Lin Yuan's connection to the Azure World to bring a human cultivator and descend here, expending at most one or two wisps of Realm-Crossing Source Power...</p><p></p><p>While the gains could potentially be half a cultivator's lifetime of accumulation.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan would never take that risk.</p><p></p><p>Even if he crossed into the Ultimate Realm in the future, he still would not do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>If he could reach the Ultimate Realm, Lin Yuan might choose to appropriately reveal the Mystery Yellow Secret Realm, but the Door of Myriad Realms? Forget about it.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just leave these remaining Void creature kings here."</p><p></p><p>After taking one last look at the space within the huge rock, Lin Yuan took a step and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began walking through the Void Secret Realm, carefully sensing every aspect of this secret realm.</p><p></p><p>With the Six Realms of Spacetime Comprehension, Lin Yuan could see through everything in the Void Secret Realm at a glance, but being able to see through it did not mean it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Although the creator of this secret realm had failed in their attempt to reach the Ultimate Realm, being able to cross into the Tenth Stage meant their potential was unquestionable. Failing to reach the Ultimate Realm did not negate this.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were various factors involved in failing to reach the Ultimate Realm, bad luck being a very possible one.</p><p></p><p>After spending five years, Lin Yuan had walked through every corner of the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then he began to explore the entire Boundless Void itself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Void Secret Realm, the Boundless Void was much simpler, but it consumed more of Lin Yuan's effort.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Void Secret Realm was artificially created, and although it contained the path of a being at the Tenth Stage, it still could not compare to the Boundless Void itself.</p><p></p><p>Another five years passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finished traversing the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan randomly chose a spot to sit cross-legged, ending his observation period. Now he would pause to reflect properly, turning everything he had seen and experienced into his own gains.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a corner of the vast Boundless Void, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, sorting through his insights.</p><p></p><p>He already had a great deal of enlightenment welling up, and now after ten years of observation, everything had converged within his mind to be rapidly comprehended with his transcendent intuition.</p><p></p><p>[With your transcendent intuition, observing the Void has greatly enhanced your comprehension of the rules of life and death reincarnation.]</p><p></p><p>[With your transcendent intuition, observing the Void has greatly enhanced your comprehension of the rules of great destruction.]  </p><p></p><p>[With your transcendent intuition, observing the Void has greatly enhanced your comprehension of the rules of causality fluctuations.]</p>

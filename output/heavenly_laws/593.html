        <h1>Chapter 593</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, the Space-Time Transfer Zone.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is one of the mightiest overlords of this world, ruling over a vast and boundless domain.</p><p></p><p>Even for Celestial Supremes, traversing the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is no easy feat. </p><p></p><p>The Celestial Supremes have mastered the control of space-time to the utmost, yet they would still need to make hundreds of millions of void leaps just to barely reach the other end of the ancient kingdom from one side.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of void leaps? Even if one could perform a hundred leaps in a single breath, it would still take tens of thousands of breaths to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>By the time they arrive, the yellow flowers would have already wilted.</p><p></p><p>And the maximum-distance void leaps would also severely drain the Celestial Supremes' vital energies - no Celestial Supreme could sustain such uninterrupted void leaping for hundreds of millions of times.</p><p></p><p>However, the space-time transfer zone in the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom allows one to arrive at any major domain city within the ancient kingdom in just over a dozen breaths.</p><p></p><p>The war between the Azure Flame Domain and the Purple Dream Domain, from the Spiritual Monarch King revealing the limit of the core imperial clan's power, to the arrival of the Crimson Treasure King through the space-time transfer array, all took place within just over thirty breaths.</p><p></p><p>Most of that time was spent on transmitting information and deciding which limit core imperial clan member to send as reinforcement.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom has an intimate understanding of the domain cities within its territory, relying on this web-like space-time transfer array, in addition to the awe-inspiring might of the ancestral progenitors.</p><p></p><p>The space-time transfer array of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is also open to outsiders, though the price is exorbitant, beyond the means of even the Overlords under its dominion.</p><p></p><p>Even the Overlords would not casually use the space-time transfer array unless there was an urgent matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, powerful experts from various major domains within the ancient kingdom were constantly entering and exiting the space-time transfer zone, exchanging information with one another.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? About the war between the Azure Flame Domain and the Purple Dream Domain?"</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Flame Domain is a border domain of our Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, and the Purple Dream Domain is also a border domain of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom. Conflicts occurring there are quite common, so a war breaking out is not surprising."</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not the war itself, but the fact that the Spiritual Monarch King intervened in this battle."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Monarch King? The youngest core imperial clan member of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Spiritual Monarch King displayed the power of a limit core imperial clan member the moment he acted."</p><p></p><p>"A limit core imperial clan member? Then it's over for the Azure Flame Domain."</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Flame Domain hasn't fallen. A figure known as 'Silver River' stepped in and slew the Spiritual Monarch King."</p><p></p><p>The Overlords from various major domains were conversing with each other. The Overlords were all connected, so any important news and information would spread among them first.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Spiritual Monarch King, who had reached the limit, was slain, was certainly worthy of the Overlords' and even the Grand Supremes' attention. "Apparently, this Silver River Grand Supreme is an out-traveling limit core imperial clan member, seeking further advancement. Now, he has easily slain the Spiritual Monarch King, likely making significant progress in that regard."</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable, the Spiritual Monarch King had just reached the limit, yet he was so easily slain? Even Celestial Supremes would find that difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Which limit core imperial clan member of our Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom is this Silver River Grand Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>The Overlords were now deeply interested, as this news concerned the top echelons of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom. They definitely wanted to learn more.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the space-time transfer zone, dozens of figures had been waiting for some time.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was a young woman in azure robes, who glanced at the ongoing conversation among the powerful experts outside without any change in her expression.</p><p></p><p>A tall man behind her lowered his voice and said, "His Majesty has summoned us to receive the Silver River Grand Supreme and escort him to the newly built royal manor. Doesn't this Silver River Grand Supreme have a royal manor before?"</p><p></p><p>Even for a core imperial clan member traveling abroad, they would still have a royal manor in the capital before their departure.</p><p></p><p>Any enfeoffed king, be it an imperial clan member or a Celestial Supreme, would have a royal manor in the capital. The royal manor would be prepared even before the enfeoffment edict was issued.</p><p></p><p>But this Silver River Grand Supreme needed them to escort him to a newly built royal manor, meaning he did not have one previously.</p><p></p><p>This was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Silver River Grand Supreme was not enfeoffed as a king before his travels?</p><p></p><p>However, any core imperial clan member, whether they have reached the limit or not, would be enfeoffed as a king.</p><p></p><p>News and information about the Silver River Grand Supreme had been circulating widely in the capital, with the general consensus being that he was a limit core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>Only a limit core imperial clan member could slay the Spiritual Monarch King at the Grand Supreme realm. Even those Celestial Supremes would likely not be able to do so when they were at the Grand Supreme realm. Celestial Supremes could suppress limit core imperial clan members through the sheer difference in realm, but if they were at the same level, the core imperial clan members would most likely prevail.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason every core imperial clan member yearned to ascend to the Celestial Supreme realm.</p><p></p><p>"However, His Majesty seems to hold this Silver River Grand Supreme in high regard, granting him a royal manor right next to our ancient kingdom's Yang Vein."</p><p></p><p>"I remember many Celestial Supremes have wanted that royal manor, but His Majesty has rejected them all. Now, he has bestowed it upon this Silver River Grand Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>The third figure spoke with a slightly wistful tone.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Vein of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was a sacred cultivation ground. The closer one was to the Yang Vein, the greater the benefits, which was why the Emperor's own residence was built upon the Yang Vein.</p><p></p><p>The newly built royal manor granted to the Silver River Grand Supreme was right next to the Yang Vein, and its benefits to cultivation would not be much inferior to the Emperor's own residence.</p><p></p><p>Most enfeoffed royal manors were only at the periphery of the Yang Vein's influence.</p><p></p><p>That royal manor right next to the Yang Vein had been coveted by many enfeoffed kings, especially the Celestial Supremes.</p><p></p><p>But successive Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom Emperors had never granted it, preferring to leave it vacant, as once bestowed, it would be difficult for the kingdom to reclaim.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, this is His Majesty's decision, not something for you to discuss." The young woman in azure robes swept her gaze across the conversing figures, speaking in a detached tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The figures immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a massive space-time transfer array in the distance began to emit slight spatial fluctuations, and a spatial passageway connected to a distant place opened up.</p><p></p><p>"They're here."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures waiting perked up immediately. They had been ordered to wait here specifically for this moment, to welcome the Silver River Grand Supreme.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The spatial passageway formed, and several figures emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>Leading them were a red-bearded old man and a young man.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Treasure King and... the Silver River Grand Supreme?"</p><p></p><p>The waiting figures immediately recognized the Crimson Treasure King, and the young man standing beside him must be the Silver River Grand Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of the Silver River Grand Supreme is unlike anything I've felt before. Could he be from the most ancient times of the core imperial clan?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures had various thoughts, and they followed the young woman in azure robes to greet the newcomers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Crimson Treasure King arrived through the space-time transfer passageway from the distant Azure Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the capital of the Scorching Sun Nation.</p><p></p><p>"It would take ten breaths to cross this distance, even if one's temporal and spatial comprehension had reached the peak of the Ninth Realm, it would still be impossible," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had left a clone in the Blue Burning City, which could roughly sense the distance between it and the main body.</p><p></p><p>"And this is the capital of the Scorching Sun Nation." Lin Yuan observed his surroundings, vaguely sensing an inexplicable pressure.</p><p></p><p>The entire capital of the Scorching Sun Nation seemed like an unprecedented secret treasure, just a slight activation could suppress ordinary Celestial Monarch-level experts.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A mysterious fluctuation swept by, extremely subtle.</p><p></p><p>"Don't overthink it, this is the sensing formation of the capital, preventing other ancient nations' experts from infiltrating," Crimson Treasure King transmitted the explanation beside him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The capital was the most prosperous and core area of the ancient Scorching Sun Nation, as well as the most important place. Any powerful expert entering the capital had to go through various investigations.</p><p></p><p>"So I have passed?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." Crimson Treasure King smiled.</p><p></p><p>The abundant Scorching Sun aura within Lin Yuan's body had ruled out the possibility of other ancient nations' experts.</p><p></p><p>The sensing formation of the Scorching Sun capital was just a "formality", not only for Lin Yuan, but Crimson Treasure King was also within its sensing range.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the spatial transmission channel, Lin Yuan saw dozens of figures approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Galaxy Supreme." The leading azure-robed woman respectfully saluted, and the dozens of figures behind her also shouted.</p><p></p><p>They did not know Lin Yuan's true identity or which core royal clan he belonged to, so they could only address him as the "Galaxy Supreme" based on their current knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Crimson Treasure King's face showed a smile as he said to Lin Yuan, "These people were sent by the Emperor to welcome you."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor?" Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The "Emperor" here naturally referred to the Emperor of the ancient Scorching Sun Nation, who was also the strongest existence in the entire ancient Scorching Sun Nation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Emperor's strength was aided by external forces.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor attaches great importance to you." Crimson Treasure King said, "Come, I'll take you to your manor."</p><p></p><p>After Crimson Treasure King's words, the azure-robed woman and the others stepped forward, leading Lin Yuan and Crimson Treasure King onto a battleship.</p><p></p><p>Within the Scorching Sun capital, spatial traversal was prohibited, not even Celestial Monarchs were an exception.</p><p></p><p>To go to a certain place, one had to either fly there honestly, or use a battleship or other flying treasures.</p><p></p><p>The latter required an application to the ancient nation, and driving a battleship within the capital was basically a symbol of one's identity.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The battleship soared into the sky, heading towards the area outside the spatial transmission zone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many powerful experts who were entering and exiting the spatial transmission zone also noticed the battleship emerging from the depths of the spatial transmission area.</p><p></p><p>"That battleship... Is it the Imperial Clan's battleship?"</p><p></p><p>"The Nine-Striped Imperial Clan Battleship? Except for the Emperor himself giving the order, no one else can mobilize this battleship."</p><p></p><p>"Just who is the existence that requires the Nine-Striped Imperial Clan Battleship to welcome them?"</p><p></p><p>One powerful expert after another looked up at the departing battleship, greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>The last time the Emperor had mobilized the Nine-Striped Imperial Clan Battleship to welcome someone, it was when the Scorching Sun Nation's Celestial Monarch commander had achieved a great victory in the large-scale war against the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation and returned to the capital.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, along with the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation and the Great Spirit Ancient Nation, was one of the six hegemon ancient nations of this world.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In the past tens of thousands of years, the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation had not engaged in extremely intense wars with the other five ancient nations, mostly just local skirmishes. Even if they achieved a great victory and returned to the capital to receive rewards, they would not mobilize the Nine-Striped Imperial Clan Battleship to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>On the battleship, Lin Yuan overlooked the capital below.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, it's been a long time since I've ridden this battleship." Crimson Treasure King was in a good mood as he looked at Lin Yuan and said, "I'm just piggybacking on your face, Brother Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the battleship stopped in front of a majestic manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Crimson Treasure King got off, and the dozens of azure-robed figures also followed.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Supreme, this is your manor." The azure-robed woman took out a token and respectfully handed it to Lin Yuan, "This is the manor's token. After refining it, you can control the entire manor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the token and refined it with a single breath.</p><p></p><p>Through this token, Lin Yuan could sense every detail of the manor, and could also control everything within the manor, including the grand formations enveloping the manor.</p><p></p><p>The manor's grand formations were derived from the capital's grand formation, and could borrow a bit of the capital's might.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Galaxy, why don't you give this manor a name?" Crimson Treasure King said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"A name?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and said, "Let's call it the Galaxy Manor."</p><p></p><p>Since his Supreme title was "Galaxy", naming the manor "Galaxy Manor" was the most natural and convenient choice.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan spoke, he controlled the manor token and engraved the words "Galaxy Manor" on the top of the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Manor?" The dozens of figures behind them murmured. Normally, a manor's name would correspond to the title of the king it was granted to.</p><p></p><p>But Galaxy?</p><p></p><p>They originally thought "Galaxy" was just an alias, but now that Lin Yuan was using it as the manor's name, it was obvious he had taken "Galaxy" as his official title.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Crimson Treasure King nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation, the royal clan's kings were usually named with the character "Crimson", such as Crimson Treasure King, Crimson Pine King, Crimson Jade King.</p><p></p><p>But it was not absolute.</p><p></p><p>It mainly depended on the preference of the king being granted the manor.</p><p></p><p>"This manor is now your Galaxy Manor. I wonder if I can go in and take a look?" Crimson Treasure King smiled and said, "It's right next to the capital's yang vein, an unparalleled cultivation holy land, but the Emperor has never wanted to grant it out."</p><p></p><p>"Please come in." Lin Yuan immediately controlled the token to open the manor's main entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Such a rich Scorching Sun origin." After entering the manor, Lin Yuan immediately felt the scorching hot aura permeating the heavens and earth. Under this aura's envelopment, Lin Yuan felt extremely comfortable, as if soaking in a hot spring, and his Scorching Sun bloodline also circulated more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Crimson Treasure King looked at Lin Yuan and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although his own manor did not have such a fiery origin source permeating it, it was not bad either. This was Lin Yuan's first time experiencing such a cultivation environment.</p><p></p><p>"Very good," Lin Yuan said solemnly after carefully feeling it.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, Lin Yuan's enlightenment efficiency would absolutely be terrifying. Especially in the aspects of the sun and Scorching Sun, it might be a day-and-night improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, that's great then." Crimson Treasure King had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, the Emperor will meet you. For now, just get used to it." Crimson Treasure King said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just then - </p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King seemed to have received some news, and he immediately looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Brother Galaxy, the final merit of the battle between the Blue Burning Domain and the Purple Dream Domain has been decided."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

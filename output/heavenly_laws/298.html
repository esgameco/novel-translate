            <p>Chapter 298: Who is Calling Me? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan and Xi Lan arrived at the second transit planet.</p><p></p><p>"This spatial passage..." Lin Yuan looked back in surprise and said, "Establishing such a stable spatial passage must require a significant cost, right?"</p><p></p><p>Spatial passages are easy to open up. Ordinary peak Eighth Order beings have the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan broke through to the Sixth Order, his senior brother appeared, intending to bring Lin Yuan back to the Red Kun main star. The crystal magic cube he crushed immediately opened up a spatial passage leading to the Red Kun main star.</p><p></p><p>The real difficulty with spatial passages lies in stability and maintenance.</p><p></p><p>Especially the latter. The crystal magic cube created by the Red Kun Star Lord consumed a lot of energy, yet even so, the spatial passage it finally opened only lasted for two minutes.</p><p></p><p>The main universe itself has recovery capabilities. Unless it's a permanent spatial rift caused by an ultimate powerhouse, any other spatial fluctuations will slowly return to their original state.</p><p></p><p>Thereforeâ€”</p><p></p><p>To maintain a stable spatial passage for a long time, energy support needs to be provided at all times.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why spatial passages are only common in the central star domain. To widely maintain them within the human civilization's territory would require too great a cost.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in emergencies, such as if a war breaks out and alien races have already invaded the human civilization's territory, human civilization has the means to instantly establish stable spatial passages throughout its entire domain.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, because no fees are charged, the cost of maintaining the spatial passages is borne by human civilization," Xi Lan said.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the central star domain, other star districts or alliances may have private spatial passages. If one doesn't want to travel the long way, they can pay a high price in civilization coins to use those spatial passages.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! </p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>After passing through dozens of transit planets, Lin Yuan and Xi Lan finally arrived at the Mother Planet.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Mother Planet?" Lin Yuan carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Mother Planet is very small, not even comparable in size to an ordinary medium-sized living planet. However, as the birthplace of human civilization, it holds a special status and is now in some sense the political center.</p><p></p><p>Many special treasures and supreme treasures, such as the Twelve Star Universe Rare Treasure "Eternal Spring", are all kept on the Mother Planet.</p><p></p><p>Due to the small size of the Mother Planet, entering it requires layers of strict screening.</p><p></p><p>On the Mother Planet, the people you casually brush shoulders with might all be Ninth Order or Tenth Order evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"The location of the Eternal Spring is on the second continent 'Qingshan Summit'. I don't have the clearance to go any further, Galaxy Star Lord, you can go there yourself," Xi Lan said after accompanying Lin Yuan for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Xi Lan had already informed him of the detailed map of the Mother Planet as well as some taboos. As a Ninth Order evolved being, comprehending and absorbing it was just a matter of moments.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's familiarity with the Mother Planet was no less than that of the Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Before parting, Xi Lan suddenly remembered something and asked, "Galaxy Star Lord, the 'Xuanhuang' secret realm is about to open, are you interested in exploring it?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang secret realm?" This wasn't the first time Lin Yuan had heard of the "Xuanhuang" secret realm. Previously, his teacher, the Red Kun Star Lord, had also mentioned this matter to him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the "Xuanhuang" evolution path that Lin Yuan was cultivating had a great connection with the "Xuanhuang" secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Around when will it open?" Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"In about half a year," Xi Lan replied. </p><p></p><p>"At that time, many of our human evolved beings will go in to explore, and evolved beings from other alien races will enter as well," Xi Lan said.</p><p></p><p>The "Xuanhuang" secret realm is not a universe secret realm controlled by humans.</p><p></p><p>Powerhouses from other alien races can also enter.</p><p></p><p>As a result... the greatest danger in entering and exploring is not the secret realm itself, but comes from the other alien races.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization has been fighting those alien races for countless years, and they have long since developed deep hatred for each other. If they encounter each other in the secret realm, they will most likely attack unless there are other greater threats.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." </p><p></p><p>"I'll see when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed a bit interested in the "Xuanhuang" secret realm. The "Xuanhuang" evolution path he was cultivating originated from there.</p><p></p><p>It was almost no inferior to the immortal dao cultivation system of the spirit realm. And in the words of the main world, the immortal dao cultivation system was an ultimate evolution path, an ultimate evolution path with a supreme existence.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived at "Qingshan" on the Mother Planet via the fixed passage.</p><p></p><p>"Qingshan Summit"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan climbed along the mountain path.</p><p></p><p>"This Qingshan, is it also a treasure?" Lin Yuan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Qingshan Summit.</p><p></p><p>After passing through layers of identity verification, Lin Yuan finally arrived before the "Eternal Spring".</p><p></p><p>This Twelve Star Universe Rare Treasure looked like a white pool over ten meters in size.</p><p></p><p>Milky white spring water continuously gushed out from the center of the pool.</p><p></p><p>Just by looking at it, Lin Yuan felt a pure and gentle power coming at him.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Spring contains the aura of eternity. All life that has bathed in the spring water can extend their lifespan by at least 500,000 years," information about the "Eternal Spring" flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Extending lifespan by 500,000 years... It should be known that below the ultimate powerhouses, the lifespans of all evolved beings are limited. Even those who have mastered the rules of time and can arbitrarily change the flow of time on their body, experiencing only one day while 10,000 years pass outside...</p><p></p><p>But their lifespan will eventually be exhausted one day.</p><p></p><p>500,000 years, not to mention Eleventh Order evolved beings, for Ninth and Tenth Order evolved beings, it might allow them to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to extending lifespan, the Eternal Spring also has many wonderful effects on the physical body, able to enhance the potential of the flesh and so on.</p><p></p><p>This is the exclusive foundation of human civilization. The peak lifespan of human Ninth Order and above evolved beings is 500,000 years longer than that of Ninth Order and above powerhouses of other races.</p><p></p><p>It's not noticeable in the short term, but the effect becomes very obvious when the timeline is extended.</p><p></p><p>However, the cost of activating the Eternal Spring is very high. For humans of their own civilization, there are two ways to take a dip in the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>One is to enter the Ninth Order.</p><p></p><p>The other is to spend 5 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>There are no exceptions beyond that.</p><p></p><p>For this, that ultimate powerhouse was willing to offer a Eleven Star top-grade universe rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Eleven Star top-grade, that's on the same level as the World Tree, each one is priceless and can be passed down as the foundation of a race.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it was still rejected by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they look down on Eleven Star top-grade universe rare treasures, but they are unwilling to "aid the enemy".</p><p></p><p>That alien race ultimate powerhouse's valued junior had immense potential and the hope of becoming an ultimate powerhouse. If...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An additional 500,000 years of lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of taking that step would only be greater.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of an 11-star top-grade cosmic treasure, allowing an alien race to potentially gain an extremely powerful individual, human civilization is not that foolish.</p><p></p><p>Even if this alien race has not directly conflicted with human civilization, it is absolutely not allowed.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization is wary of alien races that have submitted to and joined the human civilization alliance, let alone others.</p><p></p><p>Those who are not of our race, their hearts must be different.</p><p></p><p>"Begin, begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away his 8th-stage armor and walked naked into the pool.</p><p></p><p>The moment he soaked in the milky white spring water, Lin Yuan felt a cool power penetrate his skin and enter his body, rapidly spreading through his limbs and bones.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the changes in his body and discovered that every cell was madly devouring the spring water. In just a short while, he found that his physical potential began to increase.</p><p></p><p>What is physical potential?</p><p></p><p>Regardless of 8th-stage or 9th-stage evolutionaries, the physical body has an upper limit and will not endlessly grow stronger. As it approaches the limit, the rate of improvement will slow down and stagnate. </p><p></p><p>This is physical potential.</p><p></p><p>An increase in potential means that physical strength can continue to improve, equivalent to breaking free of shackles, allowing strength to further advance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical strength was already far superior to other normal humans. With the boost from the mysterious gourd liquid, it was over a dozen times greater than before.</p><p></p><p>With such a high upper limit, further improvement would only be more difficult, yet under the soaking of the Eternal Spring water, it surprisingly began to slowly increase again.</p><p></p><p>"And lifespan too."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. He could sense his lifespan beginning to extend.</p><p></p><p>Ten years.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years. </p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Each evolutionary's gain in lifespan after soaking in the Eternal Spring varies, depending on their absorption and adaptation to the spring water. However, the minimum increase is still 500,000 years.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a 12-star cosmic treasure."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. No wonder with a treasure that can increase the foundation and lifespan of every evolutionary, human civilization has prospered to this extent in just over 2 million years.</p><p></p><p>Although the World Tree has many wondrous uses, with its World Fruit able to help evolutionaries open up their inner worlds ahead of time, in terms of value, it is far inferior to the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>After all, the World Tree itself can only be used by one evolutionary, and the World Fruit merely helps 6th and 7th stage evolutionaries easily open their inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>But the Eternal Spring provides immense help to 9th and 10th stage evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder, between this Eternal Spring and my gourd, which one is more valuable?"</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan soaked in the Eternal Spring, this thought suddenly came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>Ever since obtaining the mysterious gourd, he had never figured out its background. Even searching through the data banks of human civilization, he could not find any similar information.</p><p></p><p>"Far from it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The "far from it" here meant that the Eternal Spring was far inferior to the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Spring can enhance one's physical foundation and extend lifespan by 500,000 years.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the heaven-defying effects of the mysterious gourd, these are nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Spring can only improve physical foundation, but the mysterious gourd can directly increase the physical upper limit. Theoretically, after absorbing the seven types of liquids, the physical multiplier will reach 23.31 times.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this multiplier is a base multiplier, not just adding a fixed amount of strength.</p><p></p><p>As for lifespan extension, it indeed has great use, but compared to the inner world foundation size directly expanding by 23.31 times, it is utterly outclassed.</p><p></p><p>The importance of inner world size for 8th-stage powerhouses goes without saying. Expanding it by a hundred miles could potentially increase strength by a level, let alone multiplying it by 23.31 times.</p><p></p><p>As for the 9th and 10th stages, although they begin to expand the depth of the inner world - opening up layers of space realms, the original size of the inner world is still the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"I must protect my gourd well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>If the Eternal Spring is a 12-star cosmic treasure, then what level is the mysterious gourd that completely surpasses it? 13-star?</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a year went by.</p><p></p><p>For any newly advanced 9th-stage evolutionary, the time limit for soaking in the Eternal Spring is half a year.</p><p></p><p>Any longer, and the effects of the spring water will rapidly diminish, becoming meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"That should be about enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up and voluntarily walked out of the white pool.</p><p></p><p>"My physical potential has probably increased by 80%, as for lifespan? 700,000 years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Although lifespan was not very meaningful to him, with his heaven-defying comprehension, Lin Yuan would always be able to break through at the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>But lifespan is something no one would complain about having more of.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the Eternal Spring, Lin Yuan was arranged to stay in a room.</p><p></p><p>Newly advanced 9th-stage evolutionaries, besides being able to soak in the Eternal Spring once, can also stay for a night at the peak of the green mountain beside the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, Lin Yuan unusually did not cultivate or comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he quietly sat there, feeling the mysterious aura flowing on the Mother Planet.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious aura was vast and profound. Even Lin Yuan, who could now toy with stars, felt like he had returned to his mother's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that our human civilization's clan-protecting weapon is on the Mother Planet. This is also the reason why the Mother Planet and the entire Central Star Domain have never been invaded by alien races for so many years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Relying on that clan-protecting weapon, even if Supremes joined forces to attack, within the scope of the Central Star Domain, they would not gain any advantage.</p><p></p><p>They could only retreat in defeat.</p><p></p><p>This clan-protecting weapon was the absolute foundation of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Supremes could come and go as they pleased, how could they be called the paramount race?</p><p></p><p>"So comfortable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, casually feeling the bits and pieces of the Mother Planet.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at a certain moment, from the depths of the distant starry sky, an indistinct yet undeniable call crossed countless light-years, connecting with Lin Yuan in some mysterious way.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Yuan could perceive this call. Even the Mother Planet, the old nest of human civilization, did not capture it.</p><p></p><p>The clan-protecting weapon that monitored all changes on the Mother Planet at all times also did not sense the slightest bit of it.</p><p></p><p>The powerful evolutionaries on the Mother Planet - 9th-stage, 10th-stage, 11th-stage - all failed to detect anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>Even the perception of the Supremes constantly enveloping the Mother Planet remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed the same as always.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Yuan, only he felt that indistinct yet incredibly firm call.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes and looked towards the depths of the starry sky, the source of the call.</p><p></p><p>"Who is calling me?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook.

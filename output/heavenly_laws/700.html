            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen supreme great saints heard these four words, and their hearts couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>The unrivaled great saint of the present era, the Milky Way Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Great Saint should belong to the great saints who suddenly emerged. Before unleashing the power of an unrivaled great saint, he had rarely taken action.</p><p></p><p>But the Milky Way Great Saint had become a supreme unrivaled great saint who could dominate the chaotic void in just one battle.</p><p></p><p>That battle made countless supreme great saints not even dare to contend with the Milky Way Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Milky Way Chaotic Continent, two supreme great saints joined forces and descended.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the Milky Way Great Saint, they couldn't even resist, and were directly dissolved in an instant. Who could withstand such a technique? And with the end of that crushing battle, more and more information was spreading.</p><p></p><p>For example, the participants at the time were not just two supreme great saints, but also had the 'Rahu Great Saint's' imprint.</p><p></p><p>Rahu Great Saint was a long-renowned supreme great saint, rumored to have already cultivated a certain thirteenth-tier inheritance.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the strength of a conventional unrivaled great saint.</p><p></p><p>But in front of the Milky Way Great Saint, he still melted like ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>This was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>There was also another rumor.</p><p></p><p>Rahu Great Saint had originally planned to sweep through the chaotic void and prove his 'unrivaled' title.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because of Lin Yuan's intervention that he completely extinguished the idea of proving his 'unrivaled' title and directly went to assault the thirteenth tier.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Saint, could it be that Senior Wanfa has actually invited the Milky Way Great Saint?" </p><p></p><p>An supreme great saint couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Since that battle, countless powerful figures had visited the Milky Way Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic great saints? Supreme great saints? Even special existences like Senior Wanfa's Eye.</p><p></p><p>However, the Milky Way Great Saint seemed very unwilling to interact with special existences and had not met any of the visiting special existences.</p><p></p><p>With the Milky Way Great Saint's strength, if he didn't want to see them, those special existences had no way to do anything, and could only obediently leave.</p><p></p><p>These special existences could not directly take action, as this was the rule set by the laws of time and life. Therefore, they were very humble in the face of the supreme great saints who could sweep through the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these special existences could see further and deeper than the supreme great saints, and they speculated that Lin Yuan was not only an unrivaled great saint, but also the strongest unrivaled great saint among all those born in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, as long as the special existences were not insane, they naturally dared not provoke him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wanfa must have his own methods." </p><p></p><p>Fengzhu Great Saint also didn't know how Senior Wanfa's Eye had invited the Milky Way Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>But since Senior Wanfa's Eye told him so, it must be true that he had invited the Milky Way Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"However," </p><p></p><p>Fengzhu Great Saint thought for a moment and continued, "Senior Wanfa said that the Milky Way Great Saint has only come with one incarnation."</p><p></p><p>One incarnation? The many supreme great saints were slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Even though they admired the Milky Way Great Saint's strength, but just a single incarnation? An unrivaled great saint was ultimately at the twelfth tier, and the incarnation he casually condensed, no matter how strong, was probably not even as strong as a supreme great saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Milky Way Great Saint was extremely powerful, sending just one incarnation to retrieve that Fayuan Fruit within three days, wasn't that a bit presumptuous?</p><p></p><p>"Since the Milky Way Great Saint is doing this, he must be confident in it." </p><p></p><p>Fengzhu Great Saint looked at the supreme great saints and said.</p><p></p><p>When he first heard this news, he also felt incredulous.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, with the Milky Way Great Saint's elevated perspective and vision, he must have his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>It was something that these supreme great saints could not fathom.</p><p></p><p>Since the Milky Way Great Saint had agreed to act on Senior Wanfa's Eye's request, how could he casually deal with it? If he was unwilling, he could have just refused directly.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>The many supreme great saints suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, they also thought so.</p><p></p><p>"I speculate that the reason the Milky Way Great Saint has only sent out one incarnation is to check the situation outside the dimensional rift, confirm that there is no threat, and then have his true self descend to directly sweep and retrieve the Fayuan Fruit."</p><p></p><p>Fengzhu Great Saint expressed his speculation.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional rift was fraught with danger, and even an unrivaled great saint could not guarantee a safe return.</p><p></p><p>The cautious Milky Way Great Saint first sent an incarnation to the dimensional gap to confirm that there was no problem, and then had his true self descend to act, this was the safest approach.</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>the other supreme great saints nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>Explained this way, it made perfect sense.</p><p></p><p>"With the Milky Way Great Saint's involvement, the chance of retrieving the Fayuan Fruit within three days is very high."</p><p></p><p>The supreme great saints had smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They were invited by Senior Wanfa's Eye, and although it was to repay a favor, if they could successfully retrieve the Fayuan Fruit, Senior Wanfa's Eye would definitely offer them more rewards.</p><p></p><p>At the supreme great saint level, most of the rare treasures in the chaotic void were no longer of much use to them.</p><p></p><p>But the precious rewards offered by Senior Wanfa's Eye would surely satisfy these supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>"This time, we can also witness the techniques of the Milky Way Great Saint's true self."</p><p></p><p>Some supreme great saints were full of anticipation. Among the unrivaled great saints born in the chaotic void, the Milky Way Great Saint was undoubtedly the most mysterious, having rarely taken action.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>at this moment,</p><p></p><p>the power of space-time converged, forming a figure that appeared not far from the more than ten supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Milky Way Great Saint arrived?"</p><p></p><p>The many supreme great saints were spiritually exhilarated, and they all looked towards that figure.</p><p></p><p>The figure was a young man, with his hands clasped behind his back, and a faint Taiji imprint rotating on his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Is this just an incarnation of the Milky Way Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Some supreme great saints were shocked. Even though this was just an incarnation, it gave them a great sense of oppression, a pressure that came from the mastery of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Sage.</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage was inwardly astonished, feeling that he had still underestimated the power of the Galactic Sage.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, he felt that even the avatar of the Galactic Sage in front of him might be difficult for him to defeat.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, the avatar of the Galactic Sage was comparable to the peerless great sages? This was probably unprecedented in the history of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the dimensional rift?" Lin Yuan stepped out, appearing before more than a dozen peerless great sages, and casually said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"The law source fruit that Senior Wanfa wants is on the small continent outside the rift."</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage's mind tensed up, and he immediately gave a general introduction to the situation.</p><p></p><p>Especially regarding the dimensional beings born on the small continent outside the rift, he emphasized that these dimensional beings were innately powerful, instinctively influencing space-time, and with the home field advantage, even peerless great sages would find it difficult to confront a large group of dimensional beings head-on.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, our main combat bodies are all inside, and we can rendezvous at that time."</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage immediately spoke.</p><p></p><p>The main combat bodies of more than a dozen peerless great sages were now on that small continent.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He stepped out again.</p><p></p><p>Entering that dimensional rift.</p><p></p><p>Another location.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Myriad Laws was also keeping a distant watch on the dimensional rift.</p><p></p><p>"Has the avatar of the Galactic Sage arrived? The speed is so fast, is it nearby?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Myriad Laws looked at Lin Yuan's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that even the avatar of the Galactic Sage is now beyond my ability to discern the depth."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Myriad Laws shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, he could no longer see through Lin Yuan's true body.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could not even see through the avatar.</p><p></p><p>Within the vision of the Eye of the Myriad Laws, even just Lin Yuan's avatar was like a black hole, influencing the surrounding space-time laws.</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow has actually grown to this extent."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Myriad Laws was also greatly astonished. When he first met Lin Yuan, the latter was not even at the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Most areas of the dimensional rift were dim and gloomy.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's avatar entered the dimensional rift, it soon saw the small continent that nurtured the law source fruit.</p><p></p><p>The continent was only the size of a void domain, but due to being separated from the chaotic void environment, the dimensional rift lacked any great law rules, as well as some inexplicable suppression, even peerless great sages would find it difficult to instantly cross the continent and enter the depths to take the law source fruit.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage."</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage."</p><p></p><p>The main combat bodies of the peerless great sages immediately approached.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, the law source fruit is right there."</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage said, and Lin Yuan looked in the direction he pointed, seeing a swaying fruit tree in the depths of the small continent.</p><p></p><p>The fruit tree was dark in color, with the laws faintly fluctuating and swaying, and a fruit the size of a fist hanging from the branches.</p><p></p><p>"The law source fruit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>The law source fruit, by absorbing the laws and principles of different dimensional spaces, has great use for the existence of the Eye of the Myriad Laws, whose foundation is the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The so-called laws and principles are the aura of the evolutionary paths of different dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, the closer we get to the law source fruit, the more numerous the dimensional native beings will be. We are only at the periphery for now," Feng Zhu the Sage introduced.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also observed the dimensional native beings on the small continent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had encountered these dimensional beings in the previous few passages through the boundless void, but those dimensional beings were extremely weak, having been netted into the void secret realms, and were thus called void creatures.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After just a brief observation, Lin Yuan had a general understanding of the strength of these dimensional beings.</p><p></p><p>They were indeed very strong.</p><p></p><p>Even ordinary invincible great sages would find it difficult to forcibly take the law source fruit from among so many dimensional beings within three days.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, what should we do now?" Feng Zhu the Sage said.</p><p></p><p>The other more than a dozen peerless great sages obediently followed orders.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this group of peerless great sages had Feng Zhu the Sage as their leader.</p><p></p><p>But since the Galactic Sage had arrived, naturally everything would be up to the Galactic Sage.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to do anything."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the many peerless great sages and casually said, "I'll just take the law source fruit myself."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage was inwardly shocked, but considering the Galactic Sage's strength, he still chose to believe.</p><p></p><p>"When will the true body of the Galactic Sage arrive?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the Sage asked.</p><p></p><p>The other peerless great sages were also mentally excited.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to see the true body of the Galactic Sage descend and subdue the group of dimensional native beings, and then take the law source fruit.</p><p></p><p>"True body?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and said, "That's not necessary."</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the incredulous gaze of more than a dozen peerless great sages.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! His palm was vast, like the sky tilting, reaching towards the deepest part of the small continent.</p><p></p><p>During this, one dimensional native being after another rose up, howling towards the overshadowing palm, but ultimately vanished silently.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the small tree bearing the law source fruit, along with the large patch of land it was rooted in, was grabbed by that huge palm and brought before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"That's it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the law source fruit tree in his hand and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the more than a dozen peerless great sages had blank minds. They looked at Lin Yuan, who was smiling and examining the law source fruit tree in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, a thought arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Is this an avatar?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

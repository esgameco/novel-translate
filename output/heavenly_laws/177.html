        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This compass?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, any supernatural power would be reduced in dimension, leaving only the purest physical form.</p><p></p><p>But this bronze compass gave Lin Yuan a sense of mysterious aura. </p><p></p><p>This vague feeling that transcended the suppression of the two-dimensional world made Lin Yuan's heart slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>After all, up until now, no being or treasure of any level could resist the dimensional suppression.</p><p></p><p>Except forâ€”</p><p></p><p>The ultimate existence. </p><p></p><p>"How do I use it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's sharp senses detected the remnants of fresh blood on the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"Is it used with fresh blood?" Lin Yuan guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll study it slowly after returning."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the bronze compass and thoroughly checked the bodies of the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan again to ensure nothing was missed, before leaving with their vital organ parts.</p><p></p><p>To claim the bounty on the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan, he had to prove he had killed them.</p><p></p><p>And the proof here was generally their vital organ parts.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan gained a great deal from the Eighteen Thieves, he did not forget the spirit crystal bounty on them.</p><p></p><p>This was free money, so naturally he could not waste it.</p><p></p><p>Dongyuan City.</p><p></p><p>Bloody Rain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder was dozing off. As a Shaman King-level expert from the capital of the Bloody Rain Ancient Kingdom, he had taken the role of tavern master at the Bloody Rain Tavern in Dongyuan City to avoid being recruited by various forces.</p><p></p><p>Although Dongyuan City was a large city, it was far from the capital and the gathering place of powers.</p><p></p><p>Here he had fewer troubles, so the hunchbacked elder had decided to spend his retirement here.</p><p></p><p>He was already very old with declining vitality, so he was not suited to compete with those Shaman Kings still in their prime.</p><p></p><p>"Due to the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan roaming the surrounding areas, a large number of experts from the ancient kingdom have been quietly gathering towards here."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder shook his head slightly, feeling quite helpless inside.</p><p></p><p>Just the bounty on the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan amounted to six million spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Add to that their original family assets and years of accumulation,</p><p></p><p>Even peak Shaman King experts were extremely tempted.</p><p></p><p>However, peak Shaman Kings were few in number. Most who came to hunt the Eighteen Thieves were teams of various experts.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"That young man has come again?"</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder's gaze shifted as he saw Lin Yuan enter the tavern once more.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder had a deep impression of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>First, Lin Yuan dared to take the bounty mission on the Eighteen Thieves alone.</p><p></p><p>Second, the hunchbacked elder did not recognize Lin Yuan as any expert he knew.</p><p></p><p>Third, the time since Lin Yuan had left was really too short, not even a day.</p><p></p><p>In a private room of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat across from the hunchbacked elder.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? Are you going to give up on the bounty mission?" The hunchbacked elder spoke without any mocking tone.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Thieves were powerful with many hidden tricks. Even at his peak, he was not confident he could take them down, let alone the seemingly very young Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder guessed that Lin Yuan must be a young scion from some major family who came out to gain experience.</p><p></p><p>On a whim, he wanted to take the bounty on the Eighteen Thieves, but after a day of rushing around, he found he could not even track them down.</p><p></p><p>So he returned to the tavern to give up the mission.</p><p></p><p>"No, I came here to claim the bounty," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Claim the bounty?" The hunchbacked elder stared at Lin Yuan, not reacting for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Claim the bounty on the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan?</p><p></p><p>"These are their skulls." Lin Yuan opened his bundle, and eighteen skulls rolled out.</p><p></p><p>To prove the killing of the Eighteen Thieves, ordinary organ parts would not do.</p><p></p><p>It had to be fatal organs like the skulls to be accepted by the Bloody Rain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Before taking the bounty, Lin Yuan had naturally clarified everything, so there would be no issues now.</p><p></p><p>As for confirming these skulls belonged to the Eighteen Thieves, the Bloody Rain Tavern naturally had special methods.</p><p></p><p>"Skulls?" The hunchbacked elder's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not confirm at this moment whether these eighteen skulls belonged to the Eighteen Thieves,</p><p></p><p>With his discerning eyes, he could immediately tell these eighteen skulls came from experts approaching the Shaman King level.</p><p></p><p>Shaman Kings, Shaman Kings, and even Shaman Emperors had vastly different levels of physical refinement, which affected the hardness and quality of their bones.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with some experience in this area could tell.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment." The hunchbacked elder's tone immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He quickly called his subordinates to take the eighteen skulls out.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder hurried back into the room, speaking with slight respect, "Sir, the skulls have been confirmed to belong to the Eighteen Thieves of Yunshan."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Rain Tavern indeed had a decent reputation. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose to take the bounty at the Blood Rain Tavern precisely because of their 'leniency'.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could post or accept bounty missions at the Blood Rain Tavern without revealing their identity.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood Rain Tavern originated from the ancient Blood Rain nation, over the long years, it had actually become independent, catering to all cultivators at the Wizard level or above from the twelve ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"This is Blood Rain Tea, which only members of the Blood Rain royal family can enjoy," said the hunchbacked elder, waving his hand to have someone serve a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The tea water was blood red in color. Lin Yuan didn't plan to drink it initially, but after glancing at it casually, he discovered a mysterious aura flowing within the tea water.</p><p></p><p>"This tea?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows twitched. </p><p></p><p>The mysterious undulation in the tea water gave him a similar feeling to the bronze compass, but far less profound and mysterious than the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't just seen the bronze compass, Lin Yuan estimated he would have only found this tea water rather special, without thinking about breaking free from the dimensional suppression of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it to drink later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected the tea water along with the cup and put it in his bundle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the hunchbacked elder was slightly stunned but didn't dare say more.</p><p></p><p>Being able to easily kill the Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain, even if Lin Yuan wasn't a Wizard Emperor level expert, he was probably not far off. Even in the capital of experts, he could shake an entire region with his might.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Rain Tea comes from the Blood Rain Tea Tree, which is an inherited treasure of the Blood Rain nation that has existed since its founding," the hunchbacked elder immediately began introducing when he thought Lin Yuan was interested in the Blood Rain Tea.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Rain Tea Tree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered this name. If even the 'tea leaves' contained a mysterious aura, then the source, the Blood Rain Tea Tree, was probably similar to the bronze compass - an 'oddity' that could break free from the dimensional suppression of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"This is a bounty of six million wizard crystals," the hunchbacked elder immediately took out a wizard crystal note that could be used across the twelve nations.</p><p></p><p>"We're even," Lin Yuan nodded and accepted the wizard crystal note.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you interested in joining our Blood Rain Tavern? With your strength, you would become a Grade A member once joining, not only enjoying priority in accepting bounties, but also receiving a higher commission from the rewards."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder immediately asked. The Blood Rain Tavern could issue any bounty and take a cut from the reward to maintain operations.</p><p></p><p>For example, the bounty for the Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain was as high as six million wizard crystals, but the Blood Rain Tavern had taken at least two million as their cut.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if Lin Yuan joined the Blood Rain Tavern, he would receive an eight million wizard crystal reward.</p><p></p><p>"I'll consider it," Lin Yuan had no intention of joining the tavern but didn't outright refuse either.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder stood up to see Lin Yuan off.</p><p></p><p>Only after Lin Yuan's figure disappeared did he return and sit down again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gray-haired old man appeared beside the hunchbacked elder.</p><p></p><p>"Tavern Master," the gray-haired man exclaimed in surprise, "The bounty for the Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain has been claimed?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the hunchbacked elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed them?"</p><p></p><p>The gray-haired man was curious. The Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain were cautious and cunning. In the past, even Wizard Emperor experts had tried to take action, but the thieves would escape before the experts arrived.</p><p></p><p>To the outside world, the Eighteen Thieves seemed to have an almost terrifying intuition, always able to choose the right path to escape danger.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure," the hunchbacked elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not sure?" The gray-haired man was even more surprised.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert that even the well-traveled hunchbacked elder didn't recognize?</p><p></p><p>"The world is vast, it's normal for me to not know," the hunchbacked elder glanced at the gray-haired man, pondered for a moment, then continued, "I guess it should be an expert from outside the Blood Rain nation."</p><p></p><p>Within the Blood Rain nation, the hunchbacked elder felt he was quite knowledgeable, but he knew nothing about Lin Yuan. The only possibility was that he came from outside the Blood Rain nation.</p><p></p><p>The bounty for the Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain could be taken by experts not just from the Blood Rain nation, but from any of the ancient nations, with an extremely wide range.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's enough about this matter. Don't mention that expert again," the hunchbacked elder stood up and said, "Also, take down the bounty for the Eighteen Thieves of Cloud Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Since the Eighteen Thieves were already dead, there was no need for the bounty to remain.</p>

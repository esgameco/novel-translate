            <p>Chapter 293 Core Member of the Magic Jade Tower (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, on countless mountain peaks.</p><p></p><p>Numerous evolvers appeared on the mountain tops, earnestly comprehending the torso suspended beneath the sky.</p><p></p><p>This torso from an extremely powerful being from outside the realm, after being weakened by the virtual world, had become a "place of tempering" for human civilization's 7th and 8th stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some hidden dangers during the comprehension period,</p><p></p><p>After being summarized by the many evolvers who comprehended it first, the hidden dangers had been reduced to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>The hidden dangers were small, but there were many advantages.</p><p></p><p>For example, tempering the mind and will,</p><p></p><p>For example, comprehending the countless demonic evolution paths within the torso.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of many factors, this type of virtual world had been semi-publicized.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were human evolvers, met the strength and conditions requirements, they could apply to enter, unlike before where they had to be genius evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Look, that's the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, after watching so many videos of the Galaxy Star Lord, I finally get to see him in person."</p><p></p><p>The evolvers on the other mountain peaks, looking at Lin Yuan sitting cross-legged on the mountain top, started discussing excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The many deeds of Lin Yuan had already spread throughout the five star regions of human civilization, and the billions of evolvers had extreme enthusiasm and even worship for this Galaxy Star Lord who continuously created miracles.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is comprehending here, and I'm also comprehending here, doesn't that mean I've cultivated together with the Galaxy Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is already so powerful, yet he's still so immersed in cultivation, I shouldn't continue to indulge."</p><p></p><p>The numerous evolvers quickly exchanged words, their tones excited, and a small portion of people even gained motivation from this, starting to cultivate even more diligently.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long noticed the gazes of the evolvers on the other mountain tops.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't pay attention to them, his main focus now was basically all on comprehending the demonic evolution paths within the torso.</p><p></p><p>The demonic evolution paths were what the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji called the countless evolution path roads within that torso.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the many evolution paths within that torso were indeed "demonic" enough, not a single one was complete and perfect, but the many profundities contained within were real and not false.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is against the heavens, you are comprehending an unknown torso, and have comprehended the 33,325th demonic evolution path]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is against the heavens, you are comprehending an unknown torso, and have comprehended the 33,326th demonic evolution path]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is against the heavens, you are comprehending an unknown torso, and have comprehended the 33,327th demonic evolution path]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly comprehended, other evolvers would spend several months or years and still not be able to comprehend a single demonic evolution path, while Lin Yuan only spent less than half an hour to thoroughly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>It was thorough comprehension, not just comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The heaven-defying comprehension was determined by Lin Yuan's current level, when he first came into contact with this torso, Lin Yuan was only at the 7th stage, and comprehension was still quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan was already at the limit of the 8th stage, only a step away from entering the 9th stage, so naturally the speed and efficiency of his comprehension had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, Lin Yuan began to comprehend the last demonic evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"This demonic evolution path talks about emotions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was a lifeform, it had emotions, it was just a matter of degree.</p><p></p><p>Controlling emotions was equivalent to controlling oneself, and one could even control those lifeforms that couldn't control their own emotions and desires.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that the emotions of lifeforms could be used in this way."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed in his heart, all along, he had focused his attention on the vast rules, but he hadn't noticed that the emotions that came from life itself could actually have such a big use.</p><p></p><p>Among the countless evolution paths collected by human civilization, there were also those that utilized emotions and desires, but they were far less detailed and specific than this demonic evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"Emotions and desires are all a part of me, there is no need to abandon them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes, and at the same time, this demonic evolution path was thoroughly comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Just at the moment when Lin Yuan comprehended the 33,333rd demonic evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his soul, the magic jade imprint in the shape of a "nine-story black tower" began to gradually deepen in color, and vaguely, it became more real, as if it wasn't just an imprint, but a real "nine-story black tower".</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The mental pressure from that torso, as well as the whispering voices filling his ears, suddenly became clear, as if a low and hoarse male voice spoke:</p><p></p><p>"An 8th stage lifeform comprehending 33,333 demonic evolution paths automatically becomes a core member of the Magic Jade Tower."</p><p></p><p>"Core member of the Magic Jade Tower!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart settled, the status of a core member of the Magic Jade Tower far surpassed that of an ordinary member, this was the true elite of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>If it was during the peak of the Magic Jade Tower, core members would be personally received by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower, and even now that the owner had disappeared, they could still obtain the inheritance secret techniques left behind by the owner.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan was willing to delay his advancement to the 9th stage in order to comprehend 33,333 demonic evolution paths at the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Becoming an ordinary member and a core member of the Magic Jade Tower had different standards for different levels of lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long informed the Goddess of Wisdom about comprehending 3,333 demonic evolution paths, but so far, not a single human evolver had become an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Was it because those 9th stage, 10th stage, and 11th stage evolvers were stupid?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>But it was useless.</p><p></p><p>For higher level evolvers, the requirements for becoming an ordinary member would be higher.</p><p></p><p>As for the extremely powerful, the test for them to join the Magic Jade Tower had long disappeared along with the disappearance of the owner of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if an extremely powerful being comprehended all the demonic evolution paths within the torso, they still couldn't become an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and left this virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go directly to the magic jade space now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split off a thread of consciousness and followed the magic jade imprint to the magic jade space.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a core member of the Magic Jade Tower allowed one to receive an inheritance secret technique from the owner of the Magic Jade Tower, and the place to receive it was in the magic jade space.</p><p></p><p>Misty clouds.</p><p></p><p>After descending into the magic jade space, Lin Yuan didn't stop and directly headed towards the nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived in front of the nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>"You're here?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji walked out, smiling as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan for a while, and suddenly his expression changed, as if he had discovered something, with a look of having seen a ghost:</p><p></p><p>"You became a core member?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>As the guardian of the Nine-Layered Black Tower, he had the ability to see the level of every member of the Magic Jade Tower - ordinary members, core members, and higher.</p><p></p><p>There were more than a dozen ways and methods to become a core member of the Magic Jade Tower. </p><p></p><p>These methods and paths had different focuses, but the most difficult one was definitely the test of pure enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had comprehended the complete spatial rules at the age of over two thousand, comprehended dozens of cosmic powers, including a primordial cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>Such talent and aptitude had never been seen even during the heyday of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji had never doubted that Lin Yuan could pass the test of becoming a core member of the Magic Jade Tower in terms of pure enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But this was too fast, right?</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Shen Ji had witnessed Lin Yuan's progress in spatial rules, rule fusion, and so on.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly have time to comprehend so many paths of magic evolution?</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that Lin Yuan's enlightenment was far beyond his imagination? Comprehending these paths of magic evolution didn't take long at all?</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was shocked for a long time and couldn't calm down.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan entered the Magic Jade Space, the fluctuations in his emotions were more than the sum of the past countless tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"I was quite lucky." Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was quite speechless in his heart. If this was considered quite lucky, then wouldn't those past supreme geniuses on the path of evolution in the Magic Jade Tower have all relied on luck?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not talk about this anymore."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji composed himself and said, "Since you have become a core member of the Magic Jade Tower, according to the rules, you can be personally summoned by the master and obtain a legacy secret technique from the master."</p><p></p><p>"But the master disappeared long ago in the distant past, so you can't meet the master either."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan, his expression somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>He could imagine how happy the master of the Magic Jade Tower would be to see a peerless genius like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So, you can only get a legacy secret technique left by the master."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>"A legacy secret technique left by the master of the Magic Jade Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was the master of the Magic Jade Tower? Lin Yuan couldn't be sure, but he should be somewhat stronger than ordinary supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>The legacy secret techniques left by such an existence, how could they be simple legacy secret techniques?</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan was stuck at the eighth level to become a core member of the Magic Jade Tower was also for the legacy secret techniques left by the master of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>"These are seven legacy secret techniques, you can choose one from them."</p><p></p><p>A layer of light screen suddenly appeared in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>One: Indestructible Magic Jade Body.</p><p></p><p>The body is like magic jade, eternally existing. Once cultivated to perfection, it will be indestructible for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>Two: Soul Magic Bell.</p><p></p><p>A soul defense secret technique that can condense a magic bell on the surface of the soul, absorbing soul attacks and temporarily increasing soul strength.</p><p></p><p>Three: Great Luo Battle Technique.</p><p></p><p>A killing secret technique.</p><p></p><p>The legacy secret techniques appeared one by one in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the legacy secret techniques left by the master of the Magic Jade Tower were exceptionally considerate, and seventh and eighth level lifeforms could try to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>There were no threshold conditions. After all, they were just legacy secret techniques, not paths of evolution. As long as they were living beings, they all had the opportunity to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each secret technique, when cultivated to the ultimate perfection, had a terrifyingly powerful effect, especially that Indestructible Magic Jade Body, which was described as "eternally existing" and "indestructible for all eternity". Just hearing it, one knew it was very terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Yuan already had the flesh divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", which overlapped somewhat with the effect of this legacy secret technique.</p><p></p><p>And to cultivate this legacy secret technique to the level of "eternally existing" and "indestructible for all eternity", it was estimated that one had to become a supreme expert to have a chance.</p><p></p><p>"The seven legacy secret techniques left by the master each have their own strengths, including killing, defense, life-saving, and so on. You can choose one."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Which one should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a little hesitant.</p><p></p><p>First of all, defensive legacy secret techniques could be excluded. He had the Primordial Essence Metal to guard his flesh, soul, mind, and will. In terms of defense, it could be said to be maxed out.</p><p></p><p>Facing evolutionary beings of the same level, even if Lin Yuan stood still without moving, the other party wouldn't be able to break through his defense.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with the Rebirth from a Drop of Blood divine ability, even if his defense was broken, Lin Yuan could recover in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As for higher-level evolutionary beings, if Lin Yuan really encountered a powerhouse that he couldn't resist, having one or two more secret techniques wouldn't make much of a difference.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful a secret technique was, it still depended on the user's strength.</p><p></p><p>If a baby held a dragon-slaying technique, could it really slay a true dragon?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had the backing of human civilization and could also learn and cultivate various legacy secret techniques. Although they were slightly inferior to the seven secret techniques left by the master of the Magic Jade Tower, they could still be used if he made do with them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't lack defensive secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also didn't lack life-saving secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan equally didn't lack offensive secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I choose this secret technique."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This legacy secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Illusory Reality?"</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue's expression revealed a trace of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"Illusory Reality" was one of the seven legacy secret techniques, and it belonged to the supportive type of legacy secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>It could allow one's own flesh to freely transform between reality and illusion, and could also freely transform between illusion and reality.</p><p></p><p>The illusion here was similar to an energy body or a soul body.</p><p></p><p>This legacy secret technique could change the basic structure of life. To a certain extent, it involved a higher essence.</p><p></p><p>It's just that it didn't have much meaning.</p><p></p><p>Even if you cultivated this legacy secret technique and transformed from a flesh and blood life to an energy life, how much would it increase your own combat power?</p><p></p><p>Or transforming from an energy life to a flesh and blood life? There wasn't much difference.</p><p></p><p>It was far inferior to choosing an offensive legacy secret technique to improve oneself.</p><p></p><p>Among the legacy secret techniques that the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji speculated Lin Yuan might choose, only this "Illusory Reality" was not included.</p><p></p><p>Because compared to the other six legacy secret techniques, it was slightly useless.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji rarely said an extra sentence.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that Lin Yuan would consider carefully and not waste this selection opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The seven secret techniques left by the master of the Magic Jade Tower, except for "Illusory Reality", were all top-notch in their respective fields.</p><p></p><p>Even if one became a supreme expert in the future, they would still be of great help.</p><p></p><p>"It's this one." Lin Yuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Choosing this legacy secret technique, Lin Yuan had carefully considered it.</p><p></p><p>For other powerhouses, this secret technique wasn't of much use, and its practical value was not on the same level as the other six legacy secret techniques at all.</p><p></p><p>But in Lin Yuan's view, it was the most suitable legacy secret technique for himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

            <p>Chapter 242: The Shock in the Milky Way Star Domain (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan knew that "Shang Shan" was not dead, he didn't pay much attention to it. ‚ôõüçÆ‚ûÖÔºô—ïùïôùì§–ñ.ƒÜùî¨ùêå‚òüüêØ</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's cultivation speed, he could now crush "Shang Shan" to death.</p><p></p><p>Let alone in the future?</p><p></p><p>It should be the other party who should be afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the spoils of war."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put the huge planet back on the star path. This planet, which could be used as a lair by two eighth-level special lifeforms, was naturally extraordinary and considered rare even among high-level living planets, containing a large amount of gentle cosmic energy.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan made a move against "Ao Du" and "Shang Shan", he tried his best not to destroy the planet and confined the aftershocks to the surface of the planet.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of special lifeform bloodlines."</p><p></p><p>First was the large amount of bloodline essence collected by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Special lifeforms in the universe are scarce in number, and many are born from the universe and cannot reproduce. Their bloodline essence is far stronger than that of humans.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization, from a very early time, tried to integrate the bloodlines of these special lifeforms into human bloodlines in order to obtain stronger offspring.</p><p></p><p>Thus, bloodline essence potions were born.</p><p></p><p>Through special means, the bloodlines are extracted from special lifeforms and made into bloodline essence potions.</p><p></p><p>It can be integrated into the bloodlines of one's own offspring. For those evolutionaries who want to establish a family, a portion of bloodline essence potion is enough to make the future generations of the family prosper for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I still have a portion of the Three-Headed Ice Wolf bloodline essence potion."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to remember something, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Headed Ice Wolf bloodline essence potion was one of the legacies of the eighth-level evolutionary Ou Yin.</p><p></p><p>It originated from the special lifeform Three-Headed Ice Wolf.</p><p></p><p>Back then, in order to make such a portion of bloodline essence potion, the eighth-level evolutionary Ou Yin had slaughtered who knows how many Three-Headed Ice Wolves.</p><p></p><p>"It should be able to make eight or nine portions of bloodline essence potions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly calculated based on the blood left by "Shang Shan" and "Ao Du".</p><p></p><p>These two special lifeforms were huge in size, almost comparable to ordinary living planets. Naturally, their body's essence blood was much more than that of the Three-Headed Ice Wolf.</p><p></p><p>Although the Three-Headed Ice Wolf was also a special lifeform, its body was only a few dozen meters in size, far inferior to "Shang Shan" and "Ao Du".</p><p></p><p>"Eight or nine portions of bloodline essence potions, even if one portion is only worth three thousand square cosmic crystals, it would add up to nearly thirty thousand square cosmic crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Many eighth-level human evolutionaries, even if all their treasures and weapons were added together, would only be equivalent to the value of ten thousand square cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>But now, just the bloodline essence alone from Lin Yuan's gains was equivalent to the entire assets of three eighth-level evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>This was still Lin Yuan's conservative estimate of the bloodline essence potions. In fact, most bloodline essence potions were worth more than three thousand square cosmic crystals each.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to explore the many treasures of the two special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"They are indeed wealthy. No wonder they asked for twenty thousand cosmic crystals right away." Lin Yuan was quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>The various treasures, ores, weapons, etc. collected by these two special lifeforms, "Shang Shan" and "Ao Du", added up to more than sixty thousand square cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>Among them, "Shang Shan" contributed more than forty thousand square cosmic crystals, while "Ao Du" contributed more than twenty thousand square cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>Together with the bloodline essence potions made from the bloodlines of these two special lifeforms, Lin Yuan's gains from this trip were estimated to exceed one hundred thousand square cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to recoup the cosmic crystals used for planet transformation so quickly."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The B-grade transformation of the Milky Way's main star cost Lin Yuan one hundred thousand square cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan originally thought that these one hundred thousand square cosmic crystals could only be earned back after the Milky Way Star Domain was fully operational and trade channels were established.</p><p></p><p>But now, just by clearing out two special lifeforms, he had already "broken even".</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>"There are still a few targets."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately headed in another direction.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining detailed information about the many special lifeforms and lone alien wanderers lurking in the Milky Way Star Domain,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided these special lifeforms and lone alien wanderers into two categories.</p><p></p><p>The first type was like "Shang Shan" and "Ao Du", who fed on planets and were harmful to the Milky Way Star Domain if left alone.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan's approach to these special lifeforms was either to directly kill them to eliminate future troubles or to drive them out of the Milky Way Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The second type was those that did not have much impact on the star domain and could form a "symbiotic" relationship with the Milky Way Star Domain. Some special lifeform tribes could produce treasures and rarities that had unimaginable effects on human evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>As long as these special lifeform tribes were obedient, Lin Yuan was willing to let them stay and even send people to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current destination was the first type of special lifeforms and lone alien wanderers.</p><p></p><p>After getting a taste of the benefits, Lin Yuan knew that he had to move as fast as possible. Otherwise, once the news spread, those special lifeforms would probably flee in fear.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>On a desolate planet,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, and the huge phantom of the World Force suppressed the entire planet.</p><p></p><p>Compared to "Shang Shan", the intelligence gathered on these two lone alien wanderers was clearly lacking. They didn't even recognize the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>But even if they didn't know Lin Yuan's identity, just the pressure of the World Force made them feel the oppressive sense of doomsday. This man in green armor had a strength far surpassing theirs.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility that he was an eighth-level peak powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, there must be some misunderstanding between us. We hope that you can give us a chance," the two lone alien wanderers said in an extremely humble manner.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at these two lone alien wanderers from the sky. "You feed on the souls of living beings. If my human citizens migrate here in the future, won't they all become your food?"</p><p></p><p>"You can't stay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan announced the verdict for these two aliens.</p><p></p><p>While human citizens had not yet migrated here, all hidden dangers had to be eliminated. Otherwise, it would be very troublesome later.</p><p></p><p>"Human citizens migrating here..."</p><p></p><p>The two lone alien wanderers felt a chill in their hearts. They indeed liked to devour the souls of living beings, but they had never laid hands on human citizens, right?</p><p></p><p>However, before they could continue thinking,</p><p></p><p>They felt their consciousness sink into darkness.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, these two lone alien wanderers turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, these two lone alien wanderers had never made a move against humans.</p><p></p><p>But just to be on the safe side, Lin Yuan was too lazy to differentiate. Anyway, they were all aliens and liked to devour souls. Keeping them around wouldn't create any value either.</p><p></p><p>Killing them was more convenient.</p><p></p><p>As for expulsion? The surrounding star domains all belonged to human civilizations.</p><p></p><p>Expelling them to other star domains, wouldn't that harm the human citizens of those star domains?</p><p></p><p>Half a day later,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared in front of a star.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, an alien covered in scales and with a sharp horn was frantically fleeing.</p><p></p><p>But when this alien saw Lin Yuan standing in the distance,</p><p></p><p>Time stopped abruptly, filled with a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, I admit that my actions were indeed somewhat cruel, but they were all directed at the Shadow Clan," the sharp-horned alien couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could react, the Galaxy Star Lord appeared.</p><p></p><p>This alien didn't even think and began to flee frantically. Although he didn't know why the Galaxy Star Lord, who had just entered the Eighth Stage, could easily slaughter several Eighth Stage aliens.</p><p></p><p>But running was the right thing to do.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Shadow Clan has retreated, why are you still staying in this star domain?" Lin Yuan looked at the screaming alien and calmly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I..." The sharp-horned alien was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>It stayed behind, naturally to test the temper of the new Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>If the new Star Lord didn't like to manage affairs, then it would continue to devour human citizens for cultivation from time to time, just like before.</p><p></p><p>If the new Star Lord was assertive, it would obediently leave.</p><p></p><p>This was also the idea of most special lifeforms and lone aliens.</p><p></p><p>They just didn't expect that the Galaxy Star Lord would be so decisive in killing, not giving them any chance to test at all.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The figure of this sharp-horned alien turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't waste words with this screaming alien. After directly killing it, he continued to advance towards the next target.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's classification of those special lifeforms and lone aliens, as long as they belonged to the first category, they would be killed if possible.</p><p></p><p>Many Star Lords of human civilization acted very gently. As long as they didn't directly harm human citizens, they generally wouldn't make a killing move.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's methods were obviously much more ruthless. In the vast universe, strength was respected. If one day human civilization declined, those aliens would not hold back when slaughtering humans.</p><p></p><p>So even if some lone aliens didn't make a move against human citizens, as long as they had this idea in their minds, Lin Yuan would kill them without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Judging by actions, not by thoughts, that was the standard when dealing with fellow humans.</p><p></p><p>For those aliens, as long as they were not aliens who submitted to human civilization or formed an alliance with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan basically wouldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Showing no mercy when mercy could be shown.</p><p></p><p>90% of these special lifeforms and lone aliens died at the hands of Lin Yuan, and the remaining 10% were lucky enough to escape.</p><p></p><p>There was no way. If he made a move one by one, the news would easily leak out. Some alien true bodies were not in the Galaxy Star Domain. When their avatars died, the true bodies would send out messages, letting some lone aliens know in advance and escape in time.</p><p></p><p>But overall, Lin Yuan's trip away from the Galaxy's main star this time was quite fruitful, and his goal was basically achieved.</p><p></p><p>Those first-class special lifeforms and lone aliens had basically disappeared from the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, when Lin Yuan launched a killing spree against the special lifeforms and lone aliens in the Galaxy Star Domain, it alarmed other forces.</p><p></p><p>Most of these forces were special lifeforms, classified by Lin Yuan as the second category, with the hope of helping the development of the Galaxy Star Domain, so he didn't pay attention to them.</p><p></p><p>"In this star domain, many Seventh and Eighth Stage powerhouses have fallen. Just the ones I know, there are thirteen Seventh Stage and one Eighth Stage who have completely died."</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened? Those Eighth Stage special lifeforms, each of them has remarkable life-saving means, who can easily kill them?"</p><p></p><p>"Some alien powerhouses I know have also died."</p><p></p><p>A special lifeform clan called the "Flower God Clan" gathered many powerhouses together, discussing with some uneasiness.</p><p></p><p>Although the Flower God Clan was a special lifeform clan, its positive combat ability was not strong, and the clan could reproduce normally.</p><p></p><p>The clansmen of the Flower God Clan could brew a beautiful wine called "Flower God Wine". Most lifeforms who drank it could gain short-term mental clarity, which had a miraculous effect when used to comprehend the secrets of the rules.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that during the Shadow Clan's rule over this area, the Flower God Clan barely survived by offering "Flower God Wine" as tribute.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed that the Seventh and Eighth Stage powerhouses who died were all those who were cruel in their methods and devoured planets from time to time?"</p><p></p><p>A Flower God Clan powerhouse who looked like a young girl suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>She was a Seventh Stage powerhouse, one of the strongest in the Flower God Clan now.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Seventh Stage powerhouses of the Flower God Clan had basically the lowest combat power.</p><p></p><p>They were not even as strong as the evolved humans of human civilization who relied on Seventh Stage evolution potions and only possessed the basic destructive power of the Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"Even Eighth Stage powerhouses have died, but our Flower God Clan is still alive and well."</p><p></p><p>Other Flower God Clan powerhouses reacted and started discussing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A Flower God Clan powerhouse with butterfly wings had a slight change in expression.</p><p></p><p>This Flower God Clan powerhouse looked around, with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Received news?"</p><p></p><p>"What news?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and say, what news exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Several Flower God Clan powerhouses asked. The news received at this time was most likely related to those Seventh and Eighth Stage aliens who died mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"The one who made a move against those Seventh and Eighth Stage aliens was the Galaxy Star Lord, the unparalleled genius of human civilization. This time, he made a move to erase all unstable factors in the Galaxy Star Domain," the Flower God Clan powerhouse who stood up said in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"I know of this human genius, but wasn't it said that he had just entered the Eighth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just entered the Eighth Stage, and killing those near peak Eighth Stage alien powerhouses like killing pigs and dogs?"</p><p></p><p>The many Flower God Clan powerhouses were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Those Eighth Stage special lifeforms and lone aliens were all good at fighting and had unimaginable means, but they were all killed?</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One possibility was that these Eighth Stage special lifeforms and lone aliens were all just boasting and couldn't withstand a single blow.</p><p></p><p>But this possibility was basically zero. If that were really the case, how could they have coexisted harmoniously with the Shadow Clan for so many years? Did they really think the Shadow Clan was a charity?</p><p></p><p>The other possibility was that the Galaxy Star Lord's strength was unimaginably powerful, and it was precisely because of this that he was able to easily deal with those special lifeforms and lone aliens.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very grateful that our Flower God Clan is still somewhat useful, otherwise..." The Flower God Clan powerhouse who stood up sighed.</p><p></p><p>According to the news she received, the Galaxy Star Lord's killing was not without reason, but was a selective pursuit.</p><p></p><p>The Flower God Clan posed no threat to the star domain and could instead brew the "Flower God Wine" which was of great benefit to the evolved, so it was spared by the Galaxy Star Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"I don't care what you think."</p><p></p><p>This Flower God Clan powerhouse calmed herself, suppressed the shock in her heart, and continued, "Before, the sky of this star domain belonged to the Shadow Clan and those powerful special lifeforms and lone aliens."</p><p></p><p>"Now, the sky of this star domain has only one."</p><p></p><p>At this point, this Flower God Clan powerhouse paused for a moment and said in a solemn voice,</p><p></p><p>"And that is the Galaxy Star Lord."</p>

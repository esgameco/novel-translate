        <h1>Chapter 470</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 470 Hope (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the black wooden box looked like just an ordinary wooden box, containing three immortal sources.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was formed by layer upon layer of sealing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Completely isolating the inside and outside of the wooden box, separating it from time, space, and causality.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could the dispersal of the 'immortal source' be minimized as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In terms of value, not to mention the immortal source inside the wooden box, the box itself alone is worth no less than 100,000 top-grade immortal crystals, equivalent to the entire wealth of an ordinary jade immortal.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Inside the black wooden box,</p><p></p><p>There was a crystal the size of a fist, with flickering light points inside, like endless stars.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the opening of the box's seals, the crystal began to emanate a wisp of aura, and many auras spread out in all directions, vaguely enveloping Lin Yuan in a mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>And within this realm -</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations of many Dao rules were like surging waves crashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was shaken. The experience he was going through at this moment was like a person who had been thirsty for dozens of days, suddenly plunging into water, with the longed-for water source rushing towards him endlessly.</p><p></p><p>【Your innate talent is extraordinary, observing the mysterious origin, your understanding of the essence of many rules has been greatly enhanced.】</p><p></p><p>Almost in an instant, Lin Yuan immersed himself in cultivation, with time and space merging with the rules, and numerous other pillar-level fusion rules rapidly improving at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the 'immortal source' in front of him, which had shrunk by a circle, and immediately closed the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the isolation between the inside and outside of the wooden box was restored, and the dispersal of the immortal source aura stopped, and the surroundings returned to their original state.</p><p></p><p>"This immortal source comes from the origin realm of the immortal world, and is condensed from the aura of the origin realm. Once it comes to the outside world, losing the condensing environment, the immortal source will 'evaporate' and 'disperse'."</p><p></p><p>"And the immortal world origin realm aura that is dispersed and evaporated will briefly recreate the environment of the immortal world origin realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>Just like water freezing into ice in a sub-zero environment.</p><p></p><p>But as long as it returns to a temperature above zero, the ice will turn back into water.</p><p></p><p>The immortal source follows a similar principle.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, just now, Lin Yuan had briefly cultivated in the immortal world origin realm.</p><p></p><p>That feeling of Dao rules raining down, the help it provided to Lin Yuan far exceeded the gains of other jade immortals in comprehending the immortal source.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's extraordinary innate talent allowed him to gain a cultivation speed that could crush other jade immortals.</p><p></p><p>The same apple falling on the head, some people will only feel that the apple is hard, or that the apple is not very delicious.</p><p></p><p>But some people can directly comprehend the essence of heaven and earth, this is the difference in innate talent.</p><p></p><p>The temporary environment formed by the dispersal of the immortal source allowed Lin Yuan to harvest greatly.</p><p></p><p>Just in that short half-day, Lin Yuan felt that his understanding of time-space fusion rules had advanced further, and the other pillar-level fusion rules were the same.</p><p></p><p>If it was just about accelerating rule comprehension, even if it was helpful, it wouldn't have shaken Lin Yuan so much.</p><p></p><p>After all, his extraordinary innate talent is there, even without the immortal source, he would still comprehend what he should comprehend, just taking a little longer.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Through the brief comprehension of the immortal source just now, Lin Yuan, including the time-space fusion rules within, all rule comprehensions advanced in parallel, and he even had a feeling of all rules returning to chaos?</p><p></p><p>"Chaos rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was spirited.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan did not have much confidence in whether he could comprehend the chaos rules at the Eleventh Realm, because there was no direction, neither Emperor Xuan nor the Demon Jade Pavilion Master could provide any guidance.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Lin Yuan could do was to comprehend as many Dao rules as possible.</p><p></p><p>But just now, Lin Yuan finally had a feeling of all things returning to chaos.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal source, the immortal source can help me comprehend the chaos rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, comprehending the chaos rules at the Eleventh Realm would not only cause his strength to surge, but also greatly increase the probability of success when attacking the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the former, Lin Yuan cared more about the latter.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the consumption rate of the immortal source is too fast."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the wooden box in front of him, and it had shrunk by a circle after being opened for just a short half-day.</p><p></p><p>If he indulged in comprehension, these three immortal sources would be completely dispersed in about ten days.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Palace Master of the Flying Immortal Palace told me to only open the wooden box when I'm cultivating and comprehending."  Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even just a brief opening would consume a one-hundredth or one-millionth of the immortal source, which is a definite loss.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I will only use the immortal source in critical moments during my cultivation, and the rest of the time will be normal comprehension."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the irregular rift in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, try to obtain more immortal sources as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>If there were enough immortal sources, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed would definitely be far beyond the current one, and comprehending the chaos rules would no longer be a luxury.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Temple of Heaven and Water wants the master to refine a batch of Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir? They are only willing to pay 20 million top-grade immortal crystals?"</p><p></p><p>"Too stingy, I directly rejected it."</p><p></p><p>"The Flowing River Palace wants to ask the master to refine a Life and Death Reincarnation Pill, with 30 million top-grade immortal crystals as the reward?"</p><p></p><p>"The Life and Death Reincarnation Pill is even rarer than the Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir, and the refining master needs to experience the danger of life and death to refine it, yet only 30 million top-grade immortal crystals? I'm too lazy to refuse."</p><p></p><p>"The Sun and Moon Sect is willing to offer one immortal source and request the master to open the furnace once. This can be considered, the master said before, when it involves immortal sources, don't easily refuse."</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Cloud True Disciple looked at the letters from various forces, quickly browsing through them and rejecting all the ones without sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan successfully refined the first batch of Nine Revolutions Golden Elixir, triggering the descent of the heavenly tribulation, and finally succeeding in the refinement, his reputation as the top-tier refining master has been fully spread.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, many forces in the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, and even the forces in the savage areas outside the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, want to request Lin Yuan to refine elixirs for them.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the immortal world, the importance of a refining master is undeniable, and various immortal elixirs have almost become an indispensable part for all immortals.</p><p></p><p>For many immortals, the importance of immortal elixirs is even greater than immortal artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what kind of strength is it exactly."</p><p></p><p>Cloud True Disciple quickly finished reading all the letters, and his mind couldn't help but flash back to the towering and majestic blurry figure he wanted to possess and invade Lin Yuan's spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>At first, Cloud True Disciple's initial reaction was whether he had usurped the Dao Ancestor, because apart from the Dao Ancestor, whose mental will at the Jade Immortal realm could make him feel so desperate?</p><p></p><p>"But since I've joined the master, my strength and realm have improved quite a bit." Cloud True Disciple calmed down, in these 500 years, just the things that casually flowed out from Lin Yuan's fingertips have greatly benefited him.</p><p></p><p>Especially the 'failed elixirs' that Lin Yuan refined occasionally. In Cloud True Disciple's eyes, Lin Yuan's definition of 'failed elixirs'...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The quality is already quite good.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The space-time in all directions was slightly distorted. While Lin Yuan tried his best to minimize his interference with the surroundings during his comprehension of the great Dao rules, he could not completely stop it.</p><p></p><p>For more than 500 years, under Lin Yuan's subtle influence, the cultivation area's space had been expanded many times over.</p><p></p><p>The vast space-time labyrinth, centered on Lin Yuan, permeated every inch of the cultivation area.</p><p></p><p>However, only Lin Yuan could enter the cultivation area, and Yun Zhenzi could occasionally approach it, but the latter's presence was marked by Lin Yuan's aura and thus unaffected.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Sect Master of the Immortal Fairy Palace visited Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Yun Zhenzi, are you interested in refining another batch of Nine Revolutions Elixirs?" The Sect Master of the Immortal Fairy Palace smiled. After carefully examining the fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs Lin Yuan had refined last time, he found their effects to be even better than imagined.</p><p></p><p>"It would be my honor." Lin Yuan smiled, as the transactions with the Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master were extremely hassle-free, and he was paid in immortal sources as the refining fee.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Next, the two discussed the details of elixir refinement, and Lin Yuan asked, "Does the Sect Master have any channels to obtain immortal sources?"</p><p></p><p>Immortal sources were naturally the more the better for Lin Yuan, but apart from a few powers like the Immortal Fairy Palace, others were only willing to pay in supreme immortal crystals or other precious resources when requesting Lin Yuan to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you want immortal sources?" The Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master showed a hint of surprise on his face. According to the immortal sources he had traded with Lin Yuan, it should have been enough for normal Jade Immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The use of immortal sources was not the more the better. The temporary environment formed by the volatilization of immortal sources, if exposed to for a long time, even Jade Immortals would face the risk of "Dao Transformation".</p><p></p><p>"Dao Transformation" meant that one's entire being would return to the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>To resist the Dao Transformation of immortal sources for a long time, one could only rely on the spiritual will of the Jade Immortal themselves.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even the top-tier Jade Immortals would not dare to cultivate for too long in the environment formed by immortal sources.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if they could only briefly contact and cultivate, it would still be of great help to any Jade Immortal, which was the reason why immortal sources were so rare.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jade Immortals had long lifespans, and they could go and comprehend the immortal sources again after a long period of time.</p><p></p><p>"I will help you inquire more about it," the Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The two continued to chat for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master seemed to have remembered something and said in a low voice, "By the way, would the Master consider hiring some top-tier Jade Immortals to protect yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"Protect myself?" Lin Yuan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." The Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master explained, "With your current level of elixir refinement, while attracting many who seek your services, it will also inevitably draw the attention of those with ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master did not directly say it, the meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier elixir refining master would undoubtedly be wealthy, and the accumulated wealth would attract the attention of powerful Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could kill a top-tier elixir refining master, the wealth they would gain would be enough to support their cultivation for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, plundering has always been the fastest way to accumulate wealth, and Lin Yuan was unwilling to plunder because he had the more efficient and safer method of elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>But for other Jade Immortals, it might not be the same.</p><p></p><p>"Do they dare to make a move in the Immortal City?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City was covered with countless formations, and even Jade Immortals had to be extremely careful, especially in the area of the high-grade cave dwellings where Lin Yuan lived.</p><p></p><p>As the highest-ranked cave dwelling in the Immortal City, its safety was naturally highly valued.</p><p></p><p>"The formations in the Immortal City are not absolutely perfect, and these formations are also set up by Jade Immortals, so there is a possibility of being broken through," the Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm was vast, with countless methods, and while the Immortal City was backed by Dao Ancestors, they had not interfered in its management since opening the irregular cracks connecting to the source of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The establishment and perfection of the Immortal City relied on many Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>These formations were also the work of various Jade Immortals, so the Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master's suggestion was not unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was just an ordinary Jade Immortal, he naturally wouldn't need to consider these, and the existence of those who could hope to break through the Immortal City formations would also require a huge price.</p><p></p><p>Just the cost of this alone would far exceed the entire wealth of an ordinary Jade Immortal, not to mention the constant risk of being detected by the Immortal City formations and then facing the joint suppression of many Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan...</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's exact wealth was unknown, just based on the harvests from refining the Nine Revolutions Elixirs during this period, it was far beyond that of an ordinary Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded, "I will consider it."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had no intention of hiring any top-tier Jade Immortals to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>That would be too troublesome and also carry the risk of exposing his own secrets.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Fairy Palace Sect Master suggested hiring top-tier Jade Immortals because he was unaware of Lin Yuan's true strength.</p><p></p><p>The outside world only knew that Lin Yuan was skilled in elixir refinement and was the top-tier elixir refining master, but in reality, Lin Yuan's greatest expertise was in offensive abilities, especially after he obtained the sixth physical divine art, "Rip the Sky".</p><p></p><p>As for whether he would really encounter any plundering attempts, Lin Yuan was even looking forward to it. At that time, it would be a question of who would plunder whom.</p><p></p><p>In this journey, Lin Yuan had set the tone for himself to be as low-key as possible, but if others actively came to him, he would only be able to accept it with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, in the Northern Noon Immortal Realm, deep within an ancient mountain range, a figure in a beast robe sat cross-legged, emanating a terrifying savage aura.</p><p></p><p>"Was it really necessary to pursue me so relentlessly just because I killed one of your offspring? You, the mighty City Lord, have so many offspring, what's the big deal about killing one of them?" </p><p></p><p>This figure in the beast robe shook his head lightly. Not long ago, he had killed the offspring of the Northern Chill City Lord in the Northern Chill Immortal City, in order to obtain a crucial resource.</p><p></p><p>This directly enraged the Northern Chill City Lord, and countless formations immediately enveloped the immortal city. If it weren't for the beast-robed figure's innate talent in merging into formations, he probably wouldn't have been able to escape the Northern Chill Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the beast-robed figure was now wanted by all the immortal cities in the Northern Noon Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the Northern Noon Immortal Realm anymore."</p><p></p><p>The beast-robed figure thought to himself. Although with his abilities, he could escape time and time again even with a bounty on his head, he couldn't keep doing this indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>As a Jade Immortal, he also needed various resources for cultivation, and under the pursuit of the entire Northern Noon Immortal Realm, he would not be able to enter those immortal cities to purchase resources.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 524</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The great collapse of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the fierce battle between two Grand Saints of Chaos had caused the collapse of all universes in a large area, leading to an early onset of the great collapse. He had indeed seen such examples in records from the Magic Jade Space and the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>The attacks of a Grand Saint of Chaos could break through all the defensive barriers of a universe. </p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't completely erase that universe, they could force its destruction and return to its initial state.</p><p></p><p>For the universe itself, this didn't have much impact, as the universe would still exist. But for the living beings within the universe, it would be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>"If the great collapse of the universe really comes early, what should I do?" Lin Yuan's thoughts fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>The great collapse of the universe actually wouldn't affect Lin Yuan much. With his strength, he could easily withstand the great destruction during the collapse and enter the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't want to enter the Chaos Void, Lin Yuan could also use the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to hide inside, like the Calamity Clan, and wait out until the next cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was half-fused with the universe's origin, so even the great collapse wouldn't affect it. Hiding inside would be almost absolutely safe, similar to the wooden house of the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Lin Yuan could use the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds to enter other dimensional worlds. After reaching the 12th level, many restrictions of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds had been lifted for Lin Yuan, allowing him to descend in his true form into certain worlds.</p><p></p><p>This method was even more reliable than the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was fused with the universe's origin, so as long as no 13th level Time Life intervened, one could rest easy. But what if a 13th level Time Life did intervene? Of course, 13th level Time Lives were such lofty existences that the probability of them interfering with a universe was almost zero, but the possibility still existed.</p><p></p><p>But the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds? Even 13th level Time Lives would find it difficult to explore other dimensional worlds.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was almost safe, then the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds was absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>In short, Lin Yuan's methods for dealing with the great collapse of the universe were too simple. The great collapse was a disaster for other life forms, even for 12th level Ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>But in Lin Yuan's mind, it wasn't even a concern.</p><p></p><p>However, while Lin Yuan himself had no problems, the countless citizens of human civilization would probably have to make choices.</p><p></p><p>"I need to tell Xuan Yuan, Xia Qin and the others about this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began contacting the other nine supreme beings of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>On matters concerning the survival of the entire human civilization, the nine supreme beings also had the right to know.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Figures gradually appeared on the ten thrones.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, what did you call us here for?"</p><p></p><p>"Why do you say that? Do we need a reason to gather?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we can get together and chat anytime."</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings of human civilization were extremely relaxed. Now that the entire universe had become the domain of human civilization, these supreme beings naturally felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>Before, there was the threat of 12th level Ultimate beings from the other eleven peak clan forces, so the nine human supreme beings, while not exactly treading on thin ice, still felt a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan was keeping a low profile, and the Ultimate beings of the other ten peak clans had all been suppressed, with their clans incorporated into human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The current human civilization was undoubtedly at its most prosperous point in history, so these supreme beings naturally felt very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the nine human supreme beings, pondered for a moment, then said: "I sent out an avatar long ago to explore the Chaos Void."</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings immediately listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary 12th level Path-breaking realm powerhouses couldn't send their avatars far beyond the universe.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had created too many miracles.</p><p></p><p>So when the nine supreme beings learned that Lin Yuan had already begun exploring the Chaos Void outside the universe, they weren't surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan said next made all the supreme beings' expressions change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that our universe is about to be engulfed by the battle between two Grand Saints of Chaos, leading to an early great collapse?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin was shocked. He didn't even know what Grand Saints of Chaos represented.</p><p></p><p>But the meaning of the great collapse of the universe was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The other eight supreme beings were in a similar state. An early great collapse of the universe was a disaster for all 12th level beings within the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, are you sure this is true?" </p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Guli asked solemnly. The great collapse of the universe was no trivial matter; it concerned the future direction of them and the entire human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"I'm 90% certain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. The Ancient Ming Chaos Continent had started a long journey to avoid the battle zone of the two Grand Saints of Chaos. Given the size of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, how much chaos stone would be needed for such a move?</p><p></p><p>Since Elder Gu Ming dared to do this, he must have received definite information.</p><p></p><p>"90% certain?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings' hearts sank.</p><p></p><p>90% certainty basically meant this would definitely happen.</p><p></p><p>"When will the battle between those two Grand Saints of Chaos affect us here?" Supreme Being Xuan Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Between a hundred and a thousand years," Lin Yuan answered.</p><p></p><p>According to the red area marked on the map given by the silver-haired woman, the location of their home universe was right in the path of the two Grand Saints of Chaos' battle trajectory, and would be affected first.</p><p></p><p>In Chaos Void time, it would be within a few years, but time flowed much faster inside the universe, so it would be between a hundred and a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere among the ten supreme beings of human civilization was very solemn.</p><p></p><p>"We owe thanks to Galaxy for this. If it weren't for you, we might not have known until the great collapse was upon us," </p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuan Yuan took a deep breath and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Facing a disaster like the great collapse of the universe, knowing in advance versus knowing at the last moment were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when a universe enters the great collapse, there are many omens.</p><p></p><p>The 12th level beings in the universe would also make corresponding preparations.</p><p></p><p>For example, they would start relocating their clans, gathering resources from throughout the universe, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But for this kind of early collapse caused by external forces, if Lin Yuan hadn't said anything, the losses to human civilization would have been great.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that relocating the human clan required time. During the great collapse of the universe, the internal universes of supreme beings could carry part of humanity, transferring the corresponding life essences into the river of time within their internal universes.</p><p></p><p>But this process took time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the universe's territory was vast, containing many resource planets and secret realms.</p><p></p><p>These planetary secret realms, if mined slowly, were like money trees. But if the great collapse of the universe was really imminent, they would definitely pack everything up and leave, even if it meant losing some in the process.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin and the others</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful ones also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>If the great collapse of the universe was unstoppable, then all they could do now was to minimize further losses as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"When the great collapse of the universe truly comes, resources and such are easy to deal with. They're not living things, so they don't need to undergo the essence of life transfer. They can simply be placed in the opened up spaces."</p><p></p><p>"But for our human race..."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being looked somewhat worried. The migration of life was not as simple as one might imagine.</p><p></p><p>Each of the nine supreme beings of human civilization had an inner universe of hundreds of thousands of light-years in size. Added together, they could reach several million light-years. </p><p></p><p>Plus Lin Yuan's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>With such a large area, if they squeezed together and lowered the quality of the living environment a bit, it would be completely sufficient to relocate the majority of the human race.</p><p></p><p>However, during the great collapse of the universe, the more life a supreme being carried within them, the heavier the destructive tribulation they would bear.</p><p></p><p>If a supreme being placed all the life in their universe, including those twelfth-order beings, inside their inner universe, they would face the full crushing force of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>The universe's origin was equivalent to the origin of a Chaos Venerable, equal to facing a Chaos Venerable's full-power attack. Even a peak Sovereign realm being would be instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Even though a supreme being's inner universe was large enough, the amount of life they could take away was still limited.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current population of human civilization, if a supreme being could take away one millionth, it would already be extremely difficult. Any more would reduce the possibility of surviving the great collapse tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"I can take away 1% of the current human race population," Lin Yuan said after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>"One percent?" </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being's pupils constricted. As one of the former twelve peak racial powers, how enormous was the population of human civilization? Even just 1% was an incredibly vast number, trillions upon trillions of trillions.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, ensuring our human race can migrate as completely as possible is important, but your safety is even more important. As long as you're still here, human civilization will still exist," </p><p></p><p>The Xiaqin supreme being said with slight worry.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a peak Dao Opener realm could safely survive the great universe collapse, provided the number of lives they carried did not exceed the limit.</p><p></p><p>But 1% of the current human civilization population? That far exceeded the limit. If a peak Dao Opener realm dared to carry so many lives, they would face the final targeted destruction of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings also looked at Lin Yuan. While they certainly wanted more humans to survive, they were even more unwilling for Lin Yuan to encounter any accidents in the upcoming universe collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. His inner universe was still growing every moment, and would reach the limit of 8 million light-years in radius in a few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation of such an inner universe, plus Lin Yuan's various methods, blocking the corresponding level of universe collapse tribulation shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Lin Yuan could break through to the Sovereign realm in the next few hundred years, his inner universe would transform again, and he could carry even more of the human race.</p><p></p><p>But advancing from Dao Opener realm to Sovereign realm required Lin Yuan to grow to his limits in all aspects, not just his inner universe. Lin Yuan wasn't confident he could break through to Sovereign realm within a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This thousand years referred to a thousand years within the universe. If it was in the Chaos Void, or in that Origin World, it would only be two or three years.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being nodded, then looked at the other eight supreme beings, "Then we'll leave first to arrange the upcoming matters."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>Even if everything went smoothly, 99% of humans would still die in the face of the impending universe collapse.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan luckily broke through to the Sovereign realm before the universe collapse arrived, at most he could only carry ten times more humans. 90% of humans would still have to die.</p><p></p><p>"My strength... is still too weak."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. If he were a Chaos Great Saint, the battle between Shadow Fiend Great Saint and Nine Phoenix Great Saint wouldn't be able to shake the area he wanted to protect at all.</p><p></p><p>The aftermath of the battle between two Great Saints could make a Chaos realm being like Ancient Ming Venerable retreat early, but for Great Saints of the same level, it wouldn't amount to much.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan advanced further, becoming a peerless Great Saint like the owner of the Demon Jade Tower or Xuanhuang Majesty, then no matter how great the hatred between Shadow Fiend Great Saint and Nine Phoenix Great Saint was,</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't dare to make even a slightly big disturbance when passing near Lin Yuan's territory, let alone engage in battle.</p><p></p><p>Whether inside the universe or in the Chaos Void outside, strength was supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign realm..." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Sovereign realm, in the eyes of almost all other Dao Opener realms, the most difficult part was the comprehension of various rules, as well as the corresponding mental will.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had already met all these standards. For Lin Yuan, the Sovereign realm was merely a matter of time. He only needed his physical body, soul, and inner universe to naturally reach their limits in all aspects, and then he could break through.</p><p></p><p>Origin World, Qingfen Domain, Yu Family.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The injuries have mostly recovered."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked inside his body. The injuries caused by the unique dark energy corrosion of the Dongyang family had now recovered 90%.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation system of this Origin World..."</p><p></p><p>Various pieces of information floated in Lin Yuan's mind. The most important was that the cultivation paths of the Yu family, the Dongyang family, and even that Qingfen Marquis all originated from the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was a behemoth that the original Yu Yan had heard about since childhood. It was said that the ancestor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was that eternal blazing sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal blazing sun?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his head slightly. Even separated by who knows how much time and space, he could still feel the terrifying nature of that blazing sun in the sky. It was at least far beyond the feeling the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent gave him.</p><p></p><p>"If this eternal blazing sun really is the transformed ancestor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, then what realm is he? Chaos Great Saint? Peerless Great Saint? Or is he a thirteenth-order eternal life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even compared to the images left behind by Xuan Emperor and the owner of the Demon Jade Tower, that eternal blazing sun was far superior.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the eternal blazing sun that Lin Yuan sensed was only an insignificant part of its full power, and the same was true for the images of Xuan Emperor and the owner of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't be directly compared.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"It's too far ahead to think about these things now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts and began to look at the surrounding time and space. An excited expression appeared on his face. "The time and space of this Origin World exhibit a completely different direction from the main universe and the Chaos Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the minutiae of time and space, while comparing them with the time and space of the main universe and the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Hum! Hum!!</p><p></p><p>Countless flashes of insight surged in Lin Yuan's mind, as he felt his comprehension of time and space improving in a terrifying manner.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

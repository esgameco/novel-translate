        <h1>Chapter 667</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, the precious treasure produced in this seat, taking the form of golden mist.</p><p></p><p>Hence it was named the 'Golden Mist'.</p><p></p><p>The treasure lands mastered by the six great ancient nations were basically named after the rare treasures they produced.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Black Jade's Nest was named after the 'Black Jade' it produced.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Celestial Overlord of the Silver River."</p><p></p><p>More than ten powerful experts from the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation reverently saluted Lin Yuan upon entering the Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>"You may rise."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of these powerful experts from the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation coming here was to establish a spatial-temporal transmission array within the Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was also a defensive formation enveloping the entire treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Every treasure land controlled by the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation was arranged in this manner.</p><p></p><p>Establishing a spatial-temporal transmission array connecting to the national capital, so that in times of crisis, they could receive timely support from the powerful experts in the national capital.</p><p></p><p>Although the Golden Mist Treasure Land belonged to Lin Yuan, it was still nominally under the control of the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation, so they could do this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan readily accepted it. With his strength, he was certainly not worried about any dangers to the Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>But establishing the spatial-temporal transmission array connecting to the national capital would greatly convenience him.</p><p></p><p>At least he wouldn't have to spend time traveling back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Mist Treasure Land was located in the desolate region outside the six great ancient nations, and the distance to the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation was extremely far. Even with Lin Yuan's mastery of spatial-temporal control, a round trip would still take a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Having the spatial-temporal transmission array would make it much less troublesome.</p><p></p><p>As for deploying the defensive formation enveloping the entire treasure land, it also saved Lin Yuan a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Overlord of the Silver River, I wonder where the spatial-temporal transmission array should be established," asked one of the formation masters from the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>After the treasure land manifested, the spatial-temporal environment would rapidly contract, but to what extent, only the controller of the treasure land would know.</p><p></p><p>So the establishment area of the spatial-temporal transmission array was still decided by the controller of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>This could also avoid the situation of establishing the spatial-temporal transmission array outside the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Any area within this range is fine," Lin Yuan focused and outlined a general area.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the more than ten formation masters of the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation began to get busy.</p><p></p><p>Establishing the spatial-temporal transmission array was easy, but deploying the defensive formation enveloping the entire treasure land required careful planning.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial-temporal Transmission Array"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a while, and the first thing the more than ten formation masters did was to establish the spatial-temporal transmission array, as it was the simplest.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal transmission arrays of the Ancient Blazing Sun Nation and the six great ancient nations all had a unified "template", with the spatial-temporal crystal as the core.</p><p></p><p>The key point was the spatial-temporal crystal.</p><p></p><p>Each spatial-temporal crystal was a complete individual entity.</p><p></p><p>If it was divided into two halves, no matter how far apart, they would still maintain a connection.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal transmission array was built upon this connection to establish a spatial-temporal channel, realizing long-distance traversal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the method of locking this connection was borrowed from the techniques left behind by the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of transmission method can only be practiced by those special existences in the Chaotic Void," Lin Yuan thought. He had to admit, the six great ancient nations of this source world were much more "advanced" than the Chaotic Void, with thirteenth-tier techniques everywhere.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, the thirteenth-tier time-life beings were highly superior, and they had almost no impact on the masses, only the most cultivated great saints would try to trace their footsteps.</p><p></p><p>But in the six great ancient nations? The thirteenth-tier ancestors were right there, and as long as one joined a certain ancient nation, they would have the opportunity to come into contact with the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention actually seeing the ancestors, at least they could obtain the opportunity to cultivate the legacies left behind by the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Chaotic Profundity Diagram, which originated from the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The merit required for the Chaotic Profundity Diagram representing the third realm was indeed very high.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaotic Profundity Diagrams representing the first and second realms were relatively affordable.</p><p></p><p>Most Exalted-level experts could accumulate the required merit.</p><p></p><p>"These rare treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan no longer paid attention to the formation masters and began to take stock of his gains.</p><p></p><p>In order to exchange for the foundation weapons of their respective ancient nations, except for the Savage Ancient Nation, the four great ancient nations had been severely plundered by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Great Abyss Ancient Nation, from which Lin Yuan had obtained nearly a hundred pounds of Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Abyss Blood was rarely circulated to the other five great ancient nations, as the Great Abyss Ancient Nation had kept it tightly guarded.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the purpose of exchanging for his own foundation weapon, Lin Yuan would not have forced the other party to hand over so much Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Abyss Ancient Nation had the Great Abyss Ancestor, a thirteenth-tier being, as its guardian. Even if Lin Yuan was an Invincible Celestial Overlord, at most he could only make the Great Abyss Ancient Nation keep a lower profile, but to do anything more outrageous? That was beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see why the Dragon Abyss Blood is so precious."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and a jade bottle appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>As the jade bottle tilted slightly, a drop of extremely pure blood appeared, with star-like points of light constantly interweaving within it.</p><p></p><p>This drop of Dragon Abyss Blood was not just a drop of fresh blood, but a world in itself, containing the operation of many Dao of Principles.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable, remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, greatly amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To integrate the Dao of Principles into the flesh and blood, allowing every particle of the body to contain a world, if one were to unleash their full power, how terrifying would the power be?</p><p></p><p>"The first life form born after the creation of this source world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about the origin of the Dragon Abyss Blood, and through this drop of fresh blood, he vaguely sensed the terrifying power of this primordial life form.</p><p></p><p>Each particle of the body containing a world? Even if the power of a single world was far inferior to the universe within Lin Yuan's body, the sheer number of them was overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>Quantitative change leading to qualitative change was not an absurd notion.</p><p></p><p>"This primordial life form, even if its strength is not as great as mine, it must surpass the so-called strongest Celestial Overlords. How did it die?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious. Particles containing worlds, equivalent to each particle being a separate individual, able to easily form avatars or clones.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful being, even if all the strongest Celestial Overlords of the source world surrounded and attacked it, they would not be able to kill and extinguish it.</p><p></p><p>But the origin of the Dragon Abyss Valley clearly indicated that this life form had perished.</p><p></p><p>Only the complete dissipation of its true spirit could have produced this kind of place that could continuously nurture Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Abyss Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily deduced that it was related to the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Only a thirteenth-tier Ancestor could easily slay such an existence.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Great Abyss Ancestor had a great enmity with this primordial life form," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancestor not only completely destroyed this primordial life form, but also gathered its true spirit and bloodline to form the Dragon Blood Valley, this precious land.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the countless life forms nurtured by the Dragon Blood Valley to be perpetually raised and harvested by the powerful experts of the Great Abyss Ancient Nation, extracting and refining their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>And the life forms nurtured by the Dragon Blood Valley were, in the strict sense, the descendants of that primordial life form.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let's try to absorb and refine it first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan no longer thought much about it and immediately began to refine this drop of Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>Most of his spiritual focus was on comprehending the operation of the source world's fundamental principles, and the remaining bit of his spiritual focus was used to refine the Dragon Abyss Blood, without affecting or delaying anything.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic qi drifted, and two figures appeared silently, quietly observing the distant void.</p><p></p><p>These two figures, with their auras concealed, but the fundamental laws governing the operation of the Chaotic Void began to yield, revealing that they were two peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the location where the Demon Shadow and Nine Phoenixes last appeared." The left peerless Great Saint was a bald figure, and his expression was solemn as he surveyed the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Great Saints of Demon Shadow and Nine Phoenixes are newly ascended, it is quite strange that their fates have completely disappeared." The peerless Great Saint on the right frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>The complete disappearance of fate can only have two possibilities:</p><p></p><p>One is to undergo reincarnation, abandoning everything and starting anew.</p><p></p><p>The other is to be completely annihilated, with all the methods of preserving one's true body, manifestation, and incarnations being extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The two peerless Great Saints were aware of the enmity between the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes and the Great Saint of Demon Shadow. If the Great Saint of Demon Shadow had actively reincarnated to escape the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes, and their fates had completely disappeared, it would not be a strange occurrence.</p><p></p><p>But for these two newly ascended Great Saints to have their fates disappear simultaneously? This was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that these two newly ascended Great Saints have both reincarnated? If they have not both reincarnated, then they must have been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>That would be even more unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>To have two Chaotic Great Saints be completely annihilated at the same time?</p><p></p><p>At least the peerless Great Saints could not accomplish that.</p><p></p><p>"Rahu Great Saint has instructed us to investigate this matter, and it is indeed necessary."</p><p></p><p>The bald figure standing on the right said.</p><p></p><p>They did not pay much attention to these two newly ascended Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>But the complete disappearance of these two newly ascended Chaotic Great Saints was enough to raise their vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"Rahu Great Saint has cultivated that lineage, and he is about to reign over the Chaotic Void, earning the title of 'Invincible'. What he has instructed us to do is certainly not just empty words."</p><p></p><p>The peerless Great Saint on the left nodded.</p><p></p><p>Rahu Great Saint was an extremely ancient Great Saint who had been cultivating a Thirteenth-Tier lineage. If he were to reach the peak of his cultivation, he would sweep through the Chaotic Void, overwhelming many peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, the peerless Great Saints, had inadvertently approached Rahu Great Saint's secluded abode, and after a brief confrontation, they had become aware of his terrifying power, and thus had willingly followed and served him.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try to reverse the flow of time and see."</p><p></p><p>The bald figure's eyes faintly revealed the reversal of time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the bald figure stopped, frowning and saying, "The time-space is completely chaotic, and I can't see anything."</p><p></p><p>The so-called reversal of time refers to the ability to reproduce the images of past events, but this image can be interfered with.</p><p></p><p>"Me too," the peerless Great Saint on the left nodded, as he had also tried to reverse time, but with no discoveries.</p><p></p><p>"Now, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The peerless Great Saint on the left looked at the bald figure.</p><p></p><p>"We must complete the task Rahu Great Saint has entrusted us with."</p><p></p><p>The bald figure thought for a moment and then spoke, "Let's start by investigating the fates of Demon Shadow and Nine Phoenixes themselves, and see who their enemies are."</p><p></p><p>"There's no other choice."</p><p></p><p>The peerless Great Saint on the left sighed.</p><p></p><p>This method, although effective, is extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Great Saints roam through countless void domains, and the resulting fates are innumerable.</p><p></p><p>To investigate them one by one would be too tedious.</p><p></p><p>Whether they can ultimately uncover anything is also unknown.</p><p></p><p>But now, this is the only method they can use to follow the clues.</p><p></p><p>Even if they cannot find anything in the end, at least they can report back to Rahu Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, in the capital of the Blazing Sun Nation, in the Silver River Palace, Lin Yuan and the Crimson Flame Venerable were sitting face to face.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River, calculating the time, today should be the day when the merits are determined." Crimson Flame Venerable smiled at Lin Yuan and said, "Considering your performance in the battle for the treasure land, the merits you have earned must be terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Will the fact that the Emperor has given me the treasure land affect the merit determination?" Lin Yuan looked at Crimson Flame Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"That's a separate matter." Crimson Flame Venerable said, "The final result is that the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation has obtained this treasure land. As for who the treasure land belongs to, it is not within the scope of merit determination."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>As the top Venerable of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, Crimson Flame Venerable had experienced countless wars between ancient nations, and he had a lot of experience in merit determination.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with your strength, Silver River Venerable, earning merits is too easy for you." Crimson Flame Venerable laughed.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Venerables, earning merits is a difficult task, and they can only accumulate them through a series of local wars.</p><p></p><p>Venerables are better off, as they can guard treasure lands and have a stable channel to acquire merits, but even for them, it takes a lot of time and effort to accumulate the necessary merits for their desired inheritances and treasures.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan is willing, earning merits is not difficult. He can often go to the borders of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation and the other five ancient nations, intimidate them, and he will be able to accumulate a large amount of merits.</p><p></p><p>If he were to initiate a war, and Lin Yuan were to intervene and end the war, the merits he would earn would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the other ancient nations are not fools either. After clearly understanding the existence of the invincible Venerable Lin Yuan, they would certainly not start a war, and would choose to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, for the contention of a newly born treasure land, how many merits would be granted?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure." Crimson Flame Venerable thought for a moment, "This treasure land is not an ordinary first-grade treasure land, but a top-tier first-grade treasure land. The specifics will depend on the decision of the Elders."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation was ruled by the Emperor, but the main decisions were made through the deliberation of the Elders.</p><p></p><p>"The merits have been granted."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Crimson Flame Venerable's expression changed as he received a message from the ancient nation.</p><p></p><p>"I have earned 2,320,000 merits." Crimson Flame Venerable immediately said, his expression slightly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>2,320,000 merits, compared to the acquisition of a top-tier first-grade treasure land, is not high. But it should be understood that Crimson Flame Venerable did not exert much effort in the contention for this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The most brutal stage of the treasure land contention, the final decisive battle, almost did not occur, as it was all resolved by Lin Yuan single-handedly defeating the other ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, to still have over 2 million merits, Crimson Flame Venerable was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This is equivalent to earning 2,320,000 merits in 2,000 years.</p><p></p><p>This ratio of time to merits earned is terrifyingly high.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the average merits earned from guarding a first-grade treasure land, when calculated over 2,000 years, would only be in the single digits.</p><p></p><p>"Heng Yang, Guang Le, and the others have also earned between 1 million to 2 million merits." Crimson Flame Venerable said, as the other Venerables who participated in the battle had also informed him of the merits they had earned.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat there and also received a message from the ancient nation.</p><p></p><p>"3.6 billion merits?" Lin Yuan looked at the change in his merit 'balance' with some astonishment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

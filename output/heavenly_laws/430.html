            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 430 Anticipation (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Why do I have a feeling that I'm facing another ultimate existence?" </p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme was startled. This was the perception unique to supreme beings, only arising when facing existences of the same level.</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme would experience this perception when interacting with the other eight supreme beings. </p><p></p><p>He would also sense this when dealing with the ultimates of other races.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>An extremely young cultivator who had just entered the tenth stage?</p><p></p><p>Actually gave the Summer Qin Supreme a similar feeling?</p><p></p><p>If the Summer Qin Supreme wasn't personally experiencing this, he would never believe it.</p><p></p><p>It was too absurd.</p><p></p><p>"What's the reason?"</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual will? The Galactic Sovereign's spiritual will exceeds the 18 million spiritual will index threshold, no, not just exceeds it, but exceeds it by a large margin."</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme's thought process was extremely fast, immediately deducing the most likely reason.</p><p></p><p>First, this was a virtual world, whether it was Lin Yuan or the Summer Qin Supreme himself, they were both condensed from a strand of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this was the Summer Qin Supreme's personal world. Without his permission, even other supreme beings could not exert any power here.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the feeling Lin Yuan gave the Summer Qin Supreme completely stemmed from the strength of his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Only by having a spiritual will that crossed into the supreme being realm could one give the Summer Qin Supreme such a feeling.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Having the spiritual will strength of a supreme being?</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme didn't know how to describe it.</p><p></p><p>A tenth stage life form? Possessing a supreme being's spiritual will strength?</p><p></p><p>Could this still be called a tenth stage life form?</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being?" Lin Yuan also sensed the Summer Qin Supreme's repeated gazes of scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when he came to visit the Summer Qin Supreme, the latter would have already started asking questions.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has sensed the strength of my spiritual will," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable. Although Lin Yuan's spiritual will had reached the twelfth stage, his realm was still the tenth stage, so he couldn't perfectly conceal it in front of a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't come to visit the Summer Qin Supreme, when he was about to break through to the eleventh stage, the supreme being avatars would descend and discover it as well.</p><p></p><p>After being silent for a while, the Summer Qin Supreme directly started asking.</p><p></p><p>When the spiritual will index exceeded one million points, it became difficult to quantify precisely.</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme only felt that Lin Yuan's spiritual will index had definitely reached the twelfth stage realm, and it wasn't just at the initial level.</p><p></p><p>"More or less," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his spiritual will index had reached 33.4 million points, but it was indeed over 20 million.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>After getting Lin Yuan's confirmation, the Summer Qin Supreme didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>A prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Too much of a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Just at the tenth stage, yet in terms of spiritual will he had crossed into the twelfth stage realm. Could a human cultivator really achieve this?</p><p></p><p>Compared to other talents and aptitudes, spiritual will was the most impossible to take shortcuts with. In the cosmos, even those uniquely special lifeforms with noble bloodlines, while their physical bodies and souls were extraordinarily superior, their spiritual will still had to start from the beginning. The stronger physical body and soul would nurture a more powerful spiritual will, but it absolutely did not have the overwhelming advantage that it did in the physical and soul aspects.</p><p></p><p>"I had an epiphany regarding spiritual will during a period of seclusion not long ago," Lin Yuan stated the reason he had prepared beforehand.</p><p></p><p>Besides slowly increasing over an extremely long period of time through experiences, spiritual will could also be rapidly enhanced through "epiphanies."</p><p></p><p>This "epiphany" referred to an epiphany about the operation of the cosmos and the myriad things in nature.</p><p></p><p>However, such occurrences were rare and had not happened many times since the beginning of the cosmos. Even when they did occur, it was mostly among lower-stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>For example, a fourth or fifth stage lifeform occasionally having an epiphany, causing their spiritual will index to directly soar from a few hundred to a few thousand.</p><p></p><p>Or some indigenous lifeforms on primitive planets, without undergoing any cultivation, having a spiritual will index approaching 10,000.</p><p></p><p>But for someone like Lin Yuan to have his spiritual will index directly exceed 20 million points after an "epiphany," it was estimated that had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>"Epiphany..." The Summer Qin Supreme fell silent again. He vaguely guessed that Lin Yuan's spiritual will increasing so drastically was probably not as simple as an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>However, this was Lin Yuan's own secret, and the Summer Qin Supreme would not pry.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan entered the tenth stage, triggering the infusion of primal chaos from the void and tearing apart cosmic rifts spanning light-years, the Summer Qin Supreme knew that Lin Yuan possessed his own extraordinary opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Regarding such matters, the Summer Qin Supreme wouldn't even ask.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual will... The stronger, the better, naturally," the Summer Qin Supreme said slowly after pondering for a while.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level of a cultivator, the more they could feel the importance of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>First to sixth stage cultivators probably didn't even know what spiritual will was.</p><p></p><p>But by the seventh stage, especially when breaking through from the seventh to the eighth stage, one of the prerequisites was having a spiritual will index of 10,000 points, only then could one safely pass the demonic tribulation.</p><p></p><p>From the eighth stage onward, the influence of spiritual will became greater and greater. When charging towards the ultimate at the eleventh stage, one needed a spiritual will index of millions of points.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the importance of spiritual will was far greater than that.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the eleventh stage human cultivators or the eleventh stage experts of other races, their physical bodies and souls would no longer decay.</p><p></p><p>But why did they still need to slow down the flow of time to extend their longevity?</p><p></p><p>In theory, eleventh stage lifeforms' physical bodies and souls should have no longevity limit.</p><p></p><p>However, the longer they lived, even if their physical bodies and souls had no issues, their own spiritual will would still become distorted.</p><p></p><p>Once the spiritual will became distorted and insane, true death would not be far away.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the importance of having a powerful spiritual will became apparent.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's spiritual will, the better it could resist this distortion and insanity.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current spiritual will strength, he could easily live through an entire cosmic cycle.</p><p></p><p>If not for the eventual destruction of the cosmos, the drying up and collapse of the river of time that would cause all lifeforms in the long river to inevitably die, Lin Yuan could even live through multiple cosmic cycles.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, a powerful spiritual will had far-reaching effects in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being, I came this time to prepare for my breakthrough to the eleventh stage," Lin Yuan brought up the main purpose for visiting the Summer Qin Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to the eleventh stage?" The Summer Qin Supreme immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>He had already guessed that Lin Yuan was here for this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as they met, he was stunned by Lin Yuan's terrifying spiritual will, which was why he still hadn't recovered his composure until now.</p><p></p><p>"When are you planning to break through?" The Summer Qin Supreme asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Within these few months," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>For such a breakthrough, he naturally had to choose the time when his state was at its peak.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current adjustment speed, it would take a few more months.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the Summer Qin Supreme nodded.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I will call upon them to jointly protect the Dharma for you."</p><p></p><p>The Summer Qin Supreme's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The "them" he referred to were naturally the other nine supreme beings of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>A couple of hundred years ago, when Lin Yuan broke through to the tenth stage, the commotion was so great that the Summer Qin Supreme had not anticipated it at all.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for forcibly borrowing the power of a supreme being, aided by the Butterfly Supreme Being's assistance, with the combined power of the Summer Qin Supreme's avatar at that time, the other racial supreme beings might have detected the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Summer Qin Supreme had learned his lesson and would directly call upon the other eight supreme beings of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>With the power of nine supreme beings, even protecting the Dharma for Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the eleventh stage and charging towards the ultimate would be more than enough.</p><p></p><p>So the Summer Qin Supreme felt he was well-prepared this time.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, my true self will keep watch over the Galactic Sovereign Star. You can break through without worry," the Summer Qin Supreme added.</p><p></p><p>The true selves of the nine supreme beings of the human civilization were all stationed at key nodes of their domains, deterring the supreme beings of other races.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan's breakthrough this time, the Summer Qin Supreme had already prepared to mobilize his true self at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring Lin Yuan's successful entry into the eleventh stage was currently the most important matter for the human civilization, and any price paid for this would be acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the Summer Qin Supreme mobilized his true self, the other races would most likely not...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"He would not make any excessive moves, unless he wanted to provoke an all-out war, otherwise he would basically maintain a certain balance."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Strongest One," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was the benefit of relying on a powerful force. Before fully maturing, unless he intentionally wanted to temper himself, everything would be smooth sailing. With Lin Yuan's talents, he would not expend any effort on matters other than breaking through.</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me," the Strongest One Xia Qin shook his head slightly. If other peak civilizations in the universe knew that the human civilization had birthed such a monstrous genius like Lin Yuan, they would probably go insane with jealousy.</p><p></p><p>"With your current strength, you should consider assaulting the Ultimate realm."</p><p></p><p>"For an eleventh-stage life to make the final leap to the Ultimate, external help can provide assistance but is far from being the determining factor," the Strongest One Xia Qin rarely gave such a reminder.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization did have treasures and methods to aid in assaulting the Ultimate realm, such as that "Cosmic Origin."</p><p></p><p>But to cross into the twelfth stage and become a Strongest One, one had to rely mainly on oneself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>So far, the most critical treasure Lin Yuan possessed for assaulting the Ultimate was the "Heart of Space-Time."</p><p></p><p>This was prepared by the Master of the Devil Jade Tower for his personal disciple, which could extend the period of the final leap to the Ultimate, freeing one from the constraints of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the "Cosmic Origin," the effect of the "Heart of Space-Time" was much greater.</p><p></p><p>"Good that you understand," the Strongest One Xia Qin nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, such words were usually spoken to eleventh-stage perfected evolutions of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>For an eleventh-stage perfected evolution, who was only one step away from assaulting the Ultimate, receiving such reminders was only normal.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan, who was at the tenth stage?</p><p></p><p>"Strongest One, there is one more matter," Lin Yuan spoke to the Strongest One Xia Qin in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Speak," the Strongest One Xia Qin smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I want to comprehend that twelfth-stage corporeal body itself."</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, that corporeal body was only a projection.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly comprehend all the paths of Demonic Evolution, he still needed to face and comprehend the original corporeal body.</p><p></p><p>If this was before his tenth transcendence, Lin Yuan would definitely not have done this so easily. Facing the remnant of a twelfth-stage life directly posed great risks to any life below the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>"That corporeal body, ah..."</p><p></p><p>"You... you should have no problem," the Strongest One Xia Qin was about to say whether Lin Yuan could withstand the mental will pressure emanating from the corporeal body itself.</p><p></p><p>But then he realized that with Lin Yuan's Strongest One level mental will, the mental will pressure from that remnant corporeal body itself posed no threat to a Strongest One of the same level.</p><p></p><p>This had also been repeatedly confirmed by the nine Strongest Ones of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Xia Qin had even comprehended that remnant for a period of time, thoroughly understanding most of the paths of Demonic Evolution.</p><p></p><p>The only pity was that the conditions for Strongest Ones to join the Devil Jade Tower were completely different from those for seventh and eighth stage lives.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Strongest One thoroughly comprehended all the paths of Demonic Evolution within the remnant, they could not become even the most ordinary disciple of the Devil Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Compared to seventh and eighth stage lives comprehending the paths of Demonic Evolution, it was far too simple for Strongest Ones.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the Devil Jade Tower recruited Strongest One level lives, it had a different set of standards for evaluation, presided over by the Master of the Devil Jade Tower personally.</p><p></p><p>But the Master of the Devil Jade Tower had disappeared for countless eons of the universe, so it was basically impossible for Strongest Ones to join the Devil Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>"However, you still need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"If you detect any abnormality, immediately withdraw," the Strongest One Xia Qin pondered repeatedly, confirming that there were no risks for Lin Yuan, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"I have granted you access. You only need to go to the thirteenth critical ground, and someone will guide you there," the Strongest One Xia Qin closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them and spoke to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization had twenty-two critical grounds in total. That corporeal body came from the Devil Jade Tower of the chaotic void forces, and was highly valued by the nine Strongest Ones of the human civilization, who had specifically placed it within the thirteenth critical ground.</p><p></p><p>"The thirteenth critical ground," Lin Yuan nodded. Previously, under the guidance of the Strongest One Butterfly, he had visited a towering palace where several Strongest Ones were present - that was the third critical ground of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"How many merit points do I need to pay?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending treasures of the twelfth stage level always required paying merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's black planet space of guidance required one billion merit points to enter once.</p><p></p><p>Across all twelve spaces of guidance, one full cycle cost twelve billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of the spaces of guidance was the fusion of the quadruple boundary of rules, which was at the eleventh stage level.</p><p></p><p>"Since that corporeal body is just sitting there with no one comprehending it, you going to comprehend it won't affect anything, so no merit points are needed," the Strongest One Xia Qin waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>He could have charged merit points, but for such a small matter, with his authority as a Strongest One, he could choose to charge or not.</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Xia Qin didn't care about those merit points.</p><p></p><p>So he simply couldn't be bothered to charge them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Strongest One," Lin Yuan expressed his gratitude again, understanding that this was the Strongest One Xia Qin's favor towards him.</p><p></p><p>After conversing with the Strongest One Xia Qin for a few more sentences, Lin Yuan bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>Watching Lin Yuan disappear from the personal world, the Strongest One Xia Qin fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a figure materialized out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Strongest One Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, have you gone mad? To actually allow the Galactic Sovereign to comprehend that corporeal body?" The Strongest One Butterfly frowned.</p><p></p><p>As the creator of the virtual world, the Strongest One Butterfly naturally knew about this first, which was why she appeared immediately.</p><p></p><p>As a Strongest One, Butterfly was well aware of the impact that remnant corporeal body could have on lives below the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from the fact that until now, not a single eleventh-stage evolved life had dared to comprehend that corporeal body.</p><p></p><p>Those seventh and eighth stage little fellows only comprehended a true projection of the original corporeal body, enduring a mental will pressure far less than directly facing the original corporeal body itself.</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Butterfly could never have imagined that the Strongest One Xia Qin would make such a decision.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Sovereign was the most powerful genius the human civilization had ever produced, with the hope of becoming the tenth Strongest One. To allow such an infinitely talented prodigy to comprehend that corporeal body?</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Butterfly could not understand.</p><p></p><p>"Butterfly, you don't need to worry," the Strongest One Xia Qin looked at Butterfly and began to explain, "The Galactic Sovereign's talents are even beyond our expectations."</p><p></p><p>"Talents are talents, but the Galactic Sovereign is only at the tenth stage now. Even if he has the potential to withstand the source mental will pressure from that corporeal body, that would be after stepping into the twelfth stage. Have you really thought through the consequences of letting him comprehend it now?" The Strongest One Butterfly said.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Sovereign was an evolved being from Xia You's evolutionary tower, so in theory the Strongest One Xia Qin had the authority to guide him.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Sovereign's talents were too monstrous. As a fellow evolved being of the human civilization, Butterfly's evolutionary path would not allow the Strongest One Xia Qin to ruin such an unparalleled genius of humanity.</p><p></p><p>"After the twelfth stage..."</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Xia Qin's expression became somewhat strange, but eventually he shook his head, "No need to wait that long, he can withstand it now."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" The Strongest One Butterfly was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign's mental will has already reached the twelfth stage level," the Strongest One Xia Qin stated directly without beating around the bush.</p><p></p><p>"Mental will reaching the twelfth stage level..."</p><p></p><p>The Strongest One Butterfly also fell silent. She extended a strand of her mental will, using her virtual world authority to lock onto the mental will avatar that Lin Yuan had just manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, over 1.8 billion points of mental will index, or to be precise, at least over 2 billion points of mental will index," the Strongest One Butterfly's pupils constricted sharply, finding it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that right?" The Strongest One Xia Qin gazed at Butterfly with great satisfaction, as if seeing his former self.</p><p></p><p>"How could a tenth stage life have such powerful mental will?" The Strongest One Butterfly muttered to herself. If Lin Yuan's mental will was so formidable, then comprehending that corporeal body would pose no problems.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was only a remnant corporeal body that had fallen for who knows how long. Being able to retain some mental will pressure was already remarkable, coupled with the suppression from the nine Strongest Ones of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan could withstand the mental will pressure, there would be no hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows," the Strongest One Xia Qin shook his head, his face showing anticipation. "But now I'm even more curious about what heights this little fellow can reach in the future."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Consciousness began to revive. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gradually took over the ancestral golden body.</p><p></p><p>"Returned to the Azure World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split off a strand of spiritual force and merged it into the Demon Tree, "The injuries of the Primordial Demon Tree are so severe?"</p><p></p><p>With just a preliminary perception, Lin Yuan discovered that the injuries of the Primordial Demon Tree had already affected its roots. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not have used the words "life or death" to describe the situation of the Azure World in the call for help.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't have much impact."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Long ago when nurturing the ancestral golden body, the Primordial Demon Tree was no longer very important to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the ancestral golden body was formed, it reached the eighth level, surpassing the peak period of the Primordial Demon Tree. After being nurtured for over a hundred thousand years, it had already stepped halfway into the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, as long as Lin Yuan was given half an incense stick's time, he could successfully take over the ancestral golden body.</p><p></p><p>He would immediately possess the foundational strength of the ninth level. Adding his profound comprehension of the rules and mastery of power application, he could even sweep across beings of the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>In a life-or-death struggle with all his trump cards out, he could even unleash the power of the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>After being nurtured in this realm for tens of millions of years, the ancestral golden body's foundation had become inconceivably profound.</p><p></p><p>Especially with Lin Yuan, the ancestor of martial arts, taking it over, he could fully unleash every ounce of its power.</p><p></p><p>The two combined would far exceed the effect of a simple one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind merged into the Primordial Demon Tree, beginning to receive detailed information from the past tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Although by relying on his connection with the Primordial Demon Tree, Lin Yuan could receive messages from it even when in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>However, those messages were extremely simplified, often describing major events of tens of millions of years with just a single sentence.</p><p></p><p>After all, separated by different dimensions, even with the Realm Gate acting as a 'transfer', transmitting information was extremely difficult and forced to be concise.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was unaware of many details.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Azure World attracted the attention and even invasion of those two outer demons. No, it shouldn't have been the idea of those two outer demons, but rather the 'Lord' behind them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thought process was incredibly fast. After just over ten breaths, he had fully understood everything that had happened over the past tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Especially the means used by those two outer demons to severely injure the Primordial Demon Tree and tear open the barrier of the Azure World - it absolutely came from an even more powerful outer demon.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence Lin Yuan had gained, in the boundless void space near the Azure World, the strongest outer demon had established a force called the 'Black Demon Pavilion', calling itself the Lord of the Black Demon Pavilion, commanding a large number of outer demons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in even more distant boundless void space, there also existed other powerful outer demons that had established their own forces or gathering places, dominating their own territories.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past tens of millions of years, the Azure World's source, under my influence, has at least become ten times stronger."</p><p></p><p>Through the Primordial Demon Tree's perspective, Lin Yuan gazed at the vast source of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>After replacing the Azure World's Heavenly Dao, Lin Yuan had deliberately begun adjusting it, making the flow of the world's source more perfect and complete.</p><p></p><p>Later, after ending his journey and returning to the main universe, Lin Yuan would still command the Primordial Demon Tree to adjust the operation of the entire Azure World's source.</p><p></p><p>With his incredible comprehension, Lin Yuan observed the operation of the main universe, then applied it to the Azure World, causing the Azure World to move closer to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>What an existence the main universe was! Not to mention the Azure World, even the boundless void space paled in comparison to its vastness. The efficiency of the main universe's source operation was naturally far beyond that of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>With the Azure World imitating the main universe's source operation, the difference might not be apparent in the short term, but over tens of thousands or even tens of millions of years, the gap would naturally emerge.</p><p></p><p>This led to the current Azure World's source being ten times stronger than tens of millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>And this was established on the basis that Lin Yuan had greatly expended the world's source to nurture the ancestral golden body. Otherwise, the gap was probably dozens or even nearly a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>Such changes in the Azure World naturally attracted the attention of the surrounding outer demons.</p><p></p><p>Originally, with the Azure World's weak source and the Primordial Demon Tree guarding it, even if those outer demons had ideas, they would not act, as they could not take it over without going through a brutal battle.</p><p></p><p>But a Azure World with a source ten times stronger was different.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, it was likely that the 'Lord of the Black Demon Pavilion' wanted to figure out why the Azure World had undergone such changes in just a short span of tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>If they could grasp this kind of change, wouldn't the efficiency of devouring the source of other worlds increase greatly in the future?</p><p></p><p>This was also the key reason why the Azure World was invaded.</p><p></p><p>If it were just the original Azure World, it would not have attracted the attention of the 'Lord of the Black Demon Pavilion'.</p><p></p><p>"Although invaded, there were hardly any casualties among the beings of this realm."</p><p></p><p>Through the Primordial Demon Tree's perspective, Lin Yuan, embodying the Heavenly Dao, observed every detail of this world.</p><p></p><p>Mainly, the Primordial Demon Tree had promptly issued orders for the beings of the Azure World to gather around it in advance.</p><p></p><p>By borrowing the Primordial Demon Tree's own power for protection, the vast majority of the Azure World's forces were preserved.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as time passed and those two outer demons continued infiltrating, the Primordial Demon Tree's injuries became more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that the damage to the beings of the Azure World would begin to soar.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The sacrificial rite has ended?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned slightly towards the main hall, where countless believers respectfully stood up, and the world's aura resonated, faintly surging into the golden body.</p><p></p><p>These surging world auras were the source power of the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Over the past tens of millions of years, with each sacrificial rite, it was the process of the ancestral golden body absorbing the world's source. The vast world's source allowed the ancestral golden body's foundation to become unimaginably profound.</p><p></p><p>"There's still half an incense stick's time before I can fully control this fleshly body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully felt the myriad wonders of the ancestral golden body. This was the strongest fleshly body he had personally nurtured for himself, so he was naturally extremely satisfied with it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's control ability, he could control this body now, but that would produce some negligible flaws. There was no need for that at all.</p><p></p><p>Currently, in the mortal realm of the Azure World, although ravaged by the power of those two demon beings, the roots had not yet been affected. Lin Yuan could still wait this short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Inside the martial hall.</p><p></p><p>A large number of believers and martial cultivators gradually left.</p><p></p><p>Only the great priest of the martial hall remained behind.</p><p></p><p>The great priest was named Qing Yao, the first leader of the Azure Alliance from tens of millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Descendants.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Tian Qing Sect had served Lin Yuan for many years, so his descendants were naturally given important positions, becoming the highest-ranking Grand Priests in the Tian Qing World. </p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao looked up at the towering golden body of the Martial Ancestor, her gaze slightly anxious, "If we allow those two foreign demon gods to continue, in at most a year, seventy percent of the mortal realm in the Tian Qing World will be completely occupied. By then, the entire world will be thoroughly polluted."</p><p></p><p>As the Grand Priest, Qing Yao's soul was bound to the Primordial Demon Tree, allowing her to vaguely sense the situation facing the entire Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>"So we must completely resist the power of those two demon gods before that happens."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao had already made up her mind, "I will sacrifice half of the flesh and souls of the living beings in this realm to help the Holy Tree recover. Then, with the power of the Holy Tree, we may still have a chance to block those two demon gods."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao's expression gradually calmed down. </p><p></p><p>Sacrificing half of the living beings' flesh and souls in this realm, she as the presiding sacrificer would definitely not survive, and would perish along with countless living beings to become nourishment for the Holy Tree.</p><p></p><p>But as long as she could protect the Tian Qing World, any sacrifice would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Two massive foreign demon gods stood before a huge crack in the barrier of the world, peering into everything inside.</p><p></p><p>"Demon brother, you only need to hand over this world now, and voluntarily inform us of the origin of this world's rapid growth. We will speak well of you before the Lord, and you may even become one of the Lord's close subordinates."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the left sent out a terrifying mental ripple, attempting to communicate with the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Since the invasion began, they had often done this, aiming to achieve victory without fighting, but it had no effect.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the left looked displeased.</p><p></p><p>In the past when it inquired like this, the Primordial Demon Tree would at least respond with a few words, even if just to buy time.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree completely ignored it.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant, even in such a predicament."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the right was also somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>They believed they had an absolute advantage, and if they were willing to pay the price, they could have already occupied the Tian Qing World and captured that Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p>"No need to delay any longer."</p><p>"Let's enter with our true forms."</p><p></p><p>The demon god on the left was growing impatient.</p><p></p><p>After this period of probing and consumption, it believed that even if the Demon Tree still had the strength to resist, it wouldn't be much.</p><p></p><p>If they forcibly entered now, even under the Demon Tree's counterattack, they would be unlikely to suffer major damage.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tian Qing World, within the Primordial Demon Tree's protective range.</p><p></p><p>Countless living beings were horrified to find that the terrifying crack spanning the heavens was suddenly torn open even wider.</p><p></p><p>An enormous foreign demon god, covered in countless tentacles, was slowly squeezing its way in.</p><p></p><p>The entire Tian Qing World trembled as this massive demon god forced its way in, the edges of the land directly cracking apart.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, another abyss-like crack opened, and a million-mile-large eyeball squeezed its way in, surrounded by wings emanating an evil and bizarre aura that rapidly spread.</p><p></p><p>On the Tree Canopy Continent.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Grand Priest Qing Yao's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao stood up abruptly. Even without seeing it herself, she could sense two massive and terrifying auras rapidly invading the entire Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>"Can't delay any longer."</p><p>"Sacrifice half the living beings to the Holy Tree now."</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao immediately gave the order, and one martial cultivator after another appeared outside the hall, ready to be sacrificed to restore the Holy Tree's power.</p><p></p><p>They had long been prepared for this, willingly sacrificing themselves as long as it could save the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p>"I hope the Martial Ancestor blesses us, and all goes smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the hall to preside over the sacrifice, Qing Yao instinctively wanted to look at the golden body of the Martial Ancestor she had revered all this time.</p><p></p><p>Although sacrificing half the world's living beings could restore the Holy Tree's power, whether it would ultimately be enough to block those two foreign demon gods was still uncertain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Holy Tree had been severely injured by those two demon gods using some unknown means, to the point that even the Tian Qing World itself was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>However, when Qing Yao turned to look, she was horrified.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor's golden body that had stood unmoving in the depths of the hall for tens of millions of years was gone.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>For Grand Priest Qing Yao, it was like the sky had fallen. The Martial Ancestor was not only her own belief, but the belief of all living beings in the Tian Qing World. With the Martial Ancestor's body gone, it was devastating.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao stepped back several paces, about to leave the hall and have someone investigate who had approached it recently.</p><p></p><p>But then she froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Because at the entrance to the hall stood a towering man, his back turned to Qing Yao.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to sacrifice half the living beings." Lin Yuan glanced at Grand Priest Qing Yao and calmly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Qing Yao intended to sacrifice half the living beings to restore the Primordial Demon Tree's power, which Lin Yuan was naturally fully aware of.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was not willing to allow that - sacrificing half the living beings of the Tian Qing World? How many martial cultivators would that be?</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing Yao's body trembled, and her eyes immediately welled up with tears.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor, whom the living beings of the Tian Qing World had worshipped for tens of millions of years, had finally descended once more.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had his back to Qing Yao as he stepped out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>On the mortal realm above, the rampaging demon god puppets immediately turned to ash, crushed by some overwhelming force. Their remaining origins were absorbed by the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>The two massive, terrifying cracks spanning the heavens, through which the two foreign demon gods had eagerly tried to squeeze in, suddenly sensed something.</p><p></p><p>They looked up towards the Tree Canopy Continent with a hint of fear in their eyes, immediately retreating without a second thought. Their huge bodies collided with the cracks, as if fleeing in utter desperation.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor had left the hall and descended to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>That is the end of the two chapters.</p><p>I should have the next Patriarch chapter over the weekend.</p><p>Please vote for me!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

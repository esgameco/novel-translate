        <h1>Chapter 589</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanxu stood in the void, silently watching as the Ling Shen King's physical form and divine essence were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>He then casually collected the various weapons and treasures left behind by this great Ling Imperial Clan member.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Ling Ancient Kingdom's imperial clan are strange and difficult to deal with, especially that ability to transform into a 'spirit'. Even Heavenly Lords would likely find it troublesome for a while."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>To transform into a 'spirit' meant to merge with and become the 'spirit' itself. And the 'spirit' exists within all things, so the Ling Shen King's technique would be undefeatable, as long as it didn't face a Heavenly Lord.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, it just happened to be something I could counter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Ling Shen King had transformed into a 'spirit' and merged with all things. But Lin Yuan's physical divine ability 'World' formed an external universe centered on himself. </p><p></p><p>Within the domain of this external universe, he could control everything. Relying solely on the control of the external universe, he could suppress the Ling Shen King even after it had become a 'spirit' and merged with the 'spirits', but it would be difficult to force it out.</p><p></p><p>The external universe had a limited duration. But after Lin Yuan's internal universe had fused and devoured the source of the Blazing Sun, the area covered by the external universe was equivalent to the Blazing Sun opening the heavens. Within this range, Lin Yuan's control over the surrounding space-time and all things was nearly perfected, allowing him to easily force the Ling Shen King out of its 'spirit' state.</p><p></p><p>Combining the internal universe as the foundation, the divine abilities 'World' and 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens', made Lin Yuan's methods terrifyingly powerful. </p><p></p><p>This was just the enhancement of the 'World' divine ability. The improvement to the foundation of his internal universe by fusing and devouring the 'Source of the Blazing Sun' was equally immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with the concealment of the internal universe, unless Lin Yuan went all-out, the 'Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens' technique, which was closely related to the Blazing Sun Ancestor, would not be revealed when he activated the 'World' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After collecting the various weapons, armors and treasures left behind by the Ling Shen King, Lin Yuan took a quick look.</p><p></p><p>Among the many weapons and armors, the silver longsword was the most eye-catching, also being the Ling Shen King's main battle weapon.</p><p></p><p>"A Heavenly Lord-grade weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could tell at a glance the level of this weapon, which belonged to a Heavenly Lord from this source world, equivalent to a 'Great Saint' in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat satisfied. Although he did not use swords, a Heavenly Lord-grade weapon could easily be exchanged for other resources of the same level.</p><p></p><p>This silver longsword, being the Ling Shen King's main battle weapon, was considered top-tier even among Heavenly Lord-grade armaments.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the silver longsword, there was also a Heavenly Lord-grade armor, as well as several other weapons and treasures. The wealth the Ling Shen King carried on its person was exceptionally abundant.</p><p></p><p>"The core imperial clan of this source world is truly wealthy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. He could also guess that these weapons, armors, treasures and rarities were likely the majority of the Ling Shen King's assets.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the great Sages participating in the wars between the two ancient kingdoms, even if it was just a local conflict, would not carry such precious weapons and treasures on their person. After all, the variables of war are too great, and if they were to perish, all of it would fall into the enemy's hands.</p><p></p><p>But the Ling Shen King? As a core imperial clan member who had grown to the pinnacle, the Ling Shen King never imagined it would die. In the many possibilities it had considered, the worst-case scenario was that the Qing Fen Domain also had a pinnacle core imperial clan member stationed there, and the two would fight to the death in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>No matter which possible outcome, the Ling Shen King had never anticipated its own downfall. This was quite normal - a core imperial clan member who had grown to the limit was invincible to all but Heavenly Lords. Unless it encountered a Heavenly Lord, it was extremely difficult for it to be defeated and perish.</p><p></p><p>And Heavenly Lords? On the battlefield, once a Heavenly Lord-level expert appeared, it meant the intensity of the war would escalate across the board. Moreover, the lofty Heavenly Lords would not go so far as to strike down such a pinnacle core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>After briefly surveying the spoils of war, Lin Yuan looked down at the battlefield below.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, twenty to thirty great Sages from the Ling Ancient Kingdom, whether newly ascended or at their peak, had all begun to flee in a frenzy. It was clear they had learned of the outcome of Lin Yuan's battle with the Ling Shen King.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred.</p><p></p><p>To deal with these ordinary great Sages, Lin Yuan naturally did not need to activate the 'World' divine ability again.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Blazing Sun World swept over, and the twenty to thirty great Sages were scooped up like fish in water, then suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River!" </p><p></p><p>The great Sage captives were filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>The most cost-effective way to handle these captives was not to kill them, but to have the Ling Ancient Kingdom 'ransom' them back after the war.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no hatred towards these great Sages, as they were simply on opposing sides. He naturally would not indulge in any vengeful acts.</p><p></p><p>Even if he killed them, they would not truly die, as they could still be revived using life-saving methods, only losing their main combat body. The significance would not be great.</p><p></p><p>Using these captives to obtain 'ransom' from the Ling Ancient Kingdom was the most beneficial course of action for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>These great Sages fought for the Ling Ancient Kingdom, and now that they were captured, the Ling Ancient Kingdom would hardly just watch them.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Wei Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he looked towards an extremely distant location.</p><p></p><p>A certain aura was rapidly retreating from there.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared, and moments later, he reappeared near the Ling Wei Wang.</p><p></p><p>Compared to these imperial clan members who had comprehended and cultivated the power of bloodlines, Lin Yuan was equally adept at the comprehension of rules, especially the fusion of space-time rules. He had long ago reached the eighth level in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Previously, by constantly cultivating the Chaotic Scriptures and enhancing his comprehension of Chaotic rules, he had also driven the advancement of space-time fusion rules and countless other rules.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in terms of chasing and hunting, unless it was those imperial clan members who specialized in such methods, they could not escape Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, do you wish to capture me?" the Ling Wei Wang said, sensing Lin Yuan's approach and simply standing still instead of fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible," the Ling Wei Wang shook his head, and then his physical body and divine essence began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The other great Sages could be captured and then ransomed back by the Ling Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But as for him, the Ling Wei Wang, becoming a captive of the Blazing Sun Kingdom was unacceptable. It would be a disgrace to the Ling Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, upon realizing he could not escape, the Ling Wei Wang decisively chose to extinguish this physical body.</p><p></p><p>Compared to becoming a captive and losing all face, the Ling Wei Wang would rather give up this physical form.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a little regretful, but he had also anticipated this. The reason he had not held back against the Ling Shen King and had directly killed it was because he knew it could not be suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>After realizing it was no match for Lin Yuan, the Ling Shen King would certainly choose self-destruction, as this was the only option for an imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures are quite plentiful," Lin Yuan continued to collect the relics left behind by the Ling Wei Wang. While not as abundant as the Ling Shen King's, they were still considered wealthy among the great Sages.</p><p></p><p>"This time's expedition," Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile. The wealth carried by the Ling Shen King and Ling Wei Wang, as well as the treasures and rarities of dozens of great Sages - even though he planned to use the captives to obtain 'ransom', he would certainly collect all their carried valuables before exchanging them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did a quick inventory and found that he had already amassed a huge fortune.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to the spoils of war obtained from the enemy, Lin Yuan could also exchange his battlefield merits with King Qisong for treasures.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's recent performance, where he almost single-handedly turned the tide of the battle, how great would his merits be?</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom, deep within the layers of formation restrictions in a certain royal palace, a white crystal suddenly emitted a hazy glow, and then a figure coalesced - it was the Spiritual God King.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual God King, who had been revived through a life-saving method, was extremely weak in energy. However, compared to the weakness of his physical body and soul, his spiritual state was also in a very poor condition right now.</p><p></p><p>"I actually died?" the Spiritual God King murmured to himself. He could feel that Lin Yuan was definitely not a Celestial Venerable, at most he was like the Spiritual God King himself, a core royal from the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom that had grown to its limit.</p><p></p><p>The core royals who had grown to their limit possessed combat power that could rival the Celestial Venerables. Even if they couldn't defeat their peers at the same level, it would be very difficult for them to be killed directly.</p><p></p><p>"Was it because my bloodline talent was suppressed by that Silver River?" the Spiritual God King began to review the battle.</p><p></p><p>He had used his strongest killing move, merging into the 'Spiritual' of all things, but in the end, that Silver River had used some unknown method to reach the pinnacle of control over the surrounding space-time, even able to reverse control the 'Spiritual'.</p><p></p><p>This was the key to the Spiritual God King's downfall. After merging into the 'Spiritual', he was almost invincible, but he also lost many other methods. And when he was forcibly expelled from the 'Spiritual' state, the shock caused him to be easily killed by Silver River.</p><p></p><p>"How if I didn't use the 'Spiritual' transformation as my killing move, maybe I could have lasted a little longer," the Spiritual God King thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>That's right, just a little longer. Although the Spiritual God King realized that he was suppressed by Silver River, that level of control that was almost above everything else, even if he hadn't transformed into the 'Spiritual', the outcome would have been no different. At most, he could have lasted a little longer.</p><p></p><p>To buy more time for the Celestial Venerables of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom to retreat?</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, could it be that the core royals of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom have made progress in breaking through the Celestial Venerable's shackles, so that Silver River possesses such strength?" the Spiritual God King speculated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength was clearly a bit abnormal, far exceeding the limit of the core royals, but he had not yet reached the Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>So the Spiritual God King had this suspicious guess.</p><p></p><p>"This is good," the Spiritual God King's eyes burned with heat. Compared to his own defeat, the discovery that there was still a possibility for further advancement brought him more help.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh. Lin Yuan put away the spoils of the Spiritual God King and disappeared, returning to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Silver River," Qijue King came forward excitedly, his expression grateful: "I never expected Senior to pass by here and lend a hand. If it weren't for Senior, dozens of surrounding domains might have fallen."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan looked at Qijue King, immediately deducing that the other party must have mistaken him for a core royal from the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom who had grown to the limit.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's strength was evident, and combined with the use of the Blazing Sun Divine Body, Qijue King naturally thought he was an extreme core royal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not deny this, as it could explain his current strength.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Silver River," Qisong King also hurried over, his tone apologetic: "I didn't know your identity before, so I spoke that way. I hope Senior can forgive me!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had previously defeated the Thunder Golem Celestial Venerable, and Qisong King had personally summoned Lin Yuan for a conversation. At that time, Qisong King's attitude was still quite good, without any airs of a king. But now, thinking of Lin Yuan's identity, Qisong King felt a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"No need to say that," Lin Yuan was not too concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do next? Attack the Purple Dream Domain?" Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the two royal Celestial Venerables, casually saying.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Celestial Venerable-level experts of the Purple Dream Domain and the dozens of surrounding domains had all been suppressed by Lin Yuan, the enemy domains were essentially empty shells. As long as Qisong King was willing to attack, he would not face much resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Attack the Purple Dream Domain?" Qisong King hesitated for a moment, then shook his head and said, "Let's forget about it. Now that the Spiritual God King has fallen, the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom will definitely make a move. If we attack the Purple Dream Domain now, even if we can take it, it will be difficult to defend. There's no need for that."</p><p></p><p>Qisong King had no great ambitions, he just wanted to maintain control over the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Qisong King's consideration was not unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, more than twenty Celestial Venerables were looking at each other in amazement. The scene of Lin Yuan's battle with the Spiritual God King had truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought it would be a thrilling and climactic fight, but the Spiritual God King didn't even last long.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Silver River's strength..."</p><p></p><p>Huozha Celestial Venerable's expression was filled with awe, and the Red Leaf Celestial Venerable next to him was no better.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Red Leaf Celestial Venerable, who had a fairly good relationship with Lin Yuan before, never thought of him as a core royal who had grown to the limit.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's recently displayed strength was probably more than just a core royal at the limit.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingfeng City, in the teleportation array area, the largest teleportation array suddenly lit up with light. After dozens of breaths, several figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>The leader was an old man with a red beard, followed by three or four young men and women.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual God King of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom has actually grown to the limit, impressive," one of the young men spoke. He looked around and let out a sigh of relief. "It seems we arrived in time."</p><p></p><p>Since there were no major problems in Qingfeng City and the teleportation array was operating smoothly, it meant the Spiritual God King had not yet made a move on Qingfeng City.</p><p></p><p>This way, their trip was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>These figures were reinforcements sent by the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom after learning that the Spiritual God King's strength had exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>The three or four young men were all Celestial Venerable-realm royals, and the red-bearded old man in the lead was a core royal who had grown to the limit.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, core royals were rare, and those who had grown to the limit were even fewer.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the red-bearded old man could arrive so quickly showed that he was taking the war between Qingfeng Domain and Purple Dream Domain very seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" the red-bearded old man's gaze was slightly puzzled as he looked towards the battlefield from afar.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" the three or four young men asked, seeing the old man standing in place without any intention of rushing to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know what Qijue King and Qisong King were relying on to hold off a core royal at the limit like the Spiritual God King for so long, it was obvious the sooner they arrived, the better.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry," the red-bearded old man glanced at the young men, with a hint of confusion in his tone: "The war is already over."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 610</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Eye of All Laws says that the Mysterious Emperor has a demonic heart, and the Master of the Jade Pavilion also says that the Mysterious Emperor is attacking the Thirteenth Realm in order to revive his Dao companion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>From the tone of the Master of the Jade Pavilion, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor should also be no weaker than his existence.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, my time here is limited."</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Jade Pavilion smiled and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure of Shen Ji was then moved to the Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure of Shen Ji was moved to tears with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Just now, outside the Black Tower, he had seen the Master of the Jade Pavilion's consciousness revive, and he was a bit dazed. The master he had been waiting for so many cosmic eras had finally returned and appeared on the Ninth Layer?</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, he will be the new Master of the Jade Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Jade Pavilion looked at the six-armed figure of Shen Ji and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure of Shen Ji immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy of the Jade Pavilion is strict. Not to mention becoming the new Master, even becoming a direct disciple requires the personal consent of the Master of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that Lin Yuan is currently only a member of the Jade Pavilion's sequence, which is already the limit.</p><p></p><p>However, now.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness left behind by the Master of the Jade Pavilion has revived, equivalent to the Master of the Jade Pavilion being present in person.</p><p></p><p>"I left some good things in this Jade Pavilion space back then. If you don't become the Master, you can only choose a few of them at most." The Master of the Jade Pavilion looked at Lin Yuan and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." Lin Yuan said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules of the Jade Pavilion, you can only select from the reward list after passing each layer.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan's performance is extremely brilliant, he cannot break this rule.</p><p></p><p>But becoming the Master is different. After the personal consent of the Master of the Jade Pavilion, Lin Yuan has the highest control over this Jade Pavilion space.</p><p></p><p>He can freely dispose of all the treasures and rarities in the Jade Pavilion space.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the control power he had as a sequence member before, the power of the Master is like playing a game.</p><p></p><p>"That drop of Time Blood, you must carefully contemplate it." The Master of the Jade Pavilion reminded.</p><p></p><p>After his consciousness revived, he knew and grasped all the events that had happened in this Jade Pavilion space.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he has never stopped contemplating that drop of Time Blood, and the more he contemplates, the more he can feel the vast and incredible differences between different timelines.</p><p></p><p>It's like a fish that has grown up in the deep sea, looking up through the layers of seawater and gazing at the boundless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Although it is extremely blurred, he can still capture the vastness of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot leave my Thirteen Realm inheritance to you, nor can I even tell you how to obtain it." The Master of the Jade Pavilion thought for a while and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance left by the Thirteen Realm life and time values opportunity the most.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, the way to obtain it cannot have any intentional preparation, just like how Lin Yuan obtained the Jade Gourd, it was completely a coincidence, and he didn't know about it beforehand.</p><p></p><p>The other Thirteen Realm inheritances are the same. If you know the location of this Thirteen Realm inheritance from other channels and then deliberately approach to pretend to obtain it, you will be held accountable by the creator of that inheritance afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Don't think you can deceive a Thirteen Realm existence. At this level of life, they can observe along the timeline, and as long as they want to know something, they are almost omniscient.</p><p></p><p>If you dare to touch the bottom line set by the Thirteen Realm, even if you die, they can forcibly revive you and make your life worse than death.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you understand."</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Master of the Jade Pavilion began to become more and more illusory, and a stream of the power of time began to swirl around him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to fall into a time loop." The Master of the Jade Pavilion said, this is the result of isolating as much as possible. With the Jade Pavilion space blocking, he has been able to hold on until now.</p><p></p><p>If he was in the chaotic void, the Master of the Jade Pavilion would have been pulled back into the time loop the moment his consciousness revived.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, is there anything I can do for you?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan immediately spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Do something for me?" The Master of the Jade Pavilion looked at Lin Yuan, a smile appearing on his face, "Become stronger, become as strong as possible, and preferably cross into the Thirteenth Realm and become a life of time."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>With the information about breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm and the time loop that the Master of the Jade Pavilion had passed on to him, Lin Yuan knew what this sentence meant.</p><p></p><p>What is a time loop?</p><p></p><p>It is an endless cycle of time, from the beginning to the end, and then from the end back to the beginning.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Thirteen Realm Extraordinary Phenomenon Life, the time loop it is trapped in is to possess a mere ant and lead the ant tribe to become the strongest group in the world.</p><p></p><p>Once this Thirteen Realm Extraordinary Phenomenon Life fails and does not succeed before the limit of its lifespan, its memory will be erased and it will start over.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the connection with the outside world becomes very important. It can help oneself recognize the reality, spread the path of evolution, and essentially use the latter as an "anchor" and "signpost" to strengthen one's clear cognition within the time loop.</p><p></p><p>The path of evolution is like this, and the cause and effect can also serve a similar purpose. However, to break through the barrier of the time loop through cause and effect, it must be the cause and effect of a Thirteen Realm life, and it must be a major cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has entered the Jade Pavilion space since he was weak, and has been in contact with the Master of the Jade Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Establishing causality, he has now become the new master of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>If he could become the master of time and life, the causality would be greatly strengthened, perhaps he could help the current master of the Magic Jade Tower who is trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze, the time lines around the master of the Magic Jade Tower became increasingly clear, and in an instant, he was dragged into the void.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of existence is the time loop?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master." The six-armed figure Shen Ji was pensive, and then he respectfully bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Before this, even if Lin Yuan had become a member of the sequence, the six-armed figure only treated him as an equal.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for this between us."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head and immediately began to examine the many precious treasures in this Magic Jade space.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Magic Jade Tower summoned the six-armed figure Shen Ji, just to notify him, but in fact, he had already transferred the highest authority of the Magic Jade space to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Unbreakable Body of the Magic Jade?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at this cultivation method created by the master of the Magic Jade Tower, which was not inferior to the "Mysterious Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Lin Yuan watched a section of the body of the 12th-level member of the Magic Jade Tower, he had gained some understanding of the Unbreakable Body of the Magic Jade.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally obtained the complete Unbreakable Body of the Magic Jade.</p><p></p><p>"It's completely different from the 'Mysterious Yellow Body'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, with his current level of understanding, comprehending this cultivation method was not difficult, and he could even compare it to the "Mysterious Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>"Treasures, rare items." Lin Yuan briefly scanned them.</p><p></p><p>The treasures and rare items collected in the Magic Jade space were not as valuable as those in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, which was normal, as the two were not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade space was just a place for the master of the Magic Jade Tower to cultivate his members, while the Mysterious Yellow Universe was a place opened up by the Mysterious Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the memory of the master of the Magic Jade Tower slaying that extraordinary life form?" Lin Yuan looked at a crystal.</p><p></p><p>This crystal, like the one that contained the drop of time blood, had an inconceivable sealing effect, but the mist inside was not time blood, but a river-like mist.</p><p></p><p>After completely taking control of this Magic Jade space, Lin Yuan immediately knew the use of the mist in the crystal.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the master of the Magic Jade Tower and many other powerhouses of the same level joined forces to slay that life form with a strong time bloodline, and divided its body.</p><p></p><p>As for the essence and divine soul of that extraordinary life form, it was the river-like mist in the crystal, which the master of the Magic Jade Tower had refined through special means. As long as one focused their spiritual sense into it, they could witness the memory and perspective of that extraordinary life form, including its mastery of time power.</p><p></p><p>This method, although far inferior to the Ancestor of the Blazing Sun possessing the Source World, was still one of the few ways in the Chaotic Void to experience the faint time lines.</p><p></p><p>The extraordinary life form with a strong time bloodline possessed countless incredible methods, and could even glimpse the blurred time lines.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Magic Jade Tower and other supreme great saints paid a heavy price to kill this life form, but the gains were also great.</p><p></p><p>Through comprehending the time blood, the master of the Magic Jade Tower met the prerequisite for a 13th-level inheritance, and his strength soared, becoming the invincible great saint of that era.</p><p></p><p>"That extraordinary life form."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, having to admit that the master of the Magic Jade Tower and the other supreme great saints utilized that life form very thoroughly, from its physical body to its essence and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already completely entered the inner region.</p><p></p><p>"The gains are too great."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted in his heart, as he held the map of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he had a huge advantage over those great saints.</p><p></p><p>Many areas in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, on the surface, seemed ordinary, like the life source star Lin Yuan first encountered.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that it nurtured a life divine stone nearly three meters tall? Chaotic great saints would basically not even glance at that kind of star planet.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were too many such star planets in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, if each one was carefully observed, the Chaotic great saints might not be as fast as those venerable ones.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Yuan, relying on the advantages of the map, was able to confirm that this area had precious treasures, so he specifically stopped to take it.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the life source star, other regions were the same.</p><p></p><p>So until now, the gains of those Chaotic great saints were pathetically small.</p><p></p><p>Only the areas that seemed extraordinary on the surface could make these great saints stop and stay.</p><p></p><p>But often these areas had traps, like the Floating Pagoda, like the Nine Realms Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to continue along the route and head deeper into the universe, when his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Infinite Void' in my body's universe has reached the second layer?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Since he had fused and devoured the Blazing Sun Source, Lin Yuan had never stopped cultivating the second layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>Even during his exploration of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan had specifically divided his spiritual sense to cultivate the second layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>After all, this 13th-level inheritance was too important to Lin Yuan, once he crossed into the second layer, his strength would undergo another qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>"The second layer of the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately descended a conscious avatar into his body's universe.</p><p></p><p>PS: There will be two more chapters added in the early morning, and a prize will be drawn, the prize is "Black Myth: Wukong", there are a total of ten copies, drawn according to the monthly ticket count.</p><p></p><p>The guaranteed monthly tickets at the beginning of the month are saved for the "Black Myth: Wukong" draw.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 676</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Great Sage of the Galaxy, come out immediately to meet us!" </p><p></p><p>The terrifying sound waves reverberated through the space-time, and at this moment, every living being on the Galaxy Chaotic Continent heard this voice.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not just the Galaxy Chaotic Continent, but a vast expanse of the surrounding void that was covered by these sound waves. As a supreme great sage, the propagation range of the hoarse shout was extremely broad.</p><p></p><p>The bald man behind him had a calm gaze, with no objections.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Sage of the Galaxy was not an absolute supreme great sage, based on his combat power within the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he was likely close to the level of a supreme great sage.</p><p></p><p>While the two supreme great sages were not afraid, they could not easily venture deep into the Galaxy Chaotic Continent either.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Chaotic Continent was opened up by the Great Sage of the Galaxy, and it was his own domain. Within the Galaxy Chaotic Continent, the Great Sage of the Galaxy could display even greater power, while these outsiders would be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Given this ebb and flow of power, the bald man naturally would not take the initiative to enter it.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the two supreme great sages, the Great Sage of the Galaxy was ultimately just a Chaotic Sage, while they were supreme great sages who followed the 'Great Sage Rahu'.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu was about to sweep through the Chaotic Void and establish his reputation as the 'Invincible' supreme great sage. By following Rahu, their status and position were naturally not comparable to ordinary great sages, so they did not need to be too kind when facing the Great Sage of the Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, an Invincible Great Sage would appear only occasionally over the ages, and once one appeared, it would be absolute invincibility and tyranny.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Mysterious Emperor or the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower, after possessing the power of an Invincible Great Sage, they would not care much about the thoughts of other great sages.</p><p></p><p>"Who is summoning the Great Sage of the Galaxy to come out?"</p><p></p><p>"It is the supreme great sages who can exert this kind of spatial-temporal suppression."</p><p></p><p>"Do the supreme great sages wish to see the Great Sage of the Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>On the Galaxy Chaotic Continent, countless powerful cultivators looked up towards the source of the sound waves, among them many Venerable Ones at the peak of the Chaotic Realm, who clearly sensed the spatial-temporal suppression and deduced that the visitors were supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had not detected the spatial-temporal suppression, many Venerable Ones would have guessed that it was the supreme great sages speaking.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the supreme great sages, who else would dare to speak to the Great Sage of the Galaxy in this manner? After all, with the Great Sage of the Galaxy's strength, suppressing other Chaotic Sages was not too difficult, as evidenced by the examples of the Dual Source Great Sage and the Black Jade Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Are those two little fellows?"</p><p></p><p>Even further away, the awareness of several special existences descended, observing the slender figure and the bald man, the two supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>Among the many special existences, Lin Yuan was likely one of the top five, or even top three, Invincible Great Sages in the history of the Chaotic Void, so they were naturally very interested.</p><p></p><p>Especially since not long ago, when Lin Yuan had cultivated the path of Chaotic Power and imprinted the Chaotic Void, it was estimated that he had already approached the level of an Invincible Great Sage, or even directly become one.</p><p></p><p>"These two little fellows should have had some contact with Rahu."</p><p></p><p>"Rahu, huh? Unexpectedly, he should have already mastered that lineage, possessing the power of an Invincible Great Sage. Unfortunately, the Great Sage of the Galaxy has appeared in this era."</p><p></p><p>The awareness of the special existences shook their heads slightly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, in the Chaotic Void, with a supreme great sage and the mastery of a certain Thirteen Realms lineage, one would possess the power of an Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>However, having the power of an Invincible Great Sage and being able to become the Invincible Great Sage are two different things. Only one Invincible Great Sage can emerge in an era. Even if there were ten great sages with the power of an Invincible Great Sage coexisting in the same era, in the end, only one Invincible Great Sage would be born.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most likely outcome if ten great sages with Invincible Great Sage power coexisted in the same era would be that no Invincible Great Sage would emerge at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, the prerequisite for becoming the Invincible Great Sage is to make all the other supreme great sages acknowledge and submit to you. If ten great sages of the same level coexisted, and their combat power did not differ too much, it would be impossible for them to wholeheartedly accept one as the Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>Because they would not be able to achieve absolute invincibility.</p><p></p><p>"It's not necessarily so. Rahu's foundation is too formidable. The Great Sage of the Galaxy's potential is terrifying, but with Rahu in this era, the Great Sage of the Galaxy may not have an easy time becoming the Invincible Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>Another awareness of a special existence evaluated, highly recognizing the potential of the Great Sage of the Galaxy, but also acknowledging that Rahu was no simple figure.</p><p></p><p>The two great sages certainly possessed the power of Invincible Great Sages, but whether the Great Sage of the Galaxy could overwhelm Rahu was another matter.</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch and see."</p><p></p><p>"These two little fellows probably don't know the true power of the Great Sage of the Galaxy, which is quite interesting. Perhaps the Great Sage of the Galaxy and Rahu will make contact earlier than expected."</p><p></p><p>The various special existences were intrigued. Throughout the long history of the universe, the appearance of a supreme great sage with the power of an Invincible Great Sage was extremely rare and precious. Now, in this era, two such figures had emerged.</p><p></p><p>The many special existences were naturally very interested. For them, the pleasures of the long ages were not many, so watching the struggle between these two great sages of such remarkable power would certainly be one of them.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Galaxy Chaotic Continent, Lin Yuan was in seclusion, cultivating. The various ancestral lineages of the Source World that had been bestowed upon him required a great deal of time and effort to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan heard the voice from the outside world, and his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's them two..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Saint?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the two supreme saints standing in the distant void, and his figure flashed as he appeared in the sky above the Silver River Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>The thin figure saw Lin Yuan and vaguely sensed something was off - the aura of this Silver River Saint was too calm, so calm that he couldn't feel even a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>"This Silver River Saint is no ordinary one." The bald man behind him also vaguely sensed something, and he stepped forward, standing beside the thin figure, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the distant Silver River Saint gave him a similar feeling to the Rahu Saint.</p><p></p><p>"In the Xuanhuang Universe, the Silver River Saint was suppressed by the Jade Unicorn Saint, but he's still hiding his true strength?"</p><p></p><p>The bald man felt incredulous. He and the thin man must have thoroughly investigated the Silver River Saint before daring to come and inquire.</p><p></p><p>"They shouldn't have been so reckless."</p><p></p><p>The bald man regretted it in his heart. If he had known the Silver River Saint was hiding so deeply, even if they came to investigate the matters of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes, they wouldn't have approached in this manner.</p><p></p><p>"What do you seek me for?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the two supreme saints, his mood not very good since they had disturbed his cultivation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's nothing much." </p><p></p><p>The bald man glanced at the thin figure and took the initiative to speak: "It's just that not long ago, we sensed the causal threads of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes had completely disappeared, so we planned to investigate and wanted to ask the Silver River Saint about it."</p><p></p><p>The bald man looked at Lin Yuan and smiled: "Now it seems to have been a misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a misunderstanding." Lin Yuan shook his head and said, "I killed them both."</p><p></p><p>Although the Nine Phoenixes Saint had self-destructed, the root cause was still Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" </p><p></p><p>The thin figure was a bit dazed. They had originally come just to report back to the Rahu Saint, but they never expected to actually find the culprit behind the complete disappearance of the Yin Demon and the Nine Phoenixes.</p><p></p><p>The bald man beside him had a grave expression. Although they had clarified the matter Rahu Saint had entrusted them with, he didn't feel the slightest bit relieved.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan had openly admitted that he had killed those two saints, completely annihilating them? Causing their causal threads to disappear entirely? This level of strength, even an invincible saint might not be able to achieve, yet the Silver River Saint had done it?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, since it was the Silver River Saint who did it, we understand now, so we won't disturb you any further."</p><p></p><p>The bald man immediately spoke up and planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The thin figure beside him did the same, as he also sensed the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Completely annihilating two saints? Even if those two saints were only newly ascended, it was extremely unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Your questions are clear, now it's my turn." Lin Yuan looked at the two supreme saints, and the surrounding space-time began to thicken and suppress them. "You disturbed my cultivation, take one of my attacks, and if you survive, you can leave."</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Saint." The bald man's expression looked grim, as he also felt the suppression of the space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Saint, we serve the Rahu Saint." The thin figure beside him spoke, as many ancient existences knew of the terrifying Rahu Saint.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't know that the Rahu Saint had already cultivated a certain Thirteen Tier inheritance, he was still an existence close to an invincible saint.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the two supreme saints could continue saying anything, they found that Lin Yuan had disappeared, replaced by a vast, eternal sun spanning across the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"No—" The thin figure felt his heart tremble in despair.</p><p></p><p>The bald man felt the same, and he unhesitatingly crushed a talisman, on which the two words "Rahu" were engraved. It was a talisman bestowed by the Rahu Saint.</p><p></p><p>When facing a troublesome opponent while working for the Rahu Saint, they could crush this talisman, and then a projection of the Rahu Saint would coalesce.</p><p></p><p>This was also the trump card the Rahu Saint had given them.</p><p></p><p>The Rahu Saint's projection, even if not as powerful as the true body, would still be far stronger than ordinary supreme saints, and with the Rahu Saint's spiritual will guiding it, its power would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The light of the sun was everywhere.</p><p></p><p>And as the talisman was crushed, streams of aura converged, forming a massive figure.</p><p></p><p>The massive figure was completely composed of gray mist, its aura seeping into the depths of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the massive figure coalesced, the Rahu Saint's spiritual will descended, but before he could even sense the surrounding situation, he felt the scorching, eternal sun looming above the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" </p><p></p><p>The massive figure's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>But before it could react in any way, the massive figure rapidly collapsed under the sun's light, completely disappearing along with the two supreme saints, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure reappeared, and he extended his right hand, collecting the spoils left behind by the two supreme saints. He thought about the words the thin figure had just said.</p><p></p><p>"Rahu Saint? Never heard of him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't care much. He had annihilated the main physical bodies of the thin figure and the bald man, a form of punishment and a display of his power to prevent any other supreme saints from disturbing him in the future.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Lin Yuan's figure vanished, returning to the depths of the Silver River Chaos Continent to continue his closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

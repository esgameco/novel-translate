        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"This compass?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, any supernatural power would be reduced in dimension, leaving only the purest physical form. </p><p></p><p>But this bronze compass gave Lin Yuan a sense of mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>This vague feeling of transcending the dimensional suppression of the two-dimensional world made Lin Yuan's heart grow somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>After all, up until now, no being or treasure of any level could resist the dimensional suppression.</p><p></p><p>Except forâ€”</p><p></p><p>The ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>"How do you use it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's keen senses detected the remnants of fresh blood on the bronze compass. </p><p></p><p>He was already quite old, his vitality declining, so he was not suited to compete with those youthful demon kings.</p><p></p><p>This was a gift, so naturally he could not waste it. </p><p></p><p>That's why he returned to the tavern intending to give up the bounty mission.</p><p></p><p>"Due to the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves roaming the surrounding areas, a large number of powerful experts from the ancient nations have already begun gathering here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"These are their skulls."</p><p></p><p>Claiming the bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves?</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder's gaze shifted as he saw Lin Yuan re-enter the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Although Dongyuan City was a large city, it was far from the capital and centers of power.</p><p></p><p>To prove the killing of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves, ordinary body parts would not suffice as evidence. </p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves were extremely powerful with countless tricks up their sleeves. Even at his peak, the hunchbacked elder had no confidence in defeating them, let alone the seemingly young Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder guessed that Lin Yuan must be a young scion from some major clan out on a training journey.</p><p></p><p>In a private room of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Lin Yuan was not any powerful expert known to the hunchbacked elder.</p><p></p><p>"Is fresh blood used?"</p><p></p><p>Here he had no such worries, so the hunchbacked elder had decided to spend his retirement in this place.</p><p></p><p>To claim the bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves, one must prove they had truly killed them.</p><p></p><p>The bounty alone for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves amounted to 60 million demon crystals.</p><p></p><p>And the proof required here was usually in the form of the targets' vital organ parts.</p><p></p><p>"How about it? Are you going to give up on the bounty mission?" The hunchbacked elder spoke without any mocking tone.</p><p></p><p>Plus their original personal belongings and years of accumulation,</p><p></p><p>First, Lin Yuan dared to take on the bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves alone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the bronze compass and checked the bodies of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves repeatedly to ensure nothing was missed, before leaving with their vital organ parts.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder was dozing off. As a demon king-level expert from the capital of the Bloodrain Ancient Nation, he had taken on the role of tavern master at the Bloodrain Tavern in Dongyuan City to avoid being recruited by various powers.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan gained greatly from the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves, he did not forget about the demon crystal bounty on them.</p><p></p><p>"That young man is back again?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat across from the hunchbacked elder.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his bundle, and eighteen skulls rolled out.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder looked at Lin Yuan, momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Claiming the bounty?"</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder shook his head slightly, feeling quite helpless inside.</p><p></p><p>Even demon king-level peak experts were extremely greedy.</p><p></p><p>Dongyuan City.</p><p></p><p>"I'll study it slowly after returning."</p><p></p><p>"No, I came here to claim the bounty."</p><p></p><p>However, demon king-level peaks were few in number. Most who came to hunt the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves were teams of various experts.</p><p></p><p>Bloodrain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Third, the time since Lin Yuan left was really too short, not even a day.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder had a deep impression of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>On a whim, he wanted to take the bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves, but after a day's journey, he found he couldn't even locate their trail.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Only vital parts like skulls would be accepted as proof by the Bloodrain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had naturally clarified everything before taking the bounty, so there wouldn't be any issues now.</p><p></p><p>As for verifying if these skulls belonged to the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves, the Bloodrain Tavern naturally had special methods.</p><p></p><p>"Skulls?"</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder's expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't sure if these eighteen skulls belonged to the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves at the moment,</p><p></p><p>With his discerning eyes, he could immediately tell these eighteen skulls came from experts nearing the demon king level.</p><p></p><p>Demon kings, demon kings, and demon emperors had vastly different levels of physical refinement, which affected the hardness and quality of their bones.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with some experience in this area could tell.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder's tone immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly summoned his subordinates to take the eighteen skulls out.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder hurried back into the private room, speaking with a slightly respectful tone: "Sir, the skulls have been confirmed to belong to the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This Bloodrain Tavern did have a decent reputation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose to claim the bounty at the Bloodrain Tavern precisely because of their "leniency."</p><p></p><p>Anyone could post or take bounty missions at the Bloodrain Tavern without revealing their identity.</p><p></p><p>Although the Bloodrain Tavern originated from the Bloodrain Ancient Nation, over the long years it had become independent, serving all demon-level and above experts from the twelve ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"This is Bloodrain Tea, which only members of the Bloodrain royal family can enjoy." The hunchbacked elder waved his hand, and someone immediately brought a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The tea was blood-red in color. Lin Yuan didn't plan to drink it, but after glancing at it casually, he noticed a mysterious aura flowing within the tea water.</p><p></p><p>"This tea?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious undulation in the tea water gave him a similar feeling to the bronze compass, but far less profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't just seen the bronze compass, Lin Yuan estimated he would have just found this tea water rather special, without thinking about transcending the dimensional suppression of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it with me to drink later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the tea water along with the tea cup into his bundle.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder was slightly stunned, but didn't dare say more.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to defeat the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves so easily, even if he wasn't a demon emperor-level expert, he was probably not far off. Even in the capital teeming with experts, he could shake the world.</p><p></p><p>"The Bloodrain Tea comes from the Bloodrain Tea Tree, which is an inherited treasure of the Bloodrain Ancient Nation existing since its founding."</p><p></p><p>"The Bloodrain Tea can slowly improve one's physical constitution. Drinking it long-term also benefits cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Thinking Lin Yuan was interested in the Bloodrain Tea, the hunchbacked elder immediately began introducing it.</p><p></p><p>"The Bloodrain Tea Tree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered this name. If even the "tea leaves" contained a mysterious aura, then the source Bloodrain Tea Tree was probably similar to the bronze compass - an "extraordinary item" that could transcend the dimensional suppression.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 60 million demon crystal bounty."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder immediately took out a demon crystal note from the inter-nation spirit banks that could be used universally.</p><p></p><p>"We're even." Lin Yuan nodded and accepted the demon crystal note.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you interested in joining our Bloodrain Tavern? With your strength, you would become a top-tier member upon joining, not only enjoying priority in taking bounties, but also receiving a higher cut of the rewards."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Tavern could issue any bounty and take a cut from the rewards to sustain its operations.</p><p></p><p>For example, the 60 million bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves - the Bloodrain Tavern had taken at least 20 million demon crystals as its cut.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if Lin Yuan joined the Bloodrain Tavern, he would receive 80 million demon crystals as the reward.</p><p></p><p>"I'll consider it." Lin Yuan had no intention of joining the tavern, but he didn't outright refuse either.</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked elder saw Lin Yuan off.</p><p></p><p>Only after Lin Yuan's figure disappeared did he return and sit down again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A gray-haired old man appeared beside the hunchbacked elder.</p><p></p><p>"Tavern Master." The gray-haired old man exclaimed in surprise, "The bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves has been claimed?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The hunchbacked elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed them?"</p><p></p><p>The gray-haired old man was curious.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves were cautious and cunning. In the past, even demon emperor experts had made moves against them, but the thieves always managed to escape before the demon emperors arrived.</p><p></p><p>To the outside world, the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves seemed to have an almost terrifying intuition, always able to choose the right path to flee from danger.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown." The hunchbacked elder shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown?" The gray-haired old man was even more surprised.</p><p></p><p>Such an expert that even the well-traveled hunchbacked elder didn't recognize?</p><p></p><p>"The world is so vast, is it not normal for me to not know?" The hunchbacked elder glanced at the gray-haired old man, pondered for a moment, then continued: "I guess he should be an expert from outside the Bloodrain Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>Within the Bloodrain Ancient Nation, the hunchbacked elder felt he was quite knowledgeable, but he knew nothing about Lin Yuan. The only possibility he could think of was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Neng was from outside the ancient Blood Rain country. </p><p></p><p>The bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits was not only open to powerful experts from the Blood Rain country, but also to powerful experts from other ancient countries, with an extremely wide scope.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"This matter ends here."</p><p>"Don't mention that powerful expert again." The hunchbacked elder stood up and said, "Also, remove the bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits."</p><p></p><p>Since the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits had already died, there was no need for the bounty to exist anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the gray-haired man with long whiskers said respectfully, inwardly startled.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p>Deep in the primordial forest. </p><p>The valley where the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits had temporarily settled.</p><p>Over a dozen figures appeared here.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence, the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits should have briefly stopped here," said one sharp-eyed man in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>They were all bounty hunters roaming among the twelve ancient countries, specializing in hunting down targets with huge bounties.</p><p></p><p>Recently they had set their sights on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits. After all, a bounty of sixty million plus the fact that these eighteen bandits had plundered the treasury of the Prince of Zhenbei, such an enormous fortune was enough to draw their pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"There was a battle here."</p><p>At this moment, a plump man next to him carefully observed for a moment before suddenly speaking up.</p><p></p><p>"A battle?"</p><p>The others were slightly taken aback. </p><p>Could it be that someone had beaten them to it?</p><p></p><p>"No, not a battle," the plump man corrected himself, "A massacre."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone looked at each other, their expressions showing confusion.</p><p></p><p>Battle and massacre, though only differing by one word, represented completely different meanings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, who massacred whom?</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits were probably killed off."</p><p>The plump man continued observing the subtle traces left behind, finally concluding, "One of the eighteen escaped in that direction, while the other seventeen died."</p><p></p><p>"It seems there was only one attacker."</p><p>The plump man's tone was calm, but the ferocity and horror he conveyed was almost overflowing.</p><p></p><p>The others imagined horrific scenes in their minds - a powerful expert suddenly appearing in this valley, then one by one the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits died, no matter how they resisted, they could not escape death.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the eighteen managed to flee in that direction while the powerful expert massacred the other seventeen.</p><p></p><p>The plump man glanced in that direction and immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, in front of an ancient tree, the plump man stopped.</p><p></p><p>"The one who escaped also died," the plump man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the others felt a chill rise in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even they, who had planned to hunt down the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits, had never imagined wiping them all out.</p><p></p><p>This was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits were not fools - once they realized they were outmatched, they would definitely scatter and flee.</p><p></p><p>With eighteen people scattering, how could they be wiped out?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to the intelligence they had obtained, the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits had an astonishing intuition that allowed them to crush powerful experts. Often before the experts could catch up, the bandits would have already fled.</p><p></p><p>"Really dead?" the leading black-skinned man, standing like a mountain with cold, calm eyes, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the traces left behind, the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits should all be dead," said the plump man.</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell the background of the attacker?" the leading man asked.</p><p></p><p>"No," the plump man shook his head. "The Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits died too quickly, without even a struggle."</p><p></p><p>If there had been a struggle and battle, it might have been possible to discern the attacker's background from the traces left behind during the fight.</p><p></p><p>But without any resistance, the powerful expert had massacred the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits one by one, so how could the attacker's background be determined?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a scrawny figure rushed over rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Rain Tavern has removed the bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits," the scrawny figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Rain Tavern had actually removed the bounty several days ago, but there was a delay in the news spreading. The group only received the message now.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits really are dead," the leading man nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Rain Tavern would only remove the bounty if they were absolutely certain the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits had all perished.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p>"We crossed six or seven ancient countries, but ended up empty-handed?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other, their hearts a mix of regret and relief.</p><p></p><p>Although having the target snatched by another powerful expert should have been infuriating, after seeing the traces of the powerful expert massacring the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits, they actually felt relieved it had been taken from them.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, wouldn't they have had to face that mysterious powerful expert?</p><p>Someone who could so easily massacre the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits - they had no confidence in being able to withstand that.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the others' complex thoughts, the leading black-skinned man fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to kill the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits so easily, that expert is at least at the Demonic Emperor level."</p><p></p><p>"Just a Demonic Emperor?" The black-skinned man felt puzzled. "In the last twenty years or so, how did Demonic Emperor level experts become so numerous?"</p><p></p><p>Having traveled through many ancient countries, the black-skinned man had noticed that in the past few hundred or thousand years, the birth of a Demonic Emperor was rare. Yet recently they seemed to be appearing 'frequently'.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the capital cities of the major ancient countries, one Demonic Emperor after another that had never been heard of before was surfacing, as though they cost nothing.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the foundations left behind by the ancient Demonic Patriarchs in each of the great ancient countries, the current twelve ancient countries might have already undergone a change of dynasties.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest chamber of the Luochuan Gathering Ground, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"This operation should have been perfect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to review, from taking the bounty at the Blood Rain Tavern to killing the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits. He had not left any trace that could expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>The huge bounty on the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits had attracted the attention of most bounty hunters from the twelve ancient countries. If Lin Yuan acted now, he would only be seen as a powerful expert from one of those twelve countries.</p><p></p><p>This broadened the scope considerably.</p><p></p><p>The only oversight was that Lin Yuan had previously sent Cha Ranggu to investigate the trail of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits.</p><p></p><p>Not that Cha Ranggu would betray him - when Lin Yuan subjugated Cha Ranggu, he had already left a strand of blood energy in his mind that could explode with a thought, holding Cha Ranggu's life in his hands, so he dared not betray.</p><p></p><p>But Cha Ranggu investigating the trail of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits on Lin Yuan's behalf was not completely without risk.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered and realized this actually could not be considered a risk.</p><p></p><p>As the overt controller of the Luochuan Gathering Ground, it made sense for Cha Ranggu to investigate the trail of the eighteen bandits roaming nearby.</p><p></p><p>After repeated consideration, Lin Yuan waved his right hand and a teacup appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The teacup was carved from precious jade, worth at least one Demonic Crystal.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's gaze was not on the teacup itself, but the blood-red tea inside.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Rain Tea?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>At the Blood Rain Tavern, Lin Yuan did not dare drink this cup of tea, worried there might be some trick to it.</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility was low - the Blood Rain Tavern had a good reputation, so it was unlikely they would secretly try something just because Lin Yuan took the bounty for the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Bandits.</p><p></p><p>If they did, how could the tavern have grown to its current scale?</p><p></p><p>"No toxicity."</p><p></p><p>After repeated tests, Lin Yuan carefully took a sip.</p><p></p><p>The icy cold tea water flowed down his throat and into his limbs.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remained extremely vigilant, ready to control his stomach and intestines to isolate the tea water if any abnormality occurred.</p><p></p><p>"It does provide a slight benefit to the physical body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that because Lin Yuan's physical body was too powerful, if a Demonic King level expert drank this Blood Rain Tea, instead of a slight benefit, it would likely provide a significant boost to their physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Rain Tea?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned, and he took out the bronze compass artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Even under the dimension compression of this two-dimensional world, it still exudes an obvious mysterious aura."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that even the most powerful eleventh-stage life form would be unable to display any transcendent power in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But this bronze compass could.</p><p></p><p>Which meant that this bronze compass was quite possibly an extremely powerful divine weapon.</p>

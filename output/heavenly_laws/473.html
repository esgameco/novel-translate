            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 473 Palms Like Heavenly Collapse (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Very quickly.</p><p></p><p>The meeting of the top-level bigwigs of the entire Cangwu Immortal City was hastily concluded.</p><p></p><p>Although the City Lord of Cangwu Immortal City exuded great confidence, believing that with the foundation of Cangwu Immortal City, it would absolutely not follow in the footsteps of the previous three immortal cities.</p><p></p><p>But many of the top-level bigwigs of the immortal city still had lingering worries.</p><p></p><p>Not afraid of ten thousand, but afraid of the unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After the Immortal Pavilion Master returned, the heaviness on his face had not eased at all.</p><p></p><p>A moment passed.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Pavilion Master walked out of the Immortal Pavilion and came to the front of a Grade-A immortal residence.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to see Master Yunzhenzi." The Immortal Pavilion Master stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>A large number of demonic beasts were gathering, and Cangwu Immortal City would be in danger of collapse. The Immortal Pavilion Master decided to come and give Lin Yuan a heads-up.</p><p></p><p>As a top-level bigwig of Cangwu Immortal City, he could not abandon the immortal city, but Lin Yuan was different, his ties to Cangwu Immortal City were not as deep, and he had the confidence to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>"The Master is in seclusion, Pavilion Master. If you have any matters, you can directly tell me, and I will inform the Master," Yunzhenzi said softly.</p><p></p><p>In the past one or two hundred years, the Immortal Pavilion Master had often visited Lin Yuan, and Yunzhenzi knew the two were on good terms, so naturally he did not dare to be negligent.</p><p></p><p>"Tell you?" The Immortal Pavilion Master fell silent for a while.</p><p></p><p>A large number of demonic beasts were gathering towards the area where Cangwu Immortal City was located, which was the immortal city's top secret. If it were to be leaked out, it could very likely lead to the premature collapse of the immortal city's many immortals.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Pavilion Master only dared to directly remind Lin Yuan, as for telling the servant in front of him to relay it to Lin Yuan? There was still a risk of it being leaked out.</p><p></p><p>"If the Master comes out of seclusion, tell him to come see me." The Immortal Pavilion Master said, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Now that Cangwu Immortal City had entered the highest state of alert, the Immortal Pavilion Master also had many things to do, so he planned to wait until Lin Yuan finished his seclusion before reminding him.</p><p></p><p>Tens of billions of miles away from Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Countless demonic beasts gathered, the terrifying demonic qi permeated, actually beginning to subtly transform the Immortal Realm towards the Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the many demonic beasts, six towering figures stood tall, these six figures had profound auras, like miniature Demonic Abysses, and the countless demonic beasts all worshipped these six towering figures.</p><p></p><p>Almost all demonic beasts had very low intelligence, one could say they had no intelligence at all, only instincts.</p><p></p><p>But among the endless demonic beasts, there was a tiny probability of the birth of Demonic Beast Sovereigns. These Demonic Beast Sovereigns had devoured countless demonic beasts, and had gathered a portion of the aura of the Ancestors of the Demonic Abyss, thus giving birth to spiritual wisdom.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the Demonic Beast Sovereigns were the 'incarnations' of the Ancestors of the Demonic Abyss, so they possessed the ability to dominate and control other demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Beast Sovereigns born from the endless demonic beasts had extremely terrifying strength, in the past immortal-demon wars, at most only one Demonic Beast Sovereign would appear.</p><p></p><p>But this immortal-demon war, the number of Demonic Beast Sovereigns exceeded the previous immortal-demon wars, and this was also the reason why three immortal cities had been attacked and destroyed in the past few decades.</p><p></p><p>One Demonic Beast Sovereign leading a large number of demonic beasts could only rampage outside the immortal cities, unable to break through the immortal cities.</p><p></p><p>But with two or three Demonic Beast Sovereigns, three Demonic Beast Sovereigns, or five Demonic Beast Sovereigns working together, they still had a very good chance of breaking through an immortal city.</p><p></p><p>"Cangwu Immortal City, what delicious food it is," the six Demonic Beast Sovereigns gazed towards the distance, which was the location of Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary demonic beasts devouring Tribulation Transcendents and Mahayana Immortals were already supreme delicacies, but for the Demonic Beast Sovereigns, even Immortal Sages were not worth much.</p><p></p><p>What the Demonic Beast Sovereigns most craved to devour were the Jade Immortals, the stronger the Jade Immortals, the greater the help they would be to the Demonic Beast Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Jade Immortals were too rare, the vast and boundless Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, the Jade Immortals were mostly concentrated in the immortal cities, which was also the reason why the Demonic Beast Sovereigns worked together to attack the immortal cities.</p><p></p><p>Not only could their hordes of demonic beasts have a large number of immortals to consume, these Demonic Beast Sovereigns themselves could also share the feast of many Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"The gathered forces are almost enough now, we can start moving towards Cangwu Immortal City." The leading Demonic Beast Sovereign spoke.</p><p></p><p>As Demonic Beast Sovereigns, their intelligence was sufficient, they had already begun to assess the situation, and would only wait patiently until the gathered forces were enough to tear apart Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"If we manage to break through Cangwu Immortal City this time, I want to devour at least twenty Jade Immortals."</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Beast Sovereign on the right spoke, the formation of Demonic Beast Sovereigns was the result of devouring countless demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>But devouring demonic beasts and devouring immortals were completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>Devouring demonic beasts for the Demonic Beast Sovereigns was only an addition in quantity, like if they were injured, they could recover through a large number of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>But devouring immortals? It was more like a compensation for a certain aspect of themselves.</p><p></p><p>The instincts of the Demonic Beast Sovereigns told them that the more immortals they devoured, the more complete they would become.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty Jade Immortals?" The Demonic Beast Sovereign on the left let out a low roar: "I want twenty Jade Immortals too."</p><p></p><p>"The ordinary Jade Immortals can be given to you, but the top-grade Jade Immortals are mine." The leading Demonic Beast Sovereign also joined in.</p><p></p><p>Top-grade Jade Immortals were of greater help to the Demonic Beast Sovereigns, but relatively speaking, top-grade Jade Immortals were even rarer and more difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Years later.</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of the six Demonic Beast Sovereigns, the almost endless and boundless demonic beasts had already arrived outside Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>The evil and twisted demonic qi permeated the air, and it was only at this moment that the many immortals of Cangwu Immortal City realized the dire situation the immortal city was facing.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic beasts have come to attack?"</p><p></p><p>"What do we do, what do we do? I heard these demonic beasts have already destroyed three immortal cities."</p><p></p><p>"Go out, I want to escape."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Leave? Within the Immortal City, relying on the protection of the Immortal City, there is still a chance to survive. Escape? I'm afraid the moment you step out, you'll be devoured by those demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xiang Wu Immortal City, after a brief moment of panic, the many immortals managed to calm down. Which of the immortals who had cultivated to the Tribulation Crossing stage was not a seasoned strategist? They quickly realized that hiding within the Immortal City was the only chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, the demonic beasts are outside. To resist these demonic beasts, we need to rely on the power of all the Daoists."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Immortal City Lord instantly appeared in the ears of all the immortals, "Now, all Daoists shall pour your magical powers and immortal energies into the ground of the Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>The vast Xiang Wu Immortal City, forged by generations of Jade Immortals, had long since become a massive war immortal artifact.</p><p></p><p>To activate this massive war immortal artifact, it required the combined power of a multitude of immortals. Only then could the full might of the Xiang Wu Immortal City be unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Demon Monarch exceeded that of the peak Jade Immortals, and with the endless hordes of demonic beasts, the only way to deal with them was to rely on the Xiang Wu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Only by fully unleashing the power of the Xiang Wu Immortal City, this massive war immortal artifact, would there be a chance to withstand the Demon Monarch and the endless demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The many immortals inside the Immortal City also recognized the dire situation and unhesitatingly poured their magical powers and immortal energies into the ground of the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The massive Xiang Wu Immortal City seemed to come alive, radiating a terrifying light that spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The large number of demonic beasts on the periphery, unable to retreat in time, were instantly reduced to dust.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, relying on the power of the Immortal City, an old trick."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the endless demonic beasts, the six Demon Monarchs watched coldly. With their strength, even the Xiang Wu Immortal City could be directly confronted and suppressed if they worked together.</p><p></p><p>But to ensure their own safety, they still dispatched a large number of demonic beasts to actively approach the Xiang Wu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of demonic beasts perished under the immortal light, also gradually depleting the foundation of the Xiang Wu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Demon Monarchs?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal City, the City Lord and other high-level leaders were slightly anxious.</p><p></p><p>With so many demonic beasts gathered outside the Immortal City, there must be Demon Monarchs secretly commanding and directing them. The Immortal City's final strike was also reserved for those Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>Only by killing or severely injuring the Demon Monarchs would there be a chance of victory, otherwise, as long as the Demon Monarchs remained, they would continue to summon endless waves of demonic beasts to attack the city.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>The endless hordes of demonic beasts showed no signs of diminishing.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord and other high-level leaders began to despair.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Hazy black demonic qi silently crept closer.</p><p></p><p>Six towering figures instantly appeared before the Xiang Wu Immortal City, raising their right hands to press down.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no."</p><p></p><p>The faces of the Immortal City Lord and other leaders changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Six Demon Monarchs, there are actually six Demon Monarchs!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord felt that parts of the Xiang Wu Immortal City were collapsing. The six Demon Monarchs, hidden in the shadows, had exhausted the majority of the Xiang Wu Immortal City's power with the endless demonic beasts, and then silently appeared to deliver the fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Despair welled up in the Immortal City Lord's heart.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that if it were not for the intention of capturing the Xiang Wu Immortal City intact, the six Demon Monarchs would not have held back, and the Xiang Wu Immortal City would have been breached long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic beasts have already entered the city."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord looked down, vaguely sensing countless demonic qi seeping into the city walls.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic beasts have invaded the city, run!"</p><p></p><p>"Run? Where can we run to? The outside is filled with demonic beasts, and now they've entered the city, where can we run to?"</p><p></p><p>"Since we can't escape, then let's fight the demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal City, it was in complete chaos. Many immortals were filled with fear and anxiety, some had resolute expressions, and some were fleeing deeper into the Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>In the Dwelling-Celestial Area.</p><p></p><p>Through the Dwelling-Celestial Formation, Yun Zhenzi observed the situation of the entire Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal City is about to fall?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi's face turned pale as he looked towards the Immortal City, seeing the six towering Demon Monarchs and the endless hordes of demonic beasts pouring in.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly tell the master."</p><p></p><p>Before the appearance of the six Demon Monarchs, the Xiang Wu Immortal City had the upper hand in the face of the endless demonic beasts, killing as many as approached. </p><p></p><p>Until the six Demon Monarchs acted, the situation instantly reversed, making Yun Zhenzi realize that the situation had taken a grave turn.</p><p></p><p>In the Cultivation Area.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow was furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal City is about to be breached?"</p><p></p><p>After receiving the notification from Yun Zhenzi, Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He only felt that he was just a hair's breadth away from the Seventh Realm of Time and Space. If he could just cultivate for a few more years, or even just a few months, he would be able to enter the new realm of the Time and Space Domain.</p><p></p><p>"The situation has become this dire?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up, walked out of the Cultivation Area, and came to Yun Zhenzi's side. Through the Dwelling-Celestial Formation, he observed the situation of the entire Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do now? There are six Demon Monarchs outside." Yun Zhenzi's voice trembled slightly. He had experienced more than one war between immortals and demons, and was well aware of the terrifying power of the Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>They were existences that surpassed even the peak Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mood was not very good. He glanced at the pale-faced Yun Zhenzi, then casually reached out a hand towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The endless demonic beasts vanished without a trace, as if they had been erased from existence. Outside the Xiang Wu Immortal City, the sky was clear and everything was still.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi's mouth hung open.</p><p></p><p>Because in that moment, he had clearly seen Lin Yuan grab the six towering Demon Monarchs in his hand. Those six Demon Monarchs, who were as tall as mountains, were no more than a tenth the size of Lin Yuan's fingers, trapped between his fingertips.</p>

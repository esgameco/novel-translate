        <h1>Chapter 477</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 477 - I am the Ancestor of the Martial Dao (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, Lin Yuan had already arranged for the Yin Primal Spirit to secretly propagate the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was a covert propagation, with the Yin Primal Spirit only gently guiding the process.</p><p></p><p>However, under the overwhelming dominance of the Immortal Cultivation System, the propagation of the Martial Dao evolution path did not have much of an impact.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao came first, and sentient beings with the right conditions would naturally prioritize the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the Martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was hiding in the shadows, and the Martial Dao cultivation system did not have enough powerful experts to anchor it. Even though it had limitless potential, it was not the first choice.</p><p></p><p>"Merely relying on the accumulation of a few hundred years is still too slow for the propagation of the Martial Dao," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Being invincible in his own right was not the same as propagating his own cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan could reside permanently in the Immortal Realm and constantly monitor its development, the moment he left, the development trend of the Martial Dao would be at risk of being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, the Martial Dao was able to spread so rapidly, entirely due to the accumulation of tens of thousands of years in the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Realm? The vastness of the Immortal Realm far exceeded the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's arrival, the Immortal Realm did not even have the Martial Dao. To develop the Martial Dao from scratch, not only would it require a great deal of effort, but it would also need a vast amount of time to settle and take root.</p><p></p><p>After all, not every Martial Dao cultivator was like Lin Yuan, and even the most brilliant Martial Dao geniuses would need generations to scale the peaks of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the Immortal Realm is not entirely devoid of Martial Dao foundations," Lin Yuan's thoughts suddenly stirred, and his gaze turned towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>That was the Lower Realm beneath the Immortal Realm, one of the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Lower Realms, which was the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's eighth journey, he had essentially rooted the Martial Dao in the Spiritual Realm and left behind many safeguards to ensure its smooth development.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Martial Dao in the Spiritual Realm originated from an even lower realm, the Middle Celestial Divine Land, where the Dao Virtue Immortal Sect had made a pact with Lin Yuan to protect the fledgling Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Since then, endless streams of Martial Dao cultivators from the Middle Celestial Divine Land have been ascending through the Dao Virtue Immortal Sect's ascension platform and joining the Dao Virtue Immortal Sect's faction.</p><p></p><p>By the time Lin Yuan descended for the eighth time, the Martial Dao cultivators had already formed a force called the "Martial Temple" in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time flow ratio between the Spiritual Realm and the main universe, it should have been over a million years since Lin Yuan completed his eighth journey.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Martial Dao has developed quite well in the Spiritual Realm," Lin Yuan's gaze pierced through the layers of space-time, giving him a general overview of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even without relying on the space-time seventh-layer comprehension to observe, Lin Yuan could still feel the vibrant development of the Martial Dao evolution path in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, even if he was far away, Lin Yuan could still sense the "flickering sparks" of the Martial Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Currently, more than half of the regions in the Spiritual Realm were permeated with these "flickering sparks".</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Martial Dao cultivation system in the Spiritual Realm had already grown into a colossal force, even able to suppress the Immortal Dao cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Qi Qing and the others have done a good job," Lin Yuan nodded slightly. Even though he had forcefully cultivated his disciple Qi Qing to the Martial Dao Eighth Layer before the end of his eighth journey.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Dao Eighth Layer was only equivalent to the Tribulation Crossing Realm, and there were not a few Tribulation Crossing Realm cultivators in the Spiritual Realm. Although Lin Yuan's residual power was still present, after being away for so long, he had to rely on Qi Qing and the others to maintain control.</p><p></p><p>"If I can guide the Martial Dao cultivators from the Spiritual Realm to ascend, it might help reduce the difficulty of propagating the Martial Dao in the Immortal Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Any endeavor, from nothing to something, is the most challenging part.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's Yin Primal Spirit had been secretly guiding the propagation for hundreds of years, the Martial Dao cultivation system only had a few hundred thousand cultivators, with the strongest only reaching the Martial Dao Sixth Layer.</p><p></p><p>But after a million years of development in the Spiritual Realm, the number of Martial Dao Eighth Layer cultivators had exceeded a thousand, and the Martial Dao Seventh Layer and Sixth Layer cultivators were countless.</p><p></p><p>"With my current space-time attainments, this should not be a problem," Lin Yuan nodded after carefully observing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was a way to ascend from the Spiritual Realm to the Immortal Realm. That was to reach the Ninth Layer of the Spiritual Realm and then fly upwards along the Ninth Layer, and with good luck, one might enter the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, due to Lin Yuan's existence, the strongest life forms in the Spiritual Realm had become exceptionally powerful. The later generations, whether Immortal Dao cultivators or Martial Dao cultivators, could at most break through the Eighth Layer, and when faced with the "Lin Yuan" entrenched in the Ninth Layer, they would be utterly crushed.</p><p></p><p>This had resulted in no life form being able to reach the Immortal Realm for the past million years.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin," Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and he detached a wisp of spiritual will, leaving the Immortal Realm and continuously descending, eventually merging into the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Dao Ancestor-level experts could spiritually roam outside the Immortal Realm, and both the Immortal Dao cultivation system in the Spiritual Realm and the Immortal Dao cultivation system in the Middle Celestial Divine Land originated from the Dao Ancestor's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had not reached the Dao Ancestor level, his space-time seventh-layer comprehension allowed him to achieve a similar effect, and in some aspects, he was even stronger than the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm, the Eighth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qing was seated at the entrance to the Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"Even after a million years, I am still far inferior to my original teacher," Qi Qing gazed at the entrance to the Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of a million years, she had long since reached the Martial Dao Eighth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Dao reached its pinnacle, and Lin Yuan's many secret techniques had all been cultivated to perfection.</p><p></p><p>This caused Licheng's strength to become the strongest in the spiritual realm. Even those ancient Tribulation Crossing cultivators from the previous eon were no match for Licheng.</p><p></p><p>However, the more this was the case, the more Licheng could feel the gap between herself and her teacher. With her current strength, she was already able to break through the eighth layer leading to the Ninth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>But when facing the Ninth Layer, which was the 'imprint' left behind by Lin Yuan, she was still crushed.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how my teacher is doing now? How is he faring in the Immortal Realm?" Licheng couldn't help but feel nostalgic for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She was the disciple Lin Yuan had taken in when he was in the Middle Continent, and her reverence for Lin Yuan was the deepest.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Licheng's thoughts were wandering.</p><p></p><p>Spatial-temporal fluctuations rippled out like ripples on water, and a majestic figure seemed to traverse the boundless expanse of time and space, descending upon the Eighth Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>An instinctive feeling of awe welled up in Licheng's heart, and she stared blankly at the majestic figure, her eyes unable to hold back the moisture, "Teacher."</p><p></p><p>"You still have a sense of rejection towards me?" A wisp of Lin Yuan's spiritual will descended into the spiritual realm, vaguely sensing the 'terror' of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>But it was only 'terror'.</p><p></p><p>Even with just a wisp of spiritual will, as long as Lin Yuan wished it, he could easily destroy the entire spiritual realm. Relying solely on his mastery of time and space, Lin Yuan could stir up an unprecedented spatial-temporal storm within the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Causing the entire world to prematurely enter the collapse and destruction phase.</p><p></p><p>To the current Lin Yuan, the spiritual realm was far too fragile.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps sensing Lin Yuan's level, the innate consciousness of the spiritual realm could only feel terror.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Don't you recognize me?" Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, looking at the trembling Licheng, and he smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, teacher, you've really returned?" Licheng suddenly snapped out of it, almost thinking she was dreaming just now.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, the spiritual realm had experienced the rise and fall of one eon after another. Aside from the Immortal Dao Ancestor who existed at the world's creation, there had never been any other powerful cultivator who had reached the Ninth Heavenly Realm and then returned to the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Licheng finally managed to accept the fact that the majestic figure in front of her was indeed her teacher.</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard these past years," Lin Yuan looked at Licheng and praised her slightly.</p><p></p><p>The development of the Dao in the spiritual realm must have required Licheng to make tremendous efforts.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, this time you've descended, is it to..." Licheng calmed down and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan again, Licheng was greatly excited, and she had just asked this question, wanting to serve her teacher again.</p><p></p><p>"No particular plans."</p><p></p><p>"I intend to bring you all to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the purpose of his return to the spiritual realm, to use the many Dao cultivators here to spread and develop the Dao in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Bring us to the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Us?"</p><p></p><p>Licheng was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, it had never been heard of that one could be 'brought' to the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>According to Licheng's understanding, the only way to go to the Immortal Realm was to ascend to the Ninth Heavenly Realm. This had always been the case since the birth of the spiritual realm, and those ancient Tribulation Crossing cultivators had all done so.</p><p></p><p>But now Lin Yuan was saying he would bring her and others up there?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, it sounded like not just one person?</p><p></p><p>"You go back and prepare. Within the spiritual realm, Dao cultivators at the sixth stage can enter the Immortal Realm," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation environment in the Immortal Realm was far superior to the spiritual realm, and Dao cultivators entering the Immortal Realm would have an even higher ceiling.</p><p></p><p>"All sixth-stage Dao cultivators?" Licheng was stunned. Nowadays, Dao cultivation was flourishing in the spiritual realm, and there were countless sixth-stage cultivators. They could all enter the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor had ordered all the demonic beings to withdraw back into the Demon Abyss, but he had not given up on observing the Immortal Realm. Due to Lin Yuan's existence, the Demon Abyss Ancestor had nearly fully restored his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He was constantly monitoring every detail of change in the Immortal Realm, especially the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Spatial-temporal channel fluctuations? Has that existence opened a spatial-temporal channel between the Immortal Realm and the lower realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor's heart stirred slightly. He could not lock onto the specific coordinates of Lin Yuan's location, but he was extremely sensitive to spatial-temporal fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Such a stable spatial-temporal channel."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor was astonished.</p><p></p><p>With his Dao Ancestor-level strength, he could wander in the lower realm and even forcibly bring the lives of the lower realm to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But to be able to open a stable spatial-temporal channel like Lin Yuan, thoroughly connecting the lower realm and the Immortal Realm, this required resisting the 'repair' power of the entire Immortal Realm. The requirement for mastery of time and space was inconceivably high.</p><p></p><p>"Which lower realm is this spatial-temporal channel leading to?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor carefully observed and began to investigate. The invisible power of the Demon Abyss gradually converged.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Demon Abyss Ancestor changed.</p><p></p><p>Not far from him, spatial-temporal power coalesced, forming the figure of a young man.</p><p></p><p>This young man easily crossed the numerous barriers of the Demon Abyss, condensing a manifestation that appeared here, smiling at the Demon Abyss Ancestor and speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Demon Abyss Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" The Demon Abyss Ancestor's expression was grave, as if facing a great enemy. He clearly recognized that this young man's manifestation was the existence he had been observing.</p><p></p><p>The young man smiled and said, "I am the Dao Ancestor of the Dao."</p>

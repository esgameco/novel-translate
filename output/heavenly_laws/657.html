        <h1>Chapter 657</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder Suyin looked at Lin Yuan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was naturally not as strong as the supreme Heavenly Sovereign who had suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>But he was far from fearful. So what if this was the supreme Heavenly Sovereign? The Mysterious Yin Ancient Country was not without its own power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Mysterious Yin Ancestor present, this Galactic Heavenly Sovereign would not dare to brazenly invade the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country. Now that he had this rare opportunity to severely punish the other, Elder Suyin naturally would not let it go.</p><p></p><p>The conditions he proposed to Lin Yuan were much better than those offered by the Great Fu Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>After all, the latter had occupied the most core celestial pillars at the moment. Even if they did not have the core celestial pillars occupied by the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, they still had a good chance of seizing this treasure land in the end.</p><p></p><p>So the Mysterious Yin Heavenly Sovereign did not dare to make excessive demands on the Great Fu Ancient Country, because they had other options.</p><p></p><p>But the Blazing Sun Ancient Country? Without the core celestial pillars occupied by the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, even if the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign's strength was formidable, he would not be able to contend with the Submerged Void Heavenly Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>It would be meaningless, as the three major ancient countries of Great Fu, Thunder and Lightning, and Mysterious Yin, together occupied more than half of the total number of core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"That's too much," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"It's not too much," Elder Suyin stood his ground.</p><p></p><p>"At most, I'll give you 50% of the output."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment, looking at Elder Suyin.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Heavenly Sovereign, this is the bottom line of my Mysterious Yin Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>Elder Suyin, aware of his current importance, smiled and said, "I'll consider it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not directly refuse, leaving room for negotiation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Elder Suyin also did not want to push Lin Yuan too hard, after all, if there was a choice, he would definitely prefer to make a deal with the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"But the time to compete for the treasure land has already passed half, I hope the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign can make a decision soon, the conditions offered by the Great Fu Ancient Country are not low."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Elder Suyin's incarnation directly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>After Elder Suyin disappeared, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Sovereign came out.</p><p></p><p>"That Suyin, he's completely taking advantage of the situation!" The Crimson Flame Heavenly Sovereign frowned. Not only was this treasure land's output of hundreds of billions of rare treasures, it also had two first-class treasure lands. How many first-class treasure lands did the Blazing Sun Ancient Country have in total? Just for more than thirty core celestial pillars, they were giving up two?</p><p></p><p>"There's no other choice," Lin Yuan was also dissatisfied, but he knew that the more this was the case, the less he could offend the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country. Doing so would only push them completely towards the Great Fu Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, even if he went all out, he might not be able to overwhelm the Submerged Void Heavenly Sovereign, let alone with other ancient countries eyeing this treasure land, such as the Savage Ancient Country and the Great Spirit Ancient Country. Although they did not have the strongest Heavenly Sovereign, the foundation and killing techniques they brought out from their ancient countries could still resist the strongest Heavenly Sovereign to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic, what are you going to do?" The Crimson Flame Heavenly Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan, even though he was now furious at Elder Suyin's opportunistic behavior, but from a rational perspective, he could only agree to the other party's requested conditions. At least this way, there was a chance to compete with the Great Fu Ancient Country for this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Delay it for now," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Heavenly Sovereign immediately understood Lin Yuan's intention. To wait and see how the situation develops in the future, and then make the final decision. After all, what was involved was not just this treasure land, the Blazing Sun Ancient Country had to also put in two other first-class treasure lands. Even if the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country did not specify which two first-class treasure lands, even the worst first-class treasure land's output of rare treasures would be extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Crimson Flame Heavenly Sovereign was still thinking too little. Lin Yuan's so-called "delaying it for now" was not just about wanting to see how the situation would develop in the future, but more importantly, to try to break through again in the next thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The breakthroughs that Lin Yuan could currently focus on were only three:</p><p></p><p>1. Completing the third layer of the "Infinite Void" cultivation.</p><p>2. Reaching the second level of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Dao.</p><p>3. Crossing into the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Any of these three breakthroughs would cause Lin Yuan's strength to undergo a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scene was immediately and completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>After destroying a special place, the young man's expression changed slightly as he looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Most of the areas in the scene were very blurred, and Lin Yuan could only confirm that the young man seemed to have sensed something.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the young man voluntarily extinguished his physical body and soul, not even wanting the Heavenly Void Urn, and completely disappeared into the void.</p><p></p><p>The scene ended.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the scene displayed should be the future.</p><p></p><p>As for the young man in the scene who activated the Heavenly Void Urn, it was Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>The only thing Lin Yuan didn't understand was why his future self would recklessly activate the Heavenly Void Urn and completely destroy a special place, without regard for the consequences.</p><p></p><p>The special places in the chaotic void are mostly related to the 13th-level time beings. Completely destroying one would definitely provoke the time being behind it.</p><p></p><p>In the end of the scene, the young man voluntarily extinguished his physical body and soul, likely because a time being had descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not sure how many years in the future the scene was, but based on his growth rate, even if it was just tens of thousands of years later, his strength would be at the peak of the 13th-level, posing no threat to the so-called invincible saints and supreme celestial beings of that time.</p><p></p><p>In that case, his choice to voluntarily extinguish everything could only be due to the threat of a time being.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew that extinguishing the physical body, soul, and will in the chaotic void did not mean complete death for him, as his self in the Source World would still be living well.</p><p></p><p>"Given my personality, I wouldn't be so impulsive as to forcibly activate the Heavenly Void Urn and completely destroy a place related to a 13th-level time being, would I?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Heavenly Void Urn would draw the attention of the owner of this 13th-level weapon, and destroying a special place would offend a 13th-level time being. Such consequences were beyond what Lin Yuan could bear, unless he had already become a time being himself, but at that time, he was still not a match for the 13th-level.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I have incurred some great enmity?" Lin Yuan wondered. "Perhaps with the human civilization clan?"</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's speculation, since he was so isolated, the only possibility of incurring great enmity would be with the human civilization clan.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he was willing to give up everything in the chaotic void just to completely destroy that special place, indicating an irreconcilable hatred between them.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it was not just hatred, but the spirit of that special place had learned of his secret, which provoked his future self to take action.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was filled with various possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I am not yet a time being, so even though I've seen a glimpse of the future, it's difficult for me to infer specific information," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The information revealed in the scene was really too little, with most areas being extremely blurred. He could only vaguely sense the presence of a few other special place spirits in the distance.</p><p></p><p>If he were a true 13th-level time being, he would be able to carefully observe all the details of this future timeline, understand the causes and consequences, and then decide whether to follow this timeline or not.</p><p></p><p>13th-level time beings have the ability to choose their own future. If they see a timeline they are not satisfied with, they can terminate it at a certain point.</p><p></p><p>The competition between 13th-level time beings mainly depends on how many future timelines they can observe. The stronger the 13th-level time being, the more future timelines they can see, and the greater their advantage in confrontations at the same level.</p><p></p><p>For example, there might suddenly be a fierce battle between two 13th-level beings at a critical future juncture, without any prior enmity or warning. It's likely that these two time beings are trying to correct the future they want.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wanted to continue observing the future timeline through the Heavenly Void Urn, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his soul and had to stop.</p><p></p><p>The future timeline belonged to the 13th-level realm, and Lin Yuan could only barely touch it with the help of the Heavenly Void Urn, with great limitations.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it," Lin Yuan collected his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The past is set, but the future is uncertain. Every moment can lead to countless possible futures, and even 13th-level time beings cannot observe all future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the future scene Lin Yuan just saw would never actually happen, and was just one of the infinitesimal possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I should try to stay low-key from now on, restrain the human civilization clan, and avoid getting involved with those special places," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if he gave up everything in this chaotic void, it would still be a devastating loss for him. It would be best if he could avoid that.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's plan, he would not cause any major disturbances before reaching the 13th-level.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, in the Treasure Land...</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Soulbinding Celestial Venerable of the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom also came to Lin Yuan, wanting to trade the forty-five treasure lands that his kingdom had occupied and refined.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom, the requirements put forth by the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom were even more outrageous, directly demanding the ownership of this treasure land for the next 100 billion years.</p><p></p><p>That meant that even if the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom eventually seized this treasure land, for the next 100 billion years, it would have nothing to do with them, and all the rare treasures produced would belong to the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Venerable, our Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom has occupied and refined the core celestial pillars, a total of forty-five. If you obtain them, you will instantly surpass the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom," the Soulbinding Celestial Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>So far, the most likely contenders to seize this treasure land were the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom and the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, with the Savage Wilderness Ancient Kingdom as the next possibility.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining three ancient kingdoms, they basically had no hope.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it," Lin Yuan did not directly refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The Soulbinding Celestial Venerable nodded. If Lin Yuan had agreed immediately, he would not have been reassured.</p><p></p><p>After the Soulbinding Celestial Venerable left, the Crimson Flame Celestial Venerable looked at Lin Yuan and said, "The Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom and the Great Spirit Ancient Kingdom have both come to us. The Lightning Thunder Ancient Kingdom hasn't come, so they've probably completely sided with the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Celestial Venerable's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>The Lightning Thunder Ancient Kingdom had occupied and refined thirty-eight core celestial pillars, all of which would now belong to the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom, making their total number of core celestial pillars exceed a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter," Lin Yuan said calmly. "Let's wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Time continued to flow.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a strange fluctuation once again swept through the Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>The supreme celestial venerables of the various ancient kingdoms all looked towards the source of the fluctuation - the second giant core celestial pillar had emerged.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

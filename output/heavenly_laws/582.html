        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You are very good," the girl in red clothes said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>So good that she couldn't find any flaws to criticize.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At least so far, the cultivation of the second layer of his "Infinite Void" technique had not encountered any major problems.</p><p></p><p>"If the master wants to measure the progress of the cultivation of the universe within his body, he can use this method," the girl in red clothes spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"What method?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the first layer of the "Infinite Void", the second layer, or the subsequent third and fourth layers, the essence was to first break down the most basic constituent particles of the universe within the body, and then reassemble them in a more perfect and even flawless manner.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan needed to comprehend more than three thousand methods of constructing the universe during the Jade Gourd trial.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the "Infinite Void" was to replace the initial structure of the universe within the body. </p><p></p><p>And in order to ensure the stability of the universe within the body, the reassembly and recombination of the microscopic particles within the universe would be done step by step.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, when Lin Yuan had completely cultivated the second layer of the "Infinite Void", he would be unable to determine exactly what stage he had reached. He would only find that the universe within his body was becoming more and more stable and its foundation was becoming thicker and thicker, until the complete cultivation of the second layer, when the universe within his body would undergo the final transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please look," the girl in red clothes flipped her hand, and a several-meter-large metal block flew out of the Jade Gourd.</p><p></p><p>The surface of this metal block was a dark golden color, faintly emanating an aura of immortality.</p><p></p><p>"This is Immortal Refined Gold," the girl in red clothes introduced simply, "It is a special material with the only characteristic being its hardness and difficulty to destroy."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Refined Gold?" Lin Yuan carefully examined the dark golden metal in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of this kind of metal before, but since it could be taken out by the girl in red clothes, it must have come from the founder of the "Infinite Void" inheritance.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for Lin Yuan not to have heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"With the foundation of your universe within, if you fully mobilize the power of your universe within and then suppress this Immortal Refined Gold, as long as you can leave a half-meter deep mark on its surface, you will be considered to be very close to the completion of the second layer.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the universe within you will basically be the strongest under the realm of Chaotic Perfection."</p><p></p><p>This was the standard the girl in red clothes had deduced based on the abundant foundation of Lin Yuan's universe within.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's universe within had accumulated far more than the theoretical "Infinite Void" cultivator's universe within.</p><p></p><p>This was something the girl in red clothes had perceived as soon as she entered.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even after experiencing the absorption and refinement of the seven liquids in front of the Jade Gourd, and with the infusion of the origin of the Chaotic Void, it would still be difficult to possess such a vast universe within at the initial entry into the Twelve Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Only half a meter deep?" Lin Yuan looked at the Immortal Refined Gold.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Sovereign Realm, and with the recent cultivation of the "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan's universe within had increased by a large margin in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Even a newly ascended Sovereign like the Nine Profound Venerable, if they fell into Lin Yuan's universe within, could be crushed into powder with a single breath.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Sovereign Realm, when the Nine Profound Venerable was under the suppression of Lin Yuan's bodily divine ability 'World', he could barely withstand the final self-explosion, and now it would be almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current foundation, even at the peak of the Chaotic Realm, it would be difficult for them to withstand the self-explosion of his universe within.</p><p></p><p>But now? Just to leave a half-meter deep mark on this Immortal Refined Gold?</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it a try," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the infinite origin within his universe began to operate, and the space around the dark golden metal began to distort and collapse.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A mark about 10 centimeters deep appeared on the surface of the Immortal Refined Gold.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan continued to mobilize the power of his universe within to suppress it, but found that it was difficult to go any deeper, let alone leave a mark.</p><p></p><p>"The deeper into the Primal Gold, the harder it becomes," the girl in red clothes said beside him. "Master, the fact that you can leave a 10-centimeter mark on the Primal Gold surface is already very good."</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes was genuinely praising him. Normally, the universe within of those who had cultivated the first layer of the "Infinite Void" could not even leave a 1-centimeter mark.</p><p></p><p>How long had Lin Yuan been cultivating the second layer of the "Infinite Void"?</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the universe within Master is the strongest under the realm of Chaotic Perfection, even including those extraordinary existences," the girl in red clothes said.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Perfection was the realm of Great Saints, and at this level of the Chaotic Realm, the life form would undergo a qualitative change, with all aspects greatly increasing, including the universe within.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was still a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>If he could leave a half-meter mark on the Immortal Refined Gold, it would be equivalent to his universe within being the strongest under the realm of Chaotic Perfection.</p><p></p><p>But now, compared to the strongest, he still had some distance to go.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate, cultivate!" Lin Yuan's true body and master continued to cultivate the second layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>Source World. </p><p>The Core Defense War. </p><p>A seat...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Class-A War Mecha.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in a state of transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The more I contemplate, the more I feel how insignificant I am."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, his expression quite pensive.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic inscriptions contained within the War Mecha were only a part of the true chaotic principles. Even the Class-A War Mecha was just a part, only more complete compared to the Class-B or Class-C War Mechas.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that beyond the chaotic inscriptions of the Class-A War Mecha lies the complete context of the chaotic principles?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Transcending the Class-A War Mecha could accommodate many Grand Ancestor-level experts, and perfectly fuse the chaotic evolutionary powers of multiple Grand Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Which of the powers evolved from the chaotic principles was not unique? Each Grand Ancestor's exclusive chaotic evolutionary power was different, even the same Chaotic Flames had countless variations.</p><p></p><p>To fuse all these chaotic evolutionary powers together? How inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"If I could comprehend the chaotic inscriptions beyond the Class-A War Mecha, it would greatly benefit my understanding of the chaotic principles."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, abandoning this unrealistic idea.</p><p></p><p>War Mechas that transcend Class-A generally only appear during all-out wars between the two ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>For wars of such intensity, where Celestial Ancestor-level experts intervene and ancient nation emperors oversee, to comprehend a War Mecha beyond Class-A? At the very least, he would need to seek the consent of the ancient nation emperors.</p><p></p><p>"However, I can already replicate the chaotic inscriptions contained within the War Mecha in the Chaotic Void. As long as I gather enough materials, I can completely replicate a War Mecha in the Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, feeling that Qiansong King believed Lin Yuan would find it very difficult to comprehend even the chaotic inscriptions of a Class-C War Mecha.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, the War Mecha inscriptions Lin Yuan had comprehended in this period numbered not less than a hundred, most of the Class-C War Mecha's chaotic inscriptions had been comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan naturally would not spread this news externally.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue contemplating the chaotic inscriptions, he suddenly had a thought.</p><p></p><p>"Has the divine imprint of the 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens' technique been comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The seventh bodily divine technique, 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens', was undoubtedly the most powerful among the bodily divine techniques he had awakened.</p><p></p><p>In order to use this technique in the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan had focused most of his mental energy on comprehending this technique.</p><p></p><p>Even though comprehending these chaotic inscriptions that were greatly beneficial to enhancing his understanding of the chaotic principles, Lin Yuan did not devote himself fully, but instead placed the majority of his energy on comprehending the divine imprint.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally felt at ease, as before comprehending this technique, he was afraid that he might suddenly perish and die completely in this Source World, preventing him from bringing this technique to the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was currently cultivating the second layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, and before him, strands of power began to intertwine and weave, ultimately forming an extremely complex and mysterious divine imprint.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens' divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was joyful, for having comprehended the corresponding divine imprint was equivalent to this bodily divine technique being usable among his various true body incarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try to integrate it with the cosmic power within my body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to attempt this.</p><p></p><p>Even before comprehending the 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens' divine imprint, Lin Yuan had this idea.</p><p></p><p>It's just that without comprehending the divine imprint, he was unable to completely replicate this bodily divine technique, so it remained just an idea, essentially unachievable.</p><p></p><p>But now? Since he had already comprehended this divine imprint, he could go and verify his conjecture.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it first on the incarnation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not attempt this on his true body incarnation, as if any accidents occurred, even though he had life-saving measures, the collapse of the cosmic power within his true body incarnation would still be a massive loss.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation was much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred.</p><p></p><p>An incarnation manifested before him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the incarnation also began to open its internal cosmos.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to his true body incarnation, as well as the two Elemental Spirits' internal cosmos, the incarnation's internal cosmos was only equivalent to the peak of the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Within the incarnation's internal cosmos, Lin Yuan condensed the source of the Blazing Sun using the 'Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens' technique, illuminating the entire internal cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the pervasive radiance of the Blazing Sun, the incarnation's internal cosmos began to rapidly collapse and disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to withstand the source of the Blazing Sun?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately identified the problem - the internal cosmos opened by the incarnation was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's try it on the Elemental Spirits?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the two Elemental Spirits had also cultivated the 'Infinite Void', although they had not undergone the baptism of the Chaotic Void's primal source multiple times, but they were still stronger than the internal cosmos of most Chaotic Venerable experts.</p><p></p><p>"Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Elemental Spirits' internal cosmos collapses, the loss would not be great."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided out a conscious incarnation, descending into the internal cosmos of the Yin Elemental Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Parting the Heavens, condense!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a flickering flame appeared, slowly burning and expanding, wherever the sunlight reached, it became a domain.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the Blazing Sun source continuously opening up the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Observing all of this, Lin Yuan's pupils slightly contracted.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter complete)</p>

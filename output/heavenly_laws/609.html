        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the master of the Demonic Jade Tower who had just reconstituted in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He was ready to admit defeat and withdraw from the ninth floor of the Black Tower at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This was because, first, he had just detonated the outer universe and was currently in a weakened state.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, although the aura fluctuations of the current master of the Demonic Jade Tower were not as strong as in the beginning, the threat he posed to Lin Yuan was the greatest. Even if he just stood there silently, there was an air of supreme dominance over the four corners of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower said, looking at Lin Yuan with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to the six-armed figure Shengji, the imprint left behind by the master of the ninth floor Demonic Jade Tower was merely a fixed 'program'-like existence.</p><p></p><p>But now? </p><p></p><p>He had actually spoken a sentence expressing personal emotional evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"Very good," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower continued, evaluating further.</p><p></p><p>"Senior?" Lin Yuan called out tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the current state of the master of the Demonic Jade Tower, since the other party had not immediately attacked him, he presumably did not have any hostility.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you have passed the ninth floor of the Black Tower," the master said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"As for me now, I am a trace of consciousness left behind by the original master. I have been completely cut off from the true body, but after awakening, the connection has been re-established, and I will likely soon fall back into the time loop again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was inwardly shocked upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the current master of the Demonic Jade Tower was not just a soulless 'imprint', but a separated consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This consciousness was different from Tuolong Dasheng's 'soul fragment'. The soul fragment was already considered a completely new life, just with the same memories as the original.</p><p></p><p>But this consciousness was still part of the master of the Demonic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many Chaotic Saints were unwilling to leave behind such soul fragments. The stronger the Saint, the more they felt this way. Soul fragments lacked power, and their fate was often not good if they fell into the hands of certain Saints.</p><p></p><p>Since this consciousness still belonged to the master of the Demonic Jade Tower, even if it awakened briefly, it would quickly fall back into the time loop again.</p><p></p><p>The time loop that one encounters when breaking through from the Tenth to the Thirteenth Realm was a test from the Chaotic Void. No matter what means were used, as long as it was the same life, it could not be avoided.</p><p></p><p>"You should have cultivated the heritage corresponding to that existence, no, it's not quite right, you've actually fused other Thirteenth Realm inheritances as well?" the master of the Demonic Jade Tower asked, examining Lin Yuan with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Fusing different Thirteenth Realm inheritances, that's quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The master had seen the terrifying power unleashed by the imprint he had left behind when it had just clashed with Lin Yuan and even detonated the outer universe in the end.</p><p></p><p>So the information he had gathered was far more than what those special existences had observed from afar when Lin Yuan fought with Heixiao Dasheng and Shuangyuan Dasheng in the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Heixiao Dasheng, Shuangyuan Dasheng had not used their full strength in their battle, not even close to detonating the outer universe, let alone fully activating it. Of course, Heixiao Dasheng and Shuangyuan Dasheng had also not used their true killing methods, not even entering the Xuanhuang Universe, so they naturally did not fight with full force.</p><p></p><p>"I was just lucky," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He was not surprised that the master of the Demonic Jade Tower had discovered his cultivation of the "Infinite Void". At the Peerless Saint realm, Thirteenth Realm inheritances were not too secretive.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that the master could tell he had fused other Thirteenth Realm techniques made Lin Yuan inwardly shocked. This meant the master was very familiar with the "Infinite Void" and knew the scope of its power.</p><p></p><p>"There's no such thing as luck," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower smiled. "Cultivating a Thirteenth Realm inheritance is extremely difficult. If I hadn't slain that extraordinary life, I wouldn't have reached the threshold to cultivate that Thirteenth Realm inheritance either."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've also cultivated a Thirteenth Realm inheritance?" Lin Yuan asked the master.</p><p></p><p>He knew how terrifying Thirteenth Realm inheritances were. The fact that he could rival Chaotic Saints at the Sovereign Realm was not solely due to the "Infinite Void", but this Thirteenth Realm inheritance had played a crucial role in elevating his foundation to a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Demonic Jade Tower was a Peerless Saint, and he had also cultivated some kind of Thirteenth Realm inheritance. How powerful must his strength be? Not only could he sweep aside other Peerless Saints, he was probably on par with them as well.</p><p></p><p>"The hardest part of a Thirteenth Realm inheritance is the cultivation, not the acquisition," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower smiled. "With your current strength, once you reach the perfected Chaotic Realm, your power may even surpass mine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened obediently. Based on his own assessment, that was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could break through to the perfected Chaotic Realm, ordinary Peerless Saints would not be his opponents at all. </p><p></p><p>The only ones who could pose a slight threat to him then would be other Peerless Saints who had also cultivated Thirteenth Realm inheritances, or those special Peerless Saints. But even then, they would only be a minor threat, as Lin Yuan had too many trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"When I built this Black Tower, I had hoped to cultivate a Chaotic Saint, but I never succeeded during my lifetime, and after falling into the time loop, one has actually appeared," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower said, his tone slightly wistful as he looked around.</p><p></p><p>During the heyday of the Demonic Jade Tower, the master had been an invincible Saint who swept through the Chaotic Void. He did have some Chaotic Saints and even Peerless Saints who had pledged allegiance to him.</p><p></p><p>But these Chaotic Saints and Peerless Saints were outsiders, not the Demonic Jade Tower's own disciples. They didn't even have the qualification to enter this Demonic Jade space, let alone pass through the nine floors of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Realm cultivated by the Demonic Jade Tower itself had never produced a Saint.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Saints could not be forcibly cultivated, even for a powerful master like the Demonic Jade Tower's. If that were possible, the Demonic Jade Tower would not have fallen into decline.</p><p></p><p>"So Senior is still trapped in the time loop," Lin Yuan probed.</p><p></p><p>"You want to ask about the time loop and breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm, don't you?" the master of the Demonic Jade Tower smiled slightly. "I have indeed left corresponding arrangements in other places, which should have all been taken away by now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Xuanhuang Emperor had left behind the Xuanhuang Universe, the master of the Demonic Jade Tower had probably left a similar place.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Universe had only emerged recently, but that didn't mean the place the master of the Demonic Jade Tower left behind hadn't emerged yet - it all depended on the conditions.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Xuanhuang Emperor or the master of the Demonic Jade Tower, they had both reached the point of breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm and fallen into the time loop, so their influence on the outside world was quite limited.</p><p></p><p>"But if you only want information about breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm and the time loop, I can certainly provide that for you," the master of the Demonic Jade Tower said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The artifact was only one, but the information and intelligence could be replicated.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." Lin Yuan was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Universe had emerged, and many Chaos Saints like the Black Agate Saint and the Dual Source Saint had come at great cost. What were they after? The precious treasures and rarities within the Xuanhuang Universe?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, there were such intentions, but that was not the main purpose.</p><p></p><p>These Saints were more eager to obtain the views and cognitions of Emperor Xuanhuang regarding the exploration of the Thirteenth Realm and time loops.</p><p></p><p>So-called treasures and rarities, after all, are just external forces and do not help in the slightest with breaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower raised his right hand and pointed at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large amount of information flooded into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Breaching the Thirteenth Realm time loop," Lin Yuan's expression became pensive.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower and Emperor Xuanhuang's exploration and cognition of time loops did not come out of thin air, but originated from other sources.</p><p></p><p>However, any life form that breaches the Thirteenth Realm and falls into a time loop cannot influence the outside world, let alone transmit information and intelligence about the time loop they have fallen into.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to obtain accurate knowledge and exploration of time loops, one can only obtain it from those who have successfully navigated through the time loops.</p><p></p><p>And the ones who have navigated through time loops? They are the Thirteenth Realm time beings.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why many peerless great Saints have traversed the chaotic void, pursuing the footsteps of the Thirteenth Realm time beings.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower has traveled through countless void domains, delving into the remnants of dangerous places, and has once had the fortune to see a Thirteenth Realm time being, receiving many intelligence and information from it regarding breaching the Thirteenth Realm and time loops.</p><p></p><p>"The time loops experienced by each Chaos Realm Perfection are different. In simple terms, you cannot prepare in advance." The Master of the Demon Jade Tower looked at Lin Yuan: "In the future, when you breach the Thirteenth Realm, the time loop you fall into will definitely be something you have never experienced before, the most unfamiliar challenge."</p><p></p><p>"For example, if your attainments in space are very high, then the time loop you fall into will have nothing to do with space."</p><p></p><p>"In my view, the so-called time loops are formed specifically based on your most lacking, most weak aspects."</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower said.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly understood. No wonder the Myriad Laws Eye had told him not to pay too much attention to time loops, because there was no need to pay attention to them.</p><p></p><p>Paying attention or not, it would not help with any advance preparation.</p><p></p><p>The vast amount of information and intelligence the Master of the Demon Jade Tower had given him also explained this point in detail, and even provided specific cases.</p><p></p><p>For example, in this Chaos Void, the time loop faced by a certain Thirteenth Realm time being when they breached the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>This Thirteenth Realm being was born as a rare and wondrous life form, one of the most talented wondrous life forms nurtured by the Chaos Void, with an extremely rich time bloodline and the strength of Chaos Realm Perfection from the moment of birth. They were the unrivaled great Saint of that era.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the time loop they fell into was the time loop of an ant.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it meant descending into the body of an ant, in a world without any rules or extraordinary powers, where the insights and understandings of great Saints were completely useless.</p><p></p><p>Even the speed of mental operation became extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>To break this time loop, they had to lead the ant tribe and become the strongest group in the world.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that ants are the weakest life forms in that world, and to become the strongest group without relying on any extraordinary powers or cultivation systems, this Thirteenth Realm time being almost fell into despair. In the end, after repeated planning, they utilized the pure physical rules of that time loop world, climbed the technology tree, created one "high-tech" weapon after another from scratch, and eventually crushed those life forms that were countless times stronger in body size.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they manage to escape that time loop.</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult," Lin Yuan couldn't help but feel troubled.</p><p></p><p>You are the most talented wondrous life form nurtured by the Chaos Void? Then let you experience the time loop of the weakest life form, the ant.</p><p></p><p>You are a solitary wanderer? Then let you lead the weakest group to become the strongest group.</p><p></p><p>You are the unrivaled great Saint? That time loop does not test your strength at all, nor is there any concept of strength. It is purely a test of physical strength, where size determines everything, and it strips away whatever you are good at.</p><p></p><p>"Technology."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan realized that the key for this Thirteenth Realm time being to break free from the time loop was technology.</p><p></p><p>It can be inferred that this Thirteenth Realm time being had never encountered technology before, otherwise the time loop would not have been such a test of technology.</p><p></p><p>Without prior exposure to technology, the test was on technology itself. Once they grasped technology, the challenge of the time loop would be something else.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder in the history of the Chaos Void, the number of Chaos Realm Perfection who have successfully crossed into the Thirteenth Realm is so few."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, if the time loops were indeed so targeted, even for peerless great Saints, the possibility of passing through them would be almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of time loop I will experience when I breach the Thirteenth Realm in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself, it would definitely not be anything he currently excels at.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I am now in the Xuanhuang Universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said, wanting to obtain some intelligence and information from the Master of the Demon Jade Tower regarding Emperor Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Although time loops cannot be prepared for in advance, the exploration and cognition provided by the Master of the Demon Jade Tower has brought Lin Yuan considerable help.</p><p></p><p>Since prevention is impossible, the best approach is to understand all aspects of one's abilities as comprehensively as possible. In this way, even if faced with challenges in time loops that one has never encountered before, one can still navigate through them. The more one knows, the greater the chance of successfully overcoming them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan was also eager to learn about Emperor Xuanhuang's exploration and cognition of time loops.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Xuanhuang..."</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower pondered for a while: "I don't know much about him, only that his reason for breaching the Thirteenth Realm was not for great freedom, but to revive his former companion."</p><p></p><p>"Revive his former companion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback. Thirteenth Realm time beings can see through the past and future timelines, and can revive any life that has existed in the past, including Twelfth Realm beings who have already broken free from the constraints of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know anything else." </p><p></p><p>The Master of the Demon Jade Tower shook his head slightly. "But I've heard that before breaching the Thirteenth Realm, he entered a certain dimensional gap, and after returning, he immediately prepared to breach the Thirteenth Realm, so he must have encountered something in that dimensional gap."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional gap refers to the space between different dimensional realms.</p><p></p><p>And the dimensional realms capable of being separated from the Chaos Void are likely no weaker than the Chaos Void itself. The dimensional gaps between the two may well give birth to some terrible existences.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

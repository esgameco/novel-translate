            <p>Chapter 252: I am the Martial Ancestor, Feeling the Divine Radiance (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still cultivating.</p><p></p><p>But he was pulled out of the room by his mother, Shen Zhen.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, I'm taking you to a good place."</p><p></p><p>Mother Shen Zhen said in a mysterious tone.</p><p></p><p>"A good place?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite helpless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The two came outside.</p><p></p><p>Father Lin Jianping had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>His expression was full of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"The place we are going to this time is the Martial Temple."</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, when you get there, you must not mess around."</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping warned.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial cultivation system is far less influential than the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>But in Xiaoyao City, the Martial Temple is the only heaven, controlling everything and commanding everything.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Xuanwang Domain, the Martial Temple is one of the most powerful forces under the Daode Immortal Sect. The combat power of several martial stage seven experts is not inferior to ordinary Hedao period true immortals.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had long speculated that the Martial Temple should be established by those disciples he had previously accepted, such as Li Qing and others.</p><p></p><p>The purpose is to ensure the inheritance of the martial cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>In the center of Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>That majestic Xiaoyao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This is the location of the Martial Temple, the most core place of the entire Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>Those few martial stage seven experts who established the Martial Temple are often at war for the Daode Immortal Sect. The strongest in the Martial Temple is only at martial stage six, but it is enough to overlook the entire Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>Among the hundreds of thousands of cities in the Xuanwang Domain, Xiaoyao City can rank in the top hundred.</p><p></p><p>It is because of the existence of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A spirit boat flew closer.</p><p></p><p>"The lord of the Martial Temple, my son is going in to feel the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor." Lin Jianping took out a token.</p><p></p><p>It was bronze in color, with the character "Wu" written on it.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of Xiaoyao Mountain, several guards glanced at the token and released the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Jianping thanked them again, and then led Lin Yuan and Shen Zhen inside.</p><p></p><p>"Using the back door again."</p><p></p><p>The guards sneered after Lin Jianping and the three disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Since the establishment of Xiaoyao City, every once in a while, many people would come to feel the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Among these people, a very small number are invited by the Martial Temple to come and feel the divine radiance because of their astonishing martial talent.</p><p></p><p>But most of them are here to "freeload" on the divine radiance.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups of the Martial Temple did not intervene in this matter. One reason is that it can add a source of income for the Martial Temple, and the other is that it has little impact on themselves.</p><p></p><p>After the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor is activated, the divine radiance envelops, and the time is fixed. Those disciples with astonishing martial talent have priority to feel it.</p><p></p><p>After they finish feeling it, it's the turn of those behind.</p><p></p><p>"To use the back door, you need to have the ability to use the back door." Another guard sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Feeling the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor, indirectly receiving guidance from martial experts comparable to true immortals, if it were you, wouldn't you be willing?"</p><p></p><p>This guard shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"I would naturally be willing."</p><p></p><p>The guard who spoke first was silent for a while, but still told the truth.</p><p></p><p>The guidance of the strong is too important.</p><p></p><p>Especially the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor, it not only has the effect of guidance but can also determine which aspect of martial arts the perceiver is good at.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, Lin Yuan saw that this was an extremely huge mountain peak, with strands of aura permeating every inch of the air, obviously outsiders dare not break in, they would be suppressed by forces coming from all directions at the first moment.</p><p></p><p>"Using martial arts methods, combined with immortal formation techniques, it's quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, Lin Yuan saw through the essence of Xiaoyao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Inside Xiaoyao Mountain, from time to time, there will be big shots from the Martial Temple passing by. If Lin Yuan's gaze offends any of them, wouldn't it be a disaster for no reason?</p><p></p><p>The few people quickly arrived in front of a teleportation formation along the road.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Mountain is too vast, it takes at least half a day to reach the Martial Temple at the top of the mountain, so at the foot of the mountain, there is usually a teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>At the indication of the Martial Temple disciples.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the three walked into the teleportation formation, and in an instant, they arrived at the top of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few people."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhen curiously looked around.</p><p></p><p>She found that many people were gathered in twos and threes, talking with their heads down.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, a huge wall stood, that was the place where the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was activated.</p><p></p><p>However, it is currently closed, and no one is allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, we are not the only ones who come to feel the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor. Xiaoyao City is so big, many forces and families will send their children here to feel it when the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor is activated."</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family in Xiaoyao City is just a small name, far inferior to those real local snakes.</p><p></p><p>Letting Lin Yuan feel the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor once requires exhausting most of the Lin family's wealth, but for those local snakes, they will send a group of clansmen to feel it every time it is activated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was listening on the side.</p><p></p><p>Most of his mind was focused on the wall behind.</p><p></p><p>"Divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had some guesses in his heart. Before leaving the Zhongtu Shenzhoushi world, he had left seven statues, on which were engraved his brief summaries of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was pondering.</p><p></p><p>The big door in the center of the huge wall in the distance slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>An old man in a black robe walked out.</p><p></p><p>"The divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor is about to envelop, those whose names are called, go in and feel it."</p><p></p><p>This black-robed old man's words were concise, and he spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed old man continued.</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>A young man stood up and strode through the door.</p><p></p><p>"Feel it well." The black-robed old man's face showed an appreciative look and reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Song?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't he the number one martial arts genius in Xiaoyao City in the past fifty years?"</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this Ouyang Song has comprehended the power of thunder, which is a power known for its killing power." The rest of the crowd started discussing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>Most of them brought their descendants through the back door, and their martial arts talent was far inferior to Ouyang Song's.</p><p></p><p>On the top of Xiaoyao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In another place.</p><p></p><p>Several figures were sitting cross-legged, staring at the location enveloped by the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that this time the activation of the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor can add a few talents to our Martial Temple."</p><p></p><p>The leading figure sighed and said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"The divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor contains the understanding of martial arts by the three old ancestors, as well as the explanation of that Martial Ancestor. Any cultivator, as long as they cultivate martial arts and feel the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor, will definitely not come away empty-handed."</p><p></p><p>The second figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>"That Martial Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>The other few people heard these words, and their expressions were slightly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>They learned about the title of the Martial Ancestor from the mouths of the three martial stage seven old ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivation system today can have today's scale, thanks to that Martial Ancestor, and</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A certain true immortal bigwig from the Moral Immortal Sect obtained it through negotiation.</p><p></p><p>However--</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, none of the martial arts cultivators at the Martial Temple had ever seen the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the square below.</p><p></p><p>During the waiting period, the many people who came through the back door to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor began to chat with each other.</p><p></p><p>"This divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was left by the three martial arts masters of the Martial Temple who are comparable to true immortals, but in fact, the divine radiance originates from the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor? I've heard this name before, but I've never heard of his specific deeds. I thought it was made up. Could this person really exist?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I actually know a bit about this. The three martial arts masters at the 7th stage who are comparable to true immortals in today's Martial Temple ascended from the lower realm."</p><p></p><p>"And that Martial Ancestor was the master of these three 7th stage martial arts masters in the lower realm."</p><p></p><p>"The master of three true immortals? Then what realm is the Martial Ancestor at now?"</p><p></p><p>"Not sure. After the three 7th stage masters of the Martial Temple ascended, they tried to find the Martial Ancestor, but in the end nothing came of it."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that Martial Ancestor didn't ascend at all, or perhaps he ascended but got trapped somewhere. The spiritual realm is boundless, filled with all kinds of dangerous lands, it's very normal."</p><p></p><p>Many discussions arose.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is an impressive existence." After a long while, Lin Jianping spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You don't even know the Martial Ancestor, how do you know he's impressive?" Shen Zhen rolled her eyes at Lin Jianping.</p><p></p><p>"You just don't understand." Lin Jianping shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor?" Lin Yuan listened on the side. </p><p></p><p>"Three 7th stage martial arts masters? Is it Li Qing? And other disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. The White Jade Pavilion he established took in hundreds of disciples and personally taught them martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But there were only a few who had hopes of stepping into the 7th stage.</p><p></p><p>On another part of the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>Several high-level members of the Martial Temple were observing the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts genius Ouyang Song sat cross-legged, feeling the divine radiance emanating from the seven statues in front of him at close range, his expression changing unpredictably.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Among the seven statues, the first statue on the left emitted 30% radiance.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts genius Ouyang Song suddenly opened his eyes, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad. This statue symbolizes the Dao of killing. 30% radiance is considered very good. Xiaoyao City hasn't produced such talent in a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The leading figure nodded and commented.</p><p></p><p>These seven statues contained different directions of martial arts and could select the future path for the perceiver.</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Song can be accepted as an inner disciple and cultivated as a key disciple."</p><p></p><p>Another figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Inner disciple? Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if he reached 40% radiance, he could definitely be included as a core disciple."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"Being an inner disciple is not bad. In the future, he has hope of stepping into the 4th stage of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>The few figures discussed for a while and finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>One martial arts genius after another experienced the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the end, three became inner disciples of the Martial Temple, one became a core disciple, and six became ordinary disciples.</p><p></p><p>With this.</p><p></p><p>The divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was basically over.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining people lining up to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor? They basically all came through the back door, and their aptitude was far from qualifying to join the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was extremely special. Even if one didn't have martial arts aptitude, experiencing it a little would still have a significant improvement effect on oneself.</p><p></p><p>There was no threshold for experiencing the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor. Even Immortal Dao cultivators could experience it.</p><p></p><p>"It's my turn, it's my turn."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up in front, the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor is about to go out."</p><p></p><p>Those who came through the back door to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor began to urge.</p><p></p><p>Those martial arts geniuses experiencing the divine radiance didn't dare say half a word, because as soon as they interjected, they would be expelled from the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>But now, those going in to perceive were all from the back door. Under the circumstance that the time enveloped by the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was fixed, naturally the faster the better.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>Several high-level members of the Martial Temple patiently observed for a while.</p><p></p><p>They immediately lost interest.</p><p></p><p>Those who came through the back door to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor basically didn't have a compatibility with martial arts higher than 10%.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why they allowed these people from the back door to experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>One cannot be deprived of the Martial Ancestor's guidance just because one is not a martial arts genius.</p><p></p><p>In the square below.</p><p></p><p>It was soon Lin Yuan's turn to enter and experience the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Son, don't feel pressured, just casually experience it." Shen Zhen encouraged Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Casually experience it?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Lin Jianping's mouth twitched. This was the opportunity he exchanged for with most of his wealth.</p><p></p><p>But in order not to make Lin Yuan nervous, Lin Jianping still said, "What your mom said is right, don't feel pressured."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I know." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and walked through the gate.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz.</p><p></p><p>The seven statues emitted a faint divine radiance.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the black robe stood on the side.</p><p></p><p>"Sit here and close your eyes to perceive." The old man in the black robe said calmly, his tone without the slightest fluctuation, obviously not knowing how many times he had said it.</p><p></p><p>"Sit there?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the seven statues, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Because he really didn't know how to perceive.</p><p></p><p>When other people came here, they would only feel that the divine radiance was filled with countless mysteries.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor was something he had played with to the point of boredom hundreds of years ago.</p><p></p><p>It's like an elementary school student doing middle school questions, needing to rack their brains and concentrate to think.</p><p></p><p>But when a doctoral student does middle school questions, they can see the answer at a glance, so what is there to think about?</p><p></p><p>"How to perceive?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a bit and still asked one more question.</p><p></p><p>"Just close your eyes and the divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor will naturally resonate with you."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in front of the statues according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The ubiquitous divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor quickly enveloped Lin Yuan and gradually began to resonate.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The seven statues simultaneously paused.</p><p></p><p>Even the originally ubiquitous divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor suddenly solidified.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the black robe, who originally wanted Lin Yuan to finish quickly so that the next perceiver could come, suddenly widened his eyes, looking at the scene in front of him in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the initial pause, the seven statues simultaneously emitted radiance, with 120% radiance filling each statue.</p><p></p><p>Strands of the Martial Ancestor's divine radiance constantly lingered around Lin Yuan's body, as if receiving a decree, and gathered at his feet.</p><p></p><p>"You, what kind of divine radiance of the Martial Ancestor did you perceive?"</p><p></p><p>The old man in the black robe trembled in his heart. Looking at Lin Yuan who was like a divine being, he subconsciously asked.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of radiance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the old man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>I am the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>What radiance am I perceiving.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the imperial capital was also a treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Here was the largest yang vein of the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, the sacred land for the cultivation of all powerful practitioners on the yang path.</p><p></p><p>"It is to be selected from the currently unassigned resource treasures."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor looked at Lin Yuan and shook his head, saying, "Take a closer look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and looked at the territorial map of the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom was vast and boundless, not limited to a certain spatial dimension, as long as it was within the temporal and spatial scope, it belonged to the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Any three unclaimed treasure lands can be selected?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The resource treasure lands of the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom were divided from top to bottom into first-class to ninth-class.</p><p></p><p>The first-class treasure lands had the highest value, and the ninth-class treasure lands had the lowest value.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when a royal family member is enfeoffed as a king, they would be granted one or two treasure lands, but they would usually be fourth-class or fifth-class treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>To occupy more precious resource treasure lands? It's possible, but one needs to exchange it with meritorious deeds.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's intention was to allow him to freely select any three treasure lands from the currently unclaimed ones? Wouldn't that mean he could directly select three first-class treasure lands? Occupying first-class treasure lands, in addition to the meritorious deeds granted by the ancient kingdom, the resources produced by the treasure lands themselves were also extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Even if nine-tenths were to be handed over to the ancient kingdom, the remaining one-tenth would be enough to make Celestial Venerable-level experts envious.</p><p></p><p>The resources produced by the treasure lands were not one-time, but continuous.</p><p></p><p>Some special resources were even priceless, as soon as they appeared, they would be bought up, and they could not be purchased at ordinary times.</p><p></p><p>"Consider it carefully, the more precious the treasure land, the more risks it entails."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Why do treasure lands require powerful practitioners to occupy them? It is because they need to withstand the risks.</p><p></p><p>These risks come from many reasons, some treasure lands are located at the border between two ancient kingdoms, and may face invasions from the opposing ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>And some treasure lands are connected to certain special dangerous areas, such as the first-class treasure land called "Star Sand River" in the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>It produces the precious resource star sand, which is a rare cultivation treasure, and even for Celestial Venerables, it has a significant effect, making it sought after by the powerful practitioners of various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>However, the bottom of the Star Sand River is connected to a mysterious world, and occasionally, the powerful practitioners from that mysterious world will invade along the Star Sand River.</p><p></p><p>The one occupying the Star Sand River must ensure its safety and the continuous output of star sand to be handed over to the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In general, the more precious the occupied resource treasure land, the greater the benefits, but as for the hidden dangers? If a treasure land is too dangerous, even if it is extremely precious, no powerful practitioner would choose to occupy it.</p><p></p><p>Once the resource requirements set by the ancient kingdom are not met while occupying a certain resource treasure land, one will be punished, so the Emperor reminded Lin Yuan to consider it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already familiarized himself with many of the resource treasure lands of the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom before coming here.</p><p></p><p>After all, any core royal family member would be granted one or two treasure lands, and Lin Yuan estimated that he would be no exception, he just didn't expect the Emperor to let him freely choose the treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>"My ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom is constantly at war with other ancient kingdoms, which is essentially a struggle for more precious resource treasure lands."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor smiled and asked, "Silver River, have you decided which three treasure lands to choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the many flickering lights on the territorial map in front of him, which were all the treasure lands he could choose from, and after a brief contemplation, he circled the three resource treasure lands he had selected.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Jade's Nest?" The Emperor and the Crimson Treasure King glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>The three treasure lands Lin Yuan chose were two first-class and one second-class.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Black Jade's Nest was one of the two first-class treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade's Nest produced a special resource called black jade, which could refine the spiritual will of living beings.</p><p></p><p>For powerful practitioners, spiritual will is extremely important, and its importance to the enhancement of one's strength is not as obvious as the physical body and soul, but it is also exceptionally crucial.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that the Black Jade's Nest can be listed as a first-class treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's choice of the Black Jade's Nest was also based on his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>The strength of spiritual will is more akin to the comprehension of the Dao, and it can synchronize with the chaotic void and this source world.</p><p></p><p>By occupying the Black Jade's Nest, he can obtain one-tenth of the black jade from this first-class treasure land, which Lin Yuan can use to refine his own spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of the spiritual will in the source world body and mind will naturally also lead to the improvement of the spiritual will of his true body and spirit in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Jade's Nest is located at the border between the ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom and the ancient Dark Yin Kingdom, which is not a safe place." The Emperor looked thoughtfully at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The black jade from the Black Jade's Nest is also useful for the powerful practitioners of the ancient Dark Yin Kingdom, so occupying this treasure land would require constantly facing the invasion of the ancient Dark Yin Kingdom's powerful practitioners.</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned to deploy a spirit avatar to permanently occupy the Black Jade's Nest.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the conflicts between the two ancient kingdoms, unless it is a large-scale or even full-scale war, the Celestial Venerable-level combat forces will not be mobilized.</p><p></p><p>Although the Black Jade's Nest is a precious first-class treasure land, only by long-term occupation and stable harvesting of the black jade can its benefits be fully realized.</p><p></p><p>Deploying a Celestial Venerable to occupy the Black Jade's Nest for a short period of time, and then being taken over by the enemy's Celestial Venerable, would not bring much benefit.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Lin Yuan's spirit avatar, although not as strong as his true body and spirit, is still far beyond the normal limit of core royal family members, and it is more than enough to occupy the Black Jade's Nest.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Black Jade's Nest, the other first-class treasure land he chose was also quite dangerous, and Lin Yuan planned to deploy another spirit avatar to occupy it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the last second-tier treasure land, although the resources it produces cannot be compared to the Black Jade, the risk is not too great. It is located in the heartland of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, and Lin Yuan only needs to dispatch a manifestation to guard it.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have already decided, here are the imperial edicts for those three treasure lands." </p><p></p><p>The Emperor said, and with a flip of his hand, three crystal stones appeared.</p><p></p><p>These three crystal stones, with auras faintly resonating with those three treasure lands, were the imperial edicts issued by the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the imperial palace,</p><p></p><p>Chibaowang was quite concerned: "Silver River, do you know who is currently replacing the ancient kingdom to suppress the Black Jade Nest?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Nest is located on the border between the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom and the Ancient Dark Yin Kingdom. Even if it had not been granted, they would still have sent someone to suppress it on their behalf.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the powerful cultivator deputized to suppress it would not be able to obtain the normal rewards for guarding a treasure land, and could only take one-tenth of the resource income.</p><p></p><p>Even so, given the preciousness of the Black Jade, even one-tenth would be enough to make many powerful cultivators envious.</p><p></p><p>"It is the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable." Chibaowang said.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable, although not of the royal lineage, possesses such formidable strength that even among the Celestial Venerables, he is considered exceptionally powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable dare to defy the Emperor's edict?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was granted the Black Jade Nest by the ancient kingdom's edict, so would the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable dare not to hand it over?</p><p></p><p>"He dares not directly defy it, but for many matters, as long as he does not directly violate it, it will do." </p><p></p><p>Chibaowang shook his head: "The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable has a great need for the Black Jade, which is why he has been deputized to guard the Black Jade Nest in place of the ancient kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Your edict to take over the Black Jade Nest, the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable dares not to defy, but he can delay it, as long as he uses the imminent invasion of the Ancient Dark Yin Kingdom as an excuse, he can completely delay your takeover."</p><p></p><p>"The longer he delays, the more Black Jade he can harvest, which is very profitable for the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable, and he cannot be accused of directly violating the Emperor's edict."</p><p></p><p>Chibaowang said.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I have dealt with that Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable a few times before, I will accompany you to the Black Jade Nest." After some thought, Chibaowang spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, brother Chibaowang, for coming along." Lin Yuan also knew of Chibaowang's goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Chibaowang has been active in the ancient kingdom for so long, and is very clear about many of the behind-the-scenes situations. With Chibaowang by his side, even if the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable wants to delay, he would have to find a reason that can stand up.</p><p></p><p>At the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>As a first-tier treasure land of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, this place naturally has a spatial transmission array connected to the capital.</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, a spatial passageway connected here, and an old man with a red beard and a young man walked out of the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Jade Nest, at its core, will condense a hundred jin of Black Jade every million years, of which ninety jin must be submitted to the ancient kingdom, and the guardian can keep ten jin." </p><p></p><p>Chibaowang began to introduce: "But according to the intelligence I've gathered, the Black Jade Nest actually produces more than a hundred jin of Black Jade every million years, usually between one hundred and ten jin to one hundred and twenty jin."</p><p></p><p>The output of a hundred jin of Black Jade per million years is just the minimum production of the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it will often exceed that.</p><p></p><p>And the excess portion naturally falls into the hands of the guardian.</p><p></p><p>While it is said that the guardian can only obtain one-tenth of the Black Jade output, in reality, the amount of Black Jade they actually obtain is close to two-tenths.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Chibaowang had just arrived.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the Black Jade Nest, a man in a red robe emerged.</p><p></p><p>There was a flickering flame at the center of his brow, which was a manifestation left behind by the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Chibaowang."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable calmly looked at Chibaowang, and also glanced at Lin Yuan standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun, I am here by the Emperor's edict to hand over this Black Jade Nest to brother Silver River." Chibaowang directly invoked the ancient kingdom's Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Black Jade Nest?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable fell silent. He had also received the order to relinquish the Black Jade Nest, so he was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"I have brought brother Silver River here now."</p><p></p><p>Chibaowang looked at the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable, and secretly transmitted a message to Lin Yuan:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River, no matter what excuses the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable tries to delay with, you don't need to say anything, just leave everything to me. I'm sure he won't dare to openly defy the Emperor's edict."</p><p></p><p>Chibaowang was prepared to completely offend the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable. He was determined to help Lin Yuan smoothly take over the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>If it gets dragged on? Who knows how long it would take, and most importantly, he would be mocked by the other Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable ignored Chibaowang and stared at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Such a strong Blazing Sun aura." The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable was secretly alarmed. As a Celestial Venerable, his perception was far beyond Chibaowang's, and he had a vague sense of the terrifying foundation of Lin Yuan's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, the Black Jade is no longer of much use to me now. This Silver River is so powerful, he must be receiving the full support of the ancient kingdom. Perhaps we will have the chance to deal with each other in the future, there's no need to completely offend him."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable weighed the pros and cons, and realized how he should proceed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, the Blazing Sun Celestial Venerable spoke in a deep voice: "Since the Emperor has issued the edict, I shall take my leave now. Brother Silver River, after you take over this treasure land, be careful of the Ancient Dark Yin Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 343 The Xuanhuang Emperor Above (End of this Volume, Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. ‡∂èüå∑‚ûÖ‚ùæùî∞ùïô‚ì§À£.ùí∏„Ññ–ºüê∏üíÄ  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with a slowly floating Xuanhuang-colored crystal in front of him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was just one small step away from fully refining the core of this secret realm. </p><p></p><p>It could take as short as half an hour or as long as several days to complete the final refinement.</p><p></p><p>Once done, Lin Yuan would take command of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, achieving what even the strongest beings in the universe yearned for but could not obtain.</p><p></p><p>The paramount experts of the major factions in the main universe, the solitary paramount experts, and all other twelfth-stage lifeforms coveted the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.  </p><p></p><p>Every time the secret realm opened, several paramount experts would try to lock onto its coordinates.</p><p></p><p>The other paramount experts who did not take action would also observe secretly. </p><p></p><p>If any variable occurred, they could rush over in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The importance paramount experts attached to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>This included the nine paramount experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan was unwilling to reveal that he was the new master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to say too much, even to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It was not out of vigilance against human civilization, but because some things were better left unsaid to avoid more undesirable events from happening.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan reached the twelfth stage, he could publicly claim this matter without any risk.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang Secret Realm is not an independent, complete world," Lin Yuan could sense the true nature of the secret realm as he was about to fully refine its core.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm existed by relying on the main universe and shared the same temporal rules.</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Xuanhuang Emperor are truly inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>After carefully perceiving it for a while, Lin Yuan could not help but feel amazed.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was hidden deep within the innumerable spatial layers of the main universe, where even paramount experts could not lock onto its coordinates.</p><p></p><p>What allowed this? </p><p></p><p>It was the secret realm's near-fusion with the vast main universe.</p><p></p><p>By borrowing the immense main universe, it caused those paramount experts to fail in locating it.</p><p></p><p>With the Xuanhuang Emperor's abilities, he could certainly have created a complete independent world.</p><p></p><p>However, that would prevent it from fusing with the main universe, and paramount experts would eventually lock onto its coordinates.</p><p></p><p>It was like a black dot suddenly appearing on a white paper - it would quickly be discovered no matter how small, due to the stark contrast with its surroundings.</p><p></p><p>But if a white dot appeared on the white paper, blending into the same color, it would be much harder to notice.</p><p></p><p>Before twelfth-stage lifeforms like paramount experts, whether the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was an independent world or not made little difference once its coordinates were locked.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>There was a certain resonance between the various Xuanhuang Secret Realms.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a resonance. Each secret realm existed in different universes, separated by vast distances.</p><p></p><p>Unless one was a paramount expert, even eleventh-stage lifeforms would be unable to traverse such distances.</p><p></p><p>And at the paramount expert level, after taking command of one Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the others held little use for them.</p><p></p><p>What attracted paramount experts most about the Xuanhuang Secret Realms was the heritage left behind by the Xuanhuang Emperor, the three great Dharma protector secret arts.</p><p></p><p>As for other things like Xuanhuang crystals or ninth or tenth-stage secret treasures? They were not worth paramount experts crossing numerous universes.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Xuanhuang Emperor's disappearance until now, no ultimate being has been born through the Xuanhuang evolutionary path," Lin Yuan stroked his chin, his mind wavering.</p><p></p><p>The threshold for the Xuanhuang evolutionary path was too high, preventing its propagation. To make the ultimate leap, one could only rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>In the era the Xuanhuang Emperor lived, there was no concept of propagating one's evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Borrowing the power of living beings to aid the ultimate leap was an idea that emerged after the Xuanhuang Emperor vanished.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Xuanhuang evolutionary path had an ultimate being or not did not affect Lin Yuan much.</p><p></p><p>He never intended to become a paramount expert through that path.</p><p></p><p>To Lin Yuan, the Xuanhuang evolutionary path at most served as a reference to draw insights from.</p><p></p><p>He would extract its essence and integrate it into his own path.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's view, the Xuanhuang evolutionary path had uncertainties.</p><p></p><p>For instance, what if the Xuanhuang Emperor "returned" after one became a paramount expert through this path?</p><p></p><p>Would there be two ultimate beings on the same evolutionary path?</p><p></p><p>What would happen then?</p><p></p><p>Would the two ultimate beings wage a war over the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Would one ultimate being become nourishment for the other?</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was extremely slim, almost negligible. </p><p></p><p>There was basically no hope for the Xuanhuang Emperor's "return."</p><p></p><p>But a risk was still a risk.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had his own martial path that he created from nothing. Naturally, he would not choose the former.</p><p></p><p>He aimed even higher.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating the Xuanhuang Body," Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, producing a fist-sized Xuanhuang crystal that dissolved into powder and fused into his body.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Xuanhuang Body secret art did not consume much heart force.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only needed to operate the secret art continuously while absorbing Xuanhuang crystals and various secret weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, the fist-sized Xuanhuang crystal was fully absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out another one.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang Body consumes an astonishing amount," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In these five years, the Xuanhuang crystals Lin Yuan consumed cultivating this secret art alone were equivalent to over a million universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>A million universal crystals was the entire fortune of a ninth-stage expert at the million-fold realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet in front of Lin Yuan, they only lasted five years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the results were extremely gratifying after such consumption.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan's Xuanhuang Body had not reached a small success stage.</p><p></p><p>But his physical body's strength had already directly increased twofold.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that after the amplification from the mysterious gourd, Lin Yuan's physical body was already nearly twenty times stronger than normal experts at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Increasing that twentyfold base by another two times, Lin Yuan felt that with just the power of his physical body and inexhaustible blood essence, he could pierce through numerous spatial layers to suppress special ninth-stage experts capable of opening millions of realms.</p><p></p><p>The martial path naturally excelled in physical body and physique compared to other paths at the same level, not to mention Lin Yuan's amplification from the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the increase in physical strength was just one aspect.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Xuanhuang Body, Lin Yuan's physical body would naturally emanate an aura called the "Xuanhuang Emperor's Protective Light."</p><p></p><p>Although this aura could not directly render him immune to ninety percent of attacks from the same level like the Element Body, as long as the Xuanhuang Emperor's Protective Light remained unbroken, Lin Yuan would not suffer any damage - be it physical, law, or even more mystical attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Emperor's Protective Light, Revive from a Drop of Blood, Element Body, and Primordial Bell.</p><p></p><p>These were currently Lin Yuan's four main defensive measures.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Primordial Bell was with his true original body, but relying on just the first three, Lin Yuan's defenses had almost reached the pinnacle of the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that ordinary tenth-stage experts could not break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, Lin Yuan was chatting with his parents.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, little Yuan, Yiyi is getting married," his mother Lu Qiong immediately shared this good news.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yi is getting married?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback. "So soon?"</p><p></p><p>He had indeed heard before that his younger sister was dating someone and they were very compatible. But he did not expect it to progress so quickly to the topic of marriage.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean so soon?" His mother rolled her eyes. "She's over ninety years old already. And you're over a hundred yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Over a hundred..." Lin Yuan came to a realization.</p><p></p><p>Evolutionary beings had long lifespans. Even first or second-stage evolutionary beings could easily live for hundreds or thousands of years with biotechnology.</p><p></p><p>But his parents were originally just ordinary people, common citizens of human civilization who generally lived up to two hundred years. Getting married at over ninety was considered "late" for them.</p><p></p><p>"Is Yi's boyfriend that kid from the Xia family?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, little Xia is honest, loyal and reliable. Yi will definitely not live a difficult life with him in the future," his mother said with delight.</p><p></p><p>"Honest? Loyal and reliable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Xia family was one of the great families of human civilization, officially called the "Human Xia Family." They had produced eighth-stage or higher citizens throughout history, and this generation even had an eleventh-stage expert presiding over them.</p><p></p><p>Someone born into such a family could hardly be described as honest and loyal.</p><p></p><p>The fact that he could marry Lin Yi might even be a "political marriage" aimed at her brother - Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>The Human Xia Family had a decent reputation. If Lin Yi married into it, then even if something happened to Lin Yuan in the future, his parents would at least...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Even the young have someone to rely on.</p><p></p><p>"Let Lin Yi's boyfriend come see me," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before speaking. </p><p></p><p>Generally, he was too lazy to meet people from other forces, as it was too troublesome and complicated. </p><p></p><p>But since it concerned his sister's marriage, Lin Yuan still planned to take an interest.</p><p></p><p>Very soon. </p><p></p><p>In less than ten minutes.</p><p></p><p>A handsome young man appeared together with Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Brother," Lin Yi called out with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Keran, it's an honor to meet the Milky Way Sovereign," the handsome young man beside her respectfully greeted with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>As the legitimate heir of the human Xia family, Xia Keran had quite some confidence even when facing seventh or eighth stage evolvers. But the Milky Way Sovereign?  </p><p></p><p>Before getting involved with Lin Yi, the eleventh stage elder of the Xia family had personally summoned him and repeatedly instructed that if it was just for fun, he must not choose the Milky Way Sovereign's sister.</p><p></p><p>There were so many women in human civilization, and even many female members of other races could be chosen. With the Xia family's resources, they wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>But anything related to the Milky Way Sovereign's sister must absolutely not have any negative impact.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would have a devastating effect on the Xia family.</p><p></p><p>Since even their own eleventh stage elder was so cautious, Xia Keran also realized the true power of the Milky Way Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Keran?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly. "Your Xia family has made great contributions to human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Those are just things of the past," Xia Keran immediately said, without any intention to show off.</p><p></p><p>Although from the Xia family, Xia Keran had received excellent education since childhood and did not give off any sense of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yi cannot compare to the scions of your great evolved families. After you two get married, I hope she will not suffer any grievances," Lin Yuan smiled at Xia Keran.</p><p></p><p>Facing Lin Yuan's gaze, Xia Keran felt an intangible pressure. Even with the virtual world separating them, he still felt his mind tremble.</p><p></p><p>"I will treat Yi Yi well," Xia Keran immediately promised.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't help but think: "The Milky Way Sovereign gives me a feeling similar to our elder. No wonder the elder told me to be cautious in treating Yi Yi."</p><p></p><p>He did consider the Milky Way Sovereign when pursuing Lin Yi, but he also genuinely liked Lin Yi herself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Milky Way Sovereign, as such a powerful being, did not have mind-reading abilities, seeing through someone's heart was still very simple.</p><p></p><p>If one did not like Lin Yi but still married her, it would immediately provoke the Milky Way Sovereign's dislike.</p><p></p><p>So even though the Xia family yearned to establish ties with the Milky Way Sovereign, they would carefully consider their choice and not make any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, Keran really likes me," Lin Yi immediately spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I know," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Through the interaction just now, Lin Yuan also sensed that Xia Keran had genuine feelings for Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>But feelings and emotions were inevitably not permanent. As Lin Yi's brother, giving the other party some reminders and warnings was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>The Xia family must also be aware of this.</p><p></p><p>The wedding ceremony between Lin Yi and Xia Keran was held the next day.</p><p></p><p>The venue was in the virtual world, with countless guests from various human forces rushing to attend.</p><p></p><p>Not only was one side the Milky Way Sovereign's sister, but the human Xia force also had deep roots. The union of these two powerful sides naturally had great influence.</p><p></p><p>"The heir of the human Xia family marrying the Milky Way Sovereign's sister. One side has unlimited potential, the other is an influential veteran force. What a union, tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"The Xia family must have had incredible luck to actually establish ties with the Milky Way Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The guests attending the wedding kept discussing.</p><p></p><p>With news of the Milky Way Sovereign in the Xuanhuang Secret Territory spreading, even a fool could see that the Milky Way Sovereign's future potential was at least the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The most talented genius in the history of human civilization, at the eighth stage he killed eighth stage invincibles like killing chickens, at the ninth stage he killed special ninth stages like killing chickens.</p><p></p><p>Such an unmatched prodigy would certainly receive focused cultivation from human civilization, with a high probability of breaking through to become a paramount being.</p><p></p><p>Once successfully becoming a paramount being, the Xia family as the in-laws would soar to the heavens in a single step, right?</p><p></p><p>Of course, becoming a paramount being was not that easy, but even if unable to reach the twelfth stage, he would still likely become a peak eleventh stage in the future.</p><p></p><p>For the Xia family, there was simply no downside.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that the many guests present felt the Xia family had stumbled upon a huge windfall.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Milky Way Sovereign was currently only at the ninth stage, while the human Xia family had an eleventh stage evolver presiding.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, who knew how many forces with the "human" prefix wished to establish ties with the Milky Way Sovereign, but were preempted by the Xia family in the end.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted idly with the senior martial brothers of the Crimson Leviathan lineage.</p><p></p><p>At this wedding of Lin Yi, their master Crimson Leviathan Sovereign did not attend, as he was in secluded meditation.</p><p></p><p>Secluded meditation during a critical breakthrough was extremely important and could not be disturbed in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Crimson Leviathan Sovereign had begun his secluded meditation more than twenty years ago. For an eighth stage evolver to be in secluded meditation for decades or even centuries was very normal, not to mention this involved a major realm breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know if the master can successfully cross into the ninth stage," the various peak lords of the Crimson Leviathan lineage said with some worry in their tone.</p><p></p><p>The leap from the eighth to ninth stage was the transition from a single-space life to a multi-space life. It might seem easy for Lin Yuan, but in reality, fully completing this transition was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>If the fusion of the Pillar Rules and ordinary rules was completed, then breaking through to the ninth stage would follow a natural progression. But Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's goal in secluded meditation was to fully complete the final step of fusing the rules.</p><p></p><p>As for finally crossing from the eighth to ninth stage, as long as the prerequisites were met, there would actually be little risk or accident.</p><p></p><p>"There definitely won't be any problem," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Leviathan Sovereign's true form was the Starry Sea Leviathan, the "pet" of the main universe's spatial origin. He had profound comprehension of spatial rules, so in fusing spatial rules with the fire rules, there should not be any major bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>"There's the Milky Way Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Sovereign presides over the Milky Way Prime Star but rarely shows himself in public."</p><p></p><p>"Finally getting to see the Milky Way Sovereign in person."</p><p></p><p>One guest after another focused their attention on Lin Yuan, showing little interest in the Xia family instead.</p><p></p><p>The Xia family's influence was vast, and their great figures often appeared in public, so most had already seen them.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the Milky Way Sovereign's rise was too recent and too legendary, with many evolvers unable to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p></p><p>"According to my family's elder, after the Milky Way Sovereign's performance in the Xuanhuang Secret Territory, once he crosses into the tenth stage, within a few hundred to a thousand years he will reach 'B-rank' tenth stage, and within five thousand years he will reach 'A-rank' tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, that's terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Some of the guests widened their eyes, for they knew how formidable a 'B-rank' tenth stage was, let alone an 'A-rank' tenth stage. Many tenth stage evolvers cultivated for hundreds of thousands or even millions of years yet still lingered at the 'D-rank' or 'C-rank'.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Milky Way Sovereign could so easily reach 'A-rank' tenth stage?</p><p></p><p>An 'A-rank' tenth stage, even on major alien battlefields, was an extraordinary being. Without an eleventh stage stepping in, a powerful 'A-rank' tenth stage alone could influence the outcome of a localized battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I don't even know when I'll reach the seventh stage, but you're already discussing when the Milky Way Sovereign will become an 'A-rank' after the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we're all human, but how is the Milky Way Sovereign's talent so much greater than ours? I heard the Milky Way Sovereign's bloodline is very ordinary?"</p><p></p><p>More evolvers felt somewhat dejected. When they were the Milky Way Sovereign's age, they were probably still stumbling around the first or second stage. But the Milky Way Sovereign was already soaring in the zenith of power.</p><p></p><p>At the wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression slightly changed. </p><p></p><p>He looked up in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Because right now, the Sun Celestial Spirit in the Xuanhuang Secret Territory had completely refined the secret territory's core.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum...</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanhuang Secret Territory.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, the earth-yellow secret territory core spinning in front of him, merging into his brow.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness began rising infinitely, viewing the entire Xuanhuang Secret Territory from a higher perspective, like a creator deity of the secret territory.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everything happening within the secret territory was under Lin Yuan's watchful gaze.</p><p></p><p>Those ninth stage aliens and human ninth stage evolvers currently in the secret territory remained oblivious, but the native lifeforms could vaguely sense something.</p><p></p><p>"Howl howl howl~~~"  </p><p></p><p>"Roar roar roar~~~"</p><p></p><p>On the three continents, countless powerful native lifeforms all knelt to the ground, reverent expressions showing their submission.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Emperor reigns supreme!</p>

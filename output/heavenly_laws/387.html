        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A four-armed man stood there silently. He was only about 1.6 or 1.7 meters tall, yet he exuded an intangible and immeasurably vast aura, especially from his four arms, which seemed vaguely out of place with the surrounding world. </p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings."</p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings."</p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of figures on the lakeshore murmured in a frenzied tone.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, the strength of the Four Celestial Kings had already far surpassed theirs. </p><p></p><p>Now, after another two hundred years, the gap would only be greater and wider.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Heavenly Gate about to open?" </p><p></p><p>The four-armed Celestial King slowly opened his profound eyes and calmly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"According to the time flow of this two-dimensional world, the Heavenly Gate will open in two more months," the leading figure on the shore immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate opens once every ten thousand years, the greatest event in this two-dimensional world. Countless powerful beings will come to witness it.</p><p></p><p>Before the arrival of the powerful beings from the myriad races, only those at the Demon Emperor level are qualified to compete for entry into the Heavenly Gate, while Demon Ancestor level beings can guarantee reaching the gate.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the intervention of the powerful beings from the myriad races, the threshold has been raised infinitely higher.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p>"We shall depart for the Celestial Mountains in one day."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings said slowly.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Mountains are known as the most towering peaks in this two-dimensional world. Each time the Heavenly Gate opens, it appears atop the Celestial Mountains, hence their name over time.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures on the shore immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Four Celestial Kings, we..." The leading figure suddenly hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, you have handled so many trivial matters for me in this two-dimensional world. Once I can leave, I will have the most powerful beings assist and compensate you as much as possible for your fundamental losses."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings looked at the many figures on the shore. These figures were all powerful, special lifeforms that would be unmatched forces in the vast cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Four Celestial Kings."</p><p>"We trouble you then, Four Celestial Kings."</p><p>"It is our honor to handle trivial matters for the Four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures felt slightly relieved. Fundamental losses could not be recovered, but they could be compensated for. As long as the most powerful beings took action and paid the price, their losses could be minimized.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason the most powerful beings were willing to act was because the Four Celestial Kings would take all the wondrous treasures from this two-dimensional world, in which these figures had contributed.</p><p></p><p>"With Your Celestial Majesty's strength, who in this two-dimensional world can match you?" The leading figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>The rest agreed. Although they were all eleventh-stage special lifeforms, they knew they had no hope of leaving and could not compete with the Four Celestial Kings before them.</p><p></p><p>As for giving up this Heavenly Gate opening and waiting for the next one, that was a matter for the nine strongest beings. It had nothing to do with them, these relatively mediocre special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The current nine strongest beings in the two-dimensional world had similar standings and would not submit to any side, even if they were all special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"You may go prepare."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings spoke, and the dozens of figures on the shore swiftly turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only the Four Celestial Kings remained on the vast lake surface.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past two hundred years, I have tried my best to excavate the potential of the supreme weapon integrated into my body. In terms of combat strength, I have probably reached the limit of this two-dimensional world," the Four Celestial Kings thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the wondrous treasures of this two-dimensional world, his supreme weapon was brought from the outside realm.</p><p></p><p>And this created an essential difference from the wondrous treasures wielded by the powerful beings of the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapon had been refined.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful beings from the myriad races could obtain wondrous treasures, and even if their might was no less than the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapon, they could not refine them, only unleashing their lowest power.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, the various means of the powerful beings from the myriad races could not be fully utilized, as they could not refine the wondrous treasures.</p><p></p><p>But the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapon had already been refined in the outside realm.</p><p></p><p>Although it fell into this two-dimensional world, with the supreme weapon's myriad abilities suppressed, as a refined supreme weapon, the Four Celestial Kings could still achieve unity of mind and body with it, and slowly unlock more of its power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this supreme weapon was perfectly suited for the Four Celestial Kings, allowing him to unleash his full combat strength.</p><p></p><p>"This time, when the Heavenly Gate opens, I will definitely be able to leave."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings was full of confidence. As a perfected eleventh-stage legendary being, he was already among the strongest of the powerful beings descending from the myriad races. Coupled with possessing a supreme weapon, he had an immense advantage.</p><p></p><p>With such an edge, the Four Celestial Kings did not think it possible that he could fail to leave.</p><p></p><p>Inside a volcano, before the roiling magma, sat a scrawny old man in lotus position. His form resembled a raging blaze, with the surrounding temperature constantly soaring, melting the rock walls.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p>"I've reached an extreme limit."</p><p></p><p>The scrawny old man let out a light sigh, and the nearby temperature rapidly dropped. "Time to head for the Celestial Mountains."</p><p></p><p>The scrawny old man narrowed his eyes slightly. "This time the Heavenly Gate opens, the only ones who can rival me are those few old fellows. The Four Celestial Kings counts as one - he brought a true supreme weapon, so he won't be easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>The scrawny old man stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Normally, eleventh-stage beings were not qualified to possess supreme weapons, even perfected eleventh-stage legendary beings.</p><p></p><p>Although supreme weapons were considered foundational treasures for peak races, an eleventh-stage being possessing one could very likely draw the attention of the most powerful beings to seize it by force.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful beings disdained bullying the weak, but if there was sufficient benefit, they would not hesitate to do so.</p><p></p><p>Unless this supreme weapon was bestowed by another of the most powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings was extremely valued in the Stellar Grand Union and was being groomed as the next ultimate being, so he was granted a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>"But in this two-dimensional world, even if he has refined a supreme weapon, how much of its power can he truly excavate? When the time comes, a few of us old fellows can join forces to deal with the Four Celestial Kings first."</p><p></p><p>The scrawny old man thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure combat strength, the Four Celestial Kings was definitely stronger than him, perhaps even the strongest among all the powerful beings descending this time.</p><p></p><p>But being the strongest did not mean invincible.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was not invincible, the Four Celestial Kings could be defeated and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>At least in the scrawny old man's view, the Four Celestial Kings posed the greatest threat and would definitely become his target of attack.</p><p></p><p>Without dealing with the Four Celestial Kings first, the scrawny old man, as a perfected eleventh-stage legendary being, would not dare go all out.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine that atop the Celestial Mountains, the Four Celestial Kings would become the target of a concentrated assault.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p>"I'll take this chance to discuss with those old friends how to deal with the Four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the scrawny old man's face. Apart from those few peers at the same level of perfected eleventh-stage legendary beings, he simply did not take any of the powerful beings from the myriad races seriously.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p>A secluded power.</p><p></p><p>Within this two-dimensional world, the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms were only the largest forces in scale.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Twelve Ancient Kingdoms, there were many secluded powers whose foundations were no less than the Twelve, all established by a Demon Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>These powers had always remained in seclusion, uninterested in outside information.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura rose from the depths of one such secluded power, a vast force of vital energy shaking everything.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Ancestor!"</p><p>"I have finally become a Demon Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>An excited middle-aged man walked out. His name was Yan Fu, the strongest expert of this secluded power. After arduous cultivation, he had finally crossed into the Demon Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>For the native lifeforms of this two-dimensional world, cultivating to Demon Ancestor was more difficult than ascending to heaven. In past Heavenly Gate openings, most competitors were Demon Emperors.</p><p></p><p>As for Demon Ancestors? If even one Demon Ancestor was born, it basically guaranteed an entry into the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Perfectly timed, crossing into the Demon Ancestor realm right before the Heavenly Gate opens."</p><p>"What my ancestors could not achieve, I shall accomplish."</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu's mind was stirred.</p><p></p><p>For the lifeforms of this two-dimensional world, entering the Heavenly Gate was the ultimate goal and dream.</p><p></p><p>But even as a Demon Ancestor, it was not guaranteed one could enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate opened once every ten thousand years, but a Demon Ancestor's lifespan was at most two to three thousand years. So to enter the gate, even as powerful as a Demon Ancestor, one still needed luck.</p><p></p><p>Yan Fu's Demon Ancestor ancestor...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't have that luck, it was only 800 years after the Heavenly Gate last opened that he became the Shaman Ancestor, directly cutting off any hope of entering the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky. </p><p></p><p>A mysterious and distant 'scroll' slowly unfurled.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of supremely powerful beings had solemn expressions as they carefully observed the 'blank paper' in the distance.  </p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, there were still two months until the Heavenly Gate opened, but in the main universe, it was just over ten hours away.</p><p></p><p>The flow of time between the two-dimensional world and the main universe was inconsistent, with a ratio of one hundred to one.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>"This opening of the Heavenly Gate may be our chance to glimpse the true nature of this 'blank paper'."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, if the Heavenly Gate is truly a passage connecting the inside of the 'blank paper' to the outside world, then at the moment it opens, we can completely discover some of the secrets of the 'blank paper' through this."</p><p></p><p>"It may even help us refine this 'blank paper'."</p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful beings, the ultimate existences, awaited solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Two years had passed, and they still knew nothing about this 'blank paper', so they pinned all their hopes on the imminent opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Feather Butterfly, is the Virtual Realm ready?" The supreme being Xia Qin looked towards the supreme being Feather Butterfly beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, when the Heavenly Gate opens, as long as the two-dimensional world inside the 'blank paper' leaks even a hint of aura, the Virtual Realm will capture it. At that time, the replicated two-dimensional world will have an even higher degree of similarity."</p><p></p><p>Feather Butterfly nodded. Her path to becoming a supreme being came from the 'Virtual Realm', so she could naturally master it.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," said Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what realm that little guy has cultivated to now?" Xia Qin suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>The 'little guy' he referred to was naturally Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning two hundred years ago that Lin Yuan had already reached the terrifying nineteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor, Xia Qin had pinned all his hopes for the evolution of human civilization in this two-dimensional world on him.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, apart from Lin Yuan, the strongest evolutionary being of human civilization was only at the fourteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xia Qin's thoughts wandered, a voice suddenly came through.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, what are you considering?" The supreme being from the Stellar Alliance looked over and transmitted mentally.</p><p></p><p>He was still unwilling to give up on the wondrous objects recorded by the evolutionary beings of human civilization. As long as the Four Celestial Kings could bring them out, the Stellar Alliance could make a huge profit from them.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance was not an enemy of human civilization, so this supreme being, having achieved the ultimate through a special life form, did not really care if human civilization also benefited in the end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Stellar Alliance taking sixty percent, the more profit human civilization made, the more the Stellar Alliance would gain.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see," Xia Qin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan, he would probably have cooperated with the Stellar Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the wondrous objects in the two-dimensional world were not brought out, they would have no meaning for their race.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Stellar Alliance took sixty percent and human civilization could only get forty percent, it was still better than getting nothing.</p><p></p><p>"See?" The Stellar Alliance supreme being looked at Xia Qin. "This time, did any of the human evolutionary beings who fell into the two-dimensional world reach the eleventh stage of a perfect life?"</p><p></p><p>Two years ago, when Xia Qin replied "let me think about it," the Stellar Alliance supreme being was just a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Heavenly Gate about to open, and Xia Qin still replying "let's see," the Stellar Alliance supreme being was no fool.</p><p></p><p>He immediately deduced two possibilities:</p><p></p><p>One was that the Human Civilization Alliance had already cooperated with other forces, leaving the task of bringing out the wondrous objects to their cooperative forces.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the evolutionary beings of human civilization who had fallen into the two-dimensional world had the qualifications to compete for the strongest and had a chance of earning a spot to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the first possibility, the Stellar Alliance supreme being was more inclined towards the second.</p><p></p><p>After all, up until now, he knew which forces the beings in the two-dimensional world who were approaching the level of the Four Celestial Kings came from.</p><p></p><p>It would be difficult for human civilization to cooperate with them, and even if they did cooperate, their share would definitely be much higher than the Stellar Alliance's.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization had no need to go out of their way for that.</p><p></p><p>"You all know about the eleventh stage perfect evolutionary being from my Human Civilization Alliance, don't you?" Xia Qin asked in return.</p><p></p><p>He did not reveal anything about Lin Yuan, not even a shred of information.</p><p></p><p>The higher the profile in the two-dimensional world, the more dangerous it was, as it could easily lead to being surrounded and attacked.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings were like that, except they had fused supreme weapons into their bodies, so even if surrounded and attacked, they could still resist.</p><p></p><p>"We'll find out then," the Stellar Alliance supreme being pondered for a moment, then thought no more of it.</p><p></p><p>Even if human civilization really did have an eleventh stage perfect evolutionary being who fell into the two-dimensional world, they could not possibly be a match for the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Four Celestial Kings, it would be very difficult for them to rival those other legendary eleventh stage perfect life forms.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure combat strength at the same level, the evolutionary beings of human civilization were generally at a disadvantage compared to powerful special life forms.</p><p></p><p>Eighth stage evolutionary beings opened up inner worlds within their bodies, narrowing the gap with special life forms, but only narrowing it.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his aura completely restrained, almost fusing with the surrounding soil. But within his flesh, every drop of blood was extremely viscous, his flesh and organs almost terrifyingly powerful to an unimaginable degree.</p><p></p><p>"Shaman Ancestor, Fiftieth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan straightened his back slightly, and the sound of his bones colliding was like a thunderous roar, causing the surrounding air to distort.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly stood up and lightly threw a punch. The terrifying force pierced through dozens of miles, forming a wide passage between his current location and the surface.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how my current strength compares to the Four Celestial Kings who possess supreme weapons."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. In terms of realm, he was certain he surpassed the Four Celestial Kings, but in terms of combat strength, he was unsure since they possessed a refined supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what level of might it could unleash in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"It's been two hundred years since I crossed into the Fortieth Realm of the Shaman Ancestor a hundred years ago. I felt my progress slowing down more and more, and it took a full hundred years to go from the Fortieth to the Fiftieth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got to the limit, the greater the difficulty in making further progress.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"There are still two months until the Heavenly Gate opens."</p><p></p><p>"I can set out now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward and appeared on the surface in a moment.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll head to the Celestial Mountains and see the strength of the other powerful beings. If they are far weaker than me, I'll sweep through directly and enter the Heavenly Gate."</p><p></p><p>"If there are any whose strength is close to mine, I'll give up the opportunity of this Heavenly Gate opening and wait for the next one in ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a plan for himself. The longer the time, the stronger his strength would grow. In terms of realm advancement, Lin Yuan had an extraordinary comprehension ability far beyond those of the various powerful races, not to mention even legendary eleventh stage perfect life forms were far inferior to him.</p><p></p><p>So there was no need to fight desperately during this Heavenly Gate opening period.</p><p></p><p>"Head straight for the Celestial Mountains."</p><p></p><p>"No need to stop at the Luochuan gathering place or the capital of the Bloodrain Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan set a direction and strode off.</p><p></p><p>Ever since crossing into the Twentieth Realm of the Shaman Ancestor, Lin Yuan had rarely appeared at the Luochuan gathering place, because his strength was too great and the slightest carelessness could cause earth-shattering impacts on the place.</p><p></p><p>As for the capital of the Bloodrain Ancient Nation, apart from taking a look in the first few years, Lin Yuan had basically never gone back.</p><p></p><p>More than ten days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to reach the Celestial Mountains.</p><p></p><p>"On this journey, I've already sensed the auras of quite a few powerful beings from the various races."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently. Most of the powerful beings stuck together in groups. Over the past two hundred years, there were often extremely powerful beings hunting down others, so the powerful beings who survived tended to group up.</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings who did not group up were generally very confident, most likely eleventh stage life forms.</p><p></p><p>It had been over three hundred years since the powerful beings of the various races descended into this two-dimensional world. The number of them still alive did not exceed two hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>Among those two hundred thousand, there were only a little over two hundred eleventh stage powerful beings, a reduction of one-third from the original three hundred or so.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally arrived at the Celestial Mountains.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Celestial Mountains?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped in his tracks and gazed at the majestic towering mountains in the distance, his expression becoming slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

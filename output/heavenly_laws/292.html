        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 292: The Secret of "Xuan Huang" (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, personal space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tasted the fine wine in front of him and smiled at the Chikunxing Master. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had great respect for the Chikunxing Master, even though his own strength now far surpassed the other party.</p><p></p><p>Before the eighth level, if it weren't for the shelter and support of the Chikunxing Master, Lin Yuan's path of cultivation would not have been so smooth.</p><p></p><p>The three goddesses could only guarantee that Lin Yuan would not suffer any suppression or difficulties, but to obtain more cultivation resources, sacrifices were definitely needed.</p><p></p><p>For example, signing a personal contract to join the Human Evolution Institute and serving for a certain number of years.</p><p></p><p>But the Chikunxing Master's treatment of Lin Yuan was completely unconditional.</p><p></p><p>When the Chikunxing Master first accepted Lin Yuan as his junior disciple, he probably did not expect this junior disciple to grow so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the little guy back then would grow to this level now." The Chikunxing Master said with a wistful expression.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Lin Yuan had crushed and killed numerous eighth-level invincible opponents on the battlefield against the Tianyu race. The Chikunxing Master had naturally heard about this.</p><p></p><p>This matter spread wildly in human civilization. After being confirmed by ninth-level evolved beings, there was no question about its authenticity. The Chikunxing Master's shock was simply beyond words.</p><p></p><p>It was too incredible.</p><p></p><p>How did Lin Yuan do it?</p><p></p><p>"The master taught well." Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I taught well?" The Chikunxing Master couldn't help but roll his eyes. Since Lin Yuan became the 13th Peak Master, let alone teaching, even the number of times they met was not many.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's growth was too fast. Often, when the Chikunxing Master was still designing a growth path for a certain stage for Lin Yuan, Lin Yuan had already stepped into the next level.</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master didn't even have time to teach.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a self-taught disciple, the Chikunxing Master didn't know whether he should have a sense of accomplishment as a master.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master then brought up the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, the 'Xuan Huang' secret realm is about to open." The Chikunxing Master said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang secret realm?" Lin Yuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Huang evolution path?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>During Lin Yuan's first Seven Star Cave Trial, it was precisely because he had comprehended the Xuan Huang evolution path in the seventh star cave that he was accepted as a disciple by the Chikunxing Master.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a deep understanding of this evolution path. Over the years, he had long comprehended it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely because he had comprehended it that Lin Yuan was certain that this evolution path was incomplete, with only half of it.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Huang evolution path in Lin Yuan's hands only reached the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely felt that the Xuan Huang evolution path was not a pure evolution path, but more like a "lead" or "key" to something.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I don't know the name of this evolution path, so I simply named it after the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master said.</p><p></p><p>"When I obtained this evolution path, I felt it was extraordinary, but unfortunately, I don't have the talent to cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he wanted to find a successor for this evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, if possible, you can try to explore the Xuan Huang secret realm. I speculate that the Xuan Huang evolution path is related to some ruins in the Xuan Huang secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Huang secret realm was a rare large-scale secret realm. Those below the eighth-level invincible could not pass through the passage formed with the main space.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the special nature of the secret realm, the Xuan Huang secret realm could not accommodate tenth-level life forms. Only eighth-level invincible and ninth-level beings could enter the Xuan Huang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred thousand years ago, the Chikunxing Master, relying on the talent of his original body, the Starry Sea Roaming Kun, had roamed freely among the eighth-level invincible.</p><p></p><p>However, he almost died in the Xuan Huang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the death here was not true death. The Starry Sea Roaming Kun had a source core. As long as the source core was not shattered, it could not be considered death.</p><p></p><p>When the Chikunxing Master entered the Xuan Huang secret realm back then, he had long left his "source core" in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But with the size of the Starry Sea Roaming Kun, once it fell, the energy required to condense it again would be as vast as mountains and seas, causing the Chikunxing Master to go bankrupt directly.</p><p></p><p>"I will take a look when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master had been to the Xuan Huang secret realm and knew more about it than himself.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Lin Yuan needed to enter and explore it, definitely out of some consideration.</p><p></p><p>"This time, when the Xuan Huang secret realm opens, I won't join in the excitement." The Chikunxing Master shook his head.</p><p></p><p>There was a great secret in the Xuan Huang secret realm, which even the strongest beings frequently paid attention to, but all of this had nothing to do with the Chikunxing Master.</p><p></p><p>Now, the most important thing for the Chikunxing Master was to step into the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the ninth level, even if he obtained the great secret of the Xuan Huang secret realm, what could he do?</p><p></p><p>He contacted Lin Yuan this time to inform him about the origin of the Xuan Huang evolution path.</p><p></p><p>This evolution path had a great connection with the Xuan Huang secret realm. The Chikunxing Master felt that Lin Yuan had the right to know.</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Huang evolution path."</p><p></p><p>A trace of peculiarity flashed in Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He took the martial dao evolution path as his core evolution path, but he also cultivated other evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Xuan Huang evolution path was one of the evolution paths that Lin Yuan cultivated concurrently.</p><p></p><p>The countless demonic evolution paths contained in the corpse of that ultimate strong being were fraught with hidden dangers. Lin Yuan only comprehended them and took their essence, but did not cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuan Huang evolution path was different. It was thick, complete, and had no other shortcomings except for being incomplete.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of evolvers cultivated many other evolution paths concurrently.</p><p></p><p>There were countless evolution paths in the world. Each evolution path had its own focus, advantages, and disadvantages. If one only cultivated one evolution path, it was very easy to be targeted by enemies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, concurrent cultivation was concurrent cultivation. An evolver's core evolution path was only one.</p><p></p><p>That was the evolution path that perfectly matched one's soul before entering the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>The other concurrently cultivated evolution paths were just auxiliary, similar to secret arts and techniques, used to enhance one's ability to deal with unexpected situations.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what secrets the Xuan Huang secret realm actually holds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was now an eighth-level citizen and an evolution scholar. His authority was frighteningly high. With just a moment's effort, he found the human civilization's introduction to the Xuan Huang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Huang secret realm, located deep within layers of space, is suspected to be a remnant of other universe eras."</p><p></p><p>The introduction to the Xuan Huang secret realm was simple, but it made Lin Yuan's heart tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Other universe eras?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>The so-called universe era meant that the universe had a lifespan. Even if this lifespan was terrifyingly long, one thing was certain.</p><p></p><p>That was, one day, the universe would fall into destruction.</p><p></p><p>After destruction came rebirth, and the period from rebirth to destruction was a complete universe era.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was quite interested in the Xuan Huang Secret Realm, he also knew that with his current strength, even if he entered the Xuan Huang Secret Realm and obtained great opportunities, he might not necessarily be able to keep them.</p><p></p><p>Facing eighth-level lifeforms, Lin Yuan could easily crush them.</p><p></p><p>But those who could enter the Xuan Huang Secret Realm were not only eighth-level lifeforms, but also ninth-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's combat power was not inferior to the strong ones among the ninth-level, but it was still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-level, I have to at least step into the ninth-level before considering the matter of the Xuan Huang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His current cultivation progress had already completed eighty percent of the rule integration.</p><p></p><p>The remaining twenty percent was just a matter of time for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Once the integration was fully completed, Lin Yuan would be able to challenge the ninth-level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, with Lin Yuan's foundation at the eighth-level, after stepping into the ninth-level, his strength would undergo another qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Inside the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The world power surged, and Lin Yuan's figure condensed as he overlooked this vast world of nearly 150 million miles.</p><p></p><p>"After stepping into the ninth-level, the inner world will also undergo a transformation, but the transformation here is not in terms of size, but in quality."</p><p></p><p>"The integration of space rules with basic rules and cosmic power will affect the inner world, causing it to evolve towards the cosmic direction."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal of opening up an inner world was to evolve it into an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, besides human civilization, there were many other races studying the method of opening up inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>"According to my current absorption speed of the liquid inside the mysterious gourd, I hope to expand the inner world to a radius of 160 million miles before stepping into the ninth-level."</p><p></p><p>Among the seven types of liquid inside the mysterious gourd, Lin Yuan had currently absorbed up to the fifth type, with two types yet to be absorbed.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't have much impact. Even after reaching the ninth-level, he could still continue trying to absorb them. Anyway, the liquid inside the mysterious gourd enhanced the basic amplification.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what changes a 160-million-mile inner world will undergo after stepping into the ninth-level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked forward to it. The many records of human civilization included the various processes of many eighth-level evolvers stepping into ninth-level evolvers.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was significantly different from those evolvers. His inner world was dozens of times larger than theirs, so the experiences of predecessors might not necessarily be correct.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the center of the inner world, where an ancient tree had already grown to a height of a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the growth of a World Tree was exceptionally slow, and it would not grow to a hundred meters even in hundreds or thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Lin Yuan's inner world was too big, and the world origin was too abundant. Under such circumstances, the development speed of the World Tree naturally far exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>A hundred-meter-sized World Tree, its area of influence had already exceeded a radius of ten million miles. With the World Tree as the center, the quality of the world power within ten million miles was much higher than that outside the ten million miles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the stability of space within the ten million mile range was also superior to that outside the ten million miles.</p><p></p><p>"It's really a treasure."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that his inner world was too big, so big that even the World Tree could not fully influence it.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as the World Tree continued to grow, to a thousand meters or ten thousand meters, it would naturally be able to cover the entire inner world.</p><p></p><p>"World Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the branches of the World Tree and discovered that embryonic forms of fruits were vaguely appearing on them.</p><p></p><p>"It's still a long way from maturity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed and his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three or four years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main star of the Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>A spaceship approached.</p><p></p><p>A young man and woman came down from it.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the Peak Master wants us to come here for."</p><p></p><p>The woman on the right was a bit nervous. She was none other than Wu Lan, one of the two examinees selected by Lin Yuan to join the Thirteen Peaks in the Seven Star Cave World.</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan had an ordinary background. In the Seven Star Cave trial, she had the most silver patterns at most. If she hadn't cultivated the martial arts evolution path, she probably wouldn't have been favored by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>"Our Peak Master is the Galaxy Star Lord who has shaken many star domains and star alliances of human civilization. Even those alien battlefields have changed their strategies because of the Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li beside her was in high spirits. Foolish people like Wu Lan simply didn't understand the worth of the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly landed on the main star.</p><p></p><p>"You must be the Star Lord's two disciples."</p><p></p><p>Chun Bo had been waiting for a long time. This was also something that Lin Yuan had instructed long ago.</p><p></p><p>If the Galaxy Star Domain wanted to develop and grow, it had to absorb a large number of evolvers, and the many subordinates that Lin Yuan had left behind in the Thirteen Peaks of the Vermilion Roc Lineage were excellent candidates.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Lan and Mo Li are here." Lin Yuan glanced at them and didn't pay much more attention.</p><p></p><p>"My current rule integration has already completed ninety-nine percent. I can fully integrate at any time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself. "According to the experience of other evolvers breaking through to the ninth-level, once the rule integration is completed, they will begin to challenge the ninth-level within a short period of time."</p><p></p><p>"The short period of time here belongs to self-evolution. The power after integration will have an impact on the inner world. Once the impact reaches a certain stage, it will automatically challenge the ninth-level."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan took the initiative to stop comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Before challenging the ninth-level, there was one more thing Lin Yuan had to do.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness connected to the virtual world and appeared on the mountain peak, looking at the torso under the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>"I have now comprehended 33,301 evolution paths. I only need a little over 300 more to comprehend the 33,333 evolution paths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Jade Space, through the exchange with the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, Lin Yuan obtained a lot of intelligence information about the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Among them was how many demonic evolution paths one needed to comprehend to become an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Tower, and how many demonic evolution paths one needed to comprehend to become a higher-level member of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The number of demonic evolution paths comprehended here depended on the comprehender's own strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>For lives at the eighth-level and below, comprehending 3,333 demonic evolution paths would automatically make them ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>As for ninth-level lives, they needed to comprehend 6,666 demonic evolution paths to become ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>As for tenth-level lives, they needed to comprehend at least more than 10,000 demonic evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan was about to comprehend 33,333 demonic evolution paths, which was the threshold for eighth-level lives to increase their membership level in the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan stepped into the ninth-level, the threshold would increase by a large margin again.</p><p></p><p>Although, with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability, even a higher threshold could be comprehended one day, but wouldn't it be foolish not to take a shortcut if there was one?</p><p></p><p>"Starting now, I will focus on comprehending the remaining demonic evolution paths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was looking forward to what changes would occur after he comprehended the 33,333 demonic evolution paths.</p>

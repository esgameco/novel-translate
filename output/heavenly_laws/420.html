Six Levels of Space-Time Realm (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The son of the void could not hide his astonishment, which was also noticed by the Lord of the East Wing and other Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Great son of the void, what happened to Tianzhi?" </p><p></p><p>The Lord of the East Wing carefully asked.</p><p></p><p>"Tianzhi has fallen into a slumber, and his life-preserving avatar is also asleep."</p><p></p><p>With a subtle thought from the son of the void, Tianzhi's life-preserving avatar moved from the deepest area of the void secret realm to the front of the evil deity Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen asleep?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the East Wing could not understand.</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi himself plotted all the arrangements to encircle and kill the Lord of the Yin Realm, but just as he was about to act, he fell into a slumber himself?</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't spoken by the son of the void himself, the Lord of the East Wing would never have believed it.</p><p></p><p>It was too absurd.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that he fell asleep voluntarily, but was forced into slumber," said the son of the void after carefully observing Tianzhi's life-preserving avatar in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Forced into slumber?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the East Wing and the Divine Eye Lord exchanged glances with the other evil deity Lords, feeling a chill.</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi was a perfect evil deity Lord. In the vast boundless void, who could force Tianzhi into slumber without any resistance or ability to send out a message?</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, interesting."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that within this less than ten billion year slumber, such an interesting thing would happen."</p><p></p><p>The son of the void muttered to himself. Although Tianzhi could not directly kill, to make him fall into slumber silently required the son of the void to borrow some power from the void secret realm itself.</p><p></p><p>"I'll let Tianzhi wake up and ask him what happened."</p><p></p><p>The son of the void's consciousness began to seep into Tianzhi's life-preserving avatar body.</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi was forced into slumber and could not wake up by his own power.</p><p></p><p>But he could be stimulated and pulled out by an external force. Of course, only the son of the void, who mastered the entire void secret realm, could do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Qing World.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>After fifty years of bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was infinitely close to reaching the sixth level of the space-time fusion realm.</p><p></p><p>The space-time "Milky Way" rippled on Lin Yuan's body, like a miniature space-time river.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, by comprehending the secret technique "Milky Way", your understanding of the space-time fusion realm has deepened.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, by comprehending the secret technique "Milky Way", your understanding of the space-time fusion realm has deepened.]</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Lin Yuan felt that the world in front of him had changed.</p><p></p><p>The vast boundless void suddenly became extremely simple, with only time and space remaining.</p><p></p><p>"I see now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was flooded with flashes of enlightenment, almost entering the sixth level of the space-time fusion realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the world within his body, Tianzhi, who had been immersed in the vast illusion woven by Lin Yuan, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm awake?"</p><p></p><p>"I broke free from the illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Before Tianzhi could look around, his physical body and soul rapidly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan merely glanced at the location of Tianzhi in the world within his body, and continued to pursue his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>He was now at a critical juncture of crossing into the sixth level of the space-time fusion realm. Lin Yuan naturally would not allow any unstable factors to appear in the world within his body.</p><p></p><p>Since Tianzhi happened to wake up at this moment, no matter what power he borrowed, he would be directly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>"So beautiful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed all his mind and soul into comprehending the essence of space-time.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful gaze of the towering son of the void, the Lord of the East Wing, and the other evil deity Lords, Tianzhi suddenly opened his eyes, but immediately changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt that his true body had perished.</p><p></p><p>"Son of the void."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the towering figure looking down at him, Tianzhi respectfully addressed him.</p><p></p><p>The son of the void directly asked, as he became increasingly interested in what had happened to Tianzhi.</p><p></p><p>For an immeasurably long time, as the master of the void secret realm, he had never sensed any unexpected existence, with everything under his control.</p><p></p><p>But now, from Tianzhi's behavior, the son of the void felt a "curiosity" that he had not experienced for who knows how long.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi did not dare defy the son of the void, and in fact had no intention of hiding anything, so he told him everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Yin Realm is not the mastermind behind the scenes. The one who promoted the spread of martial arts is the Martial Ancestor. The Lord of the Yin Realm is just a pawn pushed forward by the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Before the son of the void could respond, the Lord of the East Wing and the other evil deity Lords were already dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>To them, the Lord of the Yin Realm was already powerful enough. But the Martial Ancestor behind him was even stronger than the Lord of the Yin Realm, to the point where even Tianzhi had no ability to resist him?</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"I incarnated into that Tian Qing World and did some investigating. I learned that in that world, the heavens, earth, and ghosts all worship the Martial Ancestor and revere martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi nodded. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it either.</p><p></p><p>"Great son of the void, that Martial Ancestor is extremely powerful, probably infinitely close to the tenth stage. In the boundless void, apart from you taking action, there are no other evil deities that can resist him."</p><p></p><p>Tianzhi respectfully said to the towering figure.</p><p></p><p>As for myself...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The true self was right in front of the Martial Ancestor, unable to even flee. It was directly suppressed and forced into slumber, causing the True Lord of Celestial Intelligence to develop an inexplicable fear towards the Martial Ancestor. </p><p></p><p>"Infinitely close to the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void had a calm expression. To him, as long as it wasn't a tenth stage evil god, he had no fear, relying on his control of the Void Secret Realm to sweep through everything.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll go experience this Martial Ancestor myself."</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void immediately spoke.  </p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of Celestial Intelligence felt slightly relieved in his heart. As long as the great Son of the Void took action, no matter how powerful that Martial Ancestor was, the outcome was already determined.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Void.</p><p>In front of a great world. </p><p>The forms of the Son of the Void and many other perfected True Lords of evil gods appeared.</p><p></p><p>The True Lord of Celestial Intelligence immediately spoke. His impression of that Azure Heaven World was extremely deep, he wouldn't mistake it.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p>The Son of the Void, whose aura was like an ocean, slightly nodded. "Since that's the case, let's start with this world."</p><p></p><p>Although the Son of the Void was very confident that no matter how powerful that Martial Ancestor was, he wouldn't be his match. But the True Lord of Celestial Intelligence's description of the Martial Ancestor made the Son of the Void not dare to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Son of the Void had just awakened, and the vast majority of his power was still in slumber, not fully revived. So he planned to kill the worlds occupied by martial arts along the way to the Azure Heaven World, while also completely ending his slumbering state, to face the Martial Ancestor at full power.</p><p></p><p>"You go lure out the Lord of the Yin Realm first."</p><p>The Son of the Void spoke. Apart from wanting to see this Martial Ancestor, he also wanted to take a look at this Lord of the Yin Realm. </p><p></p><p>Since the Lord of the Yin Realm was the powerful being put forward by the Martial Ancestor, he could probably see some of the Martial Ancestor's methods from him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The True Lord of Divine Eyes nodded, immediately revealing his form and arriving outside that great world.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Yin Realm, get out here for me - get out - get out -"</p><p>The True Lord of Divine Eyes' voice propagated through space-time. In that instant, all living beings within the great world heard these words.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Yin Realm, get out here for me - get out - get out -" </p><p>The terrifying sound waves, mixed with space-time fluctuations, made all beings within the world tremble from the depths of their souls.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>At the same time, the Son of the Void was secretly observing the living beings within the world, especially those martial arts cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p>The Son of the Void slightly nodded, quite praising.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already learned from the True Lord of Celestial Intelligence about the threat and potential of the martial arts cultivation system, when he personally saw the martial arts cultivators and observed the martial arts they cultivated, the Son of the Void was still somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The evil gods could grow to the level of destroying the heavens and extinguishing the earth because of their innate foundations.</p><p></p><p>Yet the martial arts cultivation system actually allowed these ants to possibly exist and grow to threaten the evil gods.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation system different from the evil gods' growth made the Son of the Void quite amazed.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p>"The outcome is already determined."</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void shook his head slightly. As long as he still controlled the Void Secret Realm, these martial arts cultivators couldn't make too big of a splash.</p><p></p><p>"Great Son of the Void, that Lord of the Yin Realm did not show himself," the True Lord of Divine Eyes returned and respectfully said to the Son of the Void.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, just directly destroy this world."</p><p>The Son of the Void spoke. After the period of observation just now, his power had recovered greatly, and he could already wield the full force of the Void Secret Realm. There was no need to waste time here anymore.  </p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p>The True Lord of Divine Eyes approached that world propagating martial arts again and opened his huge mouth. Space-time began to distort as he tried to directly swallow this world.</p><p></p><p>For a seventh or eighth stage evil god, swallowing a world required time, bite by bite. But for the True Lord of Divine Eyes, a perfected ninth stage True Lord, he could swallow the world before him in one bite.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p>The world began to shake.</p><p>The living beings within watched in horror as a huge mouth appeared outside their world, biting down towards the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The True Lord of Divine Eyes' expression changed, and he immediately stopped swallowing, allowing the world that was about to enter his mouth to slowly return to its original position.</p><p></p><p>"Over there?"</p><p>The True Lord of Divine Eyes' gaze became solemn, looking towards a certain direction - it was precisely the Azure Heaven World where the Martial Ancestor dwelled, as pointed out earlier by the True Lord of Celestial Intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Now within the True Lord of Divine Eyes' perceptive view, traces of space-time ripples were constantly emanating and spreading from that direction. In a moment, they enveloped half of the Boundless Void.  </p><p></p><p>Not just the True Lord of Divine Eyes, at this time the other perfected True Lords of evil gods also stared fixedly at the source of the space-time ripples, their expressions extremely solemn. This kind of change affecting the entire Boundless Void was something most of them had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"Son of the Void?"</p><p>The True Lord of Celestial Intelligence was the same, but he reacted first, turning his head to look at the Son of the Void standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>However, the Son of the Void was no longer standing in his original spot. </p><p></p><p>The True Lord of Celestial Intelligence looked around and only then realized that at some point, the Son of the Void had already moved to stand in front of all the True Lords of evil gods, gazing towards the direction of the Azure Heaven World, as if observing some existence.</p><p></p><p>The Son of the Void's gaze was more solemn than ever before, as if facing a formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>The heavens, earth, and ghosts and gods all revere martial arts.</p><p>What a remarkable Martial Ancestor!</p>

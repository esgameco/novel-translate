            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 472: The Arrival of the Demonic Abyss (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the beast robe was somewhat perplexed. He remembered that he had infiltrated the cultivation area of the cave dwelling where Yunzhenzi was located.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Boundless heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the beast robe first thought that he had fallen into some kind of illusory formation.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly dismissed this idea.</p><p></p><p>Even the most powerful illusory formation is ultimately just an illusion. It may be able to deceive the senses of ordinary Jade Immortals, but for him, a Jade Immortal, the spatial fluctuations around him felt completely real.</p><p></p><p>This made the figure realize that this was not an illusion, but true space-time.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Interspace Realm created by a supreme Jade Immortal," the figure in the beast robe finally realized.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Jade Immortals, through their profound understanding of the mysteries of space-time, can create Interspace Realms as their long-term cultivation retreats. These would appear like spatial mazes.</p><p></p><p>However, in the figure's understanding, even the Interspace Realms created by the direct disciples of the Patriarch of the Immortal Dao would at most be a few thousand to tens of thousands of li in size. How could this one be so boundless and endless?</p><p></p><p>This was why the figure did not immediately think of the Interspace Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Interspace Realm before him was far too vast compared to the normal ones.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of existence could have created an Interspace Realm of such a scale?" The figure trembled inwardly. While there was no limit on the size of an Interspace Realm, it was generally related to the depth of the creator Jade Immortal's understanding of the mysteries of space-time. The vaster the Interspace Realm, the more profound the creator's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But which Jade Immortal could have created this?</p><p></p><p>The figure did not dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Before the figure in the beast robe could take any action, the space-time around him began to ripple. He felt like a lone boat in the vast ocean, sinking into the depths in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"How many is this now?" </p><p></p><p>In the center of the cultivation area, Lin Yuan opened his eyes. All the treasures and spoils from the figure in the beast robe appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had revealed his abilities as a supreme Alchemy Grandmaster ten years ago, mysterious Jade Immortals had been periodically infiltrating his cave dwelling, attempting to kill him and seize his vast wealth.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately for them, these mysterious Jade Immortals often could not even withstand the spatial maze formed by the unintentional influence of Lin Yuan's cultivation of the laws of space-time, and perished.</p><p></p><p>This had allowed Lin Yuan to amass a considerable fortune. The mysterious Jade Immortals capable of penetrating the formations of the Immortal City must be at least peak Jade Immortals, their true combat power far exceeding even cultivators like Yunzhenzi.</p><p></p><p>Such Jade Immortals were naturally quite wealthy. Even a single one could provide Lin Yuan with enough materials for many Immortal pills.</p><p></p><p>"This is even more efficient than alchemy," Lin Yuan thought to himself. However, he also knew that the long-term, stable income from alchemy could not be replaced.</p><p></p><p>As for these mysterious Jade Immortals infiltrating his cave dwelling? They might keep coming one after another in the short term, but in the long run, Lin Yuan would remain unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Other Jade Immortals who had designs on him would eventually realize that something was amiss - the fact that so many mysterious Jade Immortals had died within Lin Yuan's cave dwelling, even if it had not been widely publicized, would make them cautious. No Jade Immortal in their right mind would dare to provoke Lin Yuan directly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at these spoils," Lin Yuan divided his attention to inspect the treasures taken from the figure in the beast robe.</p><p></p><p>In the Flying Immortal Palace, the Palace Master's expression changed slightly as he gazed towards the Grade-A Dwelling Area, specifically towards the cave dwelling where Lin Yuan resided.</p><p></p><p>"Another Jade Immortal has infiltrated Yunzhenzi Master's cave dwelling?" The Flying Immortal Palace Master was already accustomed to this.</p><p></p><p>The Flying Immortal Palace was a crucial institution in the Cangwu Immortal City, with absolute control over the formations and killing arrays of the Dwelling Area.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, due to his cooperation with Lin Yuan, the Palace Master had long been closely monitoring the formations around Lin Yuan's cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Those Jade Immortals who had quietly infiltrated Lin Yuan's cave dwelling thought they were being stealthy, but a considerable number of them had already been detected in advance by the Flying Immortal Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>The first time the Palace Master discovered a mysterious Jade Immortal infiltrating Lin Yuan's cave dwelling, he had been unusually nervous. He immediately mobilized all the formations in the Dwelling Area to seal the space-time, then personally went to the cave dwelling to check if Lin Yuan was still there.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw Lin Yuan emerge from the cave dwelling unharmed, stating that no Jade Immortal had infiltrated it.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master had initially thought that Lin Yuan was being coerced, but after repeated communication, even taking Lin Yuan out of the Dwelling Area, he still maintained the same stance.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master could only leave helplessly, wondering if there was something wrong with the formations of the Immortal City, as there seemed to be no Jade Immortal infiltration after all.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the second, third, and subsequent incidents occurred.</p><p></p><p>In the beginning, the Flying Immortal Palace Master was still very nervous, worried about Lin Yuan's safety. But each time, he found nothing, and Lin Yuan remained unharmed, never having encountered any danger.</p><p></p><p>As the incidents accumulated, the Palace Master began to find it puzzling.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Yunzhenzi Master has hidden depths as well," the Deputy Palace Master couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>If it had only happened once or twice, it might have been a problem with the formations. But with so many occurrences, even the Deputy Palace Master had realized what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Since the formations were not malfunctioning, it meant that there were indeed ill-intentioned Jade Immortals infiltrating the cave dwelling. Yet Lin Yuan remained unharmed in the end.</p><p></p><p>While the details of what happened in between were unknown, the beginning and the result allowed one to infer the process.</p><p></p><p>All the mysterious Jade Immortals who had infiltrated the cave dwelling had ultimately met their demise at Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the first incident until now, the Immortal City's formations had only detected the entry of these Jade Immortals, but never their escape.</p><p></p><p>"So many Jade Immortals, all of them dying within Yunzhenzi Master's cave dwelling." The Flying Immortal Palace Master pondered for a while. "This Yunzhenzi Master is truly unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>Normally, battles between peak Jade Immortals would not just disappear without a trace, at the very least leaving massive ripples in their wake.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's cave dwelling had never shown any such aftereffects. All the Jade Immortals who had infiltrated simply vanished without a sound, as if they had never been there in the first place.</p><p></p><p>This made the Flying Immortal Palace Master feel a chill, unable to reconcile these events with the gentle and amiable Lin Yuan he knew.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?" the Deputy Palace Master asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?" The Flying Immortal Palace Master glanced at him. "Yunzhenzi Master is an esteemed guest of our Cangwu Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had displayed unfathomable abilities, he had not taken any actions detrimental to the Immortal City so far.</p><p></p><p>As for the Jade Immortals who had died at Lin Yuan's hands? They had infiltrated the Immortal City's Dwelling Area on their own accord. Even if Lin Yuan had not killed them, the Immortal City would have pursued them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Flying Immortal Palace Master...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Master had no intention of doing anything, nor did he have the desire to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Every Jade Immortal has their own secret opportunity, and to investigate the secret of a Jade Immortal is tantamount to standing against that Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Immortal Transcendence Palace had no intention of becoming an enemy of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was meticulously counting the spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>"In total, it's approximately seventy to eighty million top-grade immortal crystals." Lin Yuan nodded slightly, quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The net worth of a normal Jade Immortal is around a million top-grade immortal crystals, so seventy to eighty million top-grade immortal crystals is already considered a massive fortune.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that most Jade Immortals convert their resources into their own strength, investing in their physical bodies and spiritual souls, leaving only a small amount of treasures and immortal artifacts. To have seventy to eighty million top-grade immortal crystals left over is absolutely considered wealthy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the various spoils of war again, landing on a dagger. This dagger was entirely black, its power completely concealed. Even Lin Yuan couldn't detect any energy fluctuations from it.</p><p></p><p>In order to thoroughly eliminate the Jade Immortals who had intruded, Lin Yuan had basically suppressed them in an instant, then used the memory contamination technique of the Abyss Demons to erase most of their life-saving methods.</p><p></p><p>This was to prevent these Jade Immortals from being revived elsewhere and spreading what had happened in the Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>Over the past five to six hundred years, Lin Yuan had secretly killed many Demons, and was quite familiar with the memory contamination technique.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were Jade Immortals who could block this type of memory contamination, like the Cloud True Disciple, using methods to isolate causality, their revival would still take tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>By then, Lin Yuan estimated that he would have already completed this journey and returned to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"This dagger..."</p><p></p><p>Before eliminating the figure in the beast robe, Lin Yuan had also casually browsed through their memories, learning that this dagger was obtained by the figure in the beast robe at great risk, by killing the heir of the Northern Chill Immortal City's Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>In the memories of the figure in the beast robe, this dagger was extremely sharp, able to cut through anything.</p><p></p><p>So after obtaining this dagger, the figure in the beast robe believed that their strength had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, during this infiltration of Lin Yuan's Immortal Abode, the figure in the beast robe never even had the chance to see Lin Yuan, and instead perished under the immense spatial pressure.</p><p></p><p>They never had the opportunity to use this dagger.</p><p></p><p>"Sharp?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan held the dagger and lightly drew it across his left arm.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a wound appeared, then quickly healed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is sharp!" Lin Yuan's expression showed slight amazement. Although his current solar divine spirit body was not as strong as his true body, it still surpassed the Jade Immortal realm, after all, the scale of the world within him was immense.</p><p></p><p>The boundless world energy constantly nurtured within his body, nourishing his physical body and spiritual soul, something that no natural treasures could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it was easily cut open by this dagger.</p><p></p><p>"A Twelfth-Grade Weapon?" Lin Yuan repeatedly examined the black dagger, but was not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>The feeling this dagger gave Lin Yuan was not as simple as a Twelfth-Grade Weapon. Even if it was a Twelfth-Grade Weapon, without infusing any power, it shouldn't be able to cut his flesh and blood so effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's level, the so-called Twelfth-Grade Weapons mainly depended on who was wielding them.</p><p></p><p>In the hands of the strongest experts, Twelfth-Grade Weapons would be unbreakable, but in the hands of ordinary Jade Immortals, they would be nothing special.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan diverted a thread of his mind to start researching the black dagger. With its sharpness, if used properly, it could become a great asset to him.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years flashed by.</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal Cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned in deep thought. After a hundred years of constant contemplation and with the help of various immortal sources, Lin Yuan vaguely felt that he was extremely close to breaking through to the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal Cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He was just one step away.</p><p></p><p>In addition, many other pillar-level fusion techniques had also undergone significant improvements, with several reaching the peak of the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts, slowing down his contemplation of the spatial-temporal fusion technique.</p><p></p><p>"But over the past hundred years..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slightly raised his head, his mind flashing through the many major events that had occurred during this time.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had focused most of his mental energy and efforts on closed-door cultivation and enlightenment, in his spare time, he had also paid attention to the many great events happening in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>And over the past hundred years, the Thirty-Three Immortal Domains could be described as tumultuous. A large number of Demons had descended from the Abyss, and countless immortals had been tragically killed by the Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Demon Great War had been ongoing for decades.</p><p></p><p>Compared to past Immortal-Demon Great Wars, the cruelty of this one was unimaginable. In the past, Immortal Cities were extremely stable, and no matter how many Demons attacked, they could not be breached. But in this Immortal-Demon Great War, within just a few decades, three Immortal Cities had been conquered, and countless immortals had been devoured by the Demons.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao does not intervene?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly as he looked up at the irregular rift in the sky. With his current spatial-temporal perception, he could clearly feel the boundless aura fluctuations from the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because they are in seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inwardly speculated, inevitably feeling puzzled. For the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, the many immortals in the Immortal Realm were the foundation of the Immortal Dao cultivation system. If they were not truly unable to leave, they should not have allowed this to happen.</p><p></p><p>"But it has nothing to do with me."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan summoned Cloud True Disciple and instructed, "I will be entering seclusion soon. Unless a major event occurs, do not disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that he was just one step away from the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal Cultivation. At the moment, his entire focus would be on contemplating the spatial-temporal rules, and he would be constantly using the immortal sources he had accumulated over the past hundred years.</p><p></p><p>In order to break through to the Seventh Realm of Spatial-Temporal Cultivation as soon as possible, Lin Yuan had even temporarily slowed down the completion of the Eleventh Realm of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As for the events happening in the outside world, unless they truly affected him, he would not get involved.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Cloud True Disciple respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>In the Blossoming Elm Immortal City, in the most core hall, all the city's top leaders and elders had gathered.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the hall was heavy, with the group of top-tier Jade Immortals remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, there's no need to be so despairing. It's just that a large group of Demons are converging towards our Blossoming Elm Immortal City, it's not like we can't resist them," the Immortal City's Sect Master slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Blossoming Elm Immortal City had obtained intelligence that up to seventy percent of the Demons in the Mysterious Heaven Immortal Domain were gradually gathering and moving towards the area where the Blossoming Elm Immortal City was located.</p><p></p><p>This was not a good sign, as it was highly likely that these Demons had already targeted the Blossoming Elm Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>If this were to happen, the Blossoming Elm Immortal City would face an unprecedented and arduous battle.</p><p></p><p>In the past Immortal-Demon Wars, the city's top leaders and elders would not have been this solemn, but in this Immortal-Demon War that had only just begun, three Immortal Cities had already fallen to the Demons.</p><p></p><p>Would the Blossoming Elm Immortal City become the fourth to fall?</p>

            <p>Chapter 223 Spiritual Transformation (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>On the high platform, several figures had their gazes fixed on Lin Yuan. üíùüòéÔºñ‚ûàs·ïºÔºµ–ñ.ƒåœÉ‡πì‚úãüëΩ</p><p></p><p>They were all ninth-stage evolutionaries, or to be precise, they were manifestations of the consciousness of ninth-stage evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their consciousness split into millions of threads, presiding over the numerous virtual worlds that had been created, paying attention to the insights of many evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>The countless evolutionary paths contained within that torso were partly so bizarre that they could even affect the real bodies in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at least eighth-stage peak or even ninth-stage evolutionaries were required to keep watch at all times.</p><p></p><p>In case any evolutionary took a wrong turn and lost control of themselves, these ninth-stage evolutionaries could then intervene.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, this torso that belonged to a deceased supreme being from outside the realm</p><p></p><p>should not have been made public so quickly, as there were many hidden dangers and pitfalls inside. Some genius evolutionaries might fall into these traps.</p><p></p><p>Even with the isolation of the virtual worlds, leaving the physical bodies in the outside world unaffected, it was still unavoidable for the memories and minds to be impacted.</p><p></p><p>But there was no other way.</p><p></p><p>It was not only the human civilization that had control over this torso.</p><p></p><p>There were also other alien races, including several peak races such as the Insectoids.</p><p></p><p>If the supreme beings did not do this, and one of these peak races gained control of this supreme evolutionary path instead,</p><p></p><p>leading to the emergence of an additional supreme being, it would definitely affect the situation on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>A single supreme being was fully capable of disrupting the current balance maintained by the major peak races.</p><p></p><p>At that time, no one knew how many benefits the Human Civilization Alliance would have to concede in order to maintain a new balance.</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow, he actually hasn't cultivated any of the evolutionary paths he comprehended until now?"</p><p></p><p>The first man was a little surprised. It had been a month or two of comprehension, and basically every evolutionary had cultivated for some time.</p><p></p><p>Once they began cultivating the evolutionary paths they comprehended, their auras would start transforming, moving closer to that torso.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's aura had remained unchanged until now, his strength still at the level of a first-stage evolutionary.</p><p></p><p>"I know of this little fellow."</p><p></p><p>"He's the junior disciple of Chi Kun, reaching the seventh stage before a hundred years old. His talent is quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>A figure beside him spoke. He was also observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the seventh stage before a hundred years old without relying on physique or bloodline, that's remarkable." Another figure chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Those who could become ninth-stage evolutionaries were also unparalleled geniuses when they were young, so they were clear that relying purely on oneself to reach the seventh stage before a hundred years old was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those uniquely gifted special lifeforms deep in the starry space, humans were still too weak.</p><p></p><p>This weakness was all-encompassing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason the human civilization could develop to where it was today relied on the advantage of numbers. With a massive population as the foundation, there would always be the birth of a few monstrous variants.</p><p></p><p>On par with those special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The last figure speculated.</p><p></p><p>They did not doubt Lin Yuan's comprehension ability, so they felt he was probably unwilling to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Unwilling to cultivate, then what is he doing here? Tempering his mind and will?"</p><p></p><p>"That works too. For a genius like him, living too short a life and seeing too little, his mind and will have always been a shortcoming. Some tempering is good."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this little fellow is actually able to resist the urge to cultivate the evolutionary paths he comprehended."</p><p></p><p>The figures discussed in low voices.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending a certain evolutionary path from that torso, the evolutionaries would be subjected to an irresistible temptation,</p><p></p><p>subconsciously believing that cultivating this evolutionary path would lead to an incomparably glorious future awaiting them.</p><p></p><p>This was also a latent ability from that torso.</p><p></p><p>This ability had already been infinitely weakened.</p><p></p><p>If facing the main body of the torso and not just a projection in the virtual world,</p><p></p><p>even ninth-stage evolutionaries would not be confident in controlling themselves.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the other evolutionaries who were immersed in cultivation,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was having a much harder time. After the other evolutionaries began cultivating, the oppressive force on their minds and wills would decrease or even cease.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was constantly enduring the suppression on his mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Suppression alone was not enough. Lin Yuan also had to continuously comprehend more evolutionary paths, dissect and understand these paths, and integrate them into his martial evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Dada. Bi." (Nonsensical sounds)</p><p></p><p>Whispers resounded in Lin Yuan's ears, emanating from that torso, echoing incessantly in his mind and will, each word shaking his soul.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could feel the tremors in his mind and consciousness. It was this constant shaking that slowly strengthened his mind and will.</p><p></p><p>This strengthening was very gradual, but at least Lin Yuan could feel it.</p><p></p><p>One had to know that previously, the strengthening of Lin Yuan's mind and will was completely imperceptible. Being able to feel it now was already extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Lin Yuan's mind and will seemed to break through some kind of shackle, and the whispers in his ears suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"My mind and will have undergone a transformation?"</p><p></p><p>This was the only possible reason.</p><p></p><p>"But this suppressive force targeting the mind and will is constantly increasing. As long as I don't stop comprehending and don't start cultivating a certain evolutionary path, the suppressive force will grow heavier and heavier."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Forcing me to cultivate a certain evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"But I won't."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had comprehended a total of 137 evolutionary paths, completely dissected these 137 paths, and only absorbed the beneficial rules and insights for himself.</p><p></p><p>These 137 evolutionary paths had greatly advanced Lin Yuan's progress on the core space model, allowing him to comprehend three more core space models.</p><p></p><p>His martial evolutionary path was also becoming more and more complete.</p><p></p><p>"Let's rest for a bit first."</p><p></p><p>After experiencing a transformation of the mind, Lin Yuan felt a wave of fatigue and simply disconnected his consciousness from the virtual world, returning to reality.</p><p></p><p>"The cosmic treasures have arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan received a message and immediately got up.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Lin Yuan had purchased several cosmic treasures to stabilize his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The inner worlds opened up by evolutionaries were not eternally unchanging and required continuous investment in the later stages.</p><p></p><p>This investment included some cosmic treasures. Certain special cosmic treasures contained the primordial power of certain rules, which could defend the inner world and perfect the world's rules.</p><p></p><p>The battles between eighth-stage evolutionaries were mainly clashes of world power. Without considering factors like talent, secret arts, rule comprehension, etc., whoever had more abundant and powerful world power would gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the palace and looked towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Before long,</p><p></p><p>a cosmic spaceship descended.</p><p></p><p>A staff member carrying a briefcase walked up to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"These are your items. Shuntong Group is at your service."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the suitcase and returned to the main hall.</p><p></p><p>New 89 Book Bar ‚Üí 89shux.com</p><p></p><p>"Cosmic Treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan purchased three Cosmic Treasures in total.</p><p></p><p>They were the 'Primordial Fire', 'Earth Essence', and 'Formless Wind'.</p><p></p><p>All three were eight-star Cosmic Treasures, requiring a total of 16,000 cubic universe crystals, with each one averaging 5-6,000 cubic universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that one cubic universe crystal is equivalent to 100 million universe coins, or 10 trillion civilization coins.</p><p></p><p>In other words, each Cosmic Treasure was worth 5-6 trillion civilization coins, an enormous sum that could buy an entire stellar system.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was only able to purchase these three Cosmic Treasures due to his Level 7 Citizen privilege. Even with money, those with slightly lower citizen levels wouldn't be able to buy them.</p><p></p><p>"I hope they don't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the three Cosmic Treasures before him. To purchase them, his wealth had shrunk by a quarter.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan's consciousness entered his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The three Cosmic Treasures also appeared here.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The glass bottles containing the three Cosmic Treasures shattered.</p><p></p><p>First, the 'Primordial Fire' rose up, directly forming a great sun under the dome of the sky, filling the entire world with warmth and light.</p><p></p><p>Then, the 'Earth Essence' directly merged into the ground. Vaguely, Lin Yuan felt the entire world become much thicker.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the 'Formless Wind' disappeared into the air. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, strands of breeze blew.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the inner world was previously barren, it could now be considered to have "come alive".</p><p></p><p>"The world's power has also increased a lot."</p><p></p><p>"Next time I encounter suitable Cosmic Treasures, I'll buy them again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not every kind of Cosmic Treasure is suitable for integrating into one's inner world. It depends on the specific situation of one's inner world.</p><p></p><p>The three Cosmic Treasures Lin Yuan selected were all very suitable for his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than half a year went by.</p><p></p><p>Most of Lin Yuan's time was spent comprehending that torso, enduring the suppression from the will of the mind, and analyzing the various evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>"The 1325th core space model." Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>More than half a year ago, just after the sixth crossing, Lin Yuan's comprehension of core space models was less than 1,200.</p><p></p><p>Now, in such a short time, he had comprehended more than 100 additional core space models. The evolutionary paths within that torso definitely played an indispensable role in helping Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to core space models, I've also comprehended many core life models." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary paths within that torso were all-encompassing. Every time Lin Yuan thoroughly analyzed one, he benefited greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness disconnected from the virtual world and his mind returned to the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Has a strand of boundary-breaking origin force already accumulated?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms. At this moment, the edge area of this gate of light had been completely lit up.</p><p></p><p>This meant that a complete strand of boundary-breaking origin force had formed, and Lin Yuan could perform the seventh crossing at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>"Crossing worlds may not necessarily have such good conditions for tempering the will of the mind."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and didn't plan to cross immediately.</p><p></p><p>If the mind will index didn't meet the standard and he couldn't enter the 8th stage, even if Lin Yuan crossed, the improvement in his strength would be limited.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the comprehension of spatial laws, without constantly analyzing the evolutionary paths within that torso, forcibly comprehending subsequent core space models at the 7th stage realm would be difficult even for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better to temporarily pause the crossing and wholeheartedly temper his mind will, in order to reach 10,000 points in the mind will index sooner and break through to the 8th stage before proceeding.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the boundary-breaking origin force wouldn't be wasted. It would only accumulate until Lin Yuan used it later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never forgotten his purpose, which was to become stronger. If crossing could make him stronger, he would cross. Now, temporarily pausing the crossing could make him stronger, so he would pause the crossing.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two years went by.</p><p></p><p>During these two years, Lin Yuan's main focus was on tempering his mind will, followed by analyzing the evolutionary paths contained within that torso.</p><p></p><p>Because the further along, the greater the force suppressing the mind will would become, thereby affecting Lin Yuan's comprehension efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped observing that torso under the vast sky and let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Only when observing that torso would one feel the force suppressing the mind will. As the observation time passed, the force suppressing the mind will would become stronger.</p><p></p><p>And when the observation stopped, the force suppressing the mind will would disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, my mind will has undergone three transformations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The first time was two years ago.</p><p></p><p>The second time was a year and two months ago.</p><p></p><p>The third time was a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>After these three mind transformations, Lin Yuan felt that his mind will index should have greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go test how much the mind will index is now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness disconnected from the virtual world and returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Let's rest for a bit first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't immediately test it.</p><p></p><p>The mind will index is not unchanging. It will fluctuate with the evolvers' state.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had just finished comprehending that torso, his mind was somewhat fatigued. Testing at this time, the results might have some deviations and not be that accurate.</p><p></p><p>Only when in a state of mental wholeness could measuring the mind will index yield relatively accurate results.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rested until he was sufficiently recovered.</p><p></p><p>All aspects had returned to their peak.</p><p></p><p>He then reconnected his consciousness to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Entering his personal space.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom, I request to test my mind will index."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made the request to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>The mind will index of evolvers is intangible and elusive. One of the three goddesses must allocate a portion of their computing power to perform an accurate measurement.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, without using any physical or spiritual power, solely relying on your own mind will, impact your surroundings."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom rang out.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan directly followed the instructions.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying mind will pressure spread and permeated in all directions.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The measurement of the mind will index was complete.</p><p></p><p>"How much is it?"</p><p></p><p>A look of anticipation appeared on Lin Yuan's face as he checked the result.</p><p></p><p>"The mind will index is 9234."</p><p></p><p>A sense of joy welled up in Lin Yuan's heart.</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 432 Comprehending Everything (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Black Star was in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>As a Grade A Tenth Level cultivator, who didn't crave to comprehend the second realm of the Pillar-Level Fusion Rules? </p><p></p><p>And then cross over into the Eleventh Level, standing at the pinnacle of the universe, below only the most powerful beings, but above countless lives.</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that there are still higher and lower ranks within the Eleventh Level, the gap between the first rank and the sixth rank of the Eleventh Level is immense.</p><p></p><p>But at least they were in the same realm.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Liuli Star sat beside him, looking envious.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, the Deputy Pagoda Master Nalan had gone even further, discussing with the Lord of the Black Star when she too could take that step.</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, the Lord of the Black Star had advanced first, leaving the Lord of the Liuli Star feeling displeased.</p><p></p><p>For a Grade A Tenth Level cultivator to comprehend the second realm of the Pillar-Level Fusion Rules required heavenly timing, geographical advantages, and personal harmony. The Deputy Pagoda Master Nalan and the Lord of the Black Star were undoubtedly fortunate.</p><p></p><p>It remained to be seen whether the Lord of the Liuli Star could also be so lucky.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Level, ah..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. If nothing went wrong, he would also cross into the Eleventh Level soon.</p><p></p><p>For any life form, entering the Eleventh Level was a great metamorphosis, second only to breaking through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>This was even more so for Lin Yuan. Compared to advancing from the Ninth to the Tenth Level, Lin Yuan's physical body, spiritual soul, and inner world had become incomparably more powerful after being able to withstand the infusion of the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the primordial chaos and void he could withstand was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was withstanding the infusion of the cosmic primordial essence or the primordial chaos and void, it was an unprecedented great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The group continued chatting for a while. The Lord of the Black Star even advised Lin Yuan not to be impatient and to proceed steadily.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other Grade A Tenth Level cultivators, Lin Yuan was still young and had plenty of time to try, while most Grade A Tenth Level cultivators faced the limit of their lifespan and tended to be anxious.</p><p></p><p>And the more anxious they were, the lower the possibility of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the human civilization plans to open a new battlefield against alien races."</p><p></p><p>The topic shifted away from the Eleventh Level, and the Lord of the Liuli Star seemed to recall something and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about that too. Apparently, this new battlefield they plan to open will surpass any previous battlefield, including those over one hundred large-scale alien battlefields."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Black Star immediately responded, having also obtained relevant inside information.</p><p></p><p>The matter of opening a new battlefield involved too many layers, making it difficult to keep completely under wraps.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for this new battlefield the human civilization planned to open, they needed to join hands with other peak powers.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for there to be no wind of it leaking out.</p><p></p><p>"A new battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened from the side, his expression somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>This was something the supreme expert Xia Qin had casually mentioned to him during their chat.</p><p></p><p>The new battlefield the human civilization was opening, or rather, jointly opening with other peak powers, was classified as an ultra-large-scale alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Not only would its direct visual size far surpass any large-scale alien battlefield, but its spatial compression stability would also be far greater.</p><p></p><p>There were a few reasons why an ultra-large-scale alien battlefield was being opened. On one hand, the various peak powers had long planned to do so.</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, the current over one hundred large-scale battlefields could no longer accommodate the battles of experts from the various peak powers.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the main universe, countless experts from the myriad races in the starry skies had basically mastered the art of creating avatars.</p><p></p><p>This led to it being very difficult for them to be truly killed and perish, especially for Eleventh Level experts who could slow their personal flow of time, making it impossible not only for them to perish but even to die of old age.</p><p></p><p>As the high-level experts did not perish, lower-level experts gradually grew into high-level experts.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason for opening an ultra-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to the human civilization's exploration and understanding of past cosmic eras, even without the avatar technique, as time passed, the number of experts in the universe tended to increase overall.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the end of a cosmic era that the universe would reach its most prosperous and flourishing state.</p><p></p><p>But the moment after such prosperity was destruction.</p><p></p><p>When a cosmic era ended, the universe would collapse. Even Twelfth Level supreme experts would have to sacrifice half or more of their number to escape.</p><p></p><p>As for the survival rate of life forms below the supreme experts, that depended on the level of the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>For life forms below the Twelfth Level, the only way to survive the destruction of the universe was to transfer their life imprints from the time river of the universe into the time river within a supreme expert's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>However, the time river within a supreme expert's inner universe could only accommodate a limited number of life imprints.</p><p></p><p>This meant that 99 percent of life forms below the Twelfth Level would die along with the destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>A secondary reason for opening large-scale battlefields was the recent consecutive destruction of two large-scale battlefields not long ago.</p><p></p><p>That extracosmic aurora had destroyed one large-scale battlefield, while the "White Paper" had reduced another to a lower dimension.</p><p></p><p>The consecutive loss of two large-scale battlefields prompted the human civilization and many other peak powers to officially implement the plan to open an ultra-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even without the collapse of those two battlefields, the opening of an ultra-large-scale battlefield was inevitable, just delayed by hundreds of millions or billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit of this new battlefield will be very high, enough to accommodate Eleventh Level perfected experts wielding supreme weapons to fight unrestrained."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Black Star's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Only by raising the intensity of war to an extreme level would they deploy large numbers of Eleventh Level experts, even perfected Eleventh Level experts.</p><p></p><p>Before the "White Paper" had descended, the large-scale alien battlefield where Lin Yuan's solar spiritual mind was located had been brewing a high-intensity war, with many Eleventh Level experts gathering.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Grand Alliance's supreme experts had even mobilized the Four Divine Kings wielding fused supreme weapons, intending to use them as a final trump card to secure victory.</p><p></p><p>Such a situation was extremely rare, occurring perhaps only once every million or billion years.</p><p></p><p>But if the ultra-large-scale battlefield was successfully opened, clashes between Eleventh Level experts would become the norm, and the suppressing forces would consist of perfected Eleventh Level experts or even ultimate existences wielding supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>"However, it doesn't really concern us."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Liuli Star sounded rather relaxed. If large-scale battlefields were the stage for Tenth Level experts, then ultra-large-scale battlefields would be the stage for Eleventh Level experts.</p><p></p><p>And as a Tenth Level expert herself, the Lord of the Liuli Star would most likely still be stationed in a large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that an extremely brutal war will inevitably break out in the initial stages of this new battlefield's opening."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Black Star said solemnly. Regardless of whether it was a small, medium, or large-scale alien battlefield, the intensity of war tended to be terrifying during its opening stages.</p><p></p><p>Many peak powers would vie to establish dominance over the new battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The ultra-large-scale battlefield would be no exception. Compared to those previous large-scale battlefields, the brutality of war in the ultra-large-scale one was estimated to be...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>It had reached an astonishing level.</p><p></p><p>Ending the casual chat with the Lord of the Black Star and other Alpha-level Tenth Floor experts. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the Lord's main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Massive Alien Battlefield"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep, the opening of the massive battlefield would have far-reaching impacts. Including the human civilization, many peak forces of various races would go all out. In the end, it was highly likely to trigger clashes between the most powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to break through to the Eleventh Floor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that everything had reached an optimal state, silently thinking in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly. </p><p></p><p>His gaze looked far towards the direction of the 13th key territory of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, before breaking through to the Eleventh Floor, I've become a member of the Demon Jade Pavilion sequence?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised in his heart. The condition to become a Demon Jade Pavilion sequence member was to comprehend all the demonic evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>And the life level was limited to below the Twelfth Floor.</p><p></p><p>After all, from a core member to a sequence member, it wasn't like storming floors where the higher the displayed potential, the richer the rewards.</p><p></p><p>One only needed to meet the set conditions.</p><p></p><p>It's just that now, this goal was completed before his impact on the Eleventh Floor.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the main hall of the 13th key territory of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his soul's memories, the various demonic evolutionary paths seemed to undergo a qualitative change, converging into that core member imprint of the Demon Jade Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz.</p><p></p><p>The demon jade imprint rapidly metamorphosed.</p><p></p><p>"So the total number of demonic evolutionary paths is thirty-three million, three hundred and thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three kinds?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan finally knew the specific number of demonic evolutionary paths contained within his body.</p><p></p><p>Initially, when observing that segment of his body in the virtual world, Lin Yuan only felt that the evolutionary paths contained in his flesh and blood were vast like an ocean of mist.</p><p></p><p>But now, this "vast like an ocean of mist" had a concrete upper limit.</p><p></p><p>After his spiritual will reached the point where it could easily withstand the spiritual pressure within his body, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the demonic evolutionary paths was like making a thousand miles of progress in a day.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, he had far surpassed the achievements of his comprehension over the past few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture, I have also successfully comprehended the Tenth Floor and Eleventh Floor volumes. As for the Twelfth Floor volume..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This segment of his body was ultimately incomplete. Additionally, the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture had been broken, leaving only scraps of the traces of the Twelfth Floor volume.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension ability, even if it was just scraps, he could still comprehend the full picture.</p><p></p><p>However, the Twelfth Floor far exceeded Lin Yuan's current realm, even if he could comprehend the Twelfth Floor volume of the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture, it would consume a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>"The Tenth Floor and Eleventh Floor volumes are enough for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. He still didn't know when he would impact the ultimate realm. The Eleventh Floor volume of the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture would suffice for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>"The Tenth Floor level 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture will still greatly enhance my physical body."</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan comprehended the Tenth and Eleventh Floor volumes of the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture, it was equivalent to cultivating it to the perfect realm. The only issue was that his physical body had not caught up.</p><p></p><p>After all, the 'Profound Yellow Body' scripture was already perfect. At the Tenth Floor level, there was basically no room for further tempering and enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Other body refining methods could not do better. Even if cultivated to the perfect realm, they would be covered by the 'Profound Yellow Body' scripture, with negligible effects on enhancing the physical body.</p><p></p><p>But the 'Demon Jade Indestructible Body' scripture? This body refining method was completely different from the 'Profound Yellow Body' scripture. If he could also reach the perfect realm with it,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan believed his physical body would make another significant leap forward.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan pondered,</p><p></p><p>Deep in his soul, that demon jade imprint finally completed its metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>A low, hoarse male voice rang out in Lin Yuan's spiritual realm:</p><p></p><p>"Having comprehended all demonic evolutionary paths, you automatically become a Demon Jade Pavilion sequence member."</p><p></p><p>"Demon Jade Pavilion sequence member?" A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Wasn't this the moment he had specifically sent out an avatar to comprehend for?</p><p></p><p>"This demon jade imprint..." Lin Yuan immediately sensed the changes in the demon jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>It became even more profound, even more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Through this demon jade imprint, I vaguely sense the specific location coordinates of that Demon Jade Space?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he became an ordinary member and core member of the Demon Jade Pavilion, Lin Yuan could only descend into the Demon Jade Space through the demon jade imprint.</p><p></p><p>As for anything more, he was unclear.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>He could sense the specific location coordinates of the Demon Jade Space?</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that the Demon Jade Space opened by the Demon Jade Pavilion Master could only be entered by Demon Jade Pavilion disciple members.</p><p></p><p>The outside world had no idea where it was located, even the Demon Jade Pavilion disciple members themselves didn't know the location of the Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the authority of a sequence member?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the Demon Jade Pavilion core members were the elites, then the sequence members were the pillars and foundations.</p><p></p><p>Above the sequence members were the personal disciples of the Demon Jade Pavilion Master, who were being cultivated as future Pavilion Masters and supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>The authority of Demon Jade Pavilion sequence members was immense, they could even take over part of the authority over the Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed the connection of the demon jade imprint, vaguely looking towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already learned from the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji that the Demon Jade Space was not located in any universe,</p><p></p><p>When he truly sensed the specific location of the Demon Jade Space, Lin Yuan was still shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ordinary person who had never left their village their entire life, looking up at the stars in the sky and estimating the distance between the stars and themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>After observing the demon jade imprint deep in his soul for a while, Lin Yuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>The imprint of a Demon Jade Pavilion sequence member was much more complex than that of a core member, but Lin Yuan's current level made it difficult to discern the specific differences.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Demon Jade Space again."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan once again separated a strand of his will, following the connection of the demon jade imprint, instantly crossing the boundless distance to descend into a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's strand of will descended, the entire Demon Jade Space seemed to sense something, trembling slightly, and the surrounding grayish mist suddenly dispersed, as if the gloomy weather was clearing up.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the surroundings and headed straight for the location of the nine-story black pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the nine-story black pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji, who had fallen into slumber, awoke the moment the Demon Jade Space trembled.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji could hardly believe it, and his eye sockets immediately became moist. "My Demon Jade Pavilion has finally birthed another sequence member?"</p>

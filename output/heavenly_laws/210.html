            <p>Chapter 210: The Stunned Primordial Demon Tree (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had overestimated the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>The other party didn't have the courage to "cut off its own flesh" and leave. This foreign evil god had completely lost its mind and placed all its hopes on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So, when Lin Yuan took the initiative to contact the Primordial Demon Tree and expressed that he had already grown to the fifth stage, the joy in the Primordial Demon Tree's heart was imaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity I've been waiting for has finally come."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tianqing World, in a dark void, the Primordial Demon Tree stared intently at the vast world in the distance, as if looking at a delicious cake.</p><p></p><p>After destroying the Evil God Battlefield, the Tianqing Alliance Leader deliberately left the World Sword behind to prevent the Primordial Demon Tree from counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this action was completely unnecessary. The current Primordial Demon Tree only had 50% of its prime essence left, and after losing the invasion battlefield, it was powerless to pose any threat to the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that the seed I planted back then would be the key to my descent into the Tianqing World." The Primordial Demon Tree was in a joyful state of mind.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, it never thought that Lin Yuan would deceive it. As an offshoot derived from the main body, the latter had an almost instinctive loyalty to the former.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianqing Alliance Leader and the others didn't notice you after they went back, right?" The Primordial Demon Tree asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, the Black Mist Mountain Range where I'm hiding is not prominent among the top ten mountain ranges and hasn't received any attention," Lin Yuan said without blushing or having his heart race.</p><p></p><p>"That's good." The Primordial Demon Tree nodded.</p><p></p><p>It also thought so. If Lin Yuan had really been noticed by powerful figures like the Tianqing Alliance Leader, how could he still communicate with it?</p><p></p><p>"Now you start preparing."</p><p></p><p>"In three days, formally open the spatial passage."</p><p></p><p>After a few reminders, the Primordial Demon Tree disconnected the communication.</p><p></p><p>The reason for waiting three days to open the spatial passage was entirely the Primordial Demon Tree's own consideration.</p><p></p><p>Now its body was too large. Although it was not conspicuous compared to the entire Tianqing World, descending into the Tianqing World with such a large body size would be difficult not to attract attention.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the huge body was also a burden on the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>So in these three days, the Primordial Demon Tree planned to condense its form and shrink it to a size within a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could it hide itself as much as possible after passing through the spatial passage and buy enough time to integrate into the world's origin.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can devour the entire origin of the Tianqing World, everything will be worth it."</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree thought to itself. Compressing its body size was extremely painful for it.</p><p></p><p>In the foreign void, the bodies of those evil gods were often millions or tens of millions of miles in size. Was it just for show?</p><p></p><p>Although a huge body reduced agility, it had many benefits in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious was survivability.</p><p></p><p>Between a foreign evil god with a body size of millions of feet and one with a body size of 100,000 feet, who would gain more energy in a single breath?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it was the former.</p><p></p><p>In the foreign void, survivability was crucial. Even for foreign evil gods, most of their lives were spent drifting alone in the void.</p><p></p><p>Encountering other foreign evil gods or a world was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the Primordial Demon Tree was so eager to descend into the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Such an opportunity was too rare and enough for a foreign evil god to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>"In three days?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. The Primordial Demon Tree opening the spatial passage in three days was somewhat beyond his expectations, but still within his plan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan turned his head to look at the Tianqing Alliance Leader and the others below.</p><p></p><p>"Did you bring all your foundations here?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked, feeling a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing World still had many foundations.</p><p></p><p>These foundations were prepared in case of extreme situations where the Primordial Demon Tree invaded the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the formation diagram of the Yin-Yang Reversal, Heaven and Earth Annihilation, Nine Heavens Great Formation has long been set up. With sixteen 7th-stage powerhouses, eighty-eight peak 6th-stage powerhouses, and one hundred ninety-four 6th-stage powerhouses guarding the formation's core, it's foolproof."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, we have brought thirteen Thunder Creation Pearls."</p><p></p><p>"These thirteen Thunder Creation Pearls are the accumulation of my Tianqing World over millions of years."</p><p></p><p>"There will be no problem."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The "Yin-Yang Reversal, Heaven and Earth Annihilation, Nine Heavens Great Formation" mentioned by the Tianqing Alliance Leader was the most powerful formation in the Tianqing World since ancient times. If it weren't for this formation needing to rely on the Tianqing World, if it weren't for the fact that once it left the world's scope, its power would greatly diminish, it would have probably been brought to the Evil God Battlefield long ago.</p><p></p><p>Such a formation could only exert its greatest power within the world.</p><p></p><p>With hundreds of powerhouses at the 6th stage and above activating it, the power of this formation would be elevated to an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Primordial Demon Tree was in its prime, if it accidentally fell into the coverage of this formation, it would either die or have its skin peeled off.</p><p></p><p>As for the Thunder Creation Pearls?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a deep understanding of the power of these pearls.</p><p></p><p>When activated, a single Thunder Creation Pearl would unleash a terrifying power that completely reached the 8th-stage level.</p><p></p><p>The nine heavens thunder of the Tianqing World, nurtured for millions of years, had only produced a total of fifteen Thunder Creation Pearls.</p><p></p><p>Excluding the ones used before, the remaining thirteen Thunder Creation Pearls were brought over by the Tianqing Alliance Leader in one go.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although the Thunder Creation Pearls had terrifying power, their shortcomings were also obvious.</p><p></p><p>That was, the activation time was relatively long, and during the activation period, thunder fluctuations would be emitted.</p><p></p><p>At this time, even a fool could see that you were going to use a trump card.</p><p></p><p>Then, whether to choose to temporarily avoid the sharp edge would have ample time to consider.</p><p></p><p>However, the shortcomings of the Thunder Creation Pearls were equivalent to non-existent for the Primordial Demon Tree that was about to descend.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could completely calculate the time.</p><p></p><p>Activate the Thunder Creation Pearls in advance. By the time the Primordial Demon Tree descended into the Tianqing World, the activation of the Thunder Creation Pearls would basically be coming to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree probably wouldn't have time to react before facing the world-destroying power of thirteen Thunder Creation Pearls.</p><p></p><p>"It still lacks a bit of feeling."</p><p></p><p>The stone longsword World Sword flew out and landed in front of the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>This world weapon could only be activated by the creatures of this world. As for Lin Yuan? Even if he could completely suppress the World Sword, he couldn't activate it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the evil demonic power of the Demon Tree was the exact opposite of the pure power inside the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>During the time Lin Yuan controlled the World Sword, he mainly used it to comprehend the operation of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have the confidence to deal with that foreign evil god by activating this sword?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Tianqing Alliance Leader and asked.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword was the strongest foundation of the Tianqing World, so naturally, Lin Yuan couldn't waste it.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't activate it himself, he would let the World Sword's original owner activate it.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Lin Yuan had now completely controlled the Tianqing Alliance Leader, and the World Sword in his hands...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Black Fog Mountains, the Ancestral Demon Tree emerged from the spatial passage, relishing the pleasant environment of the world compared to the harsh conditions outside the realm. Eager to initiate the secret technique to merge with the world's origin, it suddenly noticed Lin Yuan nearby. </p><p></p><p>Shocked to sense Lin Yuan had reached the peak of the 6th stage, far beyond its expectations, the Ancestral Demon Tree also detected a hint of heart-trembling aura from him. Realizing something was amiss, it turned to retreat through the passage, only to watch it crumble away.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a terrifying aura surged as a formation exuding boundless power unfurled, filling the area with destructive yin-yang energy. Thunder Orbs pulsed with fearsome energy, turning the surroundings into a lightning pool that suppressed the Demon Tree's remaining strength. </p><p></p><p>Hundreds of powerful experts attacked in unison as the Alliance Leader wielded the World Sword, rending space itself. Facing imminent doom, the Ancestral Demon Tree revealed its true form, rapidly expanding, but was still torn apart in an instant by the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>Realizing it could not leave the world alive, the Demon Tree unleashed a terrible mental shockwave in its final moments, confused by the turn of events. It could not fathom how so many experts had ambushed it or how its offspring tree could have possibly betrayed it to join the world's forces.</p><p></p><p>As its massive form was shredded and its essence scattered, Lin Yuan ordered a halt. He then absorbed the remaining half of the Ancestral Demon Tree's pure, evil origin essence in a single gulp.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 400</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry void.</p><p></p><p>This was a desolate star domain. As far as the eye could see for hundreds of thousands of light years around, not a single planet was in sight. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, a faint ripple of spatial fluctuation appeared, and Lin Yuan's form materialized out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The territory of the Stellar Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately used his true primordial self's position as the 'coordinate' to determine his current location.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the senior 'White Paper' would actually send me here?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Before leaving this universe, the half-meter-tall old man had casually tossed Lin Yuan out.</p><p></p><p>And according to Lin Yuan's wishes, the farther away the better, since at that time there were dozens of ultimate existences surrounding 'White Paper'.</p><p></p><p>If tossed nearby, it would be troublesome for those ultimate beings skilled in spatial paths to detect the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I'll have a chance to see senior 'White Paper' again in the future." Lin Yuan fused into the deep layers of space, gazing towards an extremely distant location where a huge spatial rift was slowly healing.</p><p></p><p>The journey through the lower-dimensional space left Lin Yuan with profound feelings and more speculations about the Door to All Realms.</p><p></p><p>The so-called lower-dimensional space was merely a product created by those near-perfect time-life beings to explore worlds of other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even existences approaching perfect time-life could not break through dimensional limits to roam different dimensions.</p><p></p><p>But the Door to All Realms could do this with ease.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Door to All Realms be a treasure of the perfect time-life realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a guess in his heart. From the half-meter-tall old man, he learned of the terrifying power of perfect time-life, which was almost omnipotent and could easily overturn entire timelines if desired.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"It's too far to think about this now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't even a supreme being yet, so considering perfect time-life had no meaning.</p><p></p><p>In any case, since the Door to All Realms had recognized him as its master, everything would become clear once his strength reached that level.</p><p></p><p>"I should return quickly."</p><p></p><p>After observing the surroundings and confirming there were no Stellar Alliance experts nearby, Lin Yuan prepared to return to the human civilization domain.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance territory was vast but typical of being "vast yet sparsely populated."</p><p></p><p>After all, the Stellar Alliance was mainly composed of various special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>And special lifeforms were far from having the reproductive abilities of human civilizations.</p><p></p><p>Even for the most ordinary special lifeform, a single reproductive cycle probably took decades or hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the ones with the strongest reproductive abilities were the insect races.</p><p></p><p>However, the insect races' production of insect warriors could not be considered true reproduction, as the insect warriors were completely controlled by the mother nest and lacked independent wills, not qualifying as life.</p><p></p><p>As for reproduction between official members of the insect races, it was even slower than most special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward, and his form vanished, reappearing millions of light years away.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the rules of space-time fusion, Lin Yuan's travel speed had increased by an unimaginable amount. A single step of millions of light years was already the result of his utmost restraint to prevent the spatial fluctuations from attracting the attention of powerful special lifeforms in the domain.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan went all out, he could easily travel tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of light years in a single step. In short, after comprehending the rules of space-time fusion, distance no longer held much meaning for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could elevate the rules of space-time fusion to the second or third level, the distance he could cross in a single step would only increase further.</p><p></p><p>"What if I combined it with the 'Nine Spatial Steps'?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, planning to test his maximum speed limit when he had a chance.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>Although this journey into the two-dimensional world carried great danger, with the risk of his solar primordial soul being completely erased, thus affecting his martial foundation, the gains were also immense if he could successfully emerge.</p><p></p><p>First of all, everything from the peak experts of the myriad races, including their physical bodies, souls, and many other profound mysteries, as well as their understanding of the rules, had fallen into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Although according to the half-meter-tall old man, apart from the comprehension of space-time fusion rules, the other aspects had not undergone 'tempering' or 'refinement', it was still far beyond expectations and infinitely easier than comprehending from scratch.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, there were those 'wondrous objects'.</p><p></p><p>One must know that over the course of millions of years, Lin Yuan had traveled to every corner of the two-dimensional world, naturally acquiring many wondrous objects.</p><p></p><p>These objects were not very useful in the two-dimensional world - at least not for Lin Yuan who was invincible there at the time, with or without them made no difference.</p><p></p><p>But once brought out, they would become priceless treasures and weapons in the twelve-star realms.</p><p></p><p>"If I had known only one victor could exist, I could have extorted those peak clans one more time." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>During the second opening of the heavenly gate, when Lin Yuan pushed it open, the other peak experts of the myriad races instinctively thought they could also push open the gate, so they didn't plan to let Lin Yuan bring the wondrous objects out.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there was no need for the solar primordial soul to rush back."</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly occurred to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had another identity - the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was opened by the Xuanhuang Sovereign and rooted in this universe. As its master, Lin Yuan could directly enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm through the Xuanhuang imprint as long as he was within this universe.</p><p></p><p>Then, he could 'transfer' through the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to return to the galactic domain.</p><p></p><p>In the Stellar Alliance territory.</p><p></p><p>The traveling Lin Yuan stopped, then activated the Xuanhuang imprint deep in his soul, and his form swiftly vanished, pulled into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master." A six-armed figure stood respectfully, bowing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As the 'spirit' of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, it could sense all changes within the secret realm, so it naturally knew when Lin Yuan entered.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"You can leave first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the six-armed figure and instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"It's safe now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt relieved. He was currently carrying many wondrous objects, so even at the main star of the galaxy, safety could not be guaranteed. But in this Xuanhuang Secret Realm, there was no danger at all.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look at this silver mirror."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the silver mirror directly.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Free from the constraints of the two-dimensional world, the silver mirror seemed to be reviving, emanating vast spatial fluctuations like a small universe unfolding.</p><p></p><p>However, as the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan could command the entire realm's power, so there was no pressure.</p><p></p><p>"After bringing it out, I need to refine it before I can reopen the space contained within?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative. In the main universe, the silver mirror's supreme weapon power had revived, but it could only be preliminarily used after refinement.</p><p></p><p>Of course, refining the silver mirror posed no difficulty for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Back in the two-dimensional world, he had already infused it with a great deal of spiritual force, equivalent to half the refinement process.</p><p></p><p>Now, continuing the refinement was simply a matter of course, taking at most a month or two.</p><p></p><p>However, this was merely refinement. To catalyze this supreme weapon to its full revived might was still beyond Lin Yuan's current abilities - at least until he reached the eleventh stage and his strength underwent another major transformation would it become possible.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization's history, powerful evolvers would occasionally appear, wielding supreme weapons and heading to mid-sized or small alien battlefields, striking out permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>In reality, supreme beings were still catalyzing those supreme weapons from behind. Ordinary eleventh-stage evolvers, even if drained of all their strength, could not catalyze a supreme weapon to unleash a strike of the twelfth stage realm.</p><p></p><p>During the refinement of the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the five crystalline spheres of light.</p><p></p><p>These were also Lin Yuan's rewards as the victor, while those wondrous objects were what he had painstakingly found in the two-dimensional world, not counting as rewards.</p><p></p><p>Of the five crystalline spheres of light, one had a pure aura, representing the sphere containing the myriad races' comprehension of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>As for the other four crystalline spheres, they appeared slightly 'turbid'.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look at this one." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan randomly selected one of the four turbid spheres of light, cautiously probing it with his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness began to rumble.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was astonished.</p><p></p><p>He had transformed into a towering figure of flame, a blazing giant hundreds of millions of kilometers tall, currently lying asleep in a vast ocean of molten rock.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Turbid Fire Sovereign? A legendary eleventh-stage perfected lifeform?" Based on the characteristics of the flame giant, Lin Yuan immediately recognized who it was.</p><p></p><p>The Turbid Fire Sovereign...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That was during the first time the Heavenly Gate opened, when he, a skinny old man, together with four other eleventh-level perfected legendary-strength experts, launched an attack on the Four Celestial Kings. </p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, the Turbid Fire King had a slender physique, but in the main universe, he was a unique special life form, only slightly inferior to the Four Celestial Kings and the Mother of the Arboreal Realm. Otherwise, he would not have attempted to attack the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>"It's too inconceivable." Lin Yuan clearly felt every part of the Flame Giant's body, the subtle structures of its flesh, and grasped the many innate abilities it possessed. Even if the Flame Giant was just breathing, the profound rules involved made Lin Yuan entranced.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a unique special life form?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his divine sense from the light cluster, his gaze filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to humans, special life forms were far too powerful, especially the unique ones like the Flame Giant, who were born at the sixth level. With just a few naps, they could reach the ninth or tenth level, and growing to the eleventh level was also very easy for them.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad races of the starry cosmos, even for a pinnacle bloodline like the Xinghai Youkun, adulthood only meant reaching the sixth level. To cross into the seventh or eighth level, they still had to rely on their own efforts.</p><p></p><p>Most Xinghai Youkun could not reach the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>But unique special life forms? They were the 'favorites' of this universe, requiring little effort to advance their life levels, naturally growing to the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was precisely because of this 'ease' that the probability of unique special life forms breaking through to the ultimate was very low. Talent and innate qualities alone were useless in becoming the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Among the many ultimate existences in the current universe, the majority were life forms that grew from weakness.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan divided his divine sense and entered the light cluster again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan transformed into a silver-armored, golden-horned alien race, and he was battling a powerful life form.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Space was constantly collapsing.</p><p></p><p>During the battle, the silver-armored, golden-horned alien race displayed many rule comprehension techniques, all of which surged into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of matter, this silver-armored, golden-horned alien race has a high attainment in the rules of great destruction," Lin Yuan thought silently. "And its flesh, although not as incredible as the Turbid Fire King's, is also extremely inconceivable in some aspects."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to delve deeper into his comprehension. The four clusters of crystalline light given to him by the half-meter-tall old man had not undergone specialized 'tempering' or 'purification'.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the direct comprehension he gained from the cluster of fused space-time rules, these clusters could not provide such direct insights.</p><p></p><p>But it made no difference to Lin Yuan. With his extraordinary comprehension ability, countless insights emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth level of martial arts, I have a direction now."</p><p></p><p>After observing all aspects of the powerful experts from various races, Lin Yuan had a specific plan for opening up the tenth level of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The flesh!"</p><p></p><p>"The soul!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and soul were the foundations of the path of martial arts evolution. Starting from the fourth and fifth levels, the path of martial arts evolution that Lin Yuan had opened focused on rule comprehension and his inner world.</p><p></p><p>But for the tenth level, Lin Yuan would shift his attention back to the flesh and soul.</p><p></p><p>With the many special life forms among the powerful experts as references, Lin Yuan gained new insights into the subtle structures of the flesh and the essence of the soul.</p><p></p><p>Although the human civilization was far behind those special life forms with profound foundations, it did not mean humans would always lag behind. The tenth level of martial arts that Lin Yuan was now opening was rapidly absorbing the strengths of those special life forms.</p><p></p><p>In theory, if Lin Yuan followed this line of thought to create and open up the tenth level, any future martial arts cultivators who practiced it would not be inferior to those special life forms in any aspect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's observation of the flesh, souls, rule comprehension, and even memories of the powerful experts from various races not only greatly helped him perfect the tenth level of martial arts but also greatly benefited himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's flesh was gradually transforming towards perfection, and his comprehension of various rules, especially the fusion rules of the major pillars, was rapidly improving.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Two months went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he looked towards a floating silver mirror in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, the initial refinement is successful." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The silver mirror, a supreme weapon without an owner, had been continuously infused with Lin Yuan's spiritual force in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>From the start of the refinement until now, it had almost encountered no setbacks or obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Swish, swish.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's initial refinement of the silver mirror, his consciousness entered the world contained within it.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Within the two-dimensional world, the internal world of the silver mirror was merely a cramped space of ten square meters.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's consciousness merged into it, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>An immensely vast world appeared before Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The size of the space here has a diameter of at least ten thousand light-years, right?" Lin Yuan murmured to himself. From its size alone, the inner universe of a supreme being was probably about the same.</p><p></p><p>"Such a massive world, once fully activated, would be no weaker than a supreme being's full power." Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>However, to fully activate the silver mirror would require at least a supreme being. Even if Lin Yuan crossed into the eleventh level, he could at most slightly activate it, but fully activating it was far beyond his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see the other artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Following his senses, Lin Yuan came to a massive stone platform.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred artifacts were arranged here. After a quick count, the total number of artifacts exceeded one hundred.</p><p></p><p>As he left the two-dimensional world, the silver mirror began to revive, and these artifacts also gradually revived.</p><p></p><p>If not within the world of the silver mirror, but in the main universe, the combined waves emitted by these over a hundred 'artifacts' would likely affect tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Among these artifacts, eleven of them belong to human civilization." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan picked out eleven artifacts from the over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>During the millennia in the two-dimensional world, Xuanxuan Du and many human civilization evolvers had been searching for various artifacts, and they had given Lin Yuan a total of twenty-two artifacts.</p><p></p><p>According to the agreement between Lin Yuan and the supreme being Xia Qin, after bringing out these twenty-two artifacts, Lin Yuan could keep half of them.</p><p></p><p>"So many artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the remaining nearly a hundred artifacts, his divine sense surging with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Even supreme existences would probably be tempted upon seeing so many artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, calm down."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan steadied his mind. Although these artifacts were incredibly precious, they held little practical use for Lin Yuan at his current stage.</p><p></p><p>His current life level was still too low to fully utilize these artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, step by step."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully transferred the eleven artifacts belonging to human civilization into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"No major issues."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. The eleven artifacts, eleven twelfth-grade precious treasures and weapons, had their might completely concealed, floating tightly within his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send these artifacts to the supreme being Xia Qin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan placed these eleven artifacts separately in his inner world, while the silver mirror and the other artifacts were kept in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>After completing these tasks, the Solar Primordial Spirit left the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and a figure silently appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>It was the Solar Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"You're back?" Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme being Butterfly has been waiting for me for some time." Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and the Solar Primordial Spirit left the Milky Way Prime Star, arriving in a starry space.</p><p></p><p>Days ago, a manifestation of the supreme being Butterfly had already appeared outside the Milky Way Prime Star, ensuring Lin Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was the only surviving powerful expert from various races in the White Scroll Realm, and although other alien races were unaware of this, the human civilization had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, supreme being Butterfly." </p><p></p><p>The Solar Primordial Spirit of Lin Yuan flew out and slightly bowed to the illusory figure in the starry space.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." The supreme being Butterfly smiled gently and said, "Let me take you to the third major realm of my human civilization. The other supreme beings wish to see you."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme beings?" Lin Yuan's expression showed slight puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Xia Qin and the other eight want to see you," the supreme being Butterfly looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Eight supreme beings?" Lin Yuan held his breath. If the supreme being Butterfly before him was included, that would make nine supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Nine supreme beings of the human civilization, all present just to see him?</p><p></p><p>Unless it was a matter of life and death for the human civilization, the nine supreme beings of the human civilization rarely gathered together, as most supreme beings had their own matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

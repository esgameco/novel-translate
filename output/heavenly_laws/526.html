        <h1>Chapter 526</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gourd was no longer its original grayish-purple color.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it displayed a translucent jade color.</p><p></p><p>Pure.</p><p></p><p>Flawless.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gently caressed it, and a large amount of information flowed from the gourd into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This jade gourd..."</p><p></p><p>An expression of shock appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The information conveyed by the transformed jade gourd was not difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>The general meaning was â€”</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had awakened the gourd to its current form, he must have already absorbed the previous seven divine liquids, completing the most basic foundation.</p><p></p><p>Next, in order to fully refine the jade gourd, he needed to comprehend the 3,333 runes contained within the gourd's inner space within one cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could he fully control the jade gourd and obtain its greatest benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing the seven colored liquids, breaking through the shackles and limitations of the inner world, expanding it to 23 times its original size, was merely completing the most basic foundation?"</p><p></p><p>A wave of emotion rose in Lin Yuan's heart. Until now, even after residing in the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent for a period of time,</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of any method that could increase the basic size of a living being's inner world, let alone not just an ordinary increase, but a direct expansion of 23 times. "This gourd..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected himself. Since obtaining the gourd, he had made many speculations and guesses about it, but he never imagined it would be like this.</p><p></p><p>"3,333 runes..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan hesitated for a moment, then divided a bit of his consciousness to try to penetrate into the gourd.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived in a vast world. Here, the sense of spatial pressure was terrifyingly extreme. The same attack that could destroy a galaxy in the universe could only break a rock here.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of time and space, along with various pillar rules, as well as the essential structure of this world." Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Just this world alone made him extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the runes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. The information transmitted to him by the jade gourd was to enter the world inside the gourd and then comprehend the 3,333 runes.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth condensed, forming a figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure stood there silently, with dozens or hundreds of subtle time rivers faintly flowing around its body.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it wasn't that the time rivers were subtle, but that this figure was too enormous, only appearing at a normal height before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His hair was curly and wavy, seemingly containing endless time and space. Even though it was just a condensed virtual image, it had a sense of crushing everything.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long I've lived, always carefree and unfettered," the figure spoke calmly. "Until one day, I suddenly felt that I should leave something for this dimensional realm, after all, I was born here, and it wouldn't be right to leave nothing behind."</p><p></p><p>"This dimensional realm." Lin Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>An existence that could be described as a dimensional realm must be at an inconceivably high level of life.</p><p></p><p>The vast and boundless chaos void was only a part of this dimensional realm, possibly a part serving as the main body, but the concept of a dimensional realm was definitely greater than the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>The various worlds Lin Yuan had traversed in the past all originated from other dimensional realms.</p><p></p><p>"After much thought, I crafted thirty-three jade gourds and scattered them about. Those with destiny may obtain them."</p><p></p><p>"Each jade gourd contains my Dao, my methods, my foundation, and my roots."</p><p></p><p>"And this jade gourd represents my foundation."</p><p></p><p>"I've always believed that the foundation is extremely important. With a solid foundation, even if the path you walk or the methods you cultivate are a bit weaker, you can make up for it through your foundation. A solid foundation makes everything a life does easier."</p><p></p><p>The figure smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Foundation." Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what foundation the figure was referring to, based on the seven liquids from the mysterious gourd earlier, it should be related to the inner world or inner universe.</p><p></p><p>If that was truly the case, then what this figure said was indeed correct.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan had crossed into the twelfth level, his inner world, which surpassed other beings at the same level by dozens of times, allowed him to basically sweep through everything. Even if his comprehension of rules was inferior to others, what did it matter? With a vast inner world and abundant world power in operation, he could completely break through all methods with sheer force.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all along, Lin Yuan's greatest strength had been his comprehension of rules. With his heaven-defying comprehension ability, understanding rules was extremely simple for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be impatient. Only by fully refining the jade gourd can you obtain what I've left behind."</p><p></p><p>"And to refine the jade gourd, you must comprehend the 3,333 runes I've left within one cosmic era."</p><p></p><p>"If you haven't comprehended these 3,333 runes, or if the time used exceeds one cosmic era, it means you're not suitable for my path of foundation."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the jade gourd will disappear and randomly appear somewhere else in this dimensional realm, waiting for the next destined person to arrive."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, the figure smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it directly dispersed, transforming into thousands of runes floating in this world.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't comprehend them, the jade gourd will disappear?" Lin Yuan's heart tightened. At this moment, how could he not know that the being who left the jade gourd was very likely the legendary thirteenth-level time life form.</p><p></p><p>Something left behind by a time life form was enough to make a group of Chaos Great Saints red with envy and even fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he certainly didn't want the jade gourd to disappear.</p><p></p><p>"With a limit of one cosmic era, the difficulty of comprehending these runes must be extremely high," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the thirteenth-level time life form believed that as long as all the runes could be comprehended within one cosmic era, one would be qualified to fully control this jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>"These runes..."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan looked at the more than three thousand runes floating in the world.</p><p></p><p>Each rune was about the size of a fist, but vaguely seemed like a universe.</p><p></p><p>"One rune equals one universe?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean that 3,333 runes were equivalent to 3,333 universes, equivalent to 3,333 Chaos Venerables?</p><p></p><p>"It's not exactly one universe." Lin Yuan observed carefully, his gaze passing over each rune.</p><p></p><p>Each type of rune represented a special structure of a universe. Strictly speaking, the 3,333 runes explained 3,333 types of universe structures.</p><p></p><p>The essence and origin of universes are the same, but different structures and different microscopic arrangements ultimately form vastly different universes.</p><p></p><p>Just like the most basic material, carbon element, different structural methods can form two completely different substances: diamond and graphite.</p><p></p><p>The same applies to universes.</p><p></p><p>"There are actually so many structural methods for universes?" Lin Yuan looked at the 3,333 runes, marveling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter which structural method, the universe formed in the end would be far superior to the home universe where Lin Yuan resided.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still hesitating instead of focusing on comprehending the first rune?" A childish voice came through. A delicate, porcelain-like little girl in red clothes with two pigtails appeared not far away, looking at Lin Yuan with boredom as she reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Lin Yuan looked towards the red-clothed girl.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the condensed silhouette from before, the red-clothed girl seemed more like a living being. That silhouette was clearly just an image, without any consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?" The red-clothed girl rolled her eyes, "If you can pass the test, you'll be my master, and I'll assist you in cultivating the legacy left by the old master."</p><p></p><p>"You don't think you can cultivate the old master's legacy on your own, do you?"</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl should be like a 'teacher' role, prepared by the being who left the jade gourd for future inheritors, to guide them on how to cultivate the legacy within the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>"The old master was so great, even just the foundational legacy he left behind is as difficult as ascending to heaven to practice. Without me guiding you on the side, there's even less hope."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl puffed out her chest, speaking proudly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed so.</p><p></p><p>Many legacies of human civilization also came with a lot of guidance. Relying solely on oneself to cultivate would make it very difficult to achieve anything.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you understand my importance." The red-clothed girl continued: "These 3,333 runes represent 3,333 different methods of universe construction."</p><p></p><p>"As for their use..."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl said: "It's to integrate them into your inner universe, allowing your inner universe to possess all the advantages of these 3,333 universe construction methods."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl explained.</p><p></p><p>"Inner universe." Lin Yuan also thought of this point.</p><p></p><p>For inner universes of the same size and area, what determines their level is the universe structure.</p><p></p><p>The more perfect the universe structure, the more profound the inner universe's foundation. This is the strongest foundation for twelfth-level life forms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, each method of inner universe construction is incredibly complex, and the difficulty of comprehending them can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>The universe is vast and boundless, and its construction methods are even more so. It's precisely because of this that the jade gourd's owner set a time limit of one universe era.</p><p></p><p>"If I could comprehend these 3,333 universe construction methods and integrate them into my inner universe, what level would my inner universe reach?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly had a thought and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend 3,333 universe construction methods?" The red-clothed girl blinked, "You haven't even started, and you're already thinking about what happens after you comprehend them all?"</p><p></p><p>"However, if you really could do that, your inner universe would probably approach the level of a normal Chaos Realm inner universe."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl thought for a moment before explaining.</p><p></p><p>She also hoped Lin Yuan could comprehend all the runes within one universe era, as it meant she could also gain a certain degree of freedom, instead of being trapped in the jade gourd for long ages, one universe era after another.</p><p></p><p>"Approaching a normal Chaos Realm inner universe?" Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>A normal Chaos Venerable's inner universe? It meant Lin Yuan's ability to withstand the universe's great destruction would surge. If this was true, relying on himself alone would be enough to carry most of the human civilization's clan groups and withstand the universe's great destruction.</p><p></p><p>"For now, don't think too much about that. Focus on comprehending all the runes within one universe era." The red-clothed girl reminded him again.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the starry universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan revealed his form.</p><p></p><p>A fist-sized palace appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>It was the ultimate Dao Realm peak defensive palace activated by the Universe Clan.</p><p></p><p>Inside were dozens of twelfth-level ultimates from this universe, imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>"The universe's great destruction is about to come, there's no need to drag things out with these twelfth-level beings anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's original plan, he was going to keep imprisoning the dozens of ultimates in the palace until he reached the Chaos Realm, reaching the level of Chaos Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Then he would deal with them all at once.</p><p></p><p>The home universe was still far from the normal universe's great destruction.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's cultivation speed, before the normal universe's great destruction arrived, he couldn't say for sure about reaching Chaos Great Saint, but he was confident about reaching Chaos Realm Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But the battle between two Chaos Great Saints caused the universe's great destruction to come early.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Lin Yuan had only two choices regarding the dozens of twelfth-level ultimates in the palace.</p><p></p><p>One was to continue ignoring them, and when the universe's great destruction came, casually throw the palace into the depths of the universe, letting the dozens of twelfth-level ultimates inside perish along with the universe.</p><p></p><p>But this choice was somewhat wasteful.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the ultimate Dao Realm peak palace itself, as well as the many weapons, treasures, and rarities of the dozens of twelfth-level ultimates inside, would all be lost.</p><p></p><p>So there was a second choice.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan planned to release the dozens of twelfth-level ultimates inside, on the condition that they hand over all their weapons, treasures, rarities, and the ultimate Dao Realm peak defensive palace.</p><p></p><p>This choice maximized benefits.</p><p></p><p>As for any potential threats from the released dozens of twelfth-level ultimates... With Lin Yuan's current strength, even a casually condensed avatar would have true ultimate Dao Realm peak power. These twelfth-level ultimates, even if released, would only cower in corners, trembling.</p><p></p><p>With a rustle,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly, and the seal on the palace in front of him faded a little.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being of the Milky Way, we are willing to hand over 90% of our weapons, treasures, and rarities, just asking you to let us out."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Supreme Being of the Milky Way, as long as you release us, I am willing to submit to human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Supreme Being of the Milky Way, we were wrong before."</p><p></p><p>From inside the palace came the pleas of dozens of twelfth-level ultimates.</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid, worried that Lin Yuan would wait until the universe's great destruction and throw the palace imprisoning all the twelfth-level beings into the depths of the universe.</p><p></p><p>If so, all the twelfth-level beings would die. Who could withstand the rounds of destructive tribulations of the universe's great destruction?</p><p></p><p>"You want to get out? I can release you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the dozens of twelfth-level beings in the palace. At this moment, these twelfth-level beings posed no threat to him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the universe itself suppressing him, even a mere ultimate Dao Realm peak defensive palace couldn't block Lin Yuan's killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"You can let us out?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the twelfth-level ultimates were a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"But you must hand over all your twelfth-level weapons, treasures, and rarities," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing."</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing."</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing too."</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace, the many twelfth-level ultimates agreed without hesitation, not even thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

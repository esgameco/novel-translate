        <h1>Chapter 585</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>In the rear of the Zimen Domain battlefield, two figures stood in the void, overlooking the distant battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The figure standing slightly behind was the Lingwei King, a member of the royal family of the ancient Great Ling Kingdom who had been enfeoffed as a king. The Lingwei King had orchestrated and initiated this war that had engulfed dozens of surrounding major domains.</p><p></p><p>From the start of the war until now, the Zimen Domain had maintained the advantage on the main battlefronts, while the Qingfen Domain had been primarily on the defensive.</p><p></p><p>"I've more or less grasped the methods of that Chisong King. This time, I need you, my younger brother, to step in and decide the outcome."</p><p></p><p>The Lingwei King glanced at the figure to his left front.</p><p></p><p>It was his younger brother, the Lingshen King, a core member of the royal family of the ancient Great Ling Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Among the many ancient kingdoms in the source world, those whose ancestral bloodline concentration reached the level of the core royal family were extremely rare, even fewer than the number of Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>As long as a core royal family member entered the Great Exalt realm and adapted for a period, they could easily sweep aside opponents at the same level.</p><p></p><p>The powerful ancestral bloodline force made each core royal family member's combat prowess formidable.</p><p></p><p>If they could fully unleash their bloodline power, the core royal family members at the Great Exalt realm could even contend with Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for a core royal family member, reaching the limit of their bloodline power was not an easy task. But it was still much simpler than a Great Exalt breaking through to become a Celestial Exalt.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, cultivation is the foundation." The Lingshen King glanced at the Lingwei King. "Is the imperial throne that important to you, brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Very important." The Lingwei King admitted frankly.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the emperor of an ancient kingdom had many benefits, including refining the royal bloodline within one's body.</p><p></p><p>For core royal family members, their bloodline concentration was already close to saturation and could not be further increased, but for ordinary royal family members, the allure of refining their bloodline concentration was still significant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the Lingwei King, refining his own bloodline concentration was not the sole purpose of becoming the ancient kingdom's emperor. He valued the control of imperial power more.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have your talent, little brother. Becoming the emperor is my only hope."</p><p></p><p>The Lingwei King sighed, also feeling a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>Although the Lingshen King was his brother, the two did not have a very close relationship. This time, to request the Lingshen King's assistance, the Lingwei King had paid a considerable price.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The Lingshen King was silent for a while, then spoke, "This time, I will help you completely clear away all obstacles in this war."</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, that Chijiu King is not an easy opponent to deal with." The Lingwei King was alarmed and quickly warned.</p><p></p><p>The Chijiu King was the third elder brother of the Chisong King, also a core royal family member.</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation age, the Chijiu King was far beyond the Lingshen King. The Lingwei King's expectation was that the Lingshen King would just need to hold the Chijiu King in check.</p><p></p><p>"Chijiu King?" The Lingshen King's tone was calm. "A core royal family member who has not reached their limit is not my opponent."</p><p></p><p>For a core royal family member to be able to contend with a Celestial Exalt, it required fully unlocking the potential of their ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The threshold between the Great Exalt and Celestial Exalt realms was not easily crossed, even with the support of the potent Thirteen Tiers of Life bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Your bloodline, little brother." The Lingwei King's pupils contracted, looking at his brother with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Lingshen King nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good." The Lingwei King was filled with ecstatic joy.</p><p></p><p>A core royal family member who had unlocked their bloodline to the extreme could be considered the strongest force under the Celestial Exalts.</p><p></p><p>And there had been no news of the Chijiu King reaching his limit after all these years.</p><p></p><p>That meant that once the Lingshen King and Chijiu King engaged in battle, the victor would undoubtedly be the Lingshen King.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, little brother is right? Cultivation is the foundation?" The Lingwei King's mind briefly flashed with this thought amidst his joy, but it was quickly replaced by excitement. "Whatever, let's first break through the Qingfen Domain."</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Chisong King and Chijiu King stood at the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"It should be time to begin the decisive battle." The Chisong King gazed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The war had been ongoing for five hundred years, and the two sides had clashed numerous times.</p><p></p><p>Fierce battles between peak Great Exalts had also occurred frequently.</p><p></p><p>The Chisong King had a premonition that the Lingwei King's side was about to become impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, the trouble will fall to you next." The Chisong King spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." The Chijiu King smiled at the Chisong King. "I'll take care of the Lingshen King. I've heard the Lingshen King of the Great Ling Kingdom has an astonishing ancestral bloodline, so I'm curious to see it for myself today."</p><p></p><p>"The Lingshen King's reputation is indeed great." The Chisong King nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Lingshen King was the youngest core royal family member of the Great Ling Kingdom. It was said that when his bloodline concentration was tested, it directly triggered an ancestral phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, should I invite a few more enfeoffed kings to come?" The Chisong King thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Can you even summon them?" The Chijiu King glanced at the Chisong King and chuckled. "Moreover, if you continue to invite more enfeoffed kings, the Lingwei King will also invite more, and the intensity of the war will only escalate further."</p><p></p><p>Local conflicts between ancient kingdoms were common occurrences, but they would maintain a certain degree of restraint in the intensity of the war.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a single enfeoffed royal family member stationed on the battlefield would be sufficient. Inviting more enfeoffed kings? Not only would the cost increase exponentially, but it would also raise the intensity of the war.</p><p></p><p>At that point, if the war became too intense and spiraled out of control, involving more and more major domains, it would lead to an all-out war between the ancient kingdoms, with many powerful Celestial Exalts intervening.</p><p></p><p>That would be a completely uncontrollable situation. Even the ambitious Lingwei King did not wish to face such a scenario. If the war intensity was too high, the situation would no longer be under his control. Even if he won the war, the glory and prestige he gained might not be much more than the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Winning would not significantly increase his reputation, and if he lost, he would be branded as the ancient kingdom's criminal, facing unimaginable punishment, such as imprisonment for billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"I see." The Chisong King nodded.</p><p></p><p>The cost of escalating the war intensity would be greater than the cost of losing a normal war.</p><p></p><p>"How is the current situation?" The Chijiu King casually inquired.</p><p></p><p>"It's still okay. The battles between the Great Exalts, the Lingwei King's side has a slight advantage, but not a significant one. As long as you can hold back the Lingshen King, the Lingwei King won't be able to do anything to me." The Chisong King was very confident. In terms of battlefield deployment, the Chisong King believed he had reached the pinnacle. Unless the opponent's strength was overwhelming, they would not be able to break through.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you've secretly allowed a Great Exalt to study the war machine?" The Chijiu King gazed at the battlefield and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's the Yinhe Great Exalt, a newly ascended Great Exalt, a disciple of the Qingfen. His potential is not bad." The Chisong King nodded. Allowing an outsider to study the war machine was clearly a violation of the ancient kingdom's rules.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else asking, the Chisong King would have denied it and pretended to be unaware. But this was his third brother, the Chijiu King, so the Chisong King truthfully told him.</p><p></p><p>"You have such high expectations of him?" The Chijiu King smiled, not interfering further.</p><p></p><p>From his perspective, even a peak Great Exalt was not worthy of his attention. As a core royal family member, even without reaching his limit, he could easily sweep aside opponents at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Tier 10 Defense Line Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position, his aura deeply concealed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years have passed, and Lin Yuan has completely integrated the source of the Scorching Sun into his own cosmic universe. The true primordial spirit of the chaotic void, the true primordial spirit of this source world, and the cosmic universe within him have all assimilated and devoured the source of the Scorching Sun.</p><p></p><p>"How marvelous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the cosmic universe within him, with a blazing sun enthroned at the center, its radiance spreading in all directions. "My current strength should surpass that of the peak Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. At this moment, with the source of the Scorching Sun fused and devoured within his cosmic universe, it was equivalent to constantly maintaining the "Scorching Sun Parting the Heavens" divine ability. The foundation and profundity were so formidable that even without using any rule-based techniques, he could suppress a peak Sovereign through sheer foundation alone.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. The Celestial Lord of this source world was equivalent to a Great Saint in the chaotic void. He had never truly fought against one, so Lin Yuan was unsure of their relative strengths.</p><p></p><p>"Now, in this source world, I finally have the power to protect myself."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Although he was unsure if he could match the Celestial Lord, it was clear that the Celestial Lord would have great difficulty harming him. Even if he was no match, he could at least ensure his own safety.</p><p></p><p>As for the Celestial Lord, they were already considered top-tier combat forces. Above them were the Emperors of the various ancient nations, and then the Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The combat prowess of the Emperors of the ancient nations surpassed that of the Celestial Lords because they wielded weapons bestowed by the Ancestors, but the Ancestors' weapons were not easily wielded, and there were many restrictive conditions.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, as long as Lin Yuan was careful, the threat from the ancient nation Emperors could also be ignored.</p><p></p><p>"There is only one more Class-A war machine left to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Over the past five hundred years, he had comprehended most of the war machines on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Only the last Class-A war machine remained, and he had already almost grasped its secrets. With his comprehension speed, it would only take a moment or a few months at most to fully understand it.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became pensive. He had already comprehended the chaotic secret patterns in almost all the war machines. Now, his understanding of the Chaotic Rules was just a step away from reaching the peak of the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's just the last Scorching Sun seed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. Over the past five hundred years, his cultivation in all aspects had progressed rapidly, but the Scorching Sun seed had been stubbornly stuck.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-third Scorching Sun seed was on the verge of being fully condensed, yet it had not taken that final step.</p><p></p><p>"Is there some unknown constraint or shackle?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, planning to investigate it after he had fully comprehended the last war machine.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he looked towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Grand Sovereign Long Feng was leading numerous war machines in a massive assault towards this area.</p><p></p><p>"Another attack?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed. It had been less than half a year since the last attack, but according to the previous pattern, the intervals between attacks should have been at least ten to dozens of years.</p><p></p><p>After all, the war machines needed repairs, and the Sovereign also needed to rest.</p><p></p><p>In the airspace above the Yiyi-13 Defense Line.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Grand Sovereign Long Feng faced each other from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Brother, you'll need to be careful from now on."</p><p></p><p>Grand Sovereign Long Feng transmitted a secret message, warning him.</p><p></p><p>Over the past five hundred years of conflict, Lin Yuan and Grand Sovereign Long Feng had developed a tacit understanding, never fighting to the death. They had formed a deep camaraderie.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for the Sovereigns, their social connections and friendships were not restricted by the ancient nations. The Sovereigns of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation and the Great Spirit Ancient Nation also had very good relationships with each other.</p><p></p><p>Many Sovereigns would even travel to different ancient nations, serving different nations at intervals.</p><p></p><p>"Careful?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Grand Sovereign Long Feng's special reminder meant that it was not a warning about himself.</p><p></p><p>Over the past five hundred years, even if Lin Yuan had hidden his true strength, the techniques he had revealed were still difficult for Grand Sovereign Long Feng to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Spiritual Majesty King about to launch the final battle?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inquired through the secret transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Grand Sovereign Long Feng hesitated for a moment before nodding.</p><p></p><p>This was not a secret, and even if he had not said anything, Lin Yuan would have soon learned about it, as all the Sovereigns on the core defense line had already gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The final battle?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the core defense line battlefield.</p><p></p><p>On the core defense line battlefield, the auras of peak Sovereigns permeated the thick space-time. Rows of Class-A war machines were facing off against each other.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis, Red Leaf Sovereign, and other peak Sovereigns had solemn expressions. The two domains had been preparing for this final battle for a long time, and they had already probed each other extensively over the past five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were entering the final decisive battle stage.</p><p></p><p>The duration of the final battle would not be short, but both sides would undoubtedly fight with all their might, and the hidden trump cards they had been concealing would be gradually revealed.</p><p></p><p>"The core defense line battlefield will definitely be the most brutal battleground, and it shouldn't have reached the Yiyi-13 Defense Line yet."</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis' thoughts drifted as he glanced at the distant Yiyi-13 Defense Line.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the peak Sovereigns on both sides clashed fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the past, when only a few peak Sovereigns fought with full force, this time all the peak Sovereigns were unleashing their full power, with almost no reservations.</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis was surrounded by blue flames that began to burn the space-time, spreading the invisible scorching flames in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The other peak Sovereigns also began to use various techniques, and in an instant, the entire battlefield area was collapsing, even affecting the clashing Class-A war machines below.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Dao Abyss."</p><p></p><p>On the Violet Dream Domain side, a towering peak Sovereign stepped forward, and the heavens and earth began to crumble. Qingfen Marquis and the other peak Sovereigns started to be affected.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of technique?"</p><p></p><p>Qingfen Marquis' expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The other Sovereigns also felt that the Chaotic Evolutionary Power they wielded was being suppressed and weakened.</p><p></p><p>At the rear of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Chisonge King and Chijue King had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I must intervene."</p><p></p><p>Chijue King spoke, the towering peak Sovereign from the Violet Dream Domain was clearly a hidden trump card of the Spiritual Majesty King, and his strength was powerful enough to influence the battle between the more than ten peak Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>If Chijue King did not step in to stop him, the peak Sovereigns from the Qingfeng Domain might be completely at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Chisonge King nodded, as he also saw that the battlefield situation was not looking good for their side.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the battlefield, it was as if the heavens and earth had been forcibly torn open, and a mass of scarlet flames coalesced. The towering peak Sovereign retreated several steps.</p><p></p><p>"Chijue King."</p><p></p><p>The towering peak Sovereign's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared above all the peak Sovereigns, with scarlet eyes that burned like a blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>However, before the many peak Sovereigns could react.</p><p></p><p>"Chijue."</p><p></p><p>A mysterious aura of divine might permeated the area, and a figure appeared in front of Chijue King, a smile on his face: "Let me see the techniques of the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation's imperial clan."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

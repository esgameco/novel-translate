        <h1>Chapter 494</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the rapidly approaching "shooting star", Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Although the chaotic void contained countless opportunities, Lin Yuan, who had not explored much, already had opportunities coming his way.</p><p></p><p>This was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe where human civilization resides, there had been numerous occasions where precious treasures and rarities fell through the eternal spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>This was because the universe itself, within the chaotic void, was akin to a massive celestial body. It unconsciously influenced the surrounding vast expanse of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Any object passing by would be drawn in by the universe's pull, eventually falling through the eternal spatial rifts into the interior of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Given the universe's massive size and the long passage of time, it was only natural that it would "net" some nearby drifting precious treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Compared to the main universe, he was far too insignificant, and the probability of him randomly encountering such precious opportunities was very low.</p><p></p><p>"According to the trajectory of this 'shooting star', it will pass near the main universe."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, it may be drawn in by the main universe and, millions of years later, fall through some eternal spatial rift, becoming an opportunity from outside the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, in a sense, he was now intercepting the ultimate opportunities of the twelfth-level within the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try to stop it in advance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the 'shooting star', "There is a flow of array aura, this 'shooting star' should be the immortal abode of some powerful cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Although there were naturally formed great arrays in the chaotic void, the might of these killing arrays was immense, far exceeding the array aura flowing within this 'shooting star'.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yuan deduced that this 'shooting star' was the immortal abode of some powerful cultivator, as great arrays were generally used as immortal abodes if they were man-made.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of the immortal abode should no longer be present."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan drew more conclusions, if the immortal abode's owner was still there, he would never have seen this 'shooting star', as any immortal abode would certainly prioritize secrecy, usually hidden deep within the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Even for those rare mobile immortal abodes, they would try their best to conceal their aura, for although the chaotic void contained countless opportunities, it also harbored many risks.</p><p></p><p>During his exploration, Lin Yuan's avatar had also been cautious.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly approaching 'shooting star', with its aura exposed, was a sign of it being uncontrolled.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time vortex."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and he began to try obstructing the 'shooting star's trajectory using his seventh-level space-time comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan was just an avatar, so his capabilities were very limited. Directly blocking the 'shooting star'? With its speed, Lin Yuan's avatar would be instantly crushed and scattered to the winds.</p><p></p><p>So he could only attempt to obstruct it indirectly, by continuously influencing the 'shooting star's flight path.</p><p></p><p>This method could not stop the 'shooting star' in a short time, but it could effectively slow it down, which was very prudent.</p><p></p><p>"The speed has decreased."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart settled, as he had been most worried that the space-time vortex's obstruction would have no effect on the 'shooting star'.</p><p></p><p>But now, the effect was quite obvious.</p><p></p><p>It was also because Lin Yuan's control of space-time forces at the seventh level was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>If it were the twelfth-level ultimates within the main universe, relying solely on sixth-level space-time comprehension, the impact on the 'shooting star' would be much smaller.</p><p></p><p>"At the current rate, it will take at most half a day to completely stop the 'shooting star'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, quickly controlling the space-time forces to obstruct the 'shooting star'.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>The rapidly approaching 'shooting star' gradually slowed down and finally came to a stop in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Standing close by, Lin Yuan could see the full appearance of the 'shooting star' - it was a massive island, with a diameter exceeding ten million miles.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the island stood a palace, while the surrounding area was filled with undulating mountains and interconnected lakes.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen twelve-star spirit trees?" Lin Yuan immediately noticed the twelve-star level spirit trees swaying near the central palace.</p><p></p><p>The fruits on the branches of the trees were emanating a powerful energy aura.</p><p></p><p>"It's a jackpot." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Compared to twelfth-level weapon materials and the like, these twelve-star spirit trees that could bear spiritual fruits were akin to money trees, able to produce valuable spiritual fruits at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these eighteen spirit trees, the island itself was a rare material, although only at the initial twelfth-star level, but the quantity was vast, covering an area of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"The control core of this immortal abode should be in that palace."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not pay attention to the spirit trees around the palace, as there were remnants of spatial forces around them, likely placed by the immortal abode's owner.</p><p></p><p>To bypass these spatial barriers, the simplest method would be to refine the control core of the island, and then the entire island would be under Lin Yuan's control.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split into two, as he was already an avatar, a manifestation of the chaotic qi. As long as he divided a thread of his spiritual will, he could form a new avatar.</p><p></p><p>Uncertain of the dangers within the palace, Lin Yuan naturally prepared a backup.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The avatar Lin Yuan had split off descended upon the island, heading towards the central palace.</p><p></p><p>"This palace doesn't seem to have any obstructions." Lin Yuan inspected the palace and cautiously observed it for a while before entering.</p><p></p><p>The palace was vast, and Lin Yuan quickly toured it, finally arriving at a certain inner hall.</p><p></p><p>There, a twelve-sided crystal stone was suspended, faintly gathering the aura of the entire giant island.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the control core of the immortal abode." Lin Yuan thought to himself, and immediately began to attempt touching and refining the crystal stone.</p><p></p><p>At that moment.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The entire palace suddenly roared to life, and the originally calm twelve-sided crystal stone began to glow, with an invisible aura converging to form a round, chubby figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure had short limbs and looked like a plump ball, with round, bulging eyes. As it appeared, it stretched and looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the immortal abode's owner?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was extremely alert, ready to disperse this avatar at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my true self has long since died, and what remains here is just a mark." The chubby figure spoke in the common language of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan had never learned it, he could understand and communicate in it naturally.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>This so-called "mark" was not even a spiritual will, just a trace of information, a remnant.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I should have known not to go to that Taiyan Relic, and now my true self didn't make it out alive." The chubby figure sighed, muttering to itself.</p><p></p><p>"Taiyan Relic?" Lin Yuan heard this from a distance, and his heart couldn't help but be stirred.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had never left the main universe, he had heard of the name Taiyan Relic, a notorious dangerous place in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is one of the great opportunity lands.</p><p></p><p>The extraterrestrial aurora that previously fell into the main universe, as well as that 'blank paper', originated from the ruins of Taiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Many heritage lineages within the main universe have mentioned the name of the Taiyuan ruins.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't help it, after all, there are traces of almost perfect time life existence there, I've been trapped at the peak of the Dominator Realm for dozens of universe eras, if I can gain some opportunities there, I have a chance to cross into the Chaos Realm."</p><p></p><p>The round and chubby figure was talking to himself, with some frustration in his words.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of the Dominator Realm?" Lin Yuan was secretly shocked when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Realms are divided into three levels: Enlightenment, Dominator, and Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Dominator Realm, even in the Chaos Void, can be considered a powerful expert. In the heyday of the Xuanhuang lineage and the Magic Jade Pavilion, there were only a few at the peak of the Dominator Realm.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of powerful expert actually died, died in the Taiyuan secret realm?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't believe that an expert at this level wouldn't have any life-saving methods, even if their true body and master were destroyed, it would be difficult for them to die completely. But according to the words of the round and chubby figure, it was obviously a complete death.</p><p></p><p>"Later arrival, which Chaos Era is it now?" The round and chubby figure looked at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>"Which Chaos Era?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback, hesitating for a moment and said, "Senior, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>He had just left the main universe not long ago, so naturally he didn't know what period the Chaos Void was in.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know?" The round and chubby figure's brow furrowed slightly. Basically, all life forms in the Chaos Void know the Chaos Eras, but Lin Yuan doesn't know?</p><p></p><p>"I am not a life form born in the Chaos Void, but from the universe," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"From the universe?" The round and chubby figure looked puzzled, "Did the universe you were in undergo a great destruction?"</p><p></p><p>"It has not undergone a great destruction yet," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Without a great destruction, how did you leave?" The round and chubby figure carefully examined Lin Yuan, his expression becoming more and more surprised. "Your understanding of time and space has reached the Seventh Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, no wonder you can send out a manifestation to explore the Chaos Void, only with such a high level of time and space understanding can you avoid being affected. But this manifestation of yours, is it condensed from Chaos Qi? Have you comprehended the Chaos Rules?"</p><p></p><p>The round and chubby figure was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>As a peak Dominator Realm expert, he naturally knew how the lives in the universe were. Even for the Twelve Realms, their lifespan would not exceed one universe era.</p><p></p><p>Because at the end of a universe era, the Twelve Realm experts would have to go through the great destruction calamity with the universe, and at least half of the ordinary Enlightenment Realm Twelve Realms would die before they could enter the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan, without experiencing the great destruction calamity, has already reached the Seventh Realm of time and space understanding? And also comprehended the Chaos Rules?</p><p></p><p>The former is easy to explain, but the latter? Comprehending the Chaos Rules is one of the most difficult thresholds for a Dominator Realm to cross into the Chaos Realm, and he also took the risk of entering the Taiyuan ruins just to obtain the opportunity to comprehend the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>"I was lucky, I accidentally comprehended it," Lin Yuan hesitated for a while and said.</p><p></p><p>The round and chubby figure could see that Lin Yuan's time and space understanding had reached the Seventh Realm, which did not surprise Lin Yuan, after all, the time and space rules he used just now to block the island were the Seventh Realm time and space rules.</p><p></p><p>At least when the round and chubby figure took back control of the island, he could see it.</p><p></p><p>According to the information left by the Xuanhuang lineage and the Magic Jade Pavilion, time and space Seventh Realm understanding is extremely rare for life forms in the universe, but it is a bit better in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Normal peak Enlightenment Realm experts have the hope of reaching the time and space Seventh Realm understanding, and the time and space understanding of Dominator Realm experts starts from the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Rules? That's very hard to come by, many peak Dominator Realm existences haven't comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend the Chaos Rules within one universe era, when you're only at the Enlightenment Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable, remarkable." The round and chubby figure was silent for a moment, his face revealing an expression of awe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he knew that Lin Yuan was currently only at the Eleventh Realm, not the Twelfth Realm Enlightenment Realm, he would be shocked countless times more.</p><p></p><p>If it's said that Enlightenment Realm experts can comprehend the Chaos Rules, there are still some rumors in the vast Chaos Void, and they are the disciples cultivated by those Chaos Realm Supremes.</p><p></p><p>But for an Eleventh Realm to comprehend the Chaos Rules, it has already completely exceeded the round and chubby figure's knowledge, even Xuanhuang the Emperor and the Master of the Magic Jade Pavilion have only heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that after my 'Cangweihao' died for countless eras, I would still be able to see such a genius."</p><p></p><p>The round and chubby figure said with a sentimental tone.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Enlightenment Realm experts who comprehended the Chaos Rules were all cultivated by those Chaos Supremes, but Lin Yuan? As a life form from the universe, the heritage he can access is extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, to still be able to comprehend the Chaos Rules, the round and chubby figure didn't know how to describe it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was silent below, listening.</p><p></p><p>Although he is only at the Eleventh Realm, his mental will has reached 40 million points, and with the Chaos Qi swirling around him, outsiders would find it difficult to see through his true realm.</p><p></p><p>"Within one era, to comprehend the Chaos Rules at the Enlightenment Realm level, you should have a great hope of crossing into the Chaos Realm in the future," the round and chubby figure 'Cangweihao' said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the disciples cultivated by those Chaos Supremes cannot be sure that they will definitely be able to cross into the Chaos Realm, comprehending the Chaos Rules is just one of the thresholds to enter the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is different from those disciples.</p><p></p><p>In 'Cangweihao's' view, Lin Yuan's potential is unknown to be much higher than the former, so he said that he has a great hope of crossing into the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>These four words "great hope" are already the highest praise from the round and chubby figure 'Cangweihao'.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Realm is too far away for me." Lin Yuan said beside him.</p><p></p><p>He is only at the Eleventh Realm now, he should first cross into the Enlightenment Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Too far?" The round and chubby figure 'Cangweihao' looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's talk about the main matter." The round and chubby figure 'Cangweihao' calmed down and said, "This cave mansion is one of the three cave mansions I often secluded in, containing eighteen Dominator Realm level rare trees, as well as three Dominator Realm secret treasures and one Chaos Realm secret treasure."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there are many secret cultivation methods that I practiced."</p><p></p><p>"Three Dominator Realm secret treasures? One Chaos Realm secret treasure?" Lin Yuan was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The weapons and treasures of the Twelve Realms are also divided into levels, from low to high: Enlightenment Realm, Dominator Realm, and Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful weapons and armaments in the main universe are only Enlightenment Realm, and the guardian weapons of the various peak clans are at most peak Enlightenment Realm or special Enlightenment Realm secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, I should select a successor for this cave mansion and its many inheritances and treasures, let him go through various trials, and make him take many oaths before handing everything over to him," the round and chubby figure 'Cangweihao' paused for a moment, then said with a complex tone, "But I don't feel qualified to take you as my successor."</p><p></p><p>"So, everything in the cave mansion is yours."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

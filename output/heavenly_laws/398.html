        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The virtual world. </p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhizhe, the supreme being, sat solemnly on the throne, his expression grave. "You mean to say that the 'blank paper' already has an owner?"</p><p></p><p>In the long years of the main universe's past, objects from outside the universe would often squeeze through the permanent spatial cracks. </p><p></p><p>The vast majority of these extra-universal objects were 'inanimate'.</p><p></p><p>For example, the extra-universal aurora that appeared not long ago.</p><p></p><p>But a small portion were 'living beings'.</p><p></p><p>During the dormant years of human civilization, on the large battlefield opened up by the Insect Race and the Feathered Race, an anomalous life form squeezed through one of those permanent spatial cracks.</p><p></p><p>This anomalous life form nearly brought an irreversible disaster to the universe's starry realm.</p><p></p><p>In the end, more than a dozen supreme beings joined forces to barely banish that anomalous life form back outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to 'inanimate objects', 'living beings' had greater unpredictability, enough to put even ultimate existences on guard.</p><p></p><p>If what Lin Yuan said was correct, that the 'blank paper' already had an owner, and that owner was inside the 'blank paper' itself, then they, as ultimate existences, would have to re-evaluate how to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"Can't say it has an owner, at least it has given birth to a 'spirit' with an independent will," Lin Yuan stated his conjecture.</p><p></p><p>According to the half-meter-tall old man, the two-dimensional world within this 'blank paper' was created by a great existence close to a perfect temporal life.</p><p></p><p>But the half-meter-tall old man himself did not seem to be close to a perfect temporal life, at most he was similar to an existence like a 'spirit', or a 'butler' casually created by the near-perfect temporal life.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it has an independent will, it counts as a 'living being'," Xia Qinzhizhe, the supreme being, frowned. "No wonder for these past hundred years, our repeated attempts to refine it have had no effect whatsoever."</p><p></p><p>With the means of an ultimate existence, if it were truly an ownerless object, not to mention being completely refined, there should have at least been some hope.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, their attempts to refine the 'blank paper' had received absolutely no response.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing," Lin Yuan hesitated for a moment before continuing, "The evolutionary trailblazers of my human civilization within the two-dimensional world probably can't come out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then repeated what the half-meter-tall old man had said.</p><p></p><p>"Of all the lifeforms that fall into the two-dimensional world, only one can eventually leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stated truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"I see, so that's how it is," Xia Qinzhizhe fell silent for a moment before quickly accepting it.</p><p></p><p>If not for Lin Yuan, none of the evolutionary trailblazers of human civilization would be able to leave following normal development.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had never fallen into the two-dimensional world, then it would have been a stage for special lifeforms, and the eventual victor would only be legendary special lifeforms like the Four Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>That Lin Yuan became the final victor of the two-dimensional world already satisfied Xia Qinzhizhe immensely - at least they didn't have to face a fundamental loss.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had mentioned that the final victor would receive a corresponding reward.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xia Qinzhizhe didn't ask about the specifics of the reward, as that was Lin Yuan's personal opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>"Don't feel burdened, that they can't come out is not because of you."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhizhe consoled Lin Yuan with a few words.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed true that even with Lin Yuan's appearance, he had recovered some of the losses.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had brought out many wondrous objects. Even if Lin Yuan took away half of them, and the human civilization took away a portion of the remaining half, what was left in the hands of each human evolutionary trailblazer would still be considered immensely precious.</p><p></p><p>Although they could not restore the fundamental losses suffered by the many human evolutionary trailblazers, they could make up for most of it in other ways.</p><p></p><p>"No one else knows about this, right?" Xia Qinzhizhe suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"It seems not," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before nodding. "Even for me, it was only from the increasing difficulty when the Heavenly Gate opened twice that I vaguely deduced something like this was happening. It wasn't until I entered the Heavenly Gate and met that half-meter-tall old man that I fully confirmed it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other myriad races? They never even had a chance to come into contact with the Heavenly Gate, let alone think in this direction or know about this."</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan obediently sat in the corner, secretly observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Are you wondering where those lifeforms that entered the Heavenly Gate in the past are now?" The half-meter-tall old man glanced at Lin Yuan in front of the huge painting and casually said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a bit curious," Lin Yuan did have such thoughts.</p><p></p><p>How long had the history of the two-dimensional world lasted? It was probably calculated in cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>According to the Heavenly Gate opening once every ten thousand years, there should have been many lifeforms leaving the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of this low-dimensional space, that great existence close to a perfect temporal life, was benevolent. He believed that even tiny low-dimensional lifeforms should have the freedom to break free from everything."</p><p></p><p>"That's why the Heavenly Gate opens once every ten thousand years," the half-meter-tall old man explained.</p><p></p><p>"Any lifeform that enters the Heavenly Gate can shed the nature of a low-dimensional lifeform. I usually toss them into a nearby universe."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I've tossed quite a few into your universe too. Most of them are already dead now," the half-meter-tall old man casually said.</p><p></p><p>The initial intention behind the creation of this low-dimensional space was to explore even lower-dimensional worlds. Secondly, it was discovered that by projecting a sliver of spiritual will into it, it could conduct a battle of insights from the same starting point.</p><p></p><p>The latter gradually became the main purpose of this low-dimensional space. Over the long years of constant refinement, it gave birth to a complete low-dimensional world within, where countless low-dimensional lifeforms multiplied.</p><p></p><p>Later, after a great calamity, this low-dimensional space fell dormant within the Taiyan Ruins. Eon after eon passed, until it was eventually ejected from the Taiyan Ruins by the various forces within, automatically beginning to absorb all nearby lifeforms into the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>As long as there were enough lifeforms that fell into the two-dimensional world, this low-dimensional space would slowly come to a halt and begin a new 'game'.</p><p></p><p>These were like fixed 'programs' engraved in the deepest part of the 'blank paper', which even the half-meter-tall old man had to follow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan fell into a brief silence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, escaping the low-dimensional space was not necessarily a good thing for those lifeforms within the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperors and Demon Patriarchs who dominated in the two-dimensional world might become extremely weak in the main universe. Their upper limits would be raised, but how many could actually reach those limits?</p><p></p><p>Just as the half-meter-tall old man said, the vast majority of low-dimensional lifeforms tossed into nearby universes would die in a short time, and the few who persisted for a while would also eventually die.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed towards the distant huge painting and vaguely sensed a change in it.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn as he felt the fluctuations in the flow of time within the painting, beginning to surge rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"To take away all the 'insights into the rules' from the game participants, they naturally need to die completely," the half-meter-tall old man rarely explained.</p><p></p><p>"A hundredfold increase in the flow of time is really too slow. Let me speed it up."</p><p></p><p>Just as the half-meter-tall old man finished speaking, Lin Yuan saw that the flow of time within the painting had already reached a million to one, ten million to one ratio.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings and many other powerful beings of the myriad races witnessed Lin Yuan enter the Heavenly Gate, which then quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>They each left Heavenly Mountain, waiting for the next opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>As eleventh-step lifeforms, their insights were naturally among the best. After expending a great deal of time and effort, they had also comprehended some longevity techniques.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the longevity of the Demon Patriarch's Thirtieth and Fortieth Realms, enduring tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Next time the Heavenly Gate opens, the one entering will definitely be me," the Four Divine Kings were full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Four Divine Kings' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the 'coordinates' of their true bodies outside, they clearly felt the change in the flow of time within the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>From the original hundredfold, it began to surge infinitely.</p><p></p><p>In the span of a dozen minutes in the main universe, ten thousand years had passed in the two-dimensional world, heralding the third opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>This time, when the Heavenly Gate opened, the Four Divine Kings swept across all directions and stood before the gate.</p><p></p><p>However, what awaited them was an immovable Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years passed.</p><p></p><p>Twenty thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Fifty thousand years. </p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings stood before the Heavenly Gate time and again, only to find themselves unable to open it. In the end, they could only grow old and die in the two-dimensional world with immense resentment.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did this 'blank paper' undergo such changes?"  </p><p></p><p>"Why is there such a vast difference in the flow of time?"</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, the ultimate existences raged, especially the supreme beings of the Stellar Grand Union.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Those, including the strongest of the universe clans, they paid an enormous price so that the clan members they valued could survive the human Blood Rain. </p><p></p><p>But in the end they still died inside it?</p><p></p><p>Then what was the point of the price they paid before?</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, what is really going on here?" The strongest of the Cosmic Alliance immediately looked towards the strongest Xia Qin, the changes in the flow of time in the two-dimensional world of the White Paper occurred after the human Blood Rain entered.</p><p></p><p>If they said there was no relation, the ultimate existences present would not believe it.</p><p></p><p>"How would I know what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The strongest Xia Qin shook his head, "My human evolutionary 'Blood Rain', after entering the Heavenly Gate, lost control over its avatar and suffered a fundamental loss."</p><p></p><p>The strongest Xia Qin spoke up directly. </p><p></p><p>After all, there was no way to prove this matter, so he could say whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't think that a mere eleventh-stage life could control this 'White Paper', did you?"</p><p></p><p>The strongest Xia Qin questioned back.</p><p></p><p>Any ultimate existence could see that this White Paper contained vast amounts of energy, at least far exceeding that of an individual strongest.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not have left dozens of ultimate existences helpless for over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that this 'White Paper' is actually a 'living being' with an independent will, and the fate of all lives that fall into it has already been determined."</p><p></p><p>The strongest Xia Qin said.</p><p></p><p>Ever since hearing some information about this 'White Paper' from Lin Yuan, the strongest Xia Qin had prepared this reason.</p><p></p><p>"A living being?"</p><p></p><p>The many ultimate existences looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>This conjecture was not impossible, especially now that the flow of time within the White Paper had changed on its own, clearly driven by some will.</p><p></p><p>And was this will the human Blood Rain? The human Blood Rain had only just entered the Heavenly Gate. And at the eleventh-stage of life, refining this 'White Paper' would be nothing but a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Inside the White Paper.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the huge scroll where tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Even for ultimate lives that had transcended the river of time, maintaining such an exaggerated ratio for a short period would require paying a price.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the range over which the half-meter-tall old man maintained the time ratio was an entire two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man's hands kept fiddling with the huge scroll, and crystalline bright lights kept emerging from the scroll, gathering in the old man's hands.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, over a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old man's hands had condensed a fist-sized crystalline light sphere.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only glanced at it from afar, but could sense the infinite time and space essence circulating within.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the insight of all the powerful beings of the various races within the scroll into the fusion of time and space rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>To extract one's insight into a certain rule, especially by forced extraction, seemed impossible.</p><p></p><p>Within the black planet, the twelve fusion rule guides for the fusion spaces were derived from ultimate existences, and were also voluntarily extracted by ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>But now, the insights of over a billion powerful beings of the various races into the fusion of time and space rules had all converged into that crystalline light sphere. Lin Yuan deduced that this was achieved through the method of dimensional reduction, lowering the essence of life, and then extracting it.</p><p></p><p>This method could only be used on lives below the twelfth stage. As for twelfth-stage ultimate existences?</p><p></p><p>They could completely resist the power of dimensional reduction.</p><p></p><p>Even if they fell into a lower dimensional space, extracting their insight into the rules would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>The essence of a twelfth-stage life was not as easily manipulated as an eleventh-stage life.</p><p></p><p>"Done."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man looked at the crystalline light sphere in his hand and turned to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior." Lin Yuan immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"This is yours." </p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man lightly tossed it, and the crystalline light sphere flew towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only observed it from a short distance, not even touching it, when he was instantly immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>Countless insights into the fusion of time and space rules seemed to endlessly pour into his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, observing the origin of the fusion of time rules and space rules, your comprehension of the time-space fusion rules has greatly increased.]</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred-plus years, in addition to comprehending the twelve pillar-level fusion rules on the black planet, Lin Yuan would also comprehend the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>After all, the time-space fusion rules were closely related to breaking through to the ultimate realm, and being able to comprehend the time-space fusion rules at the tenth stage would allow one's inner world to become more perfect.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan attempted to break through to the eleventh stage in the future, the benefits he would gain from the infusion of chaos origin would also be greater.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the infusion of cosmic origin or the infusion of chaos origin, the essence was to fill a basin with water.</p><p></p><p>Whether this basin was only half a meter wide or as vast as a lake, it would ultimately be filled by the infused origin within three hundred and thirty-three seconds.</p><p></p><p>So, the larger the basin, the more water it could hold, and the more terrifying the metamorphosis it would undergo.</p><p></p><p>Here, the 'basin' basically referred to one's inner world.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending the time-space fusion rules was tantamount to making one's inner world more perfect and complete, allowing it to withstand more origin infusion.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time-space fusion rules was slow, and he had almost no hope of comprehending it at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>This was only normal - it was nearly impossible for a tenth-stage life to comprehend the time rules, let alone the fusion of time and space rules. This had not occurred even in the past ten cosmic cycles of this universe.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Observing the crystalline light sphere before him, Lin Yuan indeed felt that his comprehension of the time-space fusion rules was rapidly increasing by leaps and bounds every minute and second.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, observing the origin of the fusion of time rules and space rules, your comprehension of the time-space fusion rules has greatly increased.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closely observed the crystalline light sphere before him. At this moment, all of his mind, including his true body, his Yin Yuan spirit, and his many avatars, abandoned their previous tasks and focused entirely on comprehending the crystalline light sphere.</p><p></p><p>After the half-meter-tall old man tossed the crystalline light sphere to Lin Yuan in front of the huge scroll, he noticed that Lin Yuan's attention was completely immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>"He's actually starting to have a breakthrough comprehension?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man raised his brows, but was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>For any powerful being, a breakthrough comprehension was a rare opportunity, during which one's comprehension ability would experience an explosive increase. Even for a twelfth-stage existence, having a breakthrough comprehension once was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man felt deeply. Even before becoming a twelfth-stage existence, his comprehension ability was stronger than most twelfth-stage existences, and much stronger at that, defying all reason.</p><p></p><p>It seemed completely normal to the half-meter-tall old man that Lin Yuan had fallen into a breakthrough comprehension state.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how much of an increase this breakthrough comprehension will bring? In the time-space fusion rules, he should be able to make further progress?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man speculated with interest.</p><p></p><p>Even with the direct rule insights contained in the crystalline light sphere, absorbing them was not something that could be done in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>It was like an extremely hungry person being presented with a cartload of steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>To eat his fill, even if he opened his stomach without any restrictions, from putting the buns in his mouth to swallowing them and digesting them, it would still take time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this time was much simpler compared to normal comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Which was akin to creating the steamed buns from scratch - planting the wheat seeds, growing the wheat, milling it into flour, and finally making the steamed buns, an extremely complex series of processes.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how simple, it still required time.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying, observing the origin of the fusion of time rules and space rules, you have comprehended the time-space fusion rules.]</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the galaxy, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and the myriad insights about the time-space fusion rules that emerged in his mind finally reached a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the boundary between time and space completely disappeared before Lin Yuan, and the two could easily fuse together.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned to one of enlightenment, as wisps of time rules and space rules fused together before him, converging into a brand new force that possessed yet transcended time and space.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the time-space fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Among the many fusion rules, the time-space fusion rules were undoubtedly the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Inside the White Paper, Lin Yuan's expression also showed enlightenment. He raised his right hand, and the forces of time and space seemed like playthings, interweaving and fusing at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"He's already comprehended the time-space fusion rules?"</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the half-meter-tall old man who was observing Lin Yuan couldn't help but reveal an astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 453: The Reputation of Lin Yuan (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The moment the avatar carried all the powerful weapons and entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan knew it was settled.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Solar Divine Celestial perished on the battlefield, these powerful weapons would still be completely his, and those Alien Twelve Tribulation experts would be unable to take them away.</p><p></p><p>"Next, there is one more thing that needs to be confirmed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred as he came to the deepest part of the secret realm, which was also the safest place in the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The Yin Divine Celestial descended and appeared in this place as well.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a six-armed figure appeared and slightly bowed towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He manifested here in response to Lin Yuan's summons.</p><p></p><p>"As the 'Spirit' of this secret realm, you should be able to tell if there are any remnant imprints or methods left in these Twelve Tribulation weapons, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six-armed figure and took out the spatial bracelet, directly handing it over.</p><p></p><p>On the massive battlefield, the more than 600 powerful weapons harvested were from the various peak clan forces, and perhaps they had left some methods behind.</p><p></p><p>To be absolutely certain, Lin Yuan naturally wanted to inspect them thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure was the 'Spirit' of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, created by the former Emperor Xuan. Although his strength was not powerful, his perception of alien energies and auras was definitely superior to Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure took the spatial bracelet and, with the power of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, began to thoroughly inspect every powerful weapon inside.</p><p></p><p>"So many Twelve Tribulation weapons?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure was slightly surprised inwardly. These Twelve Tribulation weapons were nothing special during the peak era of the Emperor Xuan lineage, but this was within the universe.</p><p></p><p>How did so many Twelve Tribulation weapons end up in the master's hands?</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure collected his thoughts and did not ponder further, immediately beginning to carefully inspect each powerful weapon.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure returned the bracelet and respectfully answered, "Master, there are no remnant energy aura methods left on any of the Twelve Tribulation weapons."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the powerful weapons truly had remnant methods left by the Alien Twelve Tribulation experts, they should have been activated when Lin Yuan suppressed those Alien Eleven Tribulation experts.</p><p></p><p>Since they were not activated, it was highly likely that no such backup methods existed.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had already guessed as much, he still had the six-armed figure inspect them to be at ease.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the six-armed figure, Lin Yuan still trusted him quite a bit. Perhaps in direct combat ability, the six-armed figure was not as strong as the Twelve Tribulation experts.</p><p></p><p>But for the Alien Twelve Tribulation experts to leave behind any aura methods that could evade the detection and perception of the six-armed figure, unless that Twelve Tribulation expert was a Chaotic Realm powerhouse, it would be impossible to do so.</p><p></p><p>And Chaotic Realm powerhouses were all supreme experts who roamed the Chaotic Void. It was virtually impossible for a Chaotic Realm powerhouse to have been born within this universe in the current era.</p><p></p><p>If there was a Chaotic Realm powerhouse among the Eleven Peak Clan Forces, then there would be no human civilization left, as all life in the universe would have to submit to that Chaotic Realm powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Place all these powerful weapons here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan came to the place where his other powerful weapons and Twelve Stellar Treasures were stored, and placed the spatial bracelet in a corner.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Lin Yuan was not lacking in powerful weapons. To ensure the smooth progress of the massive battlefield, Lin Yuan had the Solar Divine Celestial select a few suitable powerful weapons to carry.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the worst outcome would be the Solar Divine Celestial perishing on the battlefield, losing a few powerful weapons, but this kind of loss was completely bearable.</p><p></p><p>If the Solar Divine Celestial perished, Lin Yuan could easily condense it again, and as for the powerful weapons? Before entering the massive battlefield, Lin Yuan had already stockpiled more than 30 powerful weapons.</p><p></p><p>Massive Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Human Civilization Alliance's War Base.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the control room, and Xuanyuan You and many other human civilization evolutions stood below, reporting the latest situation on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, currently our Human Civilization Alliance and other strong forces have occupied the Victory Altar in the center of the battlefield. As long as we can hold out for a hundred years, we can smoothly obtain the first right to dominate the war."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan You spoke respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he completely regarded Lin Yuan as a high-ranking figure above himself, and he was also wholeheartedly obedient, without any resentment.</p><p></p><p>The other Eleven Tribulation complete evolution experts on the scene were the same.</p><p></p><p>What a joke, the sight of the Galactic Lord casually crushing tens of thousands of Alien Eleven Tribulation experts was still reverberating in the minds of all the human evolution experts.</p><p></p><p>In the Galactic Lord, they vaguely sensed a similar meaning to that of the Powerful Ones, who viewed the Eleven Tribulation experts as mere ants.</p><p></p><p>"The Victory Altar."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>The normal development of the war was that the Twelve Peak Clan Forces would engage in a brutal slaughter, and then a victor would emerge to occupy the Victory Altar.</p><p></p><p>To withstand the counterattacks of the other peak clan forces, they only needed to continue occupying the Victory Altar for a hundred years in the future.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The altar can declare the end of the first large-scale battlefield, or perhaps the dominance of this war.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is the ideal situation. In reality, the vast majority of faction powers cannot successfully occupy the Victory Altar for a hundred years. Once occupied by other faction powers, even if they regain it, they have to start the occupation time calculation from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>So a large-scale war, in theory, can be resolved in the shortest time of a hundred years, but in reality, it can last for thousands or even tens of thousands of years, with the battlefield altar constantly swaying between several peak faction powers, which is perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>"I will go to the Victory Altar to guard it," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The length of occupation of the Victory Altar is related to whether the war can end, so naturally Lin Yuan needs to personally guard it and ensure that the defensive strength there is the strongest.</p><p></p><p>After being reminded by Xia Qin, Lin Yuan knew that the other eleven peak faction powers would not easily admit defeat and give up.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is for the dominance of the first war, or the hundreds of supreme weapons that have fallen into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for the peak faction powers, the latter is more important. Even if they lose the dominance of the first war and lose part of their territory, as long as they regain the dominance of the war in the future, the territory will come back.</p><p></p><p>But if they lose the supreme weapons? It is highly likely that they will not be able to get them back. This is not just a few supreme weapons, but hundreds of them.</p><p></p><p>After reporting all the matters, Xuanyuan You and many other human evolutions respectfully left.</p><p></p><p>"The Victory Altar," Lin Yuan looked towards the direction of the Victory Altar, from which a mysterious aura was faintly emanating, allowing him to easily lock onto its exact location.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Victory Altar was precisely to intensify the fierce competition among the major peak faction powers.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what means those alien Twelfth Ranks are planning to use to deal with me," Lin Yuan was in an extremely relaxed mood, after all, all the supreme weapons had already been sent to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Even if the situation becomes worse later, Lin Yuan has already made a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>The bottom line harvest has already been determined.</p><p></p><p>Yuzu Domain.</p><p></p><p>A secret place, here there is a vast and boundless world, in the center of the world stands a towering building, the building is a palace-shaped, majestic, with the aura of the birth of the universe permeating.</p><p></p><p>In front of the palace, a figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The figure walked into the palace and respectfully bowed to the majestic figure sitting high in the palace: "I pay my respects to the Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Rank ultimate existence within the Yuzu Clan is also called the "Emperor", meaning the supreme.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>"How does the Galactic Lord feel?" The "Emperor" sitting high in the palace spoke, looking down at the figure below.</p><p></p><p>This figure is the strongest Eleventh Rank of the Yuzu Clan, named Fan Gaomo, holding one of the Yuzu Clan's ancestral weapons, currently hiding in the corner of the battlefield, always vigilant against the Galactic Lord's attack.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor, the Galactic Lord's strength is too strong. Even if I forcibly activate the ancestral weapon, I still feel far from being able to resist him," Fan Gaomo said in a low voice, with a hint of despair in his tone.</p><p></p><p>As one of the earliest tribes born at the dawn of the universe, the Yuzu Clan, even after splitting off from the Universal Clan, is still extremely proud. Except for the Jie Clan, which can make them look up to, the Yuzu Clan's strong ones all have a kind of condescending attitude towards the other later-emerging peak faction powers.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Galactic Lord has made Fan Gaomo deeply aware that the Yuzu Clan's bloodline he is so proud of is actually quite laughable in the face of absolute power.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord is indeed powerful. Even if he brings the ultimate foundation of human civilization into it, the strength and effort required to activate it is something you cannot achieve," the "Emperor" of the Yuzu Clan nodded slightly, then changed the subject, "But no matter how powerful he is, he is still only an Eleventh Rank life, and can be dealt with."</p><p></p><p>"Emperor, are you planning to..." Fan Gaomo's heart stirred slightly as he looked up at the majestic figure above.</p><p></p><p>"Go to our clan's treasure vault and take the 84th treasure with my order," the "Emperor" of the Yuzu Clan spoke, his tone calm, after discussing and exchanging with the Twelfth Rank ultimate existences of the other eleven peak faction powers.</p><p></p><p>Within the next hundred years, all eleven peak faction powers must unite to try their best to kill the Galactic Lord's clone and retrieve all the supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Yuzu Clan will use its 84th treasure from the vault, and the other peak faction powers will also use treasures of the same level, with the purpose of dealing with the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The 84th treasure?" Fan Gaomo took a deep breath, the 84th treasure, although not an ancestral weapon, its instantaneous explosive power is even greater than the ancestral weapon.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral weapon has a very high upper limit and can have a great effect on even Twelfth Rank ultimate existences, but the 84th treasure can sweep away any existence below the Twelfth Rank.</p><p></p><p>Even the Twelfth Rank ultimate, in the face of the 84th treasure, needs to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"Go," the "Emperor" of the Yuzu Clan waved his hand and did not say more.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Fan Gaomo was immediately teleported out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"The 84th treasure."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's spirits were high, the tremendous pressure the Galactic Lord had caused him had dissipated a lot.</p>

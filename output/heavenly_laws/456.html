            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 456: The Primordial Empress Mother (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Is that it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged and re-examined himself inside and out, confirming that only his life essence had been reduced, without any other aspects being affected.</p><p></p><p>And the reduction in his life essence was only one ten-millionth.</p><p></p><p>As for the impact on Lin Yuan's own strength...</p><p></p><p>It can be said to have no effect.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even vaguely felt that this one ten-millionth reduction in life essence was only temporary, and it would soon recover.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned.</p><p></p><p>He could speculate that the unexplained reduction in his life essence was definitely the work of the peak clan forces.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely high-level move, estimated to be at the ultimate 12th Realm level, otherwise he would not have been completely unaware of it and would not have had the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>However—</p><p></p><p>The peak clan forces that made the move must have underestimated the thickness of Lin Yuan's life essence, causing the reduction in life essence to be like a drop in the ocean compared to his total life essence.</p><p></p><p>The life essence is determined by many aspects, such as the inner world, physical body, soul, and spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>External forces have almost no influence on the life essence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's life essence is primarily determined by his inner world, whose diameter reaches more than 7 billion li, compared to the normal 11th Realm Perfection's less than a billion li, which is tens of thousands of times more.</p><p></p><p>His physical body has also been refined to the extreme through the martial dao cultivation path, with the fine structures of the bodies of myriad strong cultivators as references, and the mysterious gourd's foundational enhancement, as well as the two times of infusion of the chaos void origin. Compared to the ordinary 11th Realm Perfection, the gap in physical body strength is no less than that of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>His soul is the same, with the powerful inner world and physical body nurturing an extraordinary soul that far exceeds the normal 11th Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>As for spiritual will, it is even more remarkable, as it has thoroughly entered the 12th Realm, and is considered powerful even within the 12th Realm, with an index of more than 33 million.</p><p></p><p>The combination of the inner world, physical body, soul, and spiritual will has made Lin Yuan's life essence far surpass the same-level 11th Realm Perfection. The gap may not be a hundred million times, but it is still in the tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>This is also reflected in the river of time. The ordinary 11th Realm Perfection is just a "big fish" in the river of time, but Lin Yuan? Sinking to the bottom of the river of time, his massive body occupies the entire riverbed, and even the slightest movement can stir up countless undercurrents, making the nearby 11th Realm lives uneasy and even affecting the local water flow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the battlefield near the victory altar...</p><p></p><p>Rip.</p><p></p><p>More than ten terrifying spatial rifts were torn open.</p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th Realm cultivators from various peak clans, wielding tribal weapons and various treasure techniques, were rushing towards the victory altar to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Go all out."</p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th Realm cultivator of the Calamity Tribe was surrounded by endless auras, as if countless calamities were upon him, yet not a speck of it touched him.</p><p></p><p>The other strongest 11th Realm cultivators were the same, exuding power that far exceeded the 11th Realm limit in their every move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Universe Tribe had used the Balance Heavenly Plate to restrict the life essence of the Galactic Lord. As long as they seize this opportunity to kill the Galactic Lord and reclaim those ultimate weapons, the losses of the various peak clans can be recovered.</p><p></p><p>As for how to deal with the Galactic Lord in the future, even if they kill the Galactic Lord's avatar now, the true body is still early, and the Galactic Lord can still condense avatars to enter the war.</p><p></p><p>After much speculation by the 12th Realm ultimate experts of the various peak clans, the ultimate foundation possessed by the Galactic Lord should have a range limit. Otherwise, the Galactic Lord would not have waited until the large-scale decisive battle with tens of thousands of 11th Realm cultivators gathered in the billions of li range before making a move.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this, it would be easy to deal with, as long as they maintain a distance from the Galactic Lord at all times.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The coldest-eyed strongest 11th Realm cultivator of the Bug Tribe, aided by the tribal weapon Nightmare Realm, unleashed terrifying soul attacks without any restraint.</p><p></p><p>Inside the victory altar, the 11th Realm guardians were horrified as they looked around and saw more than ten figures rushing towards the altar. These figures were distorting and shattering the space, causing all the 11th Realm cultivators of the Human Civilization Alliance to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Even Xuan Yuan Yu was stunned, as these strongest 11th Realm cultivators had clearly mobilized all their means to overwhelm the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Yuan Yu's heart sank. These strongest 11th Realm cultivators dared to attack so openly, they must have the confidence to contend with the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>Given the astonishing power Lin Yuan had displayed on the battlefield ten years ago, the 11 peak clan forces would not have sent their strongest 11th Realm cultivators to their deaths if they did not have a good grasp of the situation. Since they have made their move, it means they have a considerable grasp.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the deepest part of the altar, Lin Yuan also sensed the approaching strongest 11th Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"First they weakened my life essence, and now they are going all out. Their plan is quite perfect, with 12th Realm ultimate scheming involved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze remained calm.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that they underestimated the thickness of Lin Yuan's life essence.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they really underestimated it, even those 12th Realm ultimate experts could not have foreseen that a cultivator at the 11th Realm would have such a thick life essence.</p><p></p><p>The strongest of the Human Civilization had confidence because they knew about Lin Yuan's breakthroughs to the 10th and 11th Realms. But the other 12th Realm ultimate experts did not know that.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the strongest of the Human Civilization might not have imagined that Lin Yuan's life essence would reach such a high level, almost creating a new realm between the 11th and 12th Realms.</p><p></p><p>"They're almost all here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and the divine ability 'World' was silently activated.</p><p></p><p>"Kill. Galactic Lord, we've come to kill you."</p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th Realm cultivators rapidly approached, about to unleash the tribal weapons to bombard the altar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment—</p><p></p><p>From all directions, above and below, left and right.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth transformed, and a brand new world descended.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord, the Galactic Lord has used that ultimate foundation again."</p><p></p><p>The strongest 11th Realm cultivators turned pale, and even the strongest 11th Realm cultivator of the Calamity Tribe had a sinking feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Fang Gao Mo saying that the Universe Tribe's treasure was used to balance the heavenly plate and restrict the Galactic Lord's life essence?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What, has the life essence of the Galactic Overlord been greatly weakened, rendering him unable to continue activating that ultimate foundation?</p><p></p><p>What's going on now?</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten of the strongest Eleventh Realm experts hastily turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, they had witnessed the Galactic Overlord's power firsthand, when there were tens of thousands of Eleventh Realm experts assisting him, helping to share the burden of the mighty divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>It was just the ten-odd strongest Eleventh Realm experts present.</p><p></p><p>How could they dare to stay any longer?</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo was also closely monitoring the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The golden balance scale before him showed the two sides in a state of equilibrium, indicating that the Galactic Overlord's life essence was still in a weakened state.</p><p></p><p>"If he doesn't have that ultimate foundation, the Galactic Overlord wouldn't be much stronger than other peak Eleventh Realm experts. Now facing..."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's thoughts were in turmoil, but soon he received inquiries from the strongest Eleventh Realm experts of the Insect Clan, Heavenly Feather Clan, and others.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Gaomo, the Galactic Overlord's life essence has not been weakened at all."</p><p></p><p>"Fan Gaomo, the Galactic Overlord has still activated that ultimate foundation, and we are all being suppressed now."</p><p></p><p>"Fan Gaomo, have you deceived us? Have you defected to the Human Civilization Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The barrage of questions left Fan Gaomo somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the golden balance scale in front of him, and the void energy that represented the Galactic Overlord's life essence was still present on the right side of the scale.</p><p></p><p>Balanced against the one-tenth life essence of a hundred complete Eleventh Realm experts on the left side.</p><p></p><p>He almost thought he had heard wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo immediately reacted, and at that moment he also sensed the overwhelming aura emanating from the center of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This aura was one that Fan Gaomo would never forget for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>It was the same devastating attack the Galactic Overlord had used ten years ago to annihilate tens of thousands of powerful Eleventh Realm experts. Compared to ten years ago, this attack had not weakened in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>But how could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>He had already used the balance scale to weaken the Galactic Overlord's life essence. Even with a weakened life essence, the Galactic Overlord should still be able to use that ultimate foundation, but the power it could unleash should have been reduced.</p><p></p><p>Yet the overwhelming aura he felt from the center of the battlefield had not diminished at all.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had not actually weakened the Galactic Overlord?</p><p></p><p>No, that couldn't be right.</p><p></p><p>The balance scale had indeed weakened the Galactic Overlord's life essence.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo could still sense the connection between himself and the Galactic Overlord through the balance scale.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on here? Could it be that the balance scale is malfunctioning?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's true self in the outer realm immediately began contacting the 'Emperor' of the Primal Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Primal Realm palace.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo stood below, waiting cautiously for the 'Emperor's' response.</p><p></p><p>The balance scale had clearly weakened the Galactic Overlord's life essence, and the corresponding void energy had even appeared on the right side of the scale.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Galactic Overlord seemed completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>"The balance scale has indeed weakened the Galactic Overlord's life essence," the 'Emperor' of the Primal Realm said after a moment.</p><p></p><p>Although the balance scale was being operated by Fan Gaomo, the 'Emperor' was also closely monitoring it, as there were safeguards left behind by the 'Emperor' within the scale.</p><p></p><p>"It has been weakened?" Fan Gaomo was even more perplexed.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Overlord's current performance was far from that of someone whose life essence had been weakened, causing a drastic drop in power.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the amount of life essence you have weakened is too little to have a significant impact on the Galactic Overlord," the 'Emperor' replied after another moment.</p><p></p><p>"Too little?" Fan Gaomo was stunned.</p><p></p><p>One-tenth of the complete life essence of a hundred Eleventh Realm experts, which was equivalent to the full life essence of four or five complete Eleventh Realm experts, even after accounting for losses, was considered too little for the Galactic Overlord?</p><p></p><p>On the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the more than ten strongest Eleventh Realm experts, struggling desperately under the suppression of the divine ability 'World' with the help of the Primal Clan's weapons.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ten years ago, Lin Yuan's strength had increased by a large margin, with more than ten fused rule insights reaching the Twelfth Realm, causing his inner world to undergo another transformation.</p><p></p><p>With his inner world enhanced, the external world formed by the divine ability 'World' naturally became stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, the peak experts of the various major clans could use the Primal Clan's weapons to tear open the space and escape the external world.</p><p></p><p>But now, they could no longer do so.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Primal Clan's weapons were constantly emitting terrifying fluctuations, it was to no avail. Within the enveloping external world, the space was as solid as substance, and aside from Lin Yuan, no one could tear it open.</p><p></p><p>"Although this is enough to trap these strongest Eleventh Realm experts, even if I let the external world self-destruct, it would still be difficult to kill a single peak Eleventh Realm expert," Lin Yuan thought to himself as he looked down at the struggling experts.</p><p></p><p>The main difference between the Primal Clan's weapons and the most powerful weapons was not in their might, as some of the peak weapons were not much weaker than the Primal Clan's.</p><p></p><p>The primary difference lay in who was activating them.</p><p></p><p>The activators of the most powerful weapons were the Eleventh Realm experts themselves, so they would not use these weapons unless absolutely necessary, as the cost was too great.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan first arrived on the battlefield, he had used a few methods to kill Eleventh Realm experts wielding powerful weapons, all of which involved exhausting them.</p><p></p><p>But the Primal Clan's weapons?</p><p></p><p>The true activators were no longer the strongest Eleventh Realm experts of the various clans, but the Twelfth Realm ultimates behind them.</p><p></p><p>Each Primal Clan weapon contained methods left behind by the Twelfth Realm ultimates, which were dormant most of the time but would be unleashed in critical moments, directly taking control of the weapons.</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh Realm experts holding the Primal Clan's weapons could not tear open the space of the external world, not because the weapons were not powerful enough, but because the ultimate methods within the weapons had not been activated.</p><p></p><p>However, if Lin Yuan wanted to completely eliminate these strongest Eleventh Realm experts, the ultimate methods within the Primal Clan's weapons would surely be triggered.</p><p></p><p>After all, the peak clans had sent the Primal Clan's weapons to the battlefield, so they must have made sufficient preparations, not wanting to lose them easily.</p><p></p><p>"Let's focus all my power and see if I can kill one of them," Lin Yuan thought, his gaze shifting towards the strongest Eleventh Realm expert of the Insect Clan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>An invisible shockwave enveloped the Insect Clan's strongest Eleventh Realm expert, causing the Nightmare Realm she wielded to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!!" she exclaimed, suddenly realizing that the Galactic Overlord had somehow appeared before her, slowly reaching out his right hand towards her.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 382</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen frantically fled, with Lin Yuan attacking him relentlessly along the way. </p><p></p><p>Although he had a defensive miraculous artifact protecting his body, he could barely withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's every strike had 99% of its force blocked by the defensive artifact. </p><p></p><p>But the remaining minor impact still seeped through.</p><p></p><p>This 'minor' impact was still comparable to Lin Yuan's full-power strike.</p><p></p><p>For Tuo Ba Gu Shen, those minor shocks still made his internal organs churn.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated strikes eventually left Tuo Ba Gu Shen severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"This monster, which eleventh-stage perfect life form in the universe is he?" Tuo Ba Gu Shen felt extremely aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>Against Lin Yuan, he had zero ability to resist. If not for the defensive artifact protecting his body, he would have been unable to endure long ago.</p><p></p><p>To possess such power in this two-dimensional world in just over a hundred years, in Tuo Ba Gu Shen's view, only those legendary life forms at the pinnacle of the eleventh stage could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Tuo Ba Gu Shen had some doubts. He had lived an extremely long life, born since the beginning of the universe's creation. He had heard of most of the slightly stronger eleventh-stage life forms in the universe.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Tuo Ba Gu Shen was only doubtful because among the powerful experts of the myriad races in this two-dimensional world, unless they took the initiative to speak up, outsiders would find it very difficult to know their identities in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The number one ranked 'Four Celestial Kings' were recognized at a glance due to their overly obvious external characteristics and terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>As for the other experts? They all came from various major races and had interactions, so it was hard to hide.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed some powerful experts of the myriad races who cultivated in seclusion without concerning themselves with worldly matters. But for Lin Yuan to have cultivated to this level of power without ever revealing himself was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Behind Tuo Ba Gu Shen, Lin Yuan closely pursued.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this two-dimensional world, for me to grow to my current level and be able to pursue and kill Tuo Ba Gu Shen to this degree, I don't know how much time it would take?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a slight sense of emotion. In this two-dimensional world, even eleventh-stage pinnacle life forms had their starting points forcibly lowered.</p><p></p><p>This was the only reason Lin Yuan had the opportunity to surpass Tuo Ba Gu Shen, a special fifth-rank eleventh-stage life form, in just over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>One must know, every life form that crossed into the eleventh stage was an absolute genius, far beyond the experts Lin Yuan had encountered when transmigrating to other dimensional worlds before.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it's time to end this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze became slightly sharper...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>One kind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan clenched his right hand tightly. </p><p></p><p>The silver mirror remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed an extraordinary object."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt delighted in his heart and also put away the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the surroundings. After chasing and killing Tuoba Gushen for half a day, hundreds of miles away, other powerful beings from various races were cautiously observing.</p><p></p><p>Shua.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe. </p><p></p><p>Deep in the starry space.</p><p></p><p>Inside a secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Gushen's face turned pale, his originally near-perfect aura suddenly plummeted.</p><p></p><p>His avatar in the two-dimensional world had perished, affecting Tuoba Gushen's true self, permanently losing the spiritual will of that avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Why...why am I so unlucky?" Tuoba Gushen felt indignant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The six of them, a group of special beings, joined forces and could almost sweep across the two-dimensional world, except for those powerful beings at the level of the nine great experts.</p><p></p><p>But how many of those nine great expert-level powerful beings were there in this entire two-dimensional world? Why did he happen to encounter one?</p><p></p><p>"My defensive extraordinary object..." Tuoba Gushen's heart was bleeding.</p><p></p><p>Originally in his plan, even if his avatar couldn't leave the two-dimensional world in the end, he could ask the powerful beings who left the two-dimensional world to bring out that defensive extraordinary object.</p><p></p><p>Although he would definitely be ripped off greatly, even if Tuoba Gushen only obtained one percent of the value of that defensive extraordinary object, it would still be of great help to himself.</p><p></p><p>At least the loss of his avatar's spiritual will and root would be partially compensated.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The avatar had perished.</p><p></p><p>That defensive extraordinary object was also gone.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Gushen could be said to have drawn a complete blank.</p><p></p><p>However, from beginning to end, Tuoba Gushen never thought of taking revenge on that powerful being who killed him.</p><p></p><p>Are you kidding?</p><p></p><p>Revenge?</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, without the aid of extraordinary objects, that mysterious powerful being could easily slaughter him.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Gushen instinctively believed that in the vast starry universe, the true self of that mysterious powerful being must also be an formidable eleventh-stage perfected expert.</p><p></p><p>To take revenge on such a powerful being, unless he, Tuoba Gushen, became the ultimate, there was not the slightest hope.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>As time passed.</p><p></p><p>The four special beings killed by Lin Yuan, as well as Pei Shen, Tuoba Gushen, and others, spread the battle videos recreated from their memories among the powerful beings of various races.</p><p></p><p>On a silent lake surface.</p><p></p><p>A man with four arms sat on the surface of the lake.</p><p></p><p>"Four Celestial Kings." Not far away, on the shore, several figures stood respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Four Celestial Kings, whether in the two-dimensional world or outside, it made countless eleventh-stage beings despair.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings were too powerful.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, the Tianyu Race poured all the strength of their powerful beings into the two-dimensional world, intending to kill the Four Celestial Kings prematurely.</p><p></p><p>But they failed.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they fail, but the entire Tianyu Race was almost wiped out.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the powerful beings of the Tianyu Race in this two-dimensional world have been in a slump.</p><p></p><p>A once-pinnacle race lost the qualification to leave through the heavenly gate two to three hundred years in advance.</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious powerful being killed Tuoba Gushen, Pei Shen, and other special beings, and those special beings had already pledged allegiance to our Starry Sky Alliance."</p><p></p><p>A tall man on the shore spoke cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"What? You want me to fight that mysterious powerful being?" The Four Celestial Kings opened his eyes, his tone icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just forget about this matter."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings glanced at the figures on the shore and said, "That mysterious powerful being's strength is not much weaker than mine."</p><p></p><p>"Now that he has obtained defensive and offensive extraordinary objects, even if I go all out, I may not be able to kill him."</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings paused for a moment and continued, "There are still two hundred years until the heavenly gate opens. In these two hundred years, I need to seize every moment to cultivate and break through. As for other matters, don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The figures on the shore were startled.</p><p></p><p>Even the Four Celestial Kings had no confidence in killing that mysterious powerful being?</p><p></p><p>"Also."</p><p></p><p>"If you encounter that mysterious powerful being, remember to run far away." The Four Celestial Kings gave a reminder and then closed his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>Inside a volcano.</p><p></p><p>Beside the boiling magma, a skinny old man sat there.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this powerful being is an old friend." The skinny old man showed a pensive expression after watching Lin Yuan's battle video.</p><p></p><p>Battles in the two-dimensional world were vastly different from those in the main universe, so it was difficult to identify a powerful being's true identity solely based on their fighting style.</p><p></p><p>But the strength Lin Yuan displayed was undoubtedly recognized by the skinny old man, who determined that Lin Yuan was also a legendary eleventh-stage perfected being like himself.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"After such a long time, I should go out and show my face, and obtain a few extraordinary objects to play with."</p><p></p><p>The skinny old man made up his mind and left the volcano.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground.</p><p></p><p>After killing Tuoba Gushen and the others, Lin Yuan did not immediately return to the Luochuan gathering place.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he hid here and began to examine his gains.</p><p></p><p>"This mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped his right hand, and the silver mirror appeared.</p><p></p><p>The mirror was entirely silver, with a mysterious aura flowing through it.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

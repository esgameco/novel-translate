        <h1>Chapter 637</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lord Longshuan heaved a light sigh, facing the threat of a Celestial Venerable, he had no intention of struggling.</p><p></p><p>Although he had many life-saving methods, even a Celestial Venerable could not completely kill him.</p><p></p><p>But offending a Celestial Venerable would bring too much trouble in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This is a Heavenly Cold Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Longshuan's pupils contracted as he noticed a fruit emitting a cold aura next to him.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cold Fruit, a rare treasure at the Venerable level, even for peak Venerables, it would be very useful.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Cold Fruit, was it left by that mysterious Celestial Venerable? To exchange for those five drops of my essence blood?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Longshuan put away the Heavenly Cold Fruit and examined it carefully, unable to suppress the strange feeling in his heart, "That mysterious Celestial Venerable is quite benevolent?"</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, with the strength of a Celestial Venerable, he could have simply come in person and made him hand over the five drops of essence blood, without needing any exchange.</p><p></p><p>For a Venerable, essence blood is precious, but losing five drops would not affect him at all.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for an exchange.</p><p></p><p>The only hidden danger of having essence blood outside is that it may become a "medium" for karmic forces, and other powerful experts could use that drop of essence blood to attack him through karmic means.</p><p></p><p>But this hidden danger is unrelated to a Celestial Venerable. A Celestial Venerable who wanted to kill him could have done so just now, there was no need to resort to karmic killing.</p><p></p><p>And karmic killing would be weakened, even for a Celestial Venerable, at most they could only severely injure this physical body.</p><p></p><p>So Lord Longshuan found it a bit "unusual" and thought that the mysterious Celestial Venerable was being benevolent.</p><p></p><p>As for the rule that Celestial Venerable-level experts are not allowed to interfere in the Six Ancient Nations, as long as no one knows which Celestial Venerable acted, the Six Ancient Nations cannot pursue the matter.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Northern Yin Celestial Venerable and the Extreme Cold Celestial Venerable had also infiltrated the Black Jade Nest in this way.</p><p></p><p>"I have already collected the essence blood of twelve Mysterious Yin Venerable-level experts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, although at the moment he was just an avatar, dealing with Venerable-level experts was still easy for him.</p><p></p><p>Even so, when Lin Yuan obtained the essence blood of the Mysterious Yin Venerable, he still left behind some rare treasures as an exchange for the other party's offering of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Lin Yuan was being benevolent, but doing so would minimize the hidden dangers as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, most Venerables, when facing the threat of a Celestial Venerable, would obediently hand over their essence blood, and afterwards, they would not dare to make a fuss about it.</p><p></p><p>But if there happened to be a few stubborn Venerables who were not satisfied in their hearts and directly made a big deal out of it, bringing it to the attention of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation's royal family, it would be a headache for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would even attract the investigation of the Celestial Venerables of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Now, by using this method similar to a transaction to obtain the essence blood of the Mysterious Yin Venerables, it is the most secure way Lin Yuan could think of.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, a rare treasure at the Venerable level is nothing in Lin Yuan's eyes, the two ancient Celestial Venerables, the Extreme Cold Celestial Venerable and the Northern Yin Celestial Venerable, have already greatly increased his wealth.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that if I could get the essence blood of the Mysterious Yin Royal Family, it would be even better."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, but he was already very satisfied with having collected the essence blood of more than ten Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Beings who have cultivated to the Venerable level, their ancestral bloodlines are definitely not diluted, even if not as pure as the royal family, they should be very close, enough for Lin Yuan to ponder over for a long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, collect more Venerable essence blood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan placed the essence blood he had already collected in another avatar, using it to directly comprehend, while this avatar continued to go to other domains to seek more Mysterious Yin Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Collecting the essence blood of Mysterious Yin Venerables involves some risks, Lin Yuan naturally would not bring the essence blood back to the Blazing Yang Ancient Nation, but would comprehend it right there in the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Even if any problems arose afterwards, he could erase the avatar in an instant, and no one would be able to trace it back.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Yang Ancient Nation, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in his manor, his avatar comprehending the essence blood of the Mysterious Yin Venerables, while his true self was also synchronously comprehending.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, comprehending the unknown essence blood, your understanding of the Mysterious Yin Dao has been enhanced.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in his comprehension, compared to the Blazing Yang bloodline, the great Dao contained within the Mysterious Yin bloodline was equally boundless, almost equivalent to the Chaos, or even surpassing the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Yin, Yin of the Great Yin."</p><p></p><p>Many enlightened insights emerged in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, your understanding of the Mysterious Yin Dao and the Yin of the Great Yin has been enhanced.】</p><p></p><p>In a moment of revelation, Lin Yuan saw the clear black and white Taiji diagram, and the Yin side began to ripple, constantly transforming with the Yang side.</p><p></p><p>In addition to comprehending the essence blood of the Mysterious Yin Venerables, Lin Yuan did not forget to comprehend the Chaotic Talisman Diagram.</p><p></p><p>So far, he knew of two ways to accelerate the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Dao, one of which was to comprehend the Mysterious Yin Dao, using it to complement the Yin of the Great Yin, thereby propelling the evolution of the Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>The other was to enhance his understanding of the Chaotic Principles, if the Chaotic Principles reached the Third Realm, it could also drive the evolution of the Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>The two methods, one internal and one external.</p><p></p><p>Whichever way, they would greatly benefit Lin Yuan, even if there was no evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Dao, just by comprehending in this way, Lin Yuan would gain tremendous benefits.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Source World, the Six Ancient Nations occupied the most central and prosperous regions.</p><p></p><p>As for the regions outside the Six Ancient Nations, there were also vast areas, but compared to the Six Ancient Nations, these areas were relatively barren.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some places would give birth to precious secret realms, and many great venerable ones would explore and travel through them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the precious secret realms contained within the six ancient nations had already been mostly occupied, and ordinary great venerable ones couldn't even get close to them.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Amidst a winding mountain range, a powerful space-time fluctuation suddenly erupted, and a mysterious aura began to spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This aura immediately caught the attention of the great venerable ones passing by in the vicinity. These great venerable ones stared wide-eyed at the source of the space-time fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>"A precious realm, this is an anomaly born from a precious realm. Has a new precious realm been born?"</p><p></p><p>"At least it is a first-class precious realm that has given birth to such an aura. A first-class precious realm?"</p><p></p><p>All the great venerable ones who sensed this scene swallowed hard. A first-class precious realm? Even the lofty six ancient nations would go all-out to contend for it. Had they stumbled upon it? The first-class precious realms currently occupied by the six ancient nations were extremely rare and scarce.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Some great venerable ones, their hearts surging, immediately approached the winding mountain range where the precious realm had been born.</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Among the six ancient nations, the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation was the third to be established. The ancestor of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation was said to be the disciple of the very first Thirteenth-Tier Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the emperor of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation and many Celestial Venerable Ones had gathered in the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"A new precious realm has been born here, and it should be a first-class precious realm. The rare treasures it produces, their effects are unknown, but they should be related to the aspect of time. Currently, any great venerable one who approaches the precious realm within a certain distance will be forcibly pushed back to their original location by the power of time."</p><p></p><p>"A first-class precious realm that produces rare treasures related to time? This precious realm must be seized."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it might even help us take the final step and break through the time loop. We cannot miss any rare treasures related to time."</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Venerable Ones of the Great Spiritual Ancient Nation quickly made their decision.</p><p></p><p>The rare treasures born from a first-class precious realm would be of great use to the Celestial Venerable Ones and even the Pinnacle Celestial Venerable Ones. And the first-class precious realms related to time, the rare treasures they produced, would make all the powerful cultivators at the Celestial Venerable One level envious.</p><p></p><p>So far, among the many first-class precious realms controlled by the six ancient nations, there were only five related to time.</p><p></p><p>On average, that was not even enough for one per ancient nation.</p><p></p><p>"You all want to seize this precious realm, but the other ancient nations also want to seize it."</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Emperor, seated on the throne, looked down and said, "For now, this precious realm has been controlled. As for its final ownership, it will be decided according to the old rules, with the Celestial Venerable Ones of the ancient nations competing for it."</p><p></p><p>If the newly born precious realm was located within the territory of a certain ancient nation, then it would undoubtedly belong to that ancient nation.</p><p></p><p>But now, this precious realm was located outside the territories of the six ancient nations, so its ownership would require a competition among the six ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>The Silver River Manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he received a summons from the emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, you must come to me immediately." The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation emperor's tone was quite urgent, and Lin Yuan immediately realized that a major event must have occurred.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived at the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw many Celestial Venerable Ones waiting outside. These Celestial Venerable Ones glanced at Lin Yuan but did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was puzzled, but he still walked directly into the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun emperor looked at Lin Yuan and smiled, saying, "Those Celestial Venerable Ones outside all want to see me, but I chose to see you first."</p><p></p><p>"Why is that?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Another first-class precious realm has been born, and it's even outside the territories of the six ancient nations," the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation emperor said briefly.</p><p></p><p>"A new first-class precious realm?" Lin Yuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Given his current status, he naturally knew the importance of first-class precious realms, and the rare treasures they produced were of great help to Celestial Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan himself was in charge of two first-class precious realms, so he was very familiar with this.</p><p></p><p>Those were precious realms that had been born for countless years, and the rare treasures they produced had already been circulated.</p><p></p><p>But this newly born precious realm would contain rare treasures that had never appeared in the six ancient nations before, which was why it would arouse the fierce competition of the Celestial Venerable Ones from the six ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Our six ancient nations have already established a rule. When a precious realm with unclear ownership appears, we will decide which ancient nation it belongs to according to the established rules."</p><p></p><p>The emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation looked at Lin Yuan and said, "The rule here is that each ancient nation will select twelve Celestial Venerable Ones to go and compete for the precious realm outside."</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Venerable Ones outside are all hoping that I will choose them as the twelve representatives of my Blazing Sun Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation emperor paused for a moment and continued, "According to the rules, even if the Celestial Venerable Ones participating in the competition ultimately fail, the harvests they obtain within the precious realm will be allowed to be taken out."</p><p></p><p>"I see." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became clear. In other words, no matter whether they could seize the precious realm in the end, the Celestial Venerable Ones participating in the competition would definitely be able to gain benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the decision of which Celestial Venerable Ones will go to compete is up to me." The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation emperor looked at Lin Yuan and smiled, "Silver River, do you have any interest?"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

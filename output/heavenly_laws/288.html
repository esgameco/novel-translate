            <p>Chapter 288: The Galaxy Master Has Arrived (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyu Clan has launched a war?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked towards the direction of the Alien Battlefield B0001 in the distance. ùü®ùü´ùìàùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏ùëúùìÇ</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his Taiji Primordial Spirit was about to reach the center of the battlefield, vaguely sensing the shockwaves of battle between the invincible Eighth Stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can block or repel the Tianyu Clan, I can obtain at least tens of millions of merit points," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge amount of merit points would be difficult to accumulate even for an invincible Eighth Stage expert after spending countless years fighting on the Alien Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even for an evolutionary scholar like Lin Yuan, he could only rely on pioneering the Ninth Stage Martial Dao to obtain an equivalent amount of merit points.</p><p></p><p>As for the others? The efficiency was too slow, requiring more than hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover--</p><p></p><p>The merit points were just Lin Yuan's guaranteed harvest.</p><p></p><p>When confronting the many powerful experts of the Tianyu Clan, as long as he could kill the invincible Eighth Stage experts on the opposing side, the spoils of war would naturally belong to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago in the Galaxy Realm, the two invincible Eighth Stage alien experts that Lin Yuan killed had yielded spoils worth nearly 500,000 cubic universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, those two invincible Eighth Stage alien experts didn't expect to die, so they carried many treasures on them, resulting in Lin Yuan's higher gains.</p><p></p><p>But on the battlefield, there were far more than two invincible Eighth Stage experts from the Tianyu Clan. What lacked in quality could be made up in quantity.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Lin Yuan was looking forward to the upcoming harvest.</p><p></p><p>At the center of Battlefield B0001.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master and the six-winged elder of the Tianyu Clan confronted each other, standing in the void. Two completely different universal forces surged like oceans, constantly colliding.</p><p></p><p>"White Cloud, you're still the same old self. Your techniques haven't changed at all. Fighting you is actually quite boring," the six-winged elder sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" White Cloud Master's expression remained unchanged. In terms of mastery over universal forces, he was not as good as the six-winged elder.</p><p></p><p>The latter's universal force was a high-level one. However, White Cloud Master's universal force was special and could completely hold off the six-winged elder.</p><p></p><p>"Slash." The six-winged elder raised his right hand and pressed down towards White Cloud Master.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, violent universal forces gathered, like an extremely sharp divine weapon, slashing down at White Cloud Master.</p><p></p><p>The universal force mastered by the six-winged elder came from the spatial storms generated when the void shattered. Endless space turned into blades, destroying everything.</p><p></p><p>"You haven't changed much either, still using those few moves." White Cloud Master snorted coldly. Within a radius of a million miles around him, white clouds suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The clouds continuously merged and intertwined, colliding with the universal force slashed down by the six-winged elder, mutually annihilating each other.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, more than half of the two universal forces had vanished, and the remaining quickly dissipated into the void.</p><p></p><p>"White Cloud blocked it."</p><p></p><p>"At least he wasn't injured."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts below slightly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master was the strongest invincible Eighth Stage expert on their side. Even with the Galaxy Master watching over them, they couldn't just be useless and wait for the Galaxy Master to save them.</p><p></p><p>After the six-winged elder finished speaking, the six pairs of wings behind his back gently unfurled. The pure white wings seemed to pluck invisible strings, and the space in all directions rippled like flowing water.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" White Cloud Master frowned. The rippling space actually began to impact the universal force around his body.</p><p></p><p>The universal force that resembled white clouds slowly collapsed under this formless spatial fluctuation and rapidly spread towards his main body.</p><p></p><p>"What technique is this?" White Cloud Master's expression changed slightly. He immediately retracted his universal force, condensing it within a few miles around his body, barely blocking the enveloping spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Trouble." White Cloud Master's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Under the spatial fluctuations stirred up by the six-winged elder, he was forcibly restricted within a radius of a few miles.</p><p></p><p>Although he was confident in blocking the six-winged elder's subsequent attacks, he obviously lacked the ability to interfere with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>This meant that--</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder had restricted him and could spare some energy to deal with the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>"Until now, you haven't used any secret treasures. It seems your trump card this time is not an external object, but reinforcements you invited, right?"</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder looked down at White Cloud Master and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"If there are any reinforcements, hurry up and let them come out. Otherwise, it will be too late."</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder raised his left hand and pressed down towards the other human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Strands of spatial fluctuations spread rapidly like flowing water, covering hundreds of millions of miles. At this moment, space was like an iron box. Even for the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts, their flight speed plummeted drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, take action."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the six-winged elder finished speaking, dozens of invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses from the Tianyu Clan all approached this side.</p><p></p><p>Various universal forces erupted wildly, forming profound airflows that expanded towards the human evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master, who was restrained by the six-winged elder, had a drastic change in expression.</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder had the spare capacity to take action, suppressing the speed of all human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts on the battlefield, forcing them to directly confront the invincible Eighth Stage experts of the Tianyu Clan.</p><p></p><p>This was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the number of invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses from the Tianyu Clan was higher than the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts.</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder was still watching from the side and could take action at any time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, White Cloud Master could only place all his hopes on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The reinforcements haven't appeared yet?" The six-winged elder was also carefully observing the battlefield, guarding against any invincible Eighth Stage experts that might appear on the human side at any time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh~</p><p></p><p>An invisible aura descended and gathered above the battlefield. The black and white yin-yang Taiji force condensed into the tall figure of Lin Yuan. His gaze was deep and indifferent. Just by standing there, he began to affect the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The six-winged elder was the first to notice the anomaly. He raised his head to look up at Lin Yuan, his expression extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master, you've finally taken action."</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master also looked towards Lin Yuan, finally feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master is here?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master has finally arrived."</p><p></p><p>"We're too useless. We didn't even force out the Tianyu Clan's trump card and made the Galaxy Master take action."</p><p></p><p>The human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionary experts were in high spirits. The Galaxy Master was simply too powerful. Not even a hundred years old, he was already at the Eighth Stage, comprehending three kinds of high-level universal forces, and had even killed two invincible Eighth Stage alien experts.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the history of human civilization, no Eighth Stage evolutionary expert as powerful as Lin Yuan had ever appeared. The offspring of the strongest experts might be able to kill other invincible Eighth Stage experts at the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>But that was by relying on the gifts from the strongest experts!</p><p></p><p>But what about the Galaxy Master?</p><p></p><p>He only had one invincible Eighth Stage teacher, Scarlet Roc Master.</p><p></p><p>For other Seventh and Eighth Stage evolutionary experts, having a teacher like Scarlet Roc Master could indeed be considered a background. But for fellow human invincible Eighth Stage evolutionary experts, what did it matter?</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Master was able to reach this point today, relying on...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On that day, he basically relied on himself.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord?!"</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder was equally nervous. Even when the Tianyu Tribe's think tank predicted the situation and mentioned the possibility of the Galaxy Star Lord appearing, the Six-Winged Elder's heart was still filled with tremendous pressure when actually facing such a legendary invincible Eighth Stage expert.</p><p></p><p>This was the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>He broke the myth of the invincible Eighth Stage and raised the upper limit of the invincible Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>What does ninety percent mean? It's almost as if they're directly saying that the Galaxy Star Lord will definitely be able to enter the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization has a huge population base, and the average individual aptitude is far inferior to that of the Tianyu Tribe. Yet, it gave birth to such a monstrous genius, making the peerless talents within the Tianyu Tribe appear dull and lackluster.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't I lock onto the Galaxy Star Lord's location? Although he's standing there, it's as if he's in the depths of infinite spatial layers, visible but untouchable."</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder's brows twitched. He stared intently at Lin Yuan, only to find that the Lin Yuan he saw seemed like a flower in a mirror or the moon in the water.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan appeared, vast spatial fluctuations covered the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Under these spatial fluctuations, the spatial ripples unleashed by the Six-Winged Elder began to disintegrate, and the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionaries, whose speed was originally suppressed, now found themselves free from the suppression.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The White Cloud Star Lord also broke free from the restraints and immediately returned to the side of the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the Galaxy Star Lord, the highest command authority of the human civilization evolutionaries on this battlefield was transferred from the White Cloud Star Lord to the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"He broke my killer move so easily?"</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder's expression was solemn. His spatial ripple killer move was comprehended from the depths of his bloodline, coupled with the cosmic power he mastered, making its might terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Just a slight display was enough to suppress the White Cloud Star Lord, a veteran invincible Eighth Stage expert. However, in front of the Galaxy Star Lord, it was as fragile as thin paper.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder didn't retreat. He believed that even if he wasn't a match for the Galaxy Star Lord, he couldn't be easily killed by him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the two Eighth Stage invincible experts who died at the hands of the Galaxy Star Lord, the Six-Winged Elder came from a peak tribe and mastered more life-saving techniques. Moreover, the cosmic power he comprehended was also of a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled at the Six-Winged Elder, "I haven't made a move in a long time. I hope the treasures you carry have some value. Otherwise, killing you would be a bit boring."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Six-Winged Elder's face turned ugly. "Galaxy Star Lord, are you so certain that you can kill me?"</p><p></p><p>As fellow invincible Eighth Stage experts, even if the Galaxy Star Lord mastered three types of high-level cosmic power, he also mastered one type of high-level cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he had deeply explored his own bloodline and even comprehended several killer moves.</p><p></p><p>Did the Galaxy Star Lord really regard him as one of those ordinary invincible Eighth Stage experts?</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Galaxy Star Lord not only attracted the attention of the human Eighth Stage invincible evolutionaries but also made the many powerful experts on the Tianyu Tribe's side secretly tense up.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what mysteries lie within the three types of high-level cosmic power he has mastered."</p><p></p><p>"Should we make a move now?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you see that the commander hasn't given the order yet?"</p><p></p><p>"The commander probably wants to probe the Galaxy Star Lord's strength and then formulate a plan to determine how many Eighth Stage invincible experts need to be allocated to hold him back."</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Tribe's Eighth Stage invincible experts stopped attacking and stood in place, observing.</p><p></p><p>Even though they knew that the Galaxy Star Lord possessed the combat power to kill Eighth Stage invincible experts, they didn't believe that the Six-Winged Elder would suffer any mishap at the Galaxy Star Lord's hands.</p><p></p><p>At most, he would suffer a bit and be suppressed for a while.</p><p></p><p>This way, they could better gauge the Galaxy Star Lord's strength.</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder felt stifled in his heart. He stared at Lin Yuan intently, "Since the Galaxy Star Lord is so confident, I won't hold back either. This spatial secret treasure contains complete spatial laws and was refined by a powerful Ninth Stage expert of our tribe."</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see, with this treasure protecting my body, what the Galaxy Star Lord relies on to kill me."</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder raised his right hand, and a silver-white cube floated, slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>He had pretty much gone all out. Such a spatial secret treasure was supposed to be a trump card, but when facing the Galaxy Star Lord, the Six-Winged Elder couldn't be bothered to hide it, as he would use it at the first opportunity anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Your Tianyu Tribe is quite generous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the silver-white cube in the Six-Winged Elder's hand and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although this treasure wasn't a Ninth Stage secret treasure, its value was not inferior to Ninth Stage secret treasures. The complete spatial laws contained within could not only be used as a weapon but also be comprehended by the owner.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder activated the silver-white cube, and instantly, the surrounding space began to fluctuate again. Strands of spatial power transformed into a spatial storm, sweeping towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quietly watched all of this unfold.</p><p></p><p>With the silver-white cube, the Six-Winged Elder's strength was already sufficient to suppress ordinary invincible Eighth Stage experts. The silver-white cube was an "external force," equivalent to a Ninth Stage secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the rapidly approaching spatial fluctuations. With a slight thought, these turbulent spatial powers quickly began to calm down, and even the silver-white cube stopped rotating and fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"What?" The Six-Winged Elder couldn't believe it. The Galaxy Star Lord's mastery of space was actually superior to his, even when he was activating the silver-white cube?</p><p></p><p>"With my comprehension of space, coupled with this spatial secret treasure, how can anyone suppress me in the spatial domain like this?"</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder couldn't accept what he was witnessing.</p><p></p><p>The Six-Winged Elder looked at Lin Yuan, and a preposterous thought suddenly surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan had thoroughly comprehended the complete spatial laws, only then could he overwhelm him in the spatial domain.</p><p></p><p>The silver-white cube indeed contained complete spatial laws, but it was ultimately just a weapon, an inanimate object. When encountering an expert who had comprehended the complete spatial laws, it would naturally be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Six-Winged Elder, whose face revealed fear, and couldn't be bothered to waste words. With a light wave of his hand, an invisible force pierced through the void. The Six-Winged Elder's figure stiffened and quickly turned into dust.</p><p></p><p>The silver-white cube and spatial bracelet fell and appeared in Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>The power formed by fusing the complete spatial laws with various cosmic powers was not something the Six-Winged Elder could withstand.</p><p></p><p>On the Tianyu Tribe's side, the numerous Eighth Stage invincible experts fell into silence. They had originally planned to see how much the Six-Winged Elder could force out the Galaxy Star Lord's killer moves.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, the Galaxy Star Lord only waved his sleeve, and the Six-Winged Elder was pulverized?</p><p></p><p>"This power..."</p><p></p><p>In the high altitude of the battlefield, within another layer of space, the Ninth Stage experts on the Tianyu Tribe's side, who were originally only casually observing the battle situation, had a slight change in their expressions, revealing a hint of shock upon seeing Lin Yuan's move.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please kindly move your fingers and share this website on Facebook.

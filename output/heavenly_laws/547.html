        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The backlash from the universe's primal will gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"No impact."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was calm. The backlash that could annihilate a Sovereign realm powerhouse was far from enough to shake the universe within his physical and spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Realm-Breaking Source Power has already exceeded 100,000."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the accumulated Realm-Breaking Source Power, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, it had increased by 100,000 strands of Realm-Breaking Source Power.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that since Lin Yuan awakened the Gate of Ten Thousand Realms until now, the total accumulated Realm-Breaking Source Power, including what had been consumed, was far from reaching 100,000.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I can accumulate Realm-Breaking Source Power at this speed when outside the universe?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It was already a fact that the universe's great collapse could cause the accumulation speed of Realm-Breaking Source Power to skyrocket. Now Lin Yuan wanted to confirm if the prerequisite for this accelerated accumulation was being within the universe.</p><p></p><p>If there was no such restriction, after his home universe's great collapse, Lin Yuan planned to send out a divine soul specifically to search for universes about to enter great collapse, in order to speed up the accumulation of Realm-Breaking Source Power.</p><p></p><p>The iron law of rules prohibited outside life from entering the universes nurtured in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Especially during a universe's great collapse period, it was extremely hostile to outside life, allowing exit but not entry.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it's time to attempt leaving the universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the outside of the universe. This was also the most difficult part for 12th-level lifeforms within the universe.</p><p></p><p>With the mass of a 12th-level lifeform, having devoured and absorbed who knows how much resources and energy within the universe, wanting to break free from the universe? It would certainly be met with obstruction and backlash from the primal will.</p><p></p><p>The process of gradually breaking free from the universe was called the Great Collapse Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>If one passed through it, it meant vast skies and seas ahead, entering the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>If one couldn't pass through, it meant being thoroughly trapped within the universe, completely perishing.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, when do you plan to start?" the Xuanyuan Supreme Being asked Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "start" meant leaving the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it in a bit. You all go first," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was receiving huge amounts of Realm-Breaking Source Power every moment, and he was really reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>So he planned to delay a while, and leave at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, he wasn't sure if he could still absorb so much Realm-Breaking Source Power after leaving the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight human civilization Supreme Beings nodded, then attempted to rush into the chaotic void, leaving the universe.</p><p></p><p>The other 12th-level alien races did the same. They weren't like Lin Yuan, so naturally the sooner they left the universe the better.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of 12th-level ultimates almost simultaneously rushed towards the outside of the universe.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The universe's primal consciousness began to obstruct them, and an enormous backlash descended.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Xuanyuan Supreme Being and other 12th-level beings suddenly changed drastically. The backlash they were now enduring was actually much stronger than anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Given the current intensity of the backlash, these 12th-level lifeforms probably couldn't endure it at all. They would all be trapped within the universe, pushing forward the birth of the next universe era.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also noticed this point, a hint of confusion appearing in his expression.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, after a universe's great collapse, the primal consciousness gradually falls into slumber, so it's not very difficult for 12th-level lifeforms to leave the universe and survive the Great Collapse Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Usually, there's close to a 50% survival rate.</p><p></p><p>Because the universe's primal consciousness lacks the strength to care about it.</p><p></p><p>But this time, during the universe's great collapse, because Lin Yuan carried too many human civilization citizens, it caused the originally gradually slumbering universe primal consciousness to fully awaken, wanting to stop Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although it ultimately couldn't stop him, the universe primal consciousness didn't fall into slumber as it normally would have.</p><p></p><p>So, when all the current 12th-level lifeforms tried to leave the universe, the obstruction and backlash force they faced from the primal consciousness was unimaginably high.</p><p></p><p>It was almost as difficult as trying to leave the universe before the great collapse had even begun.</p><p></p><p>At this level of difficulty, even a peak Dao-Opening realm powerhouse would likely be unable to break out and survive the Great Collapse Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh! Upon realizing the Great Collapse Tribulation was far more terrifying than expected, the Xuanyuan Supreme Being and other 12th-level beings unhesitatingly retreated.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't retreated, these 12th-level beings would likely have all been severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Being severely injured during a universe's great collapse? That basically announced a death sentence.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Collapse Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight human Supreme Beings were solemn, their moods sinking to rock bottom.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest Xuanyuan Supreme Being had no confidence in surviving it. Forget surviving, they couldn't even endure it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If all nine human civilization Supreme Beings were like this, those 12th-level alien races began to show fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Their 12th-level weapons, artifacts, and treasures had all fallen into Lin Yuan's hands, so their strength was already greatly reduced. Now facing such a Great Collapse Tribulation...</p><p></p><p>"We probably can't get out."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight Supreme Beings looked at each other, this thought simultaneously arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying Great Collapse Tribulation simply couldn't be resisted by Dao-Opening realm beings.</p><p></p><p>Just as the nine human civilization Supreme Beings realized they were about to perish, a voice suddenly sounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, enter my inner universe."</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme Beings were all familiar with this voice. It came from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, you want us to enter your inner universe?" </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme Being was slightly stunned, then shook his head and said: "If we do that, Galaxy, the difficulty you face in the Great Collapse Tribulation will skyrocket. This Great Collapse Tribulation is already far beyond previous ones, and if it increases further..."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme Being was unwilling to burden Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan could survive and leave the universe, the human civilization wouldn't be considered extinct.</p><p></p><p>As for themselves? If they caused Lin Yuan to fail the Great Collapse Tribulation, the Xuanyuan Supreme Being would be the first to never forgive himself.</p><p></p><p>The other eight Supreme Beings felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Carrying ordinary lifeforms out of the universe would already increase the difficulty of the Great Collapse Tribulation. Carrying a 12th-level powerhouse? Let alone Lin Yuan planning to take all nine human civilization Supreme Beings?</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. With a thought, he collected the nine Supreme Beings who hadn't yet reacted into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether Lin Yuan took the nine Supreme Beings or not, the Great Collapse Tribulation he faced wouldn't change at all, because it was already at the highest difficulty. The universe's primal consciousness would exhaust everything to stop Lin Yuan from leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Galaxy, we are willing to submit forever..."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, seeing Lin Yuan collect the nine Supreme Beings into his inner universe, although they knew the hope was slim, the many 12th-level alien races still couldn't help but tentatively inquire.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Serve forever?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment, then casually collected all the 12th-level alien races into his internal universe as well.</p><p></p><p>After all, bringing one or bringing a group made no difference. As long as the difficulty of the Great Destruction calamity remained unchanged, Lin Yuan naturally didn't mind bringing more. </p><p></p><p>Having more 12th-level beings serve him certainly wasn't a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The universe became empty, with only Lin Yuan standing alone under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Finally I can truly unleash my full power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed softly. Since reaching the 12th level, he had never gone all out with his true body.</p><p></p><p>Before mastering the first layer of "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan was suppressed by the universe's origin, at most only able to exert the combat power of a peak Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the first layer of "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan was nearly invincible at the Sovereign realm, daring to challenge Chaos Venerable Ones. Although the universe's origin consciousness could no longer suppress him, he still didn't dare to use his full power.</p><p></p><p>Because the destructive power was too great. A slight misstep could cause irreversible damage to the universe and starry sky, which was the territory of humankind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the universe's Great Destruction imminent, Lin Yuan no longer needed to be so cautious.</p><p></p><p>Everything would be destroyed anyway.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's body suddenly expanded, growing to an unimaginable height. One finger spanned tens of thousands of light years, his eyes like two bottomless abysses. A casual breath could extinguish countless star systems.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire universe seemed like a slightly larger swimming pool to Lin Yuan. Though vast, he could see its limits at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched his limbs freely, his terrifying aura annihilating countless planets. If this had happened before the Great Destruction, who knows how many lives would have perished.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step towards the edge of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Outside the home universe.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign and Snake Demon Sovereign were growing impatient waiting.</p><p></p><p>Based on the normal progression of a universe's Great Destruction, 12th-level beings should have emerged by now.</p><p></p><p>But this universe showed no signs, not even hints of 12th-level beings approaching escape.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign frowned, carefully sensing for a while.</p><p></p><p>"The origin consciousness of this universe is extremely active. This isn't right. Shouldn't the origin consciousness of a universe undergoing Great Destruction fall into slumber?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign pondered, "Could it be that some 12th-level being is carrying too many lives, causing the origin consciousness to awaken from slumber to prevent it?"</p><p></p><p>"How foolish!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign nearly cursed out loud.</p><p></p><p>The origin consciousness awakening from slumber would increase the difficulty of the Great Destruction calamity.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign wasn't sympathizing with the 12th-level beings inside the universe. Rather, the increased difficulty would cause a sharp drop in the number of 12th-level beings surviving the calamity, with more perishing within the universe.</p><p></p><p>This would naturally reduce their harvest as well.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Snake Demon Sovereign also realized this point, his expression extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>He had waited so long, only for this result?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, just count it as bad luck."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign glanced at the distant universe, intending to leave directly.</p><p></p><p>With the high probability that no 12th-level beings would emerge, this universe wasn't worth waiting for anymore.</p><p></p><p>With this time, he could fully harvest another universe.</p><p></p><p>Just as Blood Blessing Sovereign turned to leave, he seemed to sense something and suddenly twisted his head to look at the distant universe again.</p><p></p><p>"A 12th-level being is approaching escape from the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign stared at the universe. By now, over half of it had been destroyed, the outer regions all a gray haze. Blood Blessing Sovereign couldn't probe further, only sensing an aura rapidly breaking free of the universe's constraints.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to potentially escape the universe even with the increased difficulty of the Great Destruction calamity, it must be a peak Path-Breaking realm being." Blood Blessing Sovereign's face showed a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Within a universe era, 12th-level beings who cultivated to the peak Path-Breaking realm were extremely rare. This represented invincible strength within the universe.</p><p></p><p>And what did being invincible within a universe mean? The vast majority of resources in the universe were definitely in the hands of this peak Path-Breaking realm being. As long as he subdued this peak Path-Breaking realm being, the harvest would be greater than subduing ten or twenty Path-Breaking realm beings.</p><p></p><p>"Snake Demon..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign's eyes narrowed slightly as he looked towards Snake Demon Sovereign's area.</p><p></p><p>If he could sense this, Snake Demon Sovereign surely could as well.</p><p></p><p>"We'll likely come to blows soon." Blood Blessing Sovereign thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In normal circumstances, with ten or twenty Path-Breaking realm beings emerging from the universe, he and Snake Demon Sovereign could split them evenly and coexist peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But with only one peak Path-Breaking realm being, how to divide? Moreover, being able to cultivate to peak Path-Breaking realm within the universe likely meant some great fortune. The value would certainly be higher than expected.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Blood Blessing Sovereign was already prepared to strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He was just waiting for that peak Path-Breaking realm being about to escape the universe to enter the Chaos Void. At that instant, he would immediately take action to capture it, then leave directly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could capture that peak Path-Breaking realm being, it would be equivalent to obtaining the greatest benefit. Blood Blessing Sovereign couldn't be bothered to tangle with Snake Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign waited patiently.</p><p></p><p>Most of his attention was on Snake Demon Sovereign, only occasionally glancing at the distant universe.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign was very clear that his greatest enemy was Snake Demon Sovereign. As long as he defeated him, that peak Path-Breaking realm being would be like meat on a chopping block, ready to be taken at any time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>In the outer regions of the distant universe, already completely destroyed and a gray haze, was casually torn open.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign directly took a step forward, rapidly approaching the universe. Snake Demon Sovereign did the same on the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Halfway there, Blood Blessing Sovereign vaguely felt dazed, because he finally realized that this tear in the gray haze was far too large?</p><p></p><p>Before Blood Blessing Sovereign could react.</p><p></p><p>He saw a sight he would never forget.</p><p></p><p>Through the huge gap torn in the gray haze, an incomparably massive giant foot stepped out. This giant foot was so large it measured hundreds of millions to billions of light years.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The tear in the gray haze continued to widen, and a towering giant nearly as tall as heaven and earth strode out.</p><p></p><p>As this towering giant walked, countless lightning bolts, flames, cold winds, and water flows forming the Great Destruction calamity desperately tried to hold him back, but to no avail. The towering giant didn't even slow his pace in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The countless lightning, flames, cold winds, and water flows of the Great Destruction calamity, though insignificant to the towering giant,</p><p></p><p>made Blood Blessing Sovereign's soul tremble. Any single bolt of lightning, or flame, cold wind, or water flow, could easily annihilate him completely. Yet they weren't even enough to tickle that towering giant?</p><p></p><p>"This?" Blood Blessing Sovereign looked up at the towering giant striding out of the universe, his eyes somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

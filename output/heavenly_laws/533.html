        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"To condense such a number of Sun Seeds below 500 years old." Blue Burn Marquis was equally shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Sun Kingdom, Sun Seeds were not only related to the level of comprehension of rules, but also had some deeper meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Such an uncut jade has never appeared in the Blue Burn Domain, or even in the Ancient Sun Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Blue Burn Marquis thought to himself, unsure if such an existence had ever been born in the Ancient Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The history of the Ancient Sun Kingdom was infinitely ancient. Before Blue Burn Marquis was born, it had already overlooked all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"It's over there."</p><p></p><p>Blue Burn Marquis looked in a certain direction, precisely where the Yu family and East Sun family were located.</p><p></p><p>"It's in the area where You Jue and Shi Song were walking." Blue Burn Marquis's gaze was far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>You Jue was the tall figure, a disciple at the Sovereign realm under Blue Burn Marquis, who was quite valued.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go over there myself."</p><p></p><p>Blue Burn Marquis still felt somewhat uneasy, mainly wanting to confirm for himself.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sun Mirror wouldn't make a mistake, but Blue Burn Marquis simply intended to double-check.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Several patriarchs of the East Sun family stopped at a distance.</p><p></p><p>"The three Blue Envoy lords are currently in the Yu family." One of the East Sun family patriarchs observed for a while and came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>He was quite proficient in the attainment of cause and effect, and through the conversation with the three Blue Envoys just now, he could vaguely lock onto the cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>If the distance was very far, at most he could only vaguely sense it, unable to determine the exact location.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three Blue Envoys were also skilled at obscuring cause and effect, and wouldn't be easily locked onto.</p><p></p><p>But the current distance was very close, and two of the Blue Envoys were also at the Self-Path realm, at the same level as the patriarchs of the East Sun family, so naturally the traces of cause and effect were captured.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The leading patriarch of the East Sun family felt his heart sink.</p><p></p><p>When the tall figure and the other Blue Envoy suddenly left, he had speculated that it might be related to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>But it was only speculation.</p><p></p><p>Not certainty.</p><p></p><p>But now it was confirmed.</p><p></p><p>The three Blue Envoys were indeed in the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"Why are the Blue Envoy lords in the Yu family?"</p><p></p><p>The other patriarchs of the East Sun family discussed in low voices, quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the perfectly good Ten Sun Genius East Sun Meng, they all ran to the Yu family?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Yu family boy is also a Ten Sun?"</p><p></p><p>The fourth patriarch of the East Sun family suddenly guessed.</p><p></p><p>To attract the gathering of three Blue Envoys like this, this possibility was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Black Fall power I refined is not so easy to fully recover from."</p><p></p><p>One of the East Sun patriarchs frowned. The Black Fall power was a special power mastered by the path he walked.</p><p></p><p>Even for Self-Path realm powerhouses of the same level, it posed a certain threat, let alone an ant like Yu Yan who was far from even the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the life-saving trump card bestowed by the Yu family, even if he survived, it would be extremely difficult and would require a lot of time to recover, let alone condense the tenth Sun Seed?</p><p></p><p>"Nothing is impossible. The Black Fall power you mastered is not unsolvable."</p><p></p><p>The leading patriarch of the East Sun family spoke.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the most likely possibility for the three Blue Envoys' behavior was that the Yu family boy was also a Ten Sun genius.</p><p></p><p>This was the result.</p><p></p><p>As for the process? How the Yu family boy recovered from the erosion of the Black Fall power and condensed the tenth Sun Seed was no longer important.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, we should have acted directly at the time, without giving any chance." The East Sun family patriarch who mastered the Black Fall power said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>If they had known that Yu Yan could condense ten Sun Seeds, they should have completely torn off the facade with the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late to say these things now."</p><p></p><p>The leading patriarch of the East Sun family said: "However, our clan's Meng'er is also a Ten Sun, even if the Yu family boy is a Ten Sun, our clan is not afraid."</p><p></p><p>The leading patriarch of the East Sun family spoke confidently. Both were Ten Sun geniuses. Even if the East Sun family couldn't do anything to the Yu family, the Yu family also couldn't do anything to the East Sun clan.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"That Yu family boy was just lucky, luckily condensing ten Sun Seeds, how could he compare to Meng'er?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the three Blue Envoy lords are also making a fuss over nothing. Even if the Yu family boy condensed ten Sun Seeds, so what? Isn't our clan's Meng'er the same?"</p><p></p><p>The patriarchs of the East Sun family discussed among themselves, feeling that the three Blue Envoy lords were overvaluing the Yu family boy.</p><p></p><p>"It's only the beginning after joining under Blue Burn Marquis."</p><p></p><p>Just as the leading patriarch of the East Sun family was about to speak, he suddenly felt a surge of scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The pupils of the several patriarchs of the East Sun family contracted sharply. In their field of vision, in all directions, up and down, left and right, blue flames began to burn faintly.</p><p></p><p>The blue flames swayed, endless and boundless.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Fire Burning the Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this Blue Burn Marquis coming?"</p><p></p><p>"Blue Burn Marquis?"</p><p></p><p>"Blue Burn Great Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>The several patriarchs of the East Sun family were dumbfounded, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>Before Blue Burn Marquis took charge of the Blue Burn Domain, wherever he went, blue fire spread, burning everything, with a terrifyingly great killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he was enfeoffed by the Ancient Sun Kingdom that it improved a lot, but blue fire still spread wherever he passed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after becoming Blue Burn Marquis, Blue Burn Great Venerable's killing intent lessened a lot, and he rarely indulged in wanton slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the several patriarchs of the East Sun family on the scene would have already been reduced to ashes the moment they saw the blue fire.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Burn Great Venerable also went to the Yu family?"</p><p></p><p>The lips of the several patriarchs of the East Sun family moved, their souls trembling. At this moment, they finally realized that something beyond their imagination must have happened in the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could it possibly attract the descent of Great Venerable Qing Fen?</p><p></p><p>"What is the Great Venerable doing at the Yu family?"</p><p></p><p>The same thought simultaneously appeared in the minds of all the ancestors of the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yu family residence.</p><p></p><p>Blue flames appeared simultaneously in all four directions of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Great Venerable Qing Fen?"</p><p></p><p>"Has Marquis Qing Fen arrived?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu family ancestors widened their eyes, also realizing something.</p><p></p><p>This was Marquis Qing Fen! Great Venerable Qing Fen! Although nowadays, people referred to Qing Fen as Marquis.</p><p></p><p>But some powerful individuals still called Qing Fen the Great Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The tall figure You Jue and the other two looked at each other. Although they knew early on that Yu Yan, who had condensed the Blazing Sun Sea, would definitely attract Marquis Qing Fen's attention.</p><p></p><p>But for the Marquis to personally rush over, it was no longer just a matter of simple importance.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis Qing Fen?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt solemn in his heart.</p><p></p><p>According to the known information, Marquis Qing Fen's strength should be on par with the Chaos Venerables in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful figure was enough to gain Lin Yuan's attention.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had seen very few strong individuals at the Chaos Realm level, and they were all image imprints and the like.</p><p></p><p>As for real Chaos Venerables? He hadn't seen a single one.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had seen from afar a black horn piercing the sky of that Chaos Dragon Beast from the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>But that Chaos Dragon Beast was only nearly comparable to a Chaos Venerable, actually just at the peak of the Sovereign Realm, not truly at the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum! Infinite blue flames gathered, forming a man wearing a blue robe.</p><p></p><p>The man had narrow eyes, with a blue flame burning on his brow. Although he was just standing there, he brought great pressure to everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a Chaos Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Venerable meant nurturing Chaos Rules, reaching the eighth level of space-time comprehension, and so on.</p><p></p><p>A Chaos Venerable, placed in the Chaos Void, unless they wanted to die by provoking a Chaos Great Saint, it would be difficult for them to perish.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was observing Marquis Qing Fen, and Marquis Qing Fen was also observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not only has he condensed over ten thousand Blazing Sun Seeds, but his physical body is also transforming towards a Blazing Sun Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable, truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"When I reached this step, it was after crossing into the Self-Path Realm for 30 million years."</p><p></p><p>The more Marquis Qing Fen observed Lin Yuan, the more incredulous he became.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Divine Body was a special physique that could only be born after condensing a certain number of Blazing Sun Seeds. It was undisputedly the most powerful physique within the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific number? It depended on the degree of compatibility of the Blazing Sun Seeds constructing a cycle within the body.</p><p></p><p>Between several thousand to tens of thousands of Blazing Sun Seeds, this kind of physique transformation was possible.</p><p></p><p>"Marquis."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Marquis."</p><p></p><p>You Jue, Shi Song, and the other Blue Envoy immediately bowed to Marquis Qing Fen.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Marquis."</p><p></p><p>"The Yu family pays respects to the Great Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>All members of the Yu family did the same, whether ancestors or ordinary high-ranking clan members, all were extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>This was Marquis Qing Fen! The former Great Venerable Qing Fen whose killing power once shocked the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Rise, all of you."</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qing Fen waved his hand, his gaze constantly on Lin Yuan, and slowly said, "Are you willing to join under my Qing Fen banner?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Marquis Qing Fen said no more, but quietly looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So direct?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned, he originally thought Marquis Qing Fen would exchange a few pleasantries.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>In the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the class system was obvious. To obtain more resources and guidance on the path, one had to integrate into the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>And Marquis Qing Fen, as a marquis of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, was the most suitable starting point for Lin Yuan to integrate into the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"Good, prepare yourself then. In half an hour, I will personally take you back."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Marquis Qing Fen disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis truly lives up to his title."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, to remain so calm and composed upon seeing such a prodigy."</p><p></p><p>"Well, as a marquis of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, what kind of prodigious genius hasn't he seen before?"</p><p></p><p>The tall figure You Jue, Shi Song, and the other Blue Envoys looked at each other, communicating secretly. When they first saw the 'Blazing Sun Sea' condensed by Yu Yan, they couldn't control the shock in their hearts. When Shi Song contacted his senior brother, he had to organize his words multiple times.</p><p></p><p>Yet Marquis Qing Fen had shown no unusual reaction from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>This made the three Blue Envoys extremely admiring in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Yu family, beneath the firmament.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qing Fen's figure appeared, looking down at the Yu family below.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qing Fen finally couldn't control himself and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Then—</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahahahahahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Terrifying blue flames surged and billowed in all directions, but were constrained within a certain range. The blue flames turned into a sea of fire, rolling endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet crossed into the Self-Path Realm, yet condensed ten thousand Blazing Sun Seeds, and already transforming towards a Blazing Sun Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>"And not even 500 years old?!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a genius! Such a prodigy! Actually born in my Qing Fen Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Marquis Qing Fen laughed uncontrollably, overjoyed, his whole being seemed to have fallen into a dream.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

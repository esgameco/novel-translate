        <h1>Chapter 631</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint, the Black Jade Great Saint, and several other Chaotic Great Saints quickly came to see Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan was facing away from them, adjusting the many great dao rules of the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>When the Chaotic Continent was first opened, although the space-time had stabilized, many other great dao rules still needed to be adjusted.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could this Chaotic Continent become more perfect and free of hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint," the Savage Great Saint, the Black Jade Great Saint, and the other Chaotic Great Saints saw that Lin Yuan did not respond to them, and did not dare to continue asking, so they could only obediently stand in place.</p><p></p><p>The vast rule fluctuations occasionally transmitted from the Chaotic Continent below shocked the minds of several Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Great Saint's understanding of the rules is too terrifying." The Chaotic Great Saints trembled inwardly, and at such close range, they could clearly feel Lin Yuan's influence on the Chaotic Continent below.</p><p></p><p>"Even if our true bodies come here now and play all our trump cards, we probably won't be able to last long against the Silver River Great Saint," the Black Jade Great Saint thought to himself, able to clearly feel the difference in strength between the current Silver River Great Saint and the one in the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"You've come." Lin Yuan glanced at the Black Jade Great Saint and the Savage Great Saint and said casually, "Did you bring the Chaotic Stones?"</p><p></p><p>"We have brought them," the Black Jade Great Saint said respectfully, completely treating Lin Yuan as an unparalleled Great Saint, and then took out a world bracelet.</p><p></p><p>"We have also brought them," the Savage Great Saint, the Tian Lu Great Saint, and the other Chaotic Great Saints said, immediately taking out the Chaotic Stones they had prepared earlier.</p><p></p><p>"In that case..." Lin Yuan finished counting, and then released the main combat bodies of the several Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all the weapons, treasures, and other precious items on these main combat bodies were confiscated by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint, the Black Jade Great Saint, and the other Great Saints had long expected this, and they had only redeemed their main combat bodies. As for the weapons and treasures they carried, they didn't have any thoughts about them.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Silver River Great Saint, we'll take our leave first," the Black Jade Great Saint said tentatively.</p><p></p><p>After getting back their main combat bodies, the Black Jade Great Saint felt relieved in his heart. Although he was well aware of Lin Yuan's strength and had no intention of going back on his word, he still felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded and looked at the several Chaotic Great Saints, then suddenly said, "Are you interested in having your forces stationed in the Chaotic Continent I've opened?"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Black Jade Great Saint, the Savage Great Saint, or the Tian Lu Great Saint and the other two newly promoted Great Saints, they all had forces backing them.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Lin Yuan's sudden rise, the other Chaotic Great Saints all had their own growth trajectories over the long years. Even if they didn't intentionally establish forces, as their strength grew, they would naturally form their own forces.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, you're not holding a grudge against us for our previous actions?" the Black Jade Great Saint asked cautiously, his heart filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Being able to station their forces in a Chaotic Continent almost on par with the Peerless Great Saints was naturally a great opportunity. But they felt that they had enmity with Lin Yuan, so they didn't dare to make such a request.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've given the Chaotic Stones, there's nothing else," Lin Yuan said. The enmity between him and the Black Jade Great Saint and the others could be resolved, and since they had already sent the Chaotic Stones, Lin Yuan had no intention of pursuing it further.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Chaotic Continent had just been opened, it needed the stationing of many forces to develop quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Good. I'll go back and prepare." The Chaotic Great Saints were delighted and immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred and thirty billion Chaotic Stones." After the Chaotic Great Saints left, Lin Yuan looked at the harvest again.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll continue cultivating, striving to break through to the Chaotic Realm as soon as possible," Lin Yuan thought to himself, and then began to meditate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>As for the various affairs on the Chaotic Continent, Lin Yuan only needed to spare a thread of his divine sense to hold the overall situation, and the trivial matters could be completely handed over to the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, in the Black Jade Nest, Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit sat in meditation, refining his mind and will with the precious Black Jade.</p><p></p><p>As a first-class treasure land of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the Black Jade produced in the Black Jade Nest could greatly help in the cultivation of one's mind and will.</p><p></p><p>"My mind and will index should be approaching 90 million points now," Lin Yuan thought happily. As the guardian of the Black Jade Nest, as long as he wished, he could completely monopolize the Black Jade there, but Lin Yuan had no intention of doing so. At the very least, he would not lack Black Jade.</p><p></p><p>"There are still 8,000 years before the Black Jade in the Black Jade Nest matures. Before that, I need to be careful of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country side."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked far towards the direction of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Nest was located on the border between the Blazing Sun Ancient Country and the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country. Although it was currently occupied by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, it would attract strong experts from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country every time it approached maturity.</p><p></p><p>The strong experts from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country did not have the intention to completely occupy the Black Jade Nest. But as long as they could attack the Black Jade Nest during the maturity period and plunder some of the Black Jade produced there, it would still be a huge gain for them.</p><p></p><p>"The information and intelligence provided by the Blazing Sun Celestial Emperor has mentioned that the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country side has been quite restless before and after each maturity period," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The precious items that could refine and enhance one's mind and will? Not only did the strong experts of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country have a demand for them, but the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful ones also yearn for it intensely.</p><p></p><p>The six great ancient nations rule over boundless domains, and among the many rare treasures that can affect the spiritual will, the black jade is definitely the most outstanding one.</p><p></p><p>"This is also very normal. If there was no threat from the Xuanyin Ancient Nation, why would there be a need for powerful experts to guard the Black Jade Nest?" Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. The Lianyang Ancient Nation provides very good treatment for each powerful expert guarding the treasure land, not only bestowing them with merits from the ancient nation, but also allowing them to take away one-tenth of the resources produced by the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"I also need to be a little more careful."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if the powerful experts from the Xuanyin Ancient Nation were to attack and seize some of the black jade, I would surely be punished, and even the Emperor might not be able to protect me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided his spiritual focus, paying close attention to the changes in the Black Jade Nest and the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>The space-time in a certain area was slightly distorted.</p><p></p><p>Two figures stood silently there, gazing into the distance at the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"Calculating the time, the black jade is about to mature," the figure on the far left said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it is about to mature," the figure on the right said: "What, Jihan, do you have designs on the black jade?"</p><p></p><p>"This rare treasure of black jade, how could you not have any thoughts about it?" Jihan, the Extreme Cold Sovereign, glanced at the figure on the right: "I remember that the spiritual will of Beiyin is a weak point at the Sovereign level. If he can obtain enough black jade, he can completely make up for this deficiency."</p><p></p><p>The influence of spiritual will on strength is far less direct than that of the physical body and soul, but if there is a gap in spiritual will, it can be a troublesome issue.</p><p></p><p>"I do have thoughts about it," Beiyin Sovereign shook his head and said, "but what's the use of just having thoughts? We can only watch as the Lianyang Ancient Nation occasionally sells some black jade to us, but we can't snatch it away."</p><p></p><p>Between the ancient nations, there is also trade, but when it comes to rare treasures like black jade, as soon as they appear, they are snatched away by the royal family and powerful Sovereigns of the Xuanyin Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the guardian of the Black Jade Nest has changed, and Huoyang has been transferred away," Beiyin Sovereign spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I know about this matter as well," Jihan Sovereign nodded: "The new guardian who has taken charge of the Black Jade Nest is named Yinhe, who is a core royal clan member. Tsk tsk, core royal clan members are just different."</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe is said to have made some breakthroughs in overcoming the bottleneck on the path to Sovereign, but no matter what, he has not yet crossed into the Sovereign realm," Beiyin Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>"What are you implying?" Jihan Sovereign's expression became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"If Huoyang was still there, I wouldn't have any thoughts about the Black Jade Nest. Huoyang's strength was powerful, guarding the Black Jade Nest and controlling various formations, leaving no chance for us to seize an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"But this Yinhe..."</p><p></p><p>Beiyin Sovereign did not continue, but the implication was clear.</p><p></p><p>This core royal clan member who has reached his limit in growth, guarding the Black Jade Nest, would be hard-pressed to have the same level of complete control as Sovereign Huoyang.</p><p></p><p>And this is the opportunity for the two of them, the Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do?" Jihan Sovereign immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>He also realized that this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could succeed, they would not lack black jade for a long time.</p><p></p><p>And even if they failed... there would be no great loss.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, when Huoyang was guarding the Black Jade Nest, I have conducted many attempts to probe the defensive formations inside. I have some understanding of them."</p><p></p><p>"But now that Yinhe has just taken charge of the Black Jade Nest, even though he has mastered all the formations, he may not be able to operate them as skillfully as Huoyang in the short term."</p><p></p><p>"We just need to sneak in during the intervals when the formations are not running at full capacity..."</p><p></p><p>Beiyin Sovereign quickly said, as he had been planning this ever since Sovereign Huoyang was transferred away and Sovereign Yinhe took over the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"Sneak in..." Jihan Sovereign hesitated a bit.</p><p></p><p>If that Sovereign Yinhe reacted and locked them in, wouldn't they be in trouble then?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Yinhe is not Huoyang. Even if we are discovered, we can just retreat," Beiyin Sovereign immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Jihan Sovereign thought about it for a while and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Those core royal clan members' mastery of the laws of heaven and earth is far inferior to that of the Sovereigns, and their control of formations is the same.</p><p></p><p>"But be sure not to expose our true identities."</p><p></p><p>Beiyin Sovereign reminded.</p><p></p><p>Between the ancient nations, unless it's a large-scale, all-out battlefield, they will try to avoid direct confrontations between Sovereign-level combat forces as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Since Beiyin Sovereign and Jihan Sovereign have decided to take action, they will definitely hide their true identities. Even if the Lianyang Ancient Nation investigates afterwards, they can attribute it to the Sovereigns of other ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>As long as their identities are not exposed, the Xuanyin Ancient Nation will protect them.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Jihan Sovereign nodded.</p><p></p><p>This is something they are doing behind the back of the Xuanyin Ancient Nation, so it must be kept secret, and they cannot take responsibility for it afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>The two Sovereigns of the Xuanyin Ancient Nation, Beiyin and Jihan, carefully observed the operation of the formations around the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"Now is the time."</p><p></p><p>Beiyin's gaze focused, and he merged into the Black Jade Nest through the gaps in the formation's operation. Jihan Sovereign did the same, the two Sovereigns entering one after the other.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 305: Fifteen Years Later (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, fifteen years had passed.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Galactic Star Lord's palace:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self sat cross-legged. In the small area in front of him, space trembled faintly, and time gradually distorted.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz!!!</p><p></p><p>The time flow rate within the area sometimes increased and sometimes slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Since I entered the Time Rule nine years ago, my subsequent comprehension speed has become slower and slower." Lin Yuan looked at the area in front of him showing different time flow rates, "It seems that the hope of fully comprehending the complete Time Rule at the ninth level is not very high."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I forcibly comprehend it by relying on my extraordinary talent, it is estimated that it will take hundreds of thousands of years. With this effort, I would have already challenged the realm of the Supremes." Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Time Rule was of no help in breaking through from the ninth level to the tenth level, and there was no such thing as foundation enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Normally, ninth-level experts would not invest too much of their time and energy into the Time Rule. This was a bottomless pit, and only Lin Yuan, relying on his extraordinary talent, tried it for a few years and finally concluded that if he wanted to fully comprehend the Time Rule, it would take a hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the hundred thousand years mentioned here referred to the time spent at the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan stepped into the tenth level or even the eleventh level, comprehending time would be greatly shortened from a higher perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, compared to the Space Rule, the effect of the Time Rule is quite ineffective. It is tied to one's own foundation, and without a sufficiently high level of life essence, it is basically useless."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For example, among some ancient eleventh-level lives, very few of them had also comprehended the Time Rule.</p><p></p><p>But would these ancient eleventh-level lives dare to enter the river of time, go upstream, and revive the lives that died in the past?</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>Even reviving the weakest sixth-level life, they didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>They had the ability to do so, but they didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>Because this went against the operating rules of the main universe, once done, one would need to face the backlash of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The life essence thickness of the Supremes was unimaginably deep and could withstand the backlash brought about by "revival", but the eleventh level was far from having this ability.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had now entered the Time Rule and could only achieve time acceleration and time deceleration, and compared with the time flow rate of the main world, it could reach up to three times at most.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was time acceleration or time deceleration, it could only be maintained for twenty breaths at most, and if the coverage area exceeded three zhang around the body, the maintenance time would plummet.</p><p></p><p>If the life essence of the expert enveloped by the time acceleration and deceleration area was higher than Lin Yuan's, it might collapse prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Just like a small fishing net, how could it trap a whale?</p><p></p><p>As for slowing down the time flow rate on one's own body surface, realizing one year outside and only one day for oneself, achieving the ability of another kind of "life extension"...</p><p></p><p>It could only achieve life extension.</p><p></p><p>When the time flow rate was different from the main universe, the perception of many rules and ways of the main universe would become blurred.</p><p></p><p>The Time Rule being inconsistent with the main universe was equivalent to actively cutting off the path of comprehending the operation of the universal Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>Unless in the time flow rate area, a new set of Dao rules operation was reconstructed.</p><p></p><p>The eight traversals performed by Lin Yuan, each time the world he traversed had a different time flow rate from the main universe, but he could still comprehend the Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>It was because under the time flow rate of the traversed world, there was a Dao rule operation adapted to it.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Secret Realm"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the depths of the starry sky. After fifteen years, the Sun Primordial Spirit had almost walked through most of the outer area.</p><p></p><p>At most, in another five or six years, it could enter the core area.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xilan were hurrying on their way.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that after traveling together with Xilan, Lin Yuan's efficiency in hurrying improved quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although Xilan's combat power was ordinary, she was extremely good at "leaping" between the layers of space. Lin Yuan followed by her side and could often avoid a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>For example, when encountering a difficult-to-deal-with native life, often as soon as this native life noticed the fluctuations deep in the space layer, Xilan would take Lin Yuan far away.</p><p></p><p>The native life wouldn't even have time to chase.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Secret Realm has been open for more than twenty years," Xilan said while hurrying, her tone slightly heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Many of my good friends who entered the secret realm have died."</p><p></p><p>Xilan sighed, "If I hadn't listened to you, the Galactic Star Lord, and stayed away from those places of opportunity, I would probably be in danger now."</p><p></p><p>Places of opportunity would have precious treasures emerge, which were great opportunities but also great risks.</p><p></p><p>Because there would be many powerful alien races rushing there, if you went to fight for the treasures, you might die at the hands of that powerful alien.</p><p></p><p>In this trip to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Xilan had already gained considerable gains. In addition to that black sphere of unknown depth, she had previously been lucky enough to enter a place of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Now for Xilan, the most important thing was to land steadily.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Over the past twenty years, he had also made some human ninth-level evolved friends and learned some information about those who entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time.</p><p></p><p>"Now nowhere in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is safe. Those alien powerhouses hiding in the outer areas most likely have reaped bountiful harvests and want to get out of the secret realm alive."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm had been open for more than twenty years. The ninth-levels who could survive until now basically had some gains and were the hunting targets of those alien races with hundreds of thousands or millions of heavy realms.</p><p></p><p>Rather than painstakingly exploring places of opportunity everywhere, it was better to directly find people who had gained opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, to hunt a ninth-level, even if they had just entered the ninth-level, many factors needed to be considered, such as whether their backing race would provide support.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, even if a ninth-level was killed, it was most likely just an avatar and wouldn't carry too many valuable treasures on them.</p><p></p><p>But it was different in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of those alien powerhouses with hundreds of thousands or millions of heavy realms, those ninth-level experts with tens of thousands of heavy realms who had survived until now were no different from walking treasure troves. Killing any one of them would yield considerable gains.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan, who tried his best not to approach places of opportunity, had gained a lot, let alone other powerhouses?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the outer area had the smallest area, so it was the first to be swept.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xilan actively moved towards the core area, avoiding the first wave of hunting by those hunters.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, if you want to get out again, you can only wait until the day it closes, be in the outer area, and then be actively expelled."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was slightly emotional.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had 333 entrances in the main universe, those were only entrances, not exits.</p><p></p><p>Once it closed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On that day, those who are not in the outer regions will be left inside the secret realm. The fate awaiting them is to be strangled to death by the power of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, you must have made some breakthroughs in these fifteen years, right?" Xilan asked curiously after chatting for a while. </p><p></p><p>If it were other ninth-level powerhouses, Xilan would not ask this at all. Fifteen years? Making breakthroughs in fifteen years?</p><p></p><p>For ninth-level powerhouses with long lifespans, fifteen years is not even enough for a nap.</p><p></p><p>But this is Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Xilan could say that he had personally witnessed Lin Yuan's growth rate.</p><p></p><p>Decades ago, Lin Yuan was still fighting against those eighth-level lifeforms on the medium-sized alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But how long had passed before he was able to repel a ninth-level powerhouse like Maduo Practitioner who was close to a million layers?</p><p></p><p>This happened fifteen years ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, fifteen years have passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can only be stronger.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"Too abnormal," Xilan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Watching a little fellow he once knew catch up to him step by step, quickly surpass him and widen the gap, made Xilan feel a bit complicated.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to say whether living in the same era as the Galaxy Star Lord is fortunate or unfortunate. </p><p></p><p>Although Xilan did not continue to ask, because detailed inquiries would seem a bit "overstepping".</p><p></p><p>But in Lin Yuan's mind, the many breakthroughs he had made in the past fifteen years still flashed by.</p><p></p><p>The first was the entry into the time rule, an achievement that the vast majority of ninth-level lifeforms could not possibly have.</p><p></p><p>Even if a ninth-level lifeform is lucky enough to enter the time rule, it is when they are at the peak of the ninth level, unable to advance further, and with a bit of luck, they can barely do it after accumulating over time.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to enter the time rule within twenty or thirty years of entering the ninth level is indeed incredible.</p><p></p><p>Entering the time rule does not greatly improve direct combat power, but its auxiliary effects are very rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>The next is the development and derivation of spatial layers. In fifteen years, Lin Yuan's spatial layers have developed and derived to 198,000 layers.</p><p></p><p>From the number of spatial layers, Lin Yuan is not considered weak even among those with 100,000 layers.</p><p></p><p>The 198,000 layers of spatial layers combined with Lin Yuan's internal world of over 100 million li, layered upon each other, can boost Lin Yuan's frontal killing power to the level of 2 million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it is only comparable in frontal killing power. In other aspects, Lin Yuan is still far inferior to powerhouses with 2 million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>For example, the mastery of the numerous spatial layers and the number of spatial layers that can be occupied in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan occasionally continues to comprehend the body of that supreme powerhouse, wanting to understand more paths of demonic evolution.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, these paths of demonic evolution are helpful to Lin Yuan and can still produce benefits even at the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Lin Yuan wants to continue to improve the level of his own Demon Jade Tower members.</p><p></p><p>After the core members of the Demon Jade Tower are the sequence members.</p><p></p><p>Compared to ordinary members and core members, sequence members begin to truly hold power in the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan can become a sequence member of the Demon Jade Tower, there is a high possibility that he can obtain some authority over that Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>In that case.</p><p></p><p>Even if in the future, there are powerful aliens who condense the Demon Jade Mark and become ordinary members of the Demon Jade Tower, using the Demon Jade Mark to descend into the Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan can also use his own authority as a sequence disciple to expel them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even has a speculation that as long as he continues to improve his own level as a member of the Demon Jade Tower, perhaps one day in the future, he can take control of the Demon Jade Tower and become its new master.</p><p></p><p>Although the Demon Jade Tower has long declined with the disappearance of its master, and many members have also scattered and hidden.</p><p></p><p>But a thin camel is bigger than a horse. Any reward repository on a single floor of the Nine-Layered Black Tower can make Lin Yuan's eyes light up, let alone the Demon Jade Tower itself?</p><p></p><p>Finally, it is about the absorption of the liquid inside the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan has absorbed the sixth kind of blue liquid, and has also absorbed most of the blue liquid. The area of his internal world has reached 180 million square li.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that after opening up layers upon layers of spatial layers, with each expansion of the internal world, the power of each spatial layer will also increase.</p><p></p><p>The impact on Lin Yuan's strength is tantamount to a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the internal world of 180 million square li is only reached by Lin Yuan's true body. As for the Sun Avatar in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The internal world is still the size before entering, after all, Lin Yuan cannot send the mysterious gourd to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm for the Sun Avatar to absorb.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there is no need to send it. It can be "transferred" through the "Myriad Worlds Gate".</p><p></p><p>When in the traversing world, one can consume the power of breaking the boundary to send items from the main world to the traversing world.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, when in the main world, items can also be instantly transmitted between Lin Yuan's true body and avatars through the "Myriad Worlds Gate".</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of paying the power of breaking the boundary.</p><p></p><p>As for the isolation of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm? If dimensional walls can be crossed, let alone the mere Xuanhuang Secret Realm?</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan still did not do so, because as long as the mysterious gourd appears in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, there will be a risk of losing it.</p><p></p><p>If the mysterious gourd is lost while the Sun Avatar is holding it, encountering a powerhouse that Lin Yuan cannot resist or the dangers of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm itself, wouldn't it be heartbreaking?</p><p></p><p>"The power of breaking the boundary?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a sigh of relief. Fifteen years ago, he had already accumulated 71 strands of the power of breaking the boundary.</p><p></p><p>Now the number of strands of the power of breaking the boundary that Lin Yuan possesses has reached 120 in one go.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge number of the power of breaking the boundary, Lin Yuan can even "customize" a traversal.</p><p></p><p>By consuming a hundred strands of the power of breaking the boundary, he can let the Myriad Worlds Gate select a world to traverse according to the conditions he sets.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the need to expend energy and mind while hurrying on the road, I would want to do a traversal now." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>When he was on the verge of breaking through the shackles, Lin Yuan was unwilling to traverse, fearing that it would affect and delay the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But now? It is the time when a large amount of time accumulation is needed. Opening up each layer of spatial layers consumes time.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he is now in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, and in order to find out the reason for the "calling sensation" as soon as possible, he still decided to postpone the opportunity to traverse.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't matter anyway.</p><p></p><p>There is no loss to the power of breaking the boundary.</p><p></p><p>"It will take another five or six years to reach the core area."</p><p></p><p>Xilan couldn't help but say in a low voice beside him. He also wanted to personally take a look at the core area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were hurrying along.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying wave of celestial phenomenon fluctuations came from a distance, affecting layers upon layers of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face changed slightly as he looked towards the source of the celestial phenomenon fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

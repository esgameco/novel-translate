        <h1>Chapter 611</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The girl in the red robe stood beside the jade gourd, also observing the changes in the surrounding space and time.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit of the jade gourd, under Lin Yuan's permission, the girl in the red robe could immediately sense the subtle differences in the internal universe within her.</p><p></p><p>"The second layer has been completed."</p><p></p><p>The girl in the red robe murmured to herself. The cultivation process of the "Infinite Void" is similar to a subtle transformation of the internal universe, making its microscopic structure more perfect and complete.</p><p></p><p>The same basic particles, through different structural arrangements, can ultimately exhibit vastly different powers.</p><p></p><p>"This second layer of the 'Infinite Void' is almost reaching the third layer of the 'Infinite Void'," the girl in the red robe thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the second layer of the "Infinite Void" can only push the internal universe to the level of the internal universe of a Chaotic Sage, but this internal universe is not just comparable to the internal universe of a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of opportunity did the master obtain to raise the internal universe to such a degree?" the girl in the red robe was quite curious. To make further progress from the current height would be extremely difficult, especially since the "Infinite Void" has already almost exhausted the limits of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>To further enhance the strength of the internal universe? Only the girl in the red robe knew how difficult that would be.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's manifestation descended.</p><p></p><p>"Master," the girl in the red robe jumped up and looked at Lin Yuan, "the universe has completed its transformation."</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan nodded, closing his eyes to carefully experience the current boundless internal universe.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an ordinary piece of carbon had been transformed into a dazzling diamond due to changes in its microscopic structure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a similar change had occurred in Lin Yuan's internal universe. The essence remained the same, but the microscopic structure had been completely renewed.</p><p></p><p>"The upper limit of the universe has been greatly raised."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately sensed an extremely strong sense of hunger emanating from the source of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"Devour, devour."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately provided a large amount of resources, allowing the source of the internal universe to consume them.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Mysterious Yellow Universe, even though it was not over yet, Lin Yuan had already earned a bountiful harvest, making it easy for the internal universe to be fully fed.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>With the support of abundant resources, the internal universe began to expand frantically again.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of billions of light-years.</p><p>Thousands of billions of light-years.</p><p>Tens of thousands of billions of light-years.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>Until it approached the range of a trillion light-years, it gradually began to slow down.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe with a range of a trillion light-years had already completely matched the size of the primordial universe nurtured by the Chaotic Void, and the internal universe of a Chaotic Sovereign was only in the range of hundreds of billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that Lin Yuan's internal universe is different from other Chaotic Realm internal universes, as it does not pursue size or area, but rather quality.</p><p></p><p>It is like a block of tofu and a silver needle.</p><p></p><p>In terms of size, the former crushes the latter, but the silver needle can easily pierce through the tofu.</p><p></p><p>The thirteenth-tier inheritance of the "Infinite Void" is also about transforming the microscopic structure of the internal universe, not specifically about increasing the size of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the deepest part of the universe, where a blazing sun was burning fiercely, its radiant light permeating the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>This blazing sun could only be seen by Lin Yuan, as he had specifically shielded it from the girl in the red robe.</p><p></p><p>"The transformation of the internal universe has also led to the transformation of the source of this blazing sun," Lin Yuan thought to himself as he looked at the source of the blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense that after the completion of the second layer of the "Infinite Void", the source of this blazing sun had also become more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, now the source of the blazing sun is completely integrated with the internal universe, becoming a part of the internal universe. Since the internal universe has been enhanced, the source of the blazing sun naturally has also been enhanced," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's internal universe has gathered two thirteenth-tier techniques.</p><p></p><p>One is the "Infinite Void", and the other is the "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens".</p><p></p><p>"Although my internal universe is only in the range of a trillion light-years, it is enough to rival internal universes that are hundreds of trillions or even quadrillions of light-years in size. Those levels of internal universes are already approaching the level of the internal universes of the Peerless Sages."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The power of the operation of his current internal universe made Lin Yuan's heart tremble - it was too powerful. This was a force that surpassed ordinary Chaotic Sages.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there is still some gap compared to the Peerless Sages, but at the Chaotic Sage level, it can almost be considered a sweeping force.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how do you feel now?" the girl in the red robe couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Very good," Lin Yuan said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He felt more powerful than ever before, even having a sense that if he fully unleashed his power, he might be able to break free from the suppression of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if this feeling was true, Lin Yuan would not do so, as it would be a fruitless effort - the result of breaking free from the Mysterious Yellow Universe would be the premature collapse of the entire universe, which would not benefit Lin Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>The longer the Mysterious Yellow Universe existed, even in the event of a space-time collapse, it could continue to nurture the Mysterious Yellow Beasts, providing resources for Lin Yuan's cultivation of the "Mysterious Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>"It's not just 'very good'..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The girl in the red dress blinked her eyes and said, "Among all the past inheritors and cultivators of the 'Infinite Void', the master is absolutely the number one, and he is far ahead of the second place."</p><p></p><p>There are cultivators who have inherited and cultivated the 'Infinite Void' to the third or even fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of the second layer, no one can match Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The past inheritors and cultivators of the 'Infinite Void'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not surprised. The 'Infinite Void' is an extremely ancient thirteen-tier inheritance, and he is far from the only cultivator of this legacy.</p><p></p><p>In the long history before Lin Yuan, there had been many cultivators who inherited this legacy.</p><p></p><p>However, when the inheriting cultivators died or broke through to the thirteenth tier, the girl in the red dress would take the jade gourd and randomly appear in any location in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Since the girl in the red dress is not a true living being, she can also enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was sweeping through the Milky Way galaxy, the thirteen-tier inheritance vessel had already been in his home universe for hundreds of universe cycles before he obtained the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>"The master has only reached the Mastery Realm, and there is still a lot of room for the internal universe to improve," the girl in the red dress continued.</p><p></p><p>First, when crossing into the Chaos Realm, the internal universe will undergo a qualitative transformation and upgrade. When the Chaos Realm is perfected, the internal universe will also undergo a qualitative transformation and upgrade. When reaching the Peerless Great Saint realm, the internal universe will continue to evolve.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the third, fourth, and fifth layers of the 'Infinite Void' will also bring about qualitative changes to the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the seventh layer? It is only a realm theoretically evolved by the creator of the 'Infinite Void', and the highest level that the past inheritors and cultivators of the 'Infinite Void' have reached is the sixth layer, with no one ever having contact with the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh layer created by the old master will allow the internal universe to evolve into an existence comparable to the chaotic void, and this is too different from the sixth layer."</p><p></p><p>"So there is almost no possibility of reaching it."</p><p></p><p>The girl in the red dress looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, even if one cultivates the sixth layer of the 'Infinite Void', the internal universe would only be tens of thousands of times stronger than the internal universe of an ordinary Peerless Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the entire chaotic void, it would be like a firefly compared to the bright moon.</p><p></p><p>Going from the first layer to the second is not difficult, but going from the first layer to hundreds of thousands or millions, and doing it in one go, is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan is different. According to his current growth rate and the foundation of his internal universe, when Lin Yuan cultivates to the perfection of the Chaos Realm, combined with the sixth layer of the 'Infinite Void', his internal universe will grow to a level far beyond the normal sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the gap with the chaotic void will be narrowed, and the possibility of advancing to the seventh layer will naturally be higher.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh layer is too far away from me," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, not thinking too much about it.</p><p></p><p>The 'Fragmented World' of Star Tears.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit sat in meditation, and at the moment his true body and main body cultivated the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', the internal universe of the Yin Primordial Spirit also naturally cultivated the second layer.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the transformation of the internal universe, the true body and incarnations are synchronized.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan slightly activated the power of his internal universe, he found that the Dao rules of the chaotic void began to gradually retreat and avoid him as the center.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that a Peerless Great Saint can, as long as they wish, form a domain area where the rules are set by themselves. Am I now barely halfway there?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Peerless Great Saints are also at the perfection of the Chaos Realm, the path they have taken has great potential, which is why they can surpass the Chaos Saints.</p><p></p><p>Based on their own path as the foundation, they can make various Dao rules retreat, and then form a domain area where they set the rules.</p><p></p><p>Like the post-heaven universes opened up by the Peerless Great Saints, this is the same principle, but the post-heaven universes are larger in scope, and the rules formed need to be sustained, so they require great effort from the Peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly gathered his aura and swept his gaze over the countless humans in the Fragmented World, including the nine powerful experts, none of whom noticed his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Let alone discover that Lin Yuan's true strength has already reached the level of traversing the Chaos Saints.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>After getting a little familiar with it, Lin Yuan began to try to cultivate the third layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>The 'Infinite Void' has a total of seven layers, strictly speaking six layers, and each layer has a completely different microscopic transformation of the internal universe. The third layer of the 'Infinite Void' has already begun to transform the time-space origin of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation time for this layer is likely not going to be short," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had no worries. The most abundant thing he had now was time. Those ancient great saints had traversed hundreds or thousands of universe cycles, and basically had no other pursuits, so they chose to break through to the thirteenth tier.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chaos Saints have nowhere else to go, and as for advancing to the Peerless Great Saint realm? Peerless Great Saints are determined by the path, those who can succeed can succeed, and those who cannot will never succeed.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was cultivating the third layer of the 'Infinite Void' while continuing to head deeper into the Mysterious Yellow Universe, a clear spatial-temporal fluctuation came from a distant place, quickly spreading through half of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that place?" Lin Yuan looked towards the source of the spatial-temporal fluctuation, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

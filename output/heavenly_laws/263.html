            <p>Chapter 263: The Long Three Hundred Years (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"This kind of Immortal King aura..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder gazed into the distance towards Xiaoyao City, or more precisely, he was looking at the vast expanse under the dome of the sky above Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of true immortals, there was nothing there, and even ordinary tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings had no perception of it.</p><p></p><p>But in the sight of the purple-robed elder, there was a magnificent world evolving, vast and unparalleled, with a wisp of aura emanating from it no weaker than the aura of an ordinary Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"The aura is actually a world..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder's mind trembled. The auras of the vast majority of Immortal Kings were the external forms of certain objects, such as a heavenly pillar or an ocean.</p><p></p><p>But the magnificent world aura before his eyes was more like an encompassment of countless other auras rather than a single aura.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor is definitely not a new Immortal King..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder composed himself. How could a new Immortal King have such a magnificent aura? Although an Immortal King's aura was only linked to their strength to a certain extent and was not absolute.</p><p></p><p>But could the boundless aura the purple-robed elder was observing now be displayed by an ordinary Immortal King? Within the infinite world, numerous wonders were contained within, something even those tribulation-transcending peak Immortal Kings who had cultivated for millions of years could not achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Immortal King, only a Supreme Immortal King who has mastered the complete power of creation can possibly condense an aura of this level."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder took a deep breath. Tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings were divided into two types.</p><p></p><p>The first were normal Immortal Kings, including new, ordinary, veteran, and peak Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>These four levels of Immortal Kings had differences in strength, mainly determined by their mastery of their own power of creation, but the gap was not too big.</p><p></p><p>Even peak Immortal Kings would find it difficult to kill a new Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the tribulation-transcending stage, having passed the physical tribulation and mental tribulation, Immortal Kings who mastered the power of creation had exceptionally powerful life-preserving abilities. Even if they couldn't win, escaping was not much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>The second type of tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings were Supreme Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Immortal Kings had mastered the complete power of creation, and some even mastered more than one type of creative power.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Supreme Immortal Kings had almost no upper limit. Some ancient Supreme Immortal Kings could kill a peak Immortal King without too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even among tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings, Supreme Immortal Kings were existences that absolutely could not be provoked and required reverence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the number of Supreme Immortal Kings was pitifully small, with only a handful of renowned ones like the Paramount Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought this Martial Ancestor would actually be a Supreme Immortal King?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder felt his scalp go a bit numb, but he couldn't help feeling curious.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the world, any existence, would leave traces, let alone a Supreme Immortal King?</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Supreme Immortal King could not be achieved just by secluded cultivation. It required interaction with the outside world and adventuring through numerous secret realms. The growth trajectory of any Supreme Immortal King could not be completely kept secret.</p><p></p><p>But Martial Ancestor...</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder considered himself knowledgeable, yet he had never heard of any Supreme Immortal King related to the word "Martial".</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that those undying ones from the prehistoric era have emerged?" The purple-robed elder speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Long ages ago, the Spirit Realm had experienced a historical fault. Before that fault was the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder's speculation about Lin Yuan could only lean towards the prehistoric era. Otherwise, there was no way to explain the sudden appearance of a Supreme Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"I'm out of here. Regardless of whether he's a Supreme Immortal King from the prehistoric era, it's best to avoid getting close..." Before figuring out this Supreme Immortal King's temperament, the purple-robed elder immediately planned to stay far away.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was just a new Immortal King, or a veteran or peak Immortal King, he wouldn't mind interacting with him.</p><p></p><p>But a Supreme Immortal King suspected to be from the prehistoric era? The purple-robed elder didn't dare to casually make contact.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one was, the more they understood the terror of Supreme Immortal Kings, especially those from that glorious prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving." The purple-robed elder turned around, about to depart.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>He froze in place.</p><p></p><p>Because a figure had appeared not far away at some unknown time, with his back to him and hands clasped behind.</p><p></p><p>"It's Martial Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder's scalp exploded. To be able to appear beside him without him detecting anything, even peak Immortal Kings couldn't do it, only that Martial Ancestor could.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the purple-robed elder immediately greeted him with slight respect.</p><p></p><p>Since Martial Ancestor had appeared here, it indicated he had discovered him. Running away at this point was obviously too late.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan glanced at the purple-robed elder, quite satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Besides promoting the martial dao cultivation system, he had revealed part of his strength to attract other tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain the true high-level information of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was too vast, with the three thousand Dao Prefectures being just a small part. If Lin Yuan were to personally search for those tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings, it would likely consume a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better to lie in wait.</p><p></p><p>The moment the purple-robed elder approached Xiaoyao City, Lin Yuan had detected him.</p><p></p><p>While the purple-robed elder was observing Martial Ancestor's aura, Lin Yuan was also observing the purple-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what means the purple-robed elder used, just now Lin Yuan had a faint feeling of being spied upon.</p><p></p><p>This spying was only the most superficial kind and far from perceiving Lin Yuan's foundation, but it was still rare.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Martial Ancestor has any tasks that require my assistance. I guarantee to follow your orders..." The purple-robed elder took the initiative to say.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask you a few questions." Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I know, I will certainly hold nothing back."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder felt slightly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a few questions, even if it were a few hundred questions, he would not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>"Where do most tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings reside?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>So far, there were rarely any traces of tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings in the three thousand Dao Prefectures, not only in Dongyun Prefecture but even in those few core prefectures. At most, there existed lineages left behind by Immortal King level experts.</p><p></p><p>Other prefectures occasionally had rumors of Immortal Kings, but they were just rumors.</p><p></p><p>For example, Jiujiang Domain was rumored to be the "Dragon Transformation Land" of a certain tribulation-transcending Dragon King.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal King level experts themselves, they were still nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>This made Lin Yuan a bit puzzled. Although tribulation-transcending Immortal Kings were rare, they had long lifespans. It was difficult for an era to give birth to one, but accumulated over eras, there should definitely be some.</p><p></p><p>"Where are all the Immortal Kings?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's question made the purple-robed elder's heart skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>To be continued...</p><p></p><p>Certainly, here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was confirmed that Lin Yuan was definitely a supreme immortal king from a prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he not even know this basic common sense?</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, those who could ask this question were mostly newly promoted immortal kings, and they were newly promoted immortal kings without any background.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as long as there were immortal king-level elders around, how could they be completely ignorant of this?</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was obviously not a newly promoted immortal king. Although the purple-robed elder had not seen Lin Yuan make a move, he had already regarded him as a supreme immortal king in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the strength of a supreme immortal king, yet knowing nothing about the matters of this era.</p><p></p><p>If not an old monster from a prehistoric era, what else could he be?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the purple-robed elder became even more respectful. He did not know much about the prehistoric era, only knowing that a catastrophic change had occurred, and even some supreme immortal kings had fallen.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal kings who were able to survive from that era were all the best among the supreme immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Martial Ancestor, in the current era, most of the tribulation-transcending immortal kings basically linger in two places."</p><p></p><p>"One is the desolate land outside the Three Thousand Dao Realms. Although it is dilapidated and far inferior to the Three Thousand Dao Realms, it has traces left from the prehistoric era, which is of great help to us ordinary immortal kings."</p><p></p><p>"The desolate land outside the Three Thousand Dao Realms?" Lin Yuan pondered in his heart. He had once explored the desolate land with his primordial spirit, but did not gain much and thus did not pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"The second is the Nine Heavens, but for us immortal kings, the first four heavens basically have no effect. It only starts to be useful from the fifth heaven, but the fifth heaven is very difficult to climb. Generally, only peak immortal kings or supreme immortal kings can ascend."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder continued.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Since the transformation of the Taiji power, the fusion of the Taiyin primordial spirit and Taiyang primordial spirit into the Taiji primordial spirit had also gained the invincible power of the eighth stage, which was the level of a supreme immortal king.</p><p></p><p>He had long ascended to the fifth heaven, but so far, he still had not encountered any immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>After all, the fifth heaven was vast and boundless. Even for supreme immortal kings, being in it was like a drop of water falling into the sea.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's Taiji primordial spirit was observing the various "wonders" and "strange phenomena" of the fifth heaven, comprehending with a heaven-defying understanding. It would not specifically seek out other immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>It was perfectly normal not to encounter any.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that there is a great secret in the ninth heaven, related to the end of the prehistoric era, and the supreme immortal kings all want to enter the ninth heaven."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder seemed to think of something and immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lin Yuan's expression did not change.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard of the legend about the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm could be entered by true immortals at the Harmonious Dao stage, and it was not much of a secret.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, there had been a saying related to the Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>There are people beyond people, heavens beyond heavens, and celestial beings above the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens here referred to the ninth heaven, and celestial beings were not specifically explained.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked a few more questions.</p><p></p><p>They were mostly simple common sense questions.</p><p></p><p>For example, how many supreme immortal kings were there in this era, and so on.</p><p></p><p>While the purple-robed elder's heart became more and more fearful, he naturally told everything he knew honestly.</p><p></p><p>"One last thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the purple-robed elder and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that tribulation-transcending immortal kings have all mastered a certain creation power. What kind of creation power do you possess?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Through close contact with the purple-robed elder, Lin Yuan was very certain that the other party had not opened up an inner world.</p><p></p><p>But the strength of the purple-robed elder, according to Lin Yuan's perception, was not weaker than the eighth-stage evolutionaries of the main world.</p><p></p><p>Without the support of an inner world, yet being able to rival the eighth-stage evolutionaries who possessed inner worlds, the key probably lay in the "creation power" mastered by the immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, the creation power I have mastered is called the Primordial Purple Qi." The purple-robed elder stretched out his right hand, and strands of purple gas could be seen lingering at his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, "Can you give me a strand?"</p><p></p><p>"If the Martial Ancestor wants it, of course it's possible." The purple-robed elder was a bit puzzled, but as a tribulation-transcending immortal king who had mastered a portion of creation power, it was extremely simple to separate a strand.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"You may go."</p><p></p><p>"If there's anything, I will contact you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected the strand of Primordial Purple Qi from the purple-robed elder and said in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder breathed a slight sigh of relief, bowed to Lin Yuan again, and then quickly turned and left.</p><p></p><p>At a location countless miles away from Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder revealed his figure, and his hanging heart finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Martial Ancestor is not the kind of supreme immortal king who likes to kill." The purple-robed elder was still a bit shaken. In the prehistoric era, it was said that some supreme immortal kings enjoyed hunting and killing immortal king-level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor asked many questions about the supreme immortal kings of this era. Could it be that he has other intentions?"</p><p></p><p>After his thoughts settled down, the purple-robed elder began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>He speculated that perhaps the Martial Ancestor wanted to rebuild the glory of the prehistoric era?</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of what purpose the Martial Ancestor has, I must seize this opportunity." The purple-robed elder made a decision in his heart. Before parting with the Martial Ancestor, he had obtained the Martial Ancestor's contact information.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Martial Ancestor allowed him to make contact.</p><p></p><p>Being able to contact a supreme immortal king at any time, and a supreme immortal king from the prehistoric era at that, how great of an opportunity would this be?</p><p></p><p>He was worried that if he encountered those bloodthirsty supreme immortal kings, wouldn't he be jumping into a pit on his own?</p><p></p><p>But now, through a brief exchange, the purple-robed elder had a vague understanding of the Martial Ancestor. Although the understanding was not deep, he was clear that the other party should not be the kind of powerhouse who would kill indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the cave abode again.</p><p></p><p>"Prehistoric era?"</p><p></p><p>"And the ninth heaven?"</p><p></p><p>In the purple-robed elder's answer, he had the greatest reaction to these few words, revealing emotional fluctuations of awe and fear.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"These can be discussed later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the prehistoric era or the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>These were not the things Lin Yuan was most concerned about at the moment.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan really wanted to confirm now was the creation power possessed by the purple-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>Primordial Purple Qi.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a strand of purple gas appeared, which was the strand of Primordial Purple Qi left by the purple-robed elder.</p><p></p><p>"This aura..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, felt it meticulously, and finally came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>This strand of Primordial Purple Qi actually had a similar resemblance to the cosmic power he possessed—the Taiji power.</p>

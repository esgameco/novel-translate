            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 434 The Majestic Chaos (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Within the territory of the Stellar Alliance. </p><p></p><p>On an enormous planet, the true forms of the Four Divine Kings, towering hundreds of millions of miles high, sat quietly.</p><p></p><p>After the two-dimensional world came to an end, the "White Paper" retreated from the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings had been sitting here ever since.</p><p></p><p>The loss of their avatars in the two-dimensional world was a heavy blow to the Four Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>It was far more than just a permanent loss of a portion of their spiritual will, and the loss of a supreme weapon suited for them. </p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Four Divine Kings' state of mind was severely shaken.</p><p></p><p>As legendary eleventh-level perfected beings, the unique special lifeforms in the cosmic starry sky, the Four Divine Kings could not claim to be the strongest at the eleventh level, but they were certainly among the top ranks.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the two-dimensional world, they were crushed by that human civilization's "Blood Rain", which the Four Divine Kings could not accept.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary products of human civilization were innately weak, with ninety-nine percent unable to cross into the first level, starting far lower than special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Four Divine Kings were defeated by such a human evolutionary product.</p><p></p><p>If it were merely a defeat, the Four Divine Kings would not have been so shaken.</p><p></p><p>Although the evolutionary products of human civilization start low, their potential is high, or else how could nine twelfth-level beings have emerged?</p><p></p><p>But the Four Divine Kings did not just suffer defeat; one could not even call it a defeat.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of that human "Blood Rain", the Four Divine Kings were not even worthy opponents.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice echoed through this region of space-time, entering the planet.</p><p></p><p>"Four Divinities, since the past is already past, there is no need to dwell on it."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Stellar Alliance's supreme being came.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme One, does our universe truly harbor such a monstrous eleventh-level lifeform?" the Four Divine Kings still could not comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"All things are possible," the Stellar Alliance's supreme being fell silent for a moment before speaking, "That two-dimensional world could only thoroughly suppress forces below the twelfth level."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that human Blood Rain possessed a certain treasure that allowed him to break free from the suppression of the two-dimensional world to some degree."</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance's supreme being said slowly.</p><p></p><p>This was the speculation made by the supreme beings and ultimate existences of various peak factions after the "White Paper" retreated from the universe, regarding why that human "Blood Rain" possessed such transcendent strength.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the heaviness in the Four Divine Kings' hearts eased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>If it were truly as the Supreme One speculated, then the Four Divine Kings' disgrace would not be so severe?</p><p></p><p>"Four Divinities, what you need to consider now is the upcoming opening of an enormous battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"To open that enormous battlefield, my Stellar Alliance has paid a great price, and the other peak factions have also paid a great price."</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance's supreme being looked down at the Four Divine Kings, "As long as we can obtain the first initiative in that enormous alien battlefield, I can take charge and try to replenish the portion of spiritual will you have lost."</p><p></p><p>Any lifeform that fell into the two-dimensional world of the White Paper would permanently lose a portion of their spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>This portion of spiritual will cannot be recovered, but it can be replenished through certain means, at the cost of a price.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supreme One. In the upcoming enormous battlefield, I will give my all," the Four Divine Kings said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good," the Stellar Alliance's supreme being nodded slightly. "After going through this experience and replenishing yourself, your foundation should be sufficient to attempt breaking through to the twelfth level ultimate."</p><p></p><p>"Attempt the twelfth level ultimate?" The Four Divine Kings' eyes burned slightly brighter.</p><p></p><p>The sole goal of any eleventh-level lifeform was to break through to the twelfth level ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Only by crossing into the twelfth level ultimate could one shed the shackles of the river of time and hope to live through eon after eon of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"There is no need to dwell on that human 'Blood Rain'. Perhaps on the path to breaking through to the ultimate, you may even surpass him," the Stellar Alliance's supreme being said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the Four Divine Kings nodded, their gaze regaining confidence.</p><p></p><p>"You-" The Stellar Alliance's supreme being was about to continue when suddenlyâ€”</p><p></p><p>A vast, surging primordial aura swept through the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"This...?" The Stellar Alliance's supreme being's expression grew solemn as their gaze calmly turned towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings also reacted, able to clearly sense this boundless, surging primordial aura despite being eleventh-level beings.</p><p></p><p>Capable of instantly...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the midst of it, such a level of chaos and primordial void descended, only at the time of impacting the ultimate. </p><p></p><p>Not long ago, there was a tenth-stage evolved human who comprehended the rules of time. When impacting the eleventh stage, it also caused an infusion of the primordial chaos void, but the movement was much smaller than the present.</p><p></p><p>"Who is impacting the ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>The four Celestial Kings looked towards the most powerful being.</p><p></p><p>He could only sense the vast and pervasive aura of the primordial chaos void everywhere, but as for the source, there was a vast space-time labyrinth obstructing it in between, so the four Celestial Kings could not determine it either.</p><p></p><p>"Within the human civilization's domain."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the most powerful being of the Stellar Alliance, with the perception of space-time at the twelfth stage, could barely see through the space-time labyrinth and determine that the source of the primordial chaos void was likely near the human civilization's domain.</p><p></p><p>"The human civilization's domain? Is it 'Blood Rain' impacting the ultimate?" </p><p></p><p>The four Celestial Kings were stunned for a moment, this thought instinctively surfacing in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The vast and overwhelming ripples of the primordial chaos void swept through, instantly drawing the attention of all twelfth-stage beings in the cosmic starry sky, and many eleventh-stage experts also reacted violently.</p><p></p><p>"Impacting the ultimate, there is a life impacting the ultimate."</p><p>"To attempt impacting the ultimate, one must at least comprehend the quintuple realm of space-time fusion."</p><p>"Impacting the ultimate ah, I don't know if I can reach the threshold to impact the ultimate before my great limit of longevity."</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe, every long period of time, there would be lives attempting to impact the ultimate, but the vast majority failed. So many eleventh-stage experts were very familiar with these ripples.</p><p></p><p>"The source is within the human civilization's domain?"</p><p></p><p>In the insect territory, countless Matriarchs opened their eyes, looking towards where the source of the primordial chaos void was.</p><p></p><p>"Is the human civilization about to give birth to their tenth most powerful being?"</p><p></p><p>Many insect Matriarchs frowned, the human civilization was already powerful enough. If they now gave birth to a tenth most powerful being, it was estimated that the insect race would be suppressed to the point of gasping for air.</p><p></p><p>In the Celestial Feather territory.</p><p></p><p>The various Patriarchs also had grave expressions. Normally, a perfected eleventh-stage evolved human from the human civilization would not be allowed to impact the ultimate without a certain level of assurance.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they failed, it would be equivalent to completely losing this perfected eleventh-stage evolved being.</p><p></p><p>Death from failing to impact the ultimate could not be revived, because the life imprint would briefly jump out of the river of time. Success meant completely breaking free from the shackles of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>If one failed, then all traces would be wiped out.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>For any peak race or force.</p><p></p><p>Impacting the ultimate was an extremely serious matter.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was no other choice, they would rather slow down their own flow of time and delay, rather than recklessly attempt impacting the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those solitary and unrestrained special lifeforms without any racial constraints were exceptions. Some special lifeforms, having lived long enough, would forcibly attempt impacting the ultimate even without the assurance of success.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of many layers of space in the Galactic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>After releasing the suppression on himself.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense that the heavens, earth and universe briefly fell into a certain stillness.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying cosmic spatial rift was torn open from the space above his head.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the primordial chaos void descended, an intangible pressure beginning to spread throughout the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up, the terrifying cosmic spatial rift continuously expanding, merely in an instant exceeding ten light-years, the profound and mysterious aura of the primordial chaos void rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the realm of the primordial chaos void?" Lin Yuan gazed upwards, the cosmic spatial rift rapidly swelling to dozens of light-years, vaguely revealing a vast and boundless space outside, carrying infinite might, supremely exalted.</p><p></p><p>The infusion of the primordial chaos void, the source was naturally the realm of the primordial chaos void. When crossing major boundaries in the life domain, it would form a temporary connection to the realm of the primordial chaos void as a conduit for infusion.</p><p></p><p>The cosmic space continued being torn open, finally stopping at one hundred light-years.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred light-years?" Lin Yuan immediately understood, this should be the limit he could withstand the infusion of the primordial chaos void this time.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ten light-year rift when breaking through from the ninth to tenth stage, this one hundred light-year rift seemed only ten times larger, but the primordial chaos void that would ultimately be infused was far, far more than a hundred or thousand times greater.</p><p></p><p>"The origin has begun infusing."</p><p></p><p>The moment the cosmic spatial rift stopped expanding, Lin Yuan realized that what he would face next was the infusion of the primordial chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The primordial infusion.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the infusion of the primordial cosmic source or the infusion of the primordial chaotic void source, it all depended on the comprehensive conditions of one's own life. </p><p></p><p>Such as the strength of the physical body, the strength of the soul, the strength of the inner world, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Among them, when breaking through to the eleventh level and impacting the ultimate, the primordial chaotic void source infusion triggered by the ultimate metamorphosis and leap of life would far exceed that of breaking through from the tenth to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>"I only have three hundred and thirty-three seconds, during which I must try my best to withstand more of the primordial chaotic void source," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity, for almost all life in the universe, came only once - when impacting the ultimate at the eleventh level. </p><p></p><p>Even if one successfully crossed into the twelfth level afterwards, with the inner world metamorphosing into an inner universe, one could only slowly absorb the primordial chaotic void source.</p><p></p><p>The boundless absorption like what was happening now in these three hundred and thirty-three seconds would never happen again.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>From the mysterious primordial chaotic void source realm passage within the universe fissure spanning over a hundred light-years, the torrential primordial chaotic void source immediately began to pour out.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling ~ Like an ocean collapsing, the speed at which the primordial source poured out was terrifying. Within a radius of a hundred light-years, everything was filled with the pure force of the primordial chaotic void source.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb it all!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body was madly absorbing, his soul was also madly absorbing, and his inner world was equally madly absorbing.</p><p></p><p>The force of the primordial chaotic void source was extremely pure. Almost no refinement was needed - as long as it was absorbed into the body, it could quickly transform into one's own energy and promote the improvement of one's foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>After only twenty seconds, Lin Yuan felt his inner world experiencing a "full" sensation, clearly having devoured enough.</p><p></p><p>"Keep absorbing." Lin Yuan did not stop. At this moment, his inner world gave him a sense of being at a critical juncture, as if one more step would break through some kind of shackle or limit.</p><p></p><p>In the Galactic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The nine strongest experts of human civilization looked somewhat dazed at the space fissure spanning over a hundred light-years, as well as the endless primordial chaotic void source pouring into the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred-light-year space fissure is no different from impacting the ultimate at the eleventh level, right?" The supreme expert Xuvirtue said in a daze.</p><p></p><p>For supreme experts, impacting the ultimate at the eleventh level was not that rare of an occurrence.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was not impacting the ultimate, but rather the eleventh level itself.</p><p></p><p>The only difference between Lin Yuan and those lives impacting the ultimate was that he had not yet leapt out of the river of time and undergone the ultimate metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert Xia Qin was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the eleventh level, he had made some predictions, believing that the commotion would definitely not be small, after all, the scene from his breakthrough to the tenth level was still vivid.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Xia Qin had only dared to guess that Lin Yuan's final breakthrough would approach the level of impacting the ultimate. But to be completely on par with it, as it was now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not undergone the ultimate metamorphosis, yet he could still cause a commotion no less than impacting the ultimate - how was that possible?</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts of human civilization stood in the void, constantly observing that hundred-light-year fissure from which the primordial chaotic void source was constantly pouring out.</p><p></p><p>All the primordial sources were marked with Lin Yuan's life imprint. Even if they could not be absorbed, they would quickly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the shock of the nine supreme experts of human civilization,</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts and ultimate existences of the various peak forces in the cosmic starry sky were somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Especially hostile forces like the Insect Race and the Tian Yu Race, who were completely opposed to human civilization, were absolutely unwilling to see human civilization gain a tenth supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>If human civilization gave birth to a tenth supreme expert, it would have a profound impact on the future war situation, especially with the imminent opening of large-scale battlefields.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop him? During the period of impacting the ultimate, although one needs to endure the retaliation of the river of time, one is also under the protection of the river of time. Even if we break free from the shackles of the river of time, we are far from being able to shake the river of time itself."</p><p></p><p>"Then what should we do? Just watch as human civilization gains another supreme expert?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts of the Insect Race, Tian Yu Race, and many others quickly communicated.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the river of time," said the Insect Queen.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the river of time."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other supreme experts nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>By going to the river of time and standing on its banks, although they would not be able to observe the details within the river of time,</p><p></p><p>If any life successfully broke free from the shackles of the river of time and crossed into the twelfth level, emerging from the river onto the banks, they would still be able to witness it.</p>

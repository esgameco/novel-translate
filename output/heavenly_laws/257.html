            <p>Chapter 257: Born for Martial Dao? Martial Dao Rises Because of Him! (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>As a physically powerful Martial Dao Seventh Stage, Shan Yang can easily lift majestic divine mountains weighing hundreds of thousands of zhang. </p><p></p><p>This is just pure strength. If he relies on other means, Shan Yang's power will surge even more.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference between Martial Dao and Immortal Dao. Immortal Dao cultivators focus on the "spirit". Starting from the Golden Core stage, to Nascent Soul stage, Deity Transformation stage, Void Refinement stage, etc., most of their cultivation is concentrated on the "spirit".</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao is different. Although Martial Dao can also condense a primordial spirit, it still takes the physical body as the foundation, with vast seas of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Shan Yang is shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed Lin Yuan's right hand, but no matter what, he couldn't lift it up.</p><p></p><p>Heavy!</p><p></p><p>Heavy! </p><p></p><p>It's really too heavy!</p><p></p><p>It's as if the person in front of him is not a person, but an entire world.</p><p></p><p>But how is this possible?</p><p></p><p>Can a person be as heavy as an entire world?</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang's thoughts seemed like paste, and he didn't react for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He even doubted whether his strength had declined.</p><p></p><p>"Want to lift me up?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Shan Yang.</p><p></p><p>A trace of strangeness flashed in his expression.</p><p></p><p>How heavy is he?</p><p></p><p>Let's not mention his physical body for now.</p><p></p><p>As a Martial Dao Eighth Stage, his physical body has been amplified five or six times by the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Every drop of blood, every hair, according to the main world's measurement standards, exceeds ten thousand tons.</p><p></p><p>The weight of his physical body is actually the smaller part.</p><p></p><p>The key is the world inside Lin Yuan's body that spans 2.6 million li in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This world is located inside Lin Yuan's body. Although it's not visible, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p><p></p><p>It's just that normally, Lin Yuan circulates the power of the world to balance the gravity from the spirit realm with the world inside his body.</p><p></p><p>But it's only balanced.</p><p></p><p>If an outsider wants to lift Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>They would need to have the power to lift the 2.6 million li world inside his body.</p><p></p><p>And how heavy is this 2.6 million li world inside Lin Yuan's body?</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan's strange expression,</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>It's not that his strength has declined, but the Lin Yuan in front of him, whom he regarded as a "little guy", is indeed too heavy.</p><p></p><p>Unimaginably heavy.</p><p></p><p>So heavy that it exceeds his power limit.</p><p></p><p>So even if he tries his best to lift, he still can't move him at all.</p><p></p><p>Not far away,</p><p></p><p>Li Qing and Nie Yun looked towards Lin Yuan and Shan Yang who were in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, Lin Yuan stood there quietly, while Shan Yang grabbed the former's shoulder with his right hand, wanting to lift directly upwards, but there seemed to be a sense of abrupt stopping.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang's figure suddenly retreated, like a startled little white rabbit, stopping beside Li Qing and Nie Yun, staring at Lin Yuan with unprecedented solemnity: "Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>This scene left Li Qing and Nie Yun a bit dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the two reacted.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing carefully observed Lin Yuan and found that she actually couldn't see through him. The aura emanating from Lin Yuan was perfect and flawless, and she couldn't discern anything at all.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The two Martial Dao Seventh Stage also realized the seriousness of the matter.</p><p></p><p>The power of qi and blood began to spread and expand, instantly enveloping the entire Martial Temple and Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan laughed softly and then said, "No need for you to send me up to the Nine Heavens. In recent years, my Yin and Yang spirits have been cultivating there all the time."</p><p></p><p>The Zhongtu Shenzhu world has Nine Heavens, where the battlegrounds of the Void Refinement ancient sages take place.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, in the spirit realm, there are also Nine Heavens. Compared to Zhongtu Shenzhu, the Nine Heavens of the spirit realm are much more mysterious, containing many "wonders" that have a guiding effect on comprehending the essence of the world.</p><p></p><p>So early on, decades ago, Lin Yuan had sent his Yang spirit and Yin spirit to the Nine Heavens to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating in the Nine Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang and Nie Yun glanced at each other, the pressure in their hearts growing even greater.</p><p></p><p>Over time, the pressure from the Nine Heavens is not something that Seventh Stage and true immortals can withstand.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation? It's estimated that only Tribulation Transcendence Immortal Kings have the ability to use the Nine Heavens as a cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it's just short-term cultivation, such as cultivating for a few months or a few years, the peak of true immortals may still be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>At present, the two Martial Dao Seventh Stage couldn't figure out Lin Yuan's strength at all, and what purpose he had for infiltrating the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Yin spirit and Yang spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qing looked at Lin Yuan, somewhat lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the hundreds of thousands of years, Martial Dao cultivators are like fish in a river, and who knows how many have been born.</p><p></p><p>And there are also many, many Martial Dao cultivators who have cultivated to the Fifth Stage and condensed a Martial Dao primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the primordial spirits condensed by Fifth Stage Martial Dao cultivators are varied and strange, but in Li Qing's memory, there is only one who was called the Yin spirit and Yang spirit.</p><p></p><p>Yin spirit and Yang spirit imply cultivating two completely opposite forces at the same time. If there is a slight mishap, one will fall into an irredeemable state.</p><p></p><p>To fuse yin and yang, and then condense the Yin spirit and Yang spirit, since the birth of Martial Dao, only Li Qing's master, that Martial Ancestor, has done it.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Nie Yun and Shan Yang were in a bit of a dilemma, not knowing whether to take action or not.</p><p></p><p>If they take action, the two really have no confidence. Shan Yang just now couldn't move Lin Yuan at all with his full strength. The other party's strength, even if it hasn't reached Tribulation Transcendence, is probably not far off.</p><p></p><p>With their strength, even if they add the peak Seventh Stage Li Qing, they won't gain any advantage, and instead will completely tear off the facade with the other party.</p><p></p><p>But if they don't take action...</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun and Shan Yang looked at Li Qing, deciding to leave this matter to Ancestor Li to decide.</p><p></p><p>It's just that when they looked at Li Qing, they found that her expression was changing, her eyes fixed on Lin Yuan, seeming to have something to say but stopping herself.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun and Shan Yang were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Little Li, it's been so many years, you're still the same." Lin Yuan smiled slightly, looking at Li Qing, and spoke.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out,</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's eyes immediately began to redden, almost unable to control her emotions, subconsciously saying two words, "Master."</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of years, only Lin Yuan in the past called her that.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing almost forgot that she still had such a "nickname".</p><p></p><p>"What has happened in these years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually found a place to sit down. In the past hundred years, he has basically been cultivating. Although through the Martial Temple, he learned a lot of information about the spirit realm and the Daode Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>But it definitely isn't as detailed as what Li Qing, a peak Martial Dao Seventh Stage, knows.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun and Shan Yang on the side had their thoughts confused again.</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>Why would Ancestor Li address Lin Yuan as "Master"?</p><p></p><p>Master... In a flash of lightning, a unimaginable thought surfaced in the minds of the two Martial Dao Seventh Stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's master is the legendary Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the little guy in front of them is the Martial Dao pioneer, the Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>But how is that possible?</p><p></p><p>Didn't they say that the Martial Ancestor disappeared long ago?</p><p></p><p>"No need to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Stand up, sit down." Lin Yuan glanced at Li Qing, Nie Yun, and Shan Yang, and said casually.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>An invisible force emerged.</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun and Shan Yang subconsciously sat down.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing also gently sat down on the seat.</p><p></p><p>"This force?" Nie Yun and Shan Yang's scalps went numb.</p><p></p><p>In the face of this invisible force, they had no ability to resist at all, and their proud martial arts qi and blood seemed to have failed.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor." </p><p></p><p>"This is the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Nie Yun and Shan Yang were shocked in their hearts. The feeling Lin Yuan gave them at this moment was far stronger than Cang Qing Immortal of the Moral Immortal Sect, who was only half a step away from the Tribulation Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"You... you finally came back." Li Qing's eyes were moist. For hundreds of thousands of years, she had never stopped looking for Lin Yuan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>But this way of entering the Spirit Realm had great uncertainty. It basically would not descend in the East Cloud Dao State, or even within the scope of the Three Thousand Dao States.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was vast and endless, and the Three Thousand Dao States were only part of the regions, with more being desolate areas.</p><p></p><p>"Master?"</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Li's form of address is Master?"</p><p></p><p>The few Taishang Elders who stood there respectfully were shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already tried their best to overestimate Lin Yuan, they didn't expect Lin Yuan to be the master of the Venerable Li!</p><p></p><p>How is this possible?</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, Chang'er is the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Taishang Great Elder's mind trembled.</p><p></p><p>Although the current scene was extremely unbelievable, how could Lin Chang be related to the Martial Ancestor? But the Venerable Li definitely wouldn't lie.</p><p></p><p>As the legendary personal disciple of the Martial Ancestor, Li Qing must know the Martial Ancestor very well and wouldn't mistake him for someone else.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I actually thought Chang'er was born for martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>The Taishang Great Elder's scalp went numb. Such an evaluation was a heartfelt affirmation and recognition for any martial arts cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It even had the potential to push martial arts to a whole new level.</p><p></p><p>But if the object was the Martial Ancestor, then it was not a compliment, but a blasphemy.</p><p></p><p>Born for martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Absolutely wrong.</p><p></p><p>The entire martial arts originated because of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"I encountered some things that caused me to only come now." Lin Yuan explained his experience of hundreds of thousands of years in just a few words.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing and the other two didn't have too many doubts about this. The Spirit Realm was vast and contained countless mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Even a Tribulation Immortal King, if they entered some kind of trap, might be trapped for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>As for why the Martial Ancestor would return with the identity of Lin Chang, Li Qing also didn't have too many doubts. The True Immortals of the Integrated Dao Realm possessed the means of corpse-resolving reincarnation, which was also one of the most powerful life-saving methods of True Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no matter how many times one reincarnated, the lifespan of the soul would not increase. True Immortals could live carefree for hundreds of thousands of years, but once the limit of the soul's lifespan was reached, no matter how many times one reincarnated, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>To extend the lifespan, one could only attempt to transcend the tribulation and become an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing else matters." Li Qing's tone was joyful. Through these few exchanges, she was already ten thousand percent certain that the Lin Yuan in front of her was her master, the Ancestor of Martial Arts in the Middle Earth Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>This could be judged from the way of speaking and tone. Li Qing rarely revealed things about Lin Yuan to outsiders, and many habits and ways were only known to her.</p><p></p><p>"Master, six thousand years after you disappeared, I entered the sixth stage of martial arts according to the guidance you left behind."</p><p></p><p>"Not long after, I ascended to the Spirit Realm through the ascension platform of the Moral Immortal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Qing began to talk about her experiences over the years.</p><p></p><p>"After ascending to the Spirit Realm, Immortal Cang Qing kept his promise and even specially designated a city as a place to spread martial arts."</p><p></p><p>When Li Qing spoke of Immortal Cang Qing, her tone was still a bit grateful.</p><p></p><p>Without Immortal Cang Qing and the protection of the Moral Immortal Sect in the early stage, it would be difficult for her, a mere sixth-stage martial artist comparable to the Refining Void Realm, to gain a foothold in the Spirit Realm. She would have to join a force and work for them for at least a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely to repay Immortal Cang Qing that Li Qing took the initiative to join the Moral Immortal Sect and fought for them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Moral Immortal Sect would also pay sufficient remuneration. During the battles in the Xuan King Domain and other major domains, Li Qing also grew rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, according to the twelve ways left by Lin Yuan to enter the seventh stage, she chose one and entered the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>After entering the seventh stage, Li Qing had the right to advance and retreat. As an existence comparable to True Immortals, even within the Moral Immortal Sect, she belonged to the absolute upper echelon.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Li Qing led the Xiaoyao City Martial Temple and cooperated with the Moral Immortal Sect in an almost allied manner, continuing to this day.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing fought for the Moral Immortal Sect, while the Moral Immortal Sect protected Xiaoyao City and paid sufficient remuneration. Li Qing's ability to cultivate all the way to the peak of the seventh stage was not unrelated to the Moral Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, among the other disciples, only you entered the seventh stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had accepted hundreds of personal disciples.</p><p></p><p>Among them, several had the potential to enter the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"Only me. Those junior martial brothers and sisters all perished while breaking through to the seventh stage." Li Qing said with a bit of loss in her expression.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the seventh stage was not smooth sailing, especially when Lin Yuan had not thoroughly perfected the seventh stage at that time and only left a speculative situation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to break through relying on his own strong foundation and heaven-defying comprehension. Breaking through to the seventh stage was like eating and drinking for him.</p><p></p><p>But what about others?</p><p></p><p>Li Qing was considered quite lucky.</p><p></p><p>With the support of the Moral Immortal Sect, she finally managed to enter the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even in the main world, cultivators following other evolution paths needed to experience great risks when advancing from the sixth stage to the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>This was still based on having a complete evolution path and the guidance of high-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was even more so in other worlds.</p><p></p><p>"These two are the disciples I value in the Spirit Realm, and they both successfully entered the seventh stage later." Li Qing immediately introduced Nie Yun and Shan Yang.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Shan Yang and Nie Yun looked a bit restrained. From childhood to adulthood, they had heard too many legends about the Martial Ancestor from Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor was almost a myth to them. With his own strength, he opened up the martial arts evolution path, made the Moral Immortal Sect yield, and made Immortal Cang Qing take the initiative to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>It's just that now, the Martial Ancestor they admired and revered in their hearts actually appeared in front of them. The thoughts in their hearts were naturally full of emotion.</p><p></p><p>Especially Shan Yang, who almost fought with the Martial Ancestor just now, felt even more apprehensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't treat these two martial arts juniors any differently. As long as they cultivated martial arts, they could be called his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"What about my elder brother, second sister, and parents?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Li Qing again and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Qing's status in the Moral Immortal Sect was not low. Even if she was not a direct disciple of the sect, she definitely knew the news of Jun Dongjin, Mu Lian'er and others.</p>

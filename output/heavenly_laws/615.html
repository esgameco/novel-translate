        <h1>Chapter 615</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The various Chaos Sovereign Lords were watching intently from afar.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the space-time had completely separated from the Mysterious Yellow Universe, forming its own realm. The nine Chaos Great Saints were likely engaged in an intense battle within.</p><p></p><p>But as they watched, the onlooking Sovereign Lords sensed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>It was too quiet.</p><p></p><p>Too quiet, given the immense powers of the Chaos Great Saints. Normally, even the aftershocks of their clashes would be enough to shatter celestial universes. The earlier battle between the Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint had already caused numerous primordial universes to be thrust into premature destruction, forcing even the Ancient Bright Sovereign Lord to retreat to avoid being gravely injured.</p><p></p><p>And these were just the newly ascended Great Saints. Now there were nine Great Saints present, with three of them being the most formidable Sovereign-level experts. The Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint would be at the bottom of this group in terms of power.</p><p></p><p>Yet, with such a terrifying assembly of powerhouses engaged in battle, there was not a single ripple or disturbance detected from the isolated space-time realm. "Could it be that the nine Great Saints haven't even engaged in combat?"</p><p></p><p>"Not fighting over such a precious treasure? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, that transcendent treasure must be of Supreme Sovereign-level. Even Supreme Sovereigns would be unable to resist the urge to fight for such an item. Let alone these Chaos Great Saints."</p><p></p><p>"If I wouldn't end up dead for trying, I'd even want to vie for it myself."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Sovereign Lords were perplexed. Logically, they were certain the nine Great Saints would clash and fight to the death over the treasure. But the current scene showed no signs of any such confrontation, leaving the Sovereign Lords deeply puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just keep watching."</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Some of the Chaos Sovereign Lords said, since they had no interest in the treasure themselves, they might as well continue observing.</p><p></p><p>What the Sovereign Lords didn't know was that the reason there were no shockwaves or disturbances was that the powers unleashed by the Great Saints had been completely enveloped and contained within Lin Yuan's external universe, preventing any ripples from reaching the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Can't escape?"</p><p></p><p>"The space-time has been sealed off. With my strength, I can't even tear open a passage to the outside world."</p><p></p><p>Tian Luo Great Saint's heart turned cold as he witnessed the scenes of Dual Source Great Saint, Black Brilliance Great Saint, and Fierce Barbarian Great Saint being easily suppressed upon their initial contact with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Tian Luo Great Saint realized that Dual Source Great Saint had been overly confident, or perhaps had underestimated Lin Yuan's true power. To resist now? Survival was already uncertain, let alone fighting back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tian Luo Great Saint began to regret not immediately agreeing to withdraw from the universe when Lin Yuan had suggested it, instead of stubbornly joining forces with Dual Source Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>While dealing with Dual Source Great Saint, Black Brilliance Great Saint, and Fierce Barbarian Great Saint, Lin Yuan also noticed the actions of the other six Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not just Tian Luo Great Saint, but the Phoenix Great Saint, Shadow Demon Great Saint, and others had the immediate thought of fleeing after witnessing how easily the three powerful Chaos Great Saints were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>They acted on this impulse, attempting to escape in different directions.</p><p></p><p>But to their misfortune, the surrounding space-time had already been subsumed by Lin Yuan's external universe.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary Chaos Great Saints were unable to break free from the spatial constraints.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six Chaos Great Saints fleeing in different directions, and with a thought, a massive spatial force surged forth, trapping the six Great Saints in place, like insects encased in amber, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>Tian Luo Great Saint's heart sank to the depths. Although he had realized he would be suppressed once he couldn't tear open a passage to the outside world, the actual moment of being trapped still weighed heavily on him.</p><p></p><p>A mighty Chaos Great Saint, who had roamed countless void domains and never truly feared even powerhouses like Dual Source Great Saint, was now so easily subdued.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not dead."</p><p></p><p>Tian Luo Great Saint carefully probed his surroundings. Although he was completely suppressed, his basic senses were still intact.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Galactic Sovereign has the power to suppress me, he could easily destroy me. But I'm still alive, which means he doesn't intend to kill me? Or perhaps I still have room for negotiation?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Luo Great Saint thought to himself. If there was any chance, he naturally didn't want to abandon this physical body and have to cultivate a new one, which would require a massive expenditure of resources and time.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can deal with those three."</p><p></p><p>With the six ordinary Chaos Great Saints taken care of, Lin Yuan's gaze finally focused on the three Great Saints - Dual Source, Black Brilliance, and Fierce Barbarian.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that the powers of these three Great Saints were truly terrifying. Lin Yuan had to exert a significant portion of his own abilities to swiftly and completely suppress them.</p><p></p><p>"Black Brilliance Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Black Brilliance Great Saint, who was enveloped in endless darkness. The Black Brilliance domain surrounding him was rapidly being compressed and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Tear the Sky."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly raised his right hand and grasped towards the Black Brilliance Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, five streaks of energy imbued with the aura of destruction flashed and struck the Black Brilliance domain.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Black Brilliance domain collapsed, and after the second layer of the "Infinite Void", Lin Yuan's foundational cultivation had risen significantly. The "Tear the Sky" technique, which depended on Lin Yuan's cultivation base, had naturally grown stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle! The Black Brilliance Great Saint's physical body was pierced through by the grasping attack, and the wounds were constantly being eroded by the destructive energy, extinguishing all vitality and recovery power.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint's eyes widened as he felt his own strength suddenly decrease by a significant margin due to the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Grasp again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to unleash the "Tear the Sky" technique.</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint's body was pierced through once more, causing his surrounding Black Brilliance domain to begin collapsing entirely, finally exposing the Great Saint's form.</p><p></p><p>Stripped of the protection of the Black Brilliance domain, the Black Brilliance Great Saint was now at Lin Yuan's mercy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Like undefended fatty meat, it was directly swept and suppressed by the mighty spatial forces.</p><p></p><p>"Savage Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at another Chaotic Great Saint. This Chaotic Great Saint, although his methods were not many, was far less troublesome than the Black Brilliance Great Saint, but it was still not easy to completely subdue him.</p><p></p><p>The flesh body of the Savage Great Saint was too powerful, almost surpassing the former Tao Dragon Great Saint. His methods were few, but his life-saving ability was extremely strong, because he simply could not die.</p><p></p><p>However, under the constant suppression of Lin Yuan's external universe, coupled with the pure offensive divine art 'Tear the Sky', the Savage Great Saint only persisted for dozens of breaths before being quickly subdued by Lin Yuan, just like the Black Brilliance Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Dual Source Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the last Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine Chaotic Great Saints, the Dual Source Great Saint was absolutely the most difficult to deal with, so Lin Yuan left him to the end to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, I admit you are very strong, but to subdue me like you subdued the Black Brilliance and the others? Absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint's expression revealed a touch of madness, and the blue-gray color he had transformed into suddenly boiled up, unleashing a life-or-death strike, instantly tearing open a narrow crack leading to the outside world on the spatial barrier.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Dual Source Great Saint fled through this tiny crack.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched quietly.</p><p></p><p>Although his external universe was terrifying, the Dual Source Great Saint's mastery of the chaotic evolutionary power was best at destroying space-time.</p><p></p><p>To tear open a passage to Lin Yuan's front, it was difficult to do, but in a desperate situation, to tear open a crack to the outside world was still possible.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint fled to the outside world, immediately shuttling back and forth towards the entrance, while his voice spread through the space-time to Lin Yuan: "Silver River Great Saint, I admit defeat this time, I will immediately leave this universe, and will not approach within a million universes, I swear."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan heard this and immediately suppressed the idea of chasing and killing him.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dual Source Great Saint could barely escape, Lin Yuan could still chase and kill him.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, it was for this reason that the Dual Source Great Saint immediately softened and swore an oath after escaping.</p><p></p><p>"Ominous Heavenly Heart?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced back, and the Ominous Heavenly Palace had already emerged. If he went to chase and kill the Dual Source Great Saint, there might be other variables.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there quietly, and with a flip of his right hand, the Savage Great Saint, the Black Brilliance Great Saint, the Heavenly Blessing Great Saint, and the other eight Chaotic Great Saints appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these eight Chaotic Great Saints had been completely subdued and had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint calmed down and said to Lin Yuan with slight reverence, "I don't know what price you are willing to pay to let me go."</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had not immediately annihilated him, he must have other ideas.</p><p></p><p>"What price are you willing to pay?" Lin Yuan looked at the several Chaotic Great Saints, saying with interest.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the best way to maximize his interests was to exchange the main combat bodies of these Chaotic Great Saints for more resources and treasures.</p><p></p><p>Direct killing? He would only be able to harvest the flesh, blood, and essence, but if he exchanged them, he could demand higher conditions.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if he killed these Chaotic Great Saints, they would have life-saving methods to revive, so exchanging them as collateral was what Lin Yuan wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred million Chaotic Stones."</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint thought for a moment and tentatively said.</p><p></p><p>"One billion Chaotic Stones." Lin Yuan shook his head and looked at the Savage Great Saint, "You too, if you want me to let you go, bring one billion Chaotic Stones."</p><p></p><p>"And you," Lin Yuan looked at the Heavenly Blessing Great Saint and the others, "each of you, five hundred million Chaotic Stones."</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred million Chaotic Stones?" The Heavenly Blessing Great Saint's heart trembled, for a Chaotic Great Saint like him, five hundred million Chaotic Stones was a huge sum.</p><p></p><p>"As for you two." Lin Yuan's gaze fell on the Nine Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint." The Nine Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint had already prepared to be slaughtered. Unlike the other veteran Chaotic Great Saints, they each had two or three main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>They, as the newly promoted Chaotic Great Saints, only had one main combat body.</p><p></p><p>Once they lost it, before they could completely recover, they couldn't even show their faces, and had no self-defense ability at all.</p><p></p><p>So as long as Lin Yuan's price was not too outrageous, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint and the Shadow Demon Great Saint were prepared to agree first and then figure it out.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about your grudges, after entering the Chaotic Realm, you've been constantly fighting each other." Lin Yuan looked down at the Nine Phoenix and the Shadow Demon, and said.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, the Shadow Demon..." The Nine Phoenix Great Saint immediately began to explain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and suddenly asked, "Have you ever considered that because of the aftermath of your fighting, it has caused the premature destruction of many universes and their inhabitants?"</p><p></p><p>"The inhabitants of the universes?" </p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix and the Shadow Demon were somewhat stunned, not expecting Lin Yuan to ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>"Those ants, even if they die, so what?" The Shadow Demon Great Saint spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Great Saint did not speak, but he obviously agreed with the Shadow Demon Great Saint's view.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He did not continue.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Demon Great Saint tentatively asked, "Silver River Great Saint, what price do we need to pay."</p><p></p><p>Before the Shadow Demon Great Saint could finish speaking, Lin Yuan swept a glance at him, "Noisy."</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The flesh bodies and souls of the Shadow Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint began to rapidly disintegrate into ash.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>The two Chaotic Great Saints were completely erased.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint... this is..." The Heavenly Blessing Great Saint and the other Chaotic Great Saints saw this scene, their hearts trembling again.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing." Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"These two ants, even if they die, so what?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Please vote for me with monthly votes~You can also participate in the "Black Myth" lottery.</p><p></p><p>Now the monthly votes are few, if you participate, the chance of winning will be very high~</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

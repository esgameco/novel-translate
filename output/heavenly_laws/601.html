        <h1>Chapter 601</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws looked down upon Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilions were scattered across numerous void domains, and each Myriad Dao Pavilion could serve as an 'anchor point'.</p><p></p><p>As long as the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws wished, it could easily transport Lin Yuan from the Myriad Dao Pavilion on the Ancient Chaotic Continent to the Myriad Dao Pavilion in the Yiyun Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>That Mysterious Yellow Universe was right next to the Yiyun Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan arrived at this void domain, he would be very close to the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As long as the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws did not refuse, it would be easy.</p><p></p><p>"What do I need to pay?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws would not help for free.</p><p></p><p>As an ancient existence that had experienced countless universal eras, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws believed in fair trade.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilions also adhered to this principle.</p><p></p><p>To obtain, one must first pay.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about what you should pay," the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws said, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it were other Chaotic Great Saints, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws would definitely charge them a hefty price.</p><p></p><p>After all, currently, the only way to reach the Mysterious Yellow Universe in a short time was to rely on the Myriad Dao Pavilions.</p><p></p><p>Even if the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws demanded a high price, Lin Yuan would have no choice but to accept it.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was not like other Chaotic Great Saints. In the eyes of the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws, Lin Yuan had more hope of breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm than those peerless Great Saints, even if the hope was still very slim.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this transaction with Lin Yuan required a sense of propriety.</p><p></p><p>If the price was too high, it would make Lin Yuan feel unpleasant, which would be counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>If the price was too low, it would not be in line with the principle of fair trade.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws helped Lin Yuan spread various martial dao lineages, it was not a simple act of giving.</p><p></p><p>It had obtained a promise from Lin Yuan. A promise in exchange for the Myriad Dao Pavilions doing their utmost to spread various martial dao lineages? And this promise had no causal constraints.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it seemed that the Myriad Dao Pavilions had made a huge loss, as even the promise of a peerless Great Saint would not be worth what the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had done.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, what the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws wanted was Lin Yuan's promise in the future when he reached the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The promise of a Thirteenth Realm Temporal Life? In simple terms, if Lin Yuan truly became a Thirteenth Realm Temporal Life, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws' early investment would be rewarded a hundredfold, even ten thousandfold.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the act of helping to spread the martial dao lineages was not a loss for the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws, but rather a profit.</p><p></p><p>After all, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws had experienced countless universal eras, and this kind of life with such terrifying potential was the first it had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>"Let's say fifty thousand Chaotic Stones," the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty thousand Chaotic Stones?" Lin Yuan looked at the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a simple matter of reaching the Mysterious Yellow Universe from the Ancient Chaotic Continent, charging fifty thousand Chaotic Stones would be an astronomical price.</p><p></p><p>Although the distance between the two places would take Lin Yuan hundreds of years to cross, ordinary Chaotic Venerable experts would likely take tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years of travel time, equivalent to fifty thousand Chaotic Stones? No Chaotic Venerable would be willing to make such a trade.</p><p></p><p>Fifty thousand Chaotic Stones was a significant amount even for Venerables, while tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years of time was practically nothing in the eyes of Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that during those tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years of travel, Chaotic Venerables could also engage in other activities without any hindrance.</p><p></p><p>However, now that the Mysterious Yellow Universe had already emerged, more and more Venerables and Great Saints were rushing there. In this context, Lin Yuan felt that the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws was being quite "generous" in charging fifty thousand Chaotic Stones.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The many treasures in the inheritance space left behind by Taolong Great Saint had allowed Lin Yuan to accumulate a sizable amount of Chaotic Stones.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and prepare," Lin Yuan said, and his incarnation immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in meditation, pondering the upcoming journey to the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Universe was opened by the Mysterious Emperor. According to the current intelligence, it was gathering numerous Chaotic Venerables, and even Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>If he were to participate in the competition for the Mysterious Yellow Universe, even with the advantages of being a Mysterious Yellow Inheritor and possessing the Beast Skin Map, his strength could not be too weak.</p><p></p><p>At least he should not just send out a single incarnation.</p><p></p><p>Incarnations too greatly limited the display of his true power. Lin Yuan's incarnation could at most reach the level of a Chaotic Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send my true body and leave behind a soul projection," Lin Yuan thought to himself. Undoubtedly, his true body would have the strongest combat power.</p><p></p><p>And by leaving behind a soul projection in the Fragment World, he could ensure the safety of the human civilization homeland as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with a soul projection left behind, even if Lin Yuan's true body encountered any accidents in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he could quickly recover.</p><p></p><p>As for relying on life-saving methods to "revive"? That would take too much time. Lin Yuan's true body and soul projection had a three-in-one relationship. As long as one of them existed, the other two could quickly coalesce, even if they were completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Using life-saving methods to "revive" would not allow for such rapid coalescing.</p><p></p><p>"As for weapons and armaments, three Chaotic Realm-level secret treasures should be enough," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>His main strengths lay in his physical body and the universe within him, with an absolute foundation and profundity to overwhelm his opponents.</p><p></p><p>Preparations complete.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan summoned the Xuan-Yuan Strongest Ones, such as Xuan-Yuan Strongest One and Xia Qin Strongest One.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, what's the matter?" Xuan-Yuan Strongest One and Xia Qin Strongest One looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go out with my true body for a while, so please pay attention during this time," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although he would leave behind a soul projection, its combat power was far inferior to his true body. If it offended enemies at the Great Saint level, the soul projection alone might not be able to withstand them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Great Saints were such existences. Even if the human civilization wanted to offend them, they did not have the qualifications, as they could not even make contact with them.</p><p></p><p>But it was never wrong to consider the worst-case scenario. After all, during Lin Yuan's true body's absence, the human civilization group would be in a relatively weakened state.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Xuan-Yuan Strongest One and Xia Qin Strongest One did not ask why Lin Yuan's true body was leaving, and simply agreed.</p><p></p><p>After selecting the Chaotic Realm secret treasures he would bring, Lin Yuan's true body silently disappeared from the Star Tear 'Fragment World'.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Myriad Dao Pavilions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had approached the Myriad Dao Pavilions with his true body.</p><p></p><p>Previously, his communications with the Myriad Dao Pavilions had all been through casually conjured incarnations.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Lin Yuan stepped into the Myriad Dao Pavilions.</p><p></p><p>He instantly appeared in the deepest space.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws seemed to have never left, waiting there all along.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws looked at Lin Yuan for a moment, a hint of surprise flashing across its expression.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you dare to compete for the Mysterious Yellow Universe," the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws said, its gaze slightly awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Even with just a casual observation, it could vaguely sense the majestic foundation and profundity within Lin Yuan, which even ordinary Chaotic Great Saints could not match.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>"If the Mastery Realm is like this, then when he breaks through to the Chaotic Realm and reaches Chaotic Realm perfection, won't he be an invincible Great Saint?" the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws thought to itself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws' investment in Lin Yuan carried certain risks, such as if Lin Yuan failed to break through to the Thirteenth Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>A mere Great Saint, even if a peerless one, was not worth the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws going to such lengths.</p><p></p><p>But if he became an invincible Great Saint? A Great Saint without rivals, capable of sweeping away his contemporaries, would be worth the All-Seeing Eye of the Myriad Laws' efforts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Other Peerless Great Saints. Even the mighty Xuan Emperor in the past could not be considered an Invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Normally, in a single era of the Chaotic Void, there would be at most only one Invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most of the time there are no Invincible Great Saints. Among the Peerless Great Saints, their combat power has already reached the limit, and none of them have the ability to overwhelm the others.</p><p></p><p>To give birth to an Invincible Great Saint? It's too difficult.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in the eyes of the Myriad Laws, Lin Yuan's future is either a Thirteenth-Tier Time Life, or an Invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>An Invincible Great Saint's promise is not a loss for the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my eyesight is still quite accurate," the Myriad Laws said with a good mood.</p><p></p><p>"When will the transfer be?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, let's start now," the Myriad Laws smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws seemed to have thought of something and reminded, "This appearance of the Mysterious Yellow Universe has attracted many Great Saints. Several Great Saints have come to me, hoping that I can send them to the vicinity of the Mysterious Yellow Universe."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws' abilities and methods were not a secret among the Great Saint realm. Many Chaotic Great Saints were too far away to reach the Mysterious Yellow Universe, so they would seek help from the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had already prepared for the worst when his true self went forward, and he had long anticipated such situations.</p><p></p><p>"Now, don't resist," the Myriad Laws looked down at Lin Yuan, and the spatial fluctuations around them began to intensify.</p><p></p><p>In the Qinglan Void Domain, on one of the Chaotic continents, in the Myriad Dao Pavilion, a figure coalesced and strode in.</p><p></p><p>The figure was tall and burly, emanating a wild and unconstrained aura. After entering the Myriad Dao Pavilion, it directly appeared in the innermost space.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Savage Great Saint," the Pavilion Master of this Myriad Dao Pavilion, who had been waiting for a long time, slightly bowed to the tall figure, showing respect.</p><p></p><p>"I'm looking for the Myriad Laws," the Savage Great Saint said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Pavilion Master immediately began to contact the Myriad Laws.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the space began to slowly rotate, and a giant eyeball coalesced, looking down at the Savage Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Savage, what do you want from me?" the Myriad Laws spoke in a flat tone, without any fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go to this spatial coordinate location," the Savage Great Saint went straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>"You also want to go to that Mysterious Yellow Universe?" the Myriad Laws looked at the Savage Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I once saw a record of a Peerless Great Saint's description in a dilapidated relic. The Posterior Heaven Universe he opened up is very valuable," the Savage Great Saint said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he still wanted to keep this information about the Posterior Heaven Universe a secret, but the Myriad Laws directly mentioned the name of the Posterior Heaven Universe, so the Savage Great Saint no longer hid it.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the Myriad Laws nodded. "But you know, I've always liked fair trades."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, tell me," the Savage Great Saint nodded.</p><p></p><p>"One billion Chaotic Stones, or ten Saint-tier weapon treasures," the Myriad Laws quoted the price.</p><p></p><p>"One billion Chaotic Stones?" the Savage Great Saint's eye twitched.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had prepared to be slaughtered by the Myriad Laws, hearing the price still made his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>One billion Chaotic Stones? Even for a Chaotic Great Saint, one billion Chaotic Stones was a staggering amount. As for ten Saint-tier weapon treasures, it was even more so.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the Qinglan Void Domain and that Mysterious Yellow Universe would require the Savage Great Saint to travel for decades.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't afraid of being too late, the Savage Great Saint would have just rushed there by himself.</p><p></p><p>But now, just for a single transfer, it would cost him one billion Chaotic Stones?</p><p></p><p>"If you're not willing, then forget it," the Myriad Laws immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing, I'm definitely willing," the Savage Great Saint took a deep breath and looked at the Myriad Laws. "But can you make it a little cheaper? I don't have that many Chaotic Stones on me right now."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you have?" the Myriad Laws directly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Three billion Chaotic Stones, and two Saint-tier weapons," the Savage Great Saint said. "But I can't give you those two Saint-tier weapons, or else my combat power will decline. Even if I go to the Mysterious Yellow Universe, I won't be able to obtain anything good."</p><p></p><p>"Three billion Chaotic Stones is not enough," the Myriad Laws said.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Savage Great Saint and the Myriad Laws reached a deal, exchanging three billion Chaotic Stones and a third of the harvest from the Mysterious Yellow Universe, for the Myriad Laws to transport him to the vicinity of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't do anything, yet you're taking a third of the harvest?" the Savage Great Saint said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"You can also choose to give one billion Chaotic Stones," the Myriad Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it then," the Savage Great Saint shook his head. Although he was certain that the value of the Mysterious Yellow Universe was great, he couldn't guarantee that his one-third harvest would exceed seven billion Chaotic Stones.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint's main goal was the same as Xuan Emperor's exploration and understanding of the Thirteenth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>In a certain mysterious place in the Chaotic Void, in front of an ancient and dilapidated altar, a Chaotic Great Saint with double horns on his head appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Great Altar Spirit, I want to go to this spatial coordinate location in the shortest time possible," the double-horned Great Saint said.</p><p></p><p>The ancient and dilapidated altar trembled slightly, and a voice sounded in the double-horned Great Saint's ear.</p><p></p><p>"I want six-tenths of your harvest from this trip."</p><p></p><p>"Six-tenths of the harvest?" the double-horned Great Saint fell silent. To divide the hard-earned harvest from life-and-death battles with other Great Saints and give six-tenths to the altar? The double-horned Great Saint knew the altar's formidable methods, and once the terms were set, they would not change.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hide it even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Then tell me, which Peerless Great Saint left behind that Posterior Heaven Universe?" the double-horned Great Saint was unwilling to make a fruitless trip, only to end up 'working' for the altar in the end, so he wanted to find out the origin of that Posterior Heaven Universe first.</p><p></p><p>If it was just an ordinary Peerless Great Saint, then he didn't need to pay such a high price to go there.</p><p></p><p>Compared to fighting with other Great Saints, he would also suffer losses. If the four-tenths of the harvest he obtained couldn't even cover the losses, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"That Universe is called the Mysterious Yellow Universe, and it was left behind by the Great Saint Xuan Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint Xuan Emperor is one of the Peerless Great Saints closest to becoming an Invincible Great Saint in that era."</p><p></p><p>The ancient and dilapidated altar's voice sounded in the double-horned Great Saint's ear.</p><p></p><p>"One of the Peerless Great Saints closest to becoming an Invincible Great Saint?" the double-horned Great Saint's expression changed slightly. Invincible Great Saints only existed in legends.</p><p></p><p>To become an Invincible Great Saint, the first thing to do was to overwhelm all the Peerless Great Saints of that era. And to be recognized by all the Peerless Great Saints of that time, the requirements for strength were terrifying. It was not enough to just defeat a certain Peerless Great Saint to gain their recognition.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's six-tenths of the harvest," the double-horned Great Saint said.</p><p></p><p>The Posterior Heaven Universe opened up by a Peerless Great Saint close to becoming an Invincible Great Saint was worth him paying such a price to go there.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

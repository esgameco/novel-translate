            <p>Chapter 274: Salah: Our Chance Has Come! (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The moment the three goddesses completed their evaluation of the Martial Dao Eighth Stage Treatise, the real-time rankings of the Martial Dao Evolution Path would be "updated".</p><p></p><p>Of course, only Lin Yuan could access this update. As for outsiders, they would have to wait until the daily update of all evolution rankings at midnight to see it.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Evolution Path ranked first in the Chi Kun Star Domain." Lin Yuan glanced at the ranking on the Chi Kun Evolution Leaderboard without much surprise.</p><p></p><p>When the Martial Dao Evolution Path was still at the seventh stage, it had already surpassed the two major eighth-stage evolution paths and ranked second on the Chi Kun Evolution Leaderboard.</p><p></p><p>Now that the eighth-stage treatise had been uploaded and the evaluation had greatly improved, it was only natural for it to leap to the top of the Chi Kun Evolution Leaderboard.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It's also ranked first on the An Nan Evolution Leaderboard?" Lin Yuan scanned the rankings at higher levels.</p><p></p><p>The An Nan Evolution Leaderboard was the evolution leaderboard of the An Nan Star Alliance, recording the top 100 strongest evolution paths that had emerged within a star alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Chi Kun Star Domain belonged to the An Nan Star Alliance, which encompassed hundreds to thousands of star domains.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered that when the Martial Dao Evolution Path was still at the seventh stage, its ranking on the An Nan Evolution Leaderboard was exactly at the 100th place.</p><p></p><p>The top 100 strongest evolution paths recorded by the An Nan Star Alliance included five ninth-stage evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Martial Dao Evolution Path still forcefully became the top of its evolution leaderboard, showing the importance placed on it by the three goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"This exposure will definitely lead to a surge in the number of cultivators following the Martial Dao Evolution Path." Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>The evolution leaderboards of various star domains and star alliances not only affirmed the evolution paths recorded on them but also served as a great way of exposure.</p><p></p><p>No matter which public virtual world, the central plaza area was always at the core position.</p><p></p><p>And the evolution leaderboards were even more so, located at the very heart of the central plaza area.</p><p></p><p>As long as they were cultivators, when entering the virtual world for the first time, they would almost be semi-forced to view the evolution paths on the leaderboards.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the Southern Star Region Evolution Leaderboard... hmm... it hasn't entered the top 100." Lin Yuan continued looking upward and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Star Region was one of the five major star regions of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Southern Star Region, there were also the Eastern Star Region, Western Star Region, Northern Star Region, and Central Star Region.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the territory of human civilization was basically composed of these five major star regions.</p><p></p><p>Among the five star regions, even the smallest Central Star Region included nearly 100,000 star alliances.</p><p></p><p>As for the other four star regions, they were constantly expanding. The largest star region already had more than 200,000 star alliances.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Domain where Lin Yuan was currently located, as well as the previous Chi Kun Star Domain and An Nan Star Alliance, all belonged to the Southern Star Region.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Star Region currently had 180,000 star alliances, and the competition on its star region-level evolution leaderboard was extremely fierce. At least for now, the Martial Dao Evolution Path couldn't enter the top 100.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. No matter how great the potential of the Martial Dao Evolution Path is, it's currently only an eighth-stage evolution path. Surpassing some ninth-stage evolution paths is already exaggerated enough. How could it possibly compare to those evolution paths recorded on the star region-level leaderboard?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never underestimated the geniuses in the history of human civilization. Many geniuses didn't grow to the end due to various accidents, but that didn't mean the path they took was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom Goddess."</p><p></p><p>"I should be an Evolution Grand Scholar now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly asked. Becoming an Evolution Grand Scholar had many restrictive conditions, the most difficult of which was to open up a stable and brand-new eighth-stage evolution path.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan had already achieved this.</p><p></p><p>"Determining the qualification of the Galaxy Star Lord... Congratulations to the Galaxy Star Lord for becoming a new Evolution Grand Scholar of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Wisdom Goddess sounded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, numerous emails from the Central Star Domain were sent to Lin Yuan's mailbox.</p><p></p><p>The Central Star Domain was the most core star domain in the central star region of human civilization. It was the old nest of human civilization, and countless important resources were gathered there.</p><p></p><p>Every citizen who could reside in the Central Star Domain for a long time had a great background and origin.</p><p></p><p>Many eighth-stage cultivators yearned to serve as an administrator on an ordinary planet in the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>But it was often difficult to achieve. Even the most ordinary living planet in the Central Star Domain had immeasurable value.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the numerous emails.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the promotion of citizen rank, these emails were basically explanations and descriptions of the identity of an Evolution Grand Scholar.</p><p></p><p>First of all, any Evolution Grand Scholar automatically owned a research planet in the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>This research planet completely belonged to the Evolution Grand Scholar and was used to develop their own achievements.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the value of being able to become a research planet far exceeded that of an ordinary living planet, and even some star system main stars couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>Just this research planet alone was priceless, and even tens of millions of cosmic crystals couldn't measure its value.</p><p></p><p>Some ninth-stage cultivators didn't even have the power to own a research planet.</p><p></p><p>What was mentioned here was not cosmic crystals, but power. In the Central Star Domain, wanting to become the lord of a planet was not a matter of cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the ability to mobilize the numerous secret data collected by human civilization, as well as joining the Academy of Sciences and the Evolution Academy."</p><p></p><p>In summary, it was a treasure.</p><p></p><p>A treasure of the Human Alliance.</p><p></p><p>For the entire human civilization, even the death of an ordinary citizen in a star domain was less heartbreaking than the death of an Evolution Grand Scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Grand Scholar Lin Yuan, with your current identity, you can apply to actively leave the Galaxy Star Domain and go to a safer inner region of human territory."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess took the initiative to remind.</p><p></p><p>"Leave now?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He had already made many investments in the Galaxy Star Domain, such as the transformation of a B-grade planet worth 100,000 cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan refused.</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess suggested that he go to the inner region of human territory, simply out of concern for safety issues.</p><p></p><p>But safety issues?</p><p></p><p>If it were before the eighth crossing, Lin Yuan indeed had this concern.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who had comprehended dozens of cosmic forces, could crush those eighth-stage invincibles even if his inner world had not yet recovered to its peak.</p><p></p><p>Even without recovering all his strength, Lin Yuan could last a few moves against ninth-stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>There was no safety issue at all.</p><p></p><p>It was the alien races that should be worried and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Grand Scholar Lin Yuan, before your identity as a grand scholar is exposed, you can still hold the fort in the Galaxy Star Domain. If your identity as a grand scholar is exposed, please go to the inner region of human territory."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess fell silent for a moment before giving a reply.</p><p></p><p>The talent and aptitude Lin Yuan had displayed could be considered top-notch among human civilization. Even if it attracted the attention of alien races, they wouldn't overturn the table and take action against</p><p></p><p>The excerpt is incomplete and ends abruptly, but here is the translation of the provided text:</p><p></p><p>However, if the identity of an Evolution University scholar is exposed, it is very likely that the alien races will actively break the tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>A top-level human civilization prodigy may not attract the attention of the apex races, and an Evolution University scholar may also find it difficult to cause the apex races to go all out against them. But when the two are combined together...</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the central plaza area, many evolvers were talking in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"It's been almost twenty years, and the eighth stage chapter of the Martial Dao Evolution Path hasn't come out yet?"</p><p></p><p>An evolver spoke up. Currently, on the Chi Kun Evolution Ranking, the Martial Dao Evolution Path still occupied the second place, showing no signs of being shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth stage chapter?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the eighth stage chapter that easy to produce?"</p><p></p><p>A green-eyed evolver beside him snorted. Even for the high and mighty Evolution University scholars, it was not an easy task to develop a complete eighth stage evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would there be so few eighth stage evolution paths in human civilization?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the eighth stage chapter of the Martial Dao Evolution Path was far from being as simple as an ordinary eighth stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>Based on the potential ranking exhibited by the Martial Dao Evolution Path, the difficulty of developing an eighth stage chapter matching it was countless times harder than other eighth stage chapters.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that even if the Martial Dao Founder can develop the eighth stage chapter, it will take hundreds or even thousands of years or more."</p><p></p><p>This green-eyed evolver had another thought in his mind that he didn't say - it might be impossible to develop the eighth stage chapter of the Martial Dao at all.</p><p></p><p>"I don't care."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Founder will definitely be able to develop the eighth stage chapter."</p><p></p><p>Many of Lin Yuan's "fans" immediately expressed their views.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Evolution Path was so popular that it naturally accumulated a large number of enthusiasts, and even its founder Lin Yuan had many "fans".</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>The green-eyed evolver couldn't be bothered to argue.</p><p></p><p>This was not just his opinion, but the perception of many high-level evolvers and high-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>It was easy for the Martial Dao Founder to develop stages one to seven, but to develop an eighth stage chapter matching the previous seven stages, one could only say there was hope.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly--</p><p></p><p>Time arrived at midnight.</p><p></p><p>The Chi Kun Evolution Ranking began to "refresh".</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>The green-eyed evolver also looked over. When he saw the name at the top of the evolution ranking, he was instantly a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Evolution Path is first?" The green-eyed evolver's heart trembled a little. Although the ranking didn't improve much, only by one place.</p><p></p><p>But that was the top.</p><p></p><p>And it could also indicate something even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>That was, the Martial Dao Evolution Path had been updated and the eighth stage chapter had been uploaded.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a previous instance where the Martial Dao Evolution Path had a significant increase in ranking without uploading a new stage chapter...</p><p></p><p>But that possibility was slim.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the green-eyed evolver immediately clicked on the detailed page of the Martial Dao Evolution Path and immediately discovered the three characters "Eighth Stage Chapter" appearing after the seventh stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>"It really developed the eighth stage chapter?"</p><p></p><p>The green-eyed evolver felt as if he was dreaming. Did he personally witness the birth of an eighth stage evolution path?</p><p></p><p>And it was the extremely monstrous Martial Dao Evolution Path?</p><p></p><p>"Take a look at the ranking of the Annan Star Alliance's evolution ranking." Just the ranking on the Chi Kun Star Domain's evolution ranking couldn't indicate whether the eighth stage chapter of the Martial Dao matched the previous stages one to seven.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the original Martial Dao Evolution Path with only seven stages, it was already close to the upper limit of the Chi Kun Evolution Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial Dao Evolution Path that had advanced to the eighth stage only improved a little, it could still become the top of the Chi Kun Evolution Ranking.</p><p></p><p>This was not the credit of the eighth stage chapter of the Martial Dao, but because the previous stages one to seven were too heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>"Annan Star Alliance Evolution Ranking." The green-eyed evolver was about to look from the bottom up.</p><p></p><p>Because he remembered that the previous ranking of the Martial Dao Evolution Path on the Annan Star Alliance Evolution Ranking was the hundredth place.</p><p></p><p>Even if it improved, it was unlikely to reach the top fifty.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Just as the green-eyed evolver's gaze swept down from the top of the ranking...</p><p></p><p>He was instantly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because the name currently at the top of the Annan Star Alliance Evolution Ranking...</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Evolution Path has topped the Annan Evolution Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>The green-eyed evolver swallowed, his mind a mess.</p><p></p><p>A fleet was rapidly traveling through a wormhole.</p><p></p><p>"The target of this mission is the main star of the Galaxy Star Domain."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan was responsible for adjusting the fleet's position to ensure the correct direction.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, so many Taiwei Clear Crystals nearly emptied our group's inventory. Was it that Galaxy Star Lord who bought them?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy captain beside him asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>A full 800,000 cubic universe crystals of Taiwei Clear Crystals, even when loaded with spatial equipment, filled up nearly half of the fleet.</p><p></p><p>Taiwei Clear Crystals contained pure energy, but their unit price was not high. 800,000 cubic universe crystals of Taiwei Clear Crystals... piled together, they were probably as large as hundreds of planets.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan's expression was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>The fleet members were all speculating that it was the Galaxy Star Lord's doing. After all, in the entire Galaxy Main Star, apart from that Galaxy Star Lord with a sky-high background and immense wealth, who had the ability to purchase so many Taiwei Clear Crystals?</p><p></p><p>800,000 cubic universe crystals... that was such a vast amount of wealth that many eighth stage evolvers couldn't earn in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is such an existence. What he buys, is it something you can discuss?"</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan still glanced at the deputy captain and warned, "Our group's most important task now is to deliver this batch of Taiwei Clear Crystals to the Galaxy Main Star. As for who it's being delivered to, it's not something you can ask about."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>The deputy captain immediately responded, feeling a bit of lingering fear in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the fleet was monitored by the Intelligent Goddess. If they rashly discussed the Galaxy Star Lord and it was recorded by the Goddess, they would definitely not be able to get away with it.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan performed the final wormhole jump and arrived outside the Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiwei Clear Crystals have been delivered?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his head and looked at the fleet parked outside the main star.</p><p></p><p>"One ship at a time, too slow. I'll go get them directly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared and reappeared outside the Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Captain Nolan naturally knew who the purchaser of this batch of Taiwei Clear Crystals was. Seeing Lin Yuan, he immediately stepped forward respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan's figure appeared outside the Galaxy Main Star...</p><p></p><p>The five eighth stage invincibles hidden deep within layers of space instantly had their eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>They had been lurking for more than ten years, just waiting for this moment - waiting for the Galaxy Star Lord to leave the main star, waiting for the Galaxy Star Lord to lose the protection of the main star.</p><p></p><p>Without the planetary defense system on the main star, the Galaxy Star Lord, this newly advanced eighth stage evolver, was like a harmless little white rabbit in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Our chance has come."</p><p></p><p>"Take action immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Sala of the leading Dark Scaled Race was in high spirits and took the initiative to leave the space layer.</p><p></p><p>The other four eighth stage invincibles did the same, charging towards Lin Yuan in excitement.</p>

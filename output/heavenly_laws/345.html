        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 345: The Surprise of the Supremely Powerful (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The perfect, profound purple liquid made Lin Yuan feel somewhat entranced. üç™üòù‚ûÖ‚ûà‚ìàƒ§ùïå‚ìß.¬¢ùê®ùî™‚òÆ‚ôú</p><p></p><p>He tried to observe it carefully, using his transcendent comprehension to perceive its essence. </p><p></p><p>But after watching for a long time, there was no effect.</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities for why his transcendent comprehension could not gain any insight:</p><p></p><p>One, the purple liquid did not contain anything worth comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Two, the essence contained within the purple liquid was too profound, beyond the ability of Lin Yuan's current ninth-level transcendent comprehension to discern.</p><p></p><p>The first possibility was obviously illogical - how could something that allowed Lin Yuan's inner world to break through its shackles and limits not contain anything worth comprehending?</p><p></p><p>"I'm already at the ninth level, yet I still can't comprehend it at all. The origins of this mysterious gourd must be far greater than I imagined," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he couldn't comprehend it, just that he couldn't comprehend it at all.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't comprehend it, at least he could comprehend the act of comprehending, just not penetrate it fully.</p><p></p><p>But being unable to comprehend it at all meant he couldn't even get through the door.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"Since the gourd is in my hands, it belongs to me."</p><p></p><p>"There will eventually come a day when I figure it out."</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't comprehend it at the ninth level, Lin Yuan didn't believe he still wouldn't be able to comprehend it when he reached the tenth or eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>And even if he truly couldn't comprehend it by then, Lin Yuan should be happy instead, as it would mean the mysterious origins of the gourd were even more inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue."</p><p></p><p>"If I wait any longer, I feel this drop of liquid will dissipate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the purple liquid.</p><p></p><p>Ever since this drop of liquid had condensed from the gourd's mouth, Lin Yuan had felt a pressure from the universe trying to erase the purple liquid's existence.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because my inner world will break through the two billion li sphere due to the purple liquid?" Lin Yuan guessed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>An inner world of one billion li was the limit for all life in the universe, including special lifeforms. Lin Yuan had easily surpassed that, already breaking a certain rule.</p><p></p><p>And two billion li? That was the limit of limits.</p><p></p><p>The seven liquids in the mysterious gourd - red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple - looked about the same at first glance, but each subsequent drop was certainly rarer and more precious than the one before.</p><p></p><p>The blue liquid allowed Lin Yuan's inner world to expand from 1.665 billion li to 1.998 billion li.</p><p></p><p>While the purple liquid could expand his inner world from 1.998 billion li to 2.331 billion li.</p><p></p><p>The increase seemed the same at 3.33 times for both.</p><p></p><p>But taking that last step at the hundred-foot pole is incomparable to the blue liquid.</p><p></p><p>It's like civilizations that haven't yet reached the stars - their top athletes may run 100 meters in 9 seconds.</p><p></p><p>But the difficulty in going from 9 seconds to 8, or from 8 to 7, doesn't increase linearly but exponentially.</p><p></p><p>The growth of the inner world follows the same principle.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swallowed the purple liquid in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying purple flames instantly ignited within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>These flames were not a normal attack, so his elemental body was useless. His physical immortal techniques like Dripping Blood Rebirth immediately collapsed. Lin Yuan's body swiftly turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical form re-condensed, a trace of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing this purple liquid is much harder than the previous six drops," Lin Yuan steadied himself and thought.</p><p></p><p>Usually when absorbing the newest liquid, it would be relatively smooth. But the purple liquid? It felt extremely arduous from the very start for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the mysterious gourd again. Its surface color had now turned to a mottled grayish-purple, both dull and dazzling.</p><p></p><p>On the alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Below an immense permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's yin spirit sat cross-legged in meditation, occasionally with other powerful experts passing by, yet none of them able to detect him.</p><p></p><p>To absorb the leaking dimensional force from the permanent spatial rift, one didn't need to be in the main space - being within the nested spatial layers worked just as well.</p><p></p><p>This permanent spatial rift was created by attacks from supremely powerful beings, tearing through countless spatial layers. No matter which nested layer Lin Yuan occupied, he could still absorb the dimensional force.</p><p></p><p>"I've now accumulated 148 strands of dimensional force," Lin Yuan's face showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Before his ninth spatial crossing, Lin Yuan had 120 strands of dimensional force. The ninth crossing consumed 10 strands, leaving 110.</p><p></p><p>From the end of the ninth crossing until now over 10 years had passed, accumulating another 38 strands.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>Constantly tearing at the root of space to a certain degree would eventually lead to the destruction of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main universe possessed an innate will that would not allow supremely powerful beings to do this. Within a certain range of creating permanent spatial rifts, the universe's will would not react.</p><p></p><p>But if those supremely powerful dared to do this on a large scale, they would definitely face interference from the universe's will.</p><p></p><p>"However, once I cross into the tenth level, I can choose to go to a major alien battlefield to absorb the dimensional force from the spatial rifts there," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the permanent spatial rifts in the medium and small alien battlefields were created long ago by some evolutionary wielding a supremely powerful weapon,</p><p></p><p>Then the spatial rifts at the major battlefields were from direct clashes between supremely powerful beings themselves.</p><p></p><p>The major battlefields were where the apex factions vied against each other, with supremely powerful beings facing off. It was the place with the highest concentration of powerful experts from the myriad races of the universe. Even ninth and tenth level experts, normally extremely rare, would gather there.</p><p></p><p>Eleventh level experts would occasionally appear as well.</p><p></p><p>But unless absolutely necessary, eleventh level experts would not attack each other, and clashes between supremely powerful beings happened only once every tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The most recent clash between supremely powerful beings was still tens of years ago - that supremely powerful corpse from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>"After I reach the tenth level, even at the major battlefields I'll have the power to protect myself," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>If he was only at the ninth level, it would still be somewhat risky. Certain special eleventh level experts could easily employ spirit-killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>But at the tenth level, he would be much safer. According to the principle of needing at least a two-realm gap to spirit-kill, only supremely powerful beings could spirit-kill a tenth level life.</p><p></p><p>And if alien supremely powerful beings attacked, the human civilization's supremely powerful would also act.</p><p></p><p>With that balance, at most Lin Yuan would lose one spirit body, with no impact on his main self.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how much the permanent spatial rifts at the major alien battlefields could increase my accumulation rate of dimensional force?" Lin Yuan felt some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan met with Duo Ke and other special ninth level experts.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, some ninth level aliens driven into the inner region are willing to pay all their gains from this secret realm as the price, just to let their spirit bodies leave the secret realm," Duo Ke said.</p><p></p><p>These ninth level aliens had ended up on the human civilization's extermination list due to being dragged down by their apex factions.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the situation in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm having become completely clear under the Galactic Sovereign's suppression, those ninth level aliens had no chance at all.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, a few of the ninth level aliens naturally wanted to surrender to the human civilization, at least to let their spirit bodies survive and leave.</p><p></p><p>For many races, ninth level experts were like pillars propping up the heavens. Losing one spirit body of a ninth level expert would definitely have a major impact on that race.</p><p></p><p>"Since they chose to ally with the Insect Race and Feather Race, they should have known the consequences," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Pay with all their gains from this secret realm journey?</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't pay, once the secret realm closed, it would all belong to Lin Yuan anyway.</p><p></p><p>He could even obtain their physical essence blood - the essence blood of ninth level experts was already comparable to many universal treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Good," Duo Ke's expression turned vibrant.</p><p></p><p>This was the Galactic Sovereign, the most powerful genius the human civilization had ever produced.</p><p></p><p>Showing no compromise at all towards the aliens, willing to forsake any gains just to make them suffer.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Sovereign Planet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped absorbing the purple liquid from the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that his physical body constantly turning to ash was a form of damage to himself.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the liquid in the mysterious gourd was not infinite, only condensing a new drop periodically.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the Path of Xuan-Huang Evolution"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then comprehended the path of Xuan-Huang evolution.</p><p></p><p>The Yang celestial spirit located in the Xuan-Huang secret realm cultivated the 'Xuan-Huang One Strike' and the 'Xuan-Huang Body'.</p><p></p><p>The Yin celestial spirit located on the alien battlefield comprehended the laws of time, cultivating the 'Steps of Space-Time'. </p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, his true self located on the main galactic star comprehended various paths of evolution, while comparing the Chaos Crystal and miniature universe against himself for mutual verification.</p><p></p><p>The three main celestial spirits each had their own focus areas.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan-Huang path of evolution is truly wondrous. The tenth and eleventh levels are completely different from the nine supreme evolutionary paths of current human civilization."</p><p></p><p>And the comprehension of the 'Steps of Space-Time' helped promote the understanding of the laws of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Various insights intertwined and converged, propelled by Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension ability, advancing him at an unimaginable speed.</p><p></p><p>"From the ninth to the tenth level is a slow metamorphosis process that cannot be rushed," Lin Yuan noted while comprehending, paying attention to his own metamorphic state.  </p><p></p><p>A ninth-level expert had at least opened a million spatial layers. For so many layers to metamorphose together, it was not something that could be done in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"With my current state, once the metamorphosis begins, it will probably take a hundred years to complete," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Other ninth-level experts who wanted to break through to the tenth level were extremely cautious during the metamorphosis period, closely monitoring the changes within their inner worlds and the transformations of the myriad spatial layers, occasionally making adjustments.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not need to pay attention to any of that. With the vastness of his inner world and the profound depth of his spatial layers reaching a certain level, so-called metamorphosis would occur naturally.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years..." Lin Yuan's expression was slightly pensive.</p><p></p><p>The total time he had spent in the main universe was just over a hundred years. Now, a single metamorphic breakthrough would take a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"I won't be dimension traveling during this hundred years," Lin Yuan decided inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At his current level, blind dimension traveling was not very useful. It was better to first reach the tenth level before considering specific traveling methods.</p><p></p><p>He could take this opportunity over the next hundred years to accumulate a large amount of Realm-Crossing Source Power. Lin Yuan was quite curious about the various dimension traveling methods of the Myriad Realms Gate, especially the "custom" traveling.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient Realm-Crossing Source Power, Lin Yuan would not mind attempting a "custom" dimension travel.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was that it had to provide tremendous assistance to himself, at least help that could not be obtained in the main world.</p><p></p><p>After all, a "custom" dimension travel required a starting cost of a hundred strands of Realm-Crossing Source Power. With such a huge price, Lin Yuan would not consider it unless he saw immense benefits.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth level of the Xuan-Huang evolutionary path mainly expounds on the essence of the 'laws of time'."</p><p></p><p>"Similarly, the tenth level of the Xia You evolutionary path also expounds on the essence of the 'laws of time'."</p><p></p><p>"Yet what they expound on the essence of time is completely different."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Xia You evolutionary path was one of the nine supreme evolutionary paths of human civilization, with the ultimate existence being the Xia Qin supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current wealth, even without counting his gains from the Xuan-Huang secret realm, he could purchase all nine of humanity's supreme evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the main use of these supreme evolutionary paths was for reference and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend their understanding of the essence of laws, and then integrate it into his own martial path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was calm as he took out the "miniature universe" to experience the complete operation of the laws of time within.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I have comprehended one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three models of the laws of time, yet my understanding of time itself has become increasingly perplexing."</p><p></p><p>A sense of contemplation appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>If he had not yet entered the realm of the laws of time, he would have thought the laws of time were just like that.</p><p></p><p>But as his comprehension of the laws of time deepened, he became more aware of his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the vast and eternal river of time, what was he? Even as powerful as an eleventh-level life form, he could only be considered a slightly bigger fish.</p><p></p><p>Only supreme existences could truly transcend the river of time and exist eternally.</p><p></p><p>"The one thousand eight hundred and twenty-third model of time is still far from fully comprehending the complete laws of time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the evolutionary scholars of human civilization had summarized a total of two thousand one hundred and seventy-three models of time.</p><p></p><p>But comprehending all two thousand one hundred and seventy-three models did not mean fully comprehending the complete laws of time.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the laws of space, where the countless evolutionary scholars of human civilization had already gained a relatively mature understanding, comprehending all the core models of space meant comprehending the complete laws of space.</p><p></p><p>But the laws of time? Even if one comprehended all the currently known models of time, one still could not fully comprehend the complete laws of time.</p><p></p><p>To fully comprehend the complete laws of time, one could only rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many models of time there were, they could only serve as aids. The final step had to be crossed by oneself.</p><p></p><p>"In comprehending the laws of time, I have finally hit a bottleneck," Lin Yuan stopped his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Even with his extraordinary comprehension ability and the complete operation of the laws of time within the miniature universe, Lin Yuan had stagnated in comprehending the next model of the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>This was only natural. Hitting a bottleneck while comprehending the laws of time? This was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>As for the miniature universe? The laws of time within only made it slightly easier for the owner to comprehend the laws of time, not directly grasp the world laws.</p><p></p><p>If the miniature universe had that capability, how could it only appear as a reward on the third and fourth floors of the Nine-Story Black Tower?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I should seek guidance from a supreme expert?" Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of hitting a bottleneck was only temporary and should not hinder Lin Yuan for too long.</p><p></p><p>But if there was a shortcut available, why bother wasting time?</p><p></p><p>Since his last meeting with the Xia Qin supreme expert, the latter had clearly stated that if Lin Yuan had any questions about cultivation that he did not understand, he could ask at any time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began contacting the Xia Qin supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>It was also a good opportunity to ask about the doubts he had regarding the comprehension of the Xia You evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>At the towering peak of the Evolutionary Pagoda...</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow is actually looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert received Lin Yuan's message, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>He almost thought Lin Yuan had forgotten about this supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>"Does he have questions about cultivation that he wants to ask me?" The Xia Qin supreme expert was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>A talent like Lin Yuan was absolutely unprecedented in human history.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still uncertain whether he could eventually become a supreme expert, guiding such an unparalleled genius still gave the Xia Qin supreme expert a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>"Come over."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert agreed to meet with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Lin Yuan's figure appeared below.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Xia Qin supreme expert," Lin Yuan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>This was still a virtual world, but it was the personal world of a supreme expert. Without the supreme expert's permission, outsiders could not enter.</p><p></p><p>Even a peerless genius like Lin Yuan needed to notify the supreme expert before entering.</p><p></p><p>"Stand up."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me your questions."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert looked at Lin Yuan with interest.</p><p></p><p>He was curious about Lin Yuan's questions regarding cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Based on the number of spatial layers Lin Yuan had revealed in the Xuan-Huang secret realm, what kind of doubts could he have?</p><p></p><p>Doubts in the ninth level of cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Or questions about the breakthrough from the ninth to the tenth level?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps a lack of understanding about certain spatial essences?</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin supreme expert's thoughts fluctuated as he wondered what aspect Lin Yuan would ask about.</p><p></p><p>He guessed that Lin Yuan's doubts should be related to space, since he was only at the ninth level. No matter how many spatial layers he had opened, he was still at the ninth level, so the level involved was only that high.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin supreme expert," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before solemnly asking, "I have some lack of understanding regarding the Three Xuan Time Indices in the Xia You evolutionary path. Are the Three Xuan Time Indices three different states of time? Or are they time vortexes intertwined in the Three Xuan forms?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Three Xuan Time Indices in the Xia You evolutionary path, which involved different states of the time domain, Lin Yuan had been comparing them with the models of the laws of time, leading to some minor doubts about the details.</p><p></p><p>"The Xia You evolutionary path?" The Xia Qin supreme expert's brows raised, for this was the evolutionary path he had established himself.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, the Xia Qin supreme expert was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Three Xuan Time Indices - wasn't that content from the eleventh level of the Xia You evolutionary path?</p>

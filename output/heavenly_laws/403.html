        <h1>Chapter 403</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Not long after Lin Yuan crossed into the tenth level, he comprehended the first pillar-level fusion rule, becoming a Grade A tenth-level cultivator. </p><p></p><p>In other words, the peak of the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't until now that he pioneered the complete Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter. </p><p></p><p>During this process, he even experienced the eons of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>From this, one can see the difficulty in pioneering the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's transcendent comprehension, he had long created hundreds or even thousands of beginnings for tenth level chapters.</p><p></p><p>But he was never satisfied, feeling the direction was wrong.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he obtained everything from the powerful beings of all races from the old man half a meter tall within the white space that he finally locked onto the vein of the tenth level chapter. It only took him two and a half years to pioneer it.</p><p></p><p>"The core of the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter, besides the corresponding rule comprehensions and many pillar-level fusion rules, lies in remolding the physical body and soul to make them more perfect, closer to those special lifeforms nurtured by the cosmos."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, to achieve this required two things - one was transcendent comprehension, and the other was the physical body and soul structures of many special lifeforms and even alien lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Both were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>"My current physical body and soul..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed them. During the creation of the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter, his physical body and soul had been metamorphosing towards perfection.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he had perfectly pioneered the tenth level chapter that his physical body and soul metamorphosed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's physical body and soul were profound, no inferior to those special lifeforms with great talents. Perhaps temporarily still not as good as the unique special lifeforms, but the gap was also not huge.</p><p></p><p>"The reason special lifeforms have a low probability of breaking through to the ultimate is that they are innately powerful without a weak period, lacking an unyielding will. But their physical bodies and souls definitely have aspects worth learning from."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The current Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter took the strengths of those special lifeforms. As for their weaknesses? Which evolutionary product of human civilization did not grow from utter weakness to strength?</p><p></p><p>There was no such thing as innate power.</p><p></p><p>"That's about it."</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly pondering the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter, Lin Yuan finally nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The current tenth level chapter was the one he had envisioned. Other evolutionary paths' tenth level chapters only emphasized comprehension of rules.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Dao evolutionary path's tenth level chapter returned to the physical body and soul, displaying the evolutionary path from the roots.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom Goddess."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately connected to the Wisdom Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 8 citizen, the great scholar Lin Yuan, the Wisdom Goddess is pleased to serve you."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess's solemn and cool voice came.</p><p></p><p>"I want to upload the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately uploaded the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter to the Wisdom Goddess terminal.</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhishouzheng and five or six other paramount experts gathered again.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter?"</p><p></p><p>"That little guy created the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter?"</p><p></p><p>The paramount experts were slightly stunned before immediately accepting it.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had even comprehended the space-time fusion rule, creating the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter was not that inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The Virtual God paramount expert immediately started browsing it.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Lin Yuan was valued second only to the nine paramount experts within human civilization. The tenth level chapter he pioneered would be directly evaluated by the paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>"This tenth level chapter?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Force paramount expert's heart was slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>As the ultimate existence of the Force rules skilled in physical bodies, the Ancient Force paramount expert immediately saw that the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter involved remolding the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Rare, truly rare."</p><p></p><p>"Just how many special lifeforms did this little guy dissect? How did he gain such an understanding of physical bodies?"</p><p></p><p>The more the Ancient Force paramount expert read, the more incredulous he became. He could somewhat comprehend Lin Yuan having high comprehension of rules since many rules pervaded the cosmos and could be clearly sensed by transcendent geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But the profundities of the physical body?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was the profundities of the physical body in the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter, all directly pointing to the great way of the physical body, the great way of the cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Could such physical body comprehension be possessed by a little guy like Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"And the soul too?" The Feather Butterfly paramount expert's expression became slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>She had also detected that the core vein of the tenth level chapter was based on the physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao cultivators who cultivate to the Martial Dao tenth level and reach perfection at that realm will have much higher chances of crossing into the eleventh level in the future, even a minuscule benefit in breaking through to the ultimate," said the Xia Qinzhishouzheng paramount expert with a nod.</p><p></p><p>One must not underestimate the importance of the physical body and soul, especially when breaking through to the ultimate. A perfected physical body and soul may not provide much help, but at least would not drag one down.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed excellent."</p><p></p><p>The Virtual God paramount expert nodded slightly. Even he could see the rare value of the Martial Dao Tenth Level Chapter - returning to the roots of the physical body and soul, reinforcing the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"This tenth level chapter is worth at least thirty billion merit points."</p><p></p><p>"Thirty billion merit points is a bit low. I think it's worth at least forty or fifty billion merit points."</p><p></p><p>"Fifty billion then? I feel the chapter's elucidation on the physical body can be applied to other evolutionary paths too."</p><p></p><p>The paramount experts discussed and finally settled on a valuation of fifty billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>Main Star of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>While waiting, Lin Yuan once again immersed himself in cultivation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment...</p><p></p><p>"Respected 8th-level citizen scholar Lin Yuan, the Martial Dao Tenth Stage text you uploaded has been evaluated," the solemn and clear voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came.</p><p></p><p>"Evaluated?" Lin Yuan opened his eyes slightly, with some anticipation.  </p><p></p><p>"The final evaluation result - the value of the Martial Dao Tenth Stage text is fifty billion merit points," the voice of the Goddess of Wisdom rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty billion merit points?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that the Martial Dao Ninth Stage text was only worth two billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>Those two billion points included the results of his bloodline cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Tenth Stage text was directly worth fifty billion merit points?</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had created nearly a hundred miraculous artifacts, fifty billion merit points was still an enormous fortune for him.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization treasury, the minimum exchange price for 12th-level precious treasures was one billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>With fifty billion merit points, he could exchange for fifty of the lowest valued 12th-level treasures.</p><p></p><p>"By the way..."</p><p></p><p>"What is the current ranking for the path of Martial Dao evolution?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to check.</p><p></p><p>After uploading the Martial Dao Ninth Stage text, the path's evolution ranking was 42nd in the Southern Star Region. </p><p></p><p>The Southern Star Region was one of the five great star regions of human civilization. Ranking 42nd there meant the overall human civilization evolution path ranking was probably around 300-400th.</p><p></p><p>"Southern Star Region evolution ranking...first?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat surprised to see the final ranking.</p><p></p><p>Although he had expected that uploading the Tenth Stage would cause the Martial Dao evolution path's ranking to soar, given the fifty billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>The higher the evaluated merit points, the more the Three Goddesses and supreme beings valued its potential.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had not expected it to directly shoot up to first place in the Southern Star Region rankings.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the five great star regions, not just a star domain or federation!</p><p></p><p>The evolution paths on the Southern Star Region rankings were basically 11th stage paths. For the 9th stage Martial Dao path to originally rank 42nd was already extremely incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Human Civilization Evolution Path Rankings"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted to look at the Martial Dao evolution path's ranking among all human civilization evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>The so-called human civilization evolution path rankings included all evolution paths recorded by human civilization, including the nine supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization evolution path rankings were the most prestigious.</p><p></p><p>"Tenth place."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the evolution paths currently ranked ahead of the Martial Dao path.</p><p></p><p>There were only nine of them.</p><p></p><p>And these nine evolution paths were all supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Dao evolution path has become the strongest evolution path below the supreme paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, calling it the strongest wasn't accurate.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization evolution path rankings were decided based on many factors, with potential carrying significant weight.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the current Martial Dao evolution path had become the pinnacle among all the myriad evolution paths recorded by humanity.</p><p></p><p>The soaring ranking of the Martial Dao evolution path quickly caused a huge stir throughout human civilization.</p><p></p><p>After all, the latest Martial Dao evolution path ranking was 10th in all of human civilization, crushing the ranks of peak 11th stage evolution paths and topping the Southern Star Region rankings. This shocked countless evolutionists and high-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>"10th in the human civilization evolution path rankings? This Martial Dao evolution path is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Just by uploading the Tenth Stage, it skyrocketed from around 300th to 10th?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I told you all the Martial Dao evolution path's prospects were limitless, but you didn't believe me."</p><p></p><p>Countless evolutionists feverishly discussed it. Since the beginning of the Stellar Era, no evolution path had ever topped a major star region at just the 10th stage before.</p><p></p><p>The various human civilization evolution path rankings did place significant weight on potential as a key factor. But what 11th stage path didn't have great potential?</p><p></p><p>In the Thunder Rain Star Domain...</p><p></p><p>The 1.5 meter tall Luo Lan He suddenly leapt up with a "swish" sound.</p><p></p><p>"I told you the Martial Dao evolution path was pretty good."</p><p></p><p>Luo Lan He was exceptionally excited - he could be considered a witness to the Martial Dao path's rise.</p><p></p><p>Back when it was only at the 2nd stage, he had taken notice and begun cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>For this, he had even defied his father's wishes.</p><p></p><p>"Father, father!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Lan He immediately began contacting his father.</p><p></p><p>"Little He."</p><p></p><p>The illusory form of Luo Lan Yu appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Father, did you see the latest Martial Dao evolution path ranking?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Lan He excitedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"I saw it," Luo Lan Yu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the hottest topic within human civilization was indeed the Martial Dao evolution path - even other alien races were aware of it.</p><p></p><p>"Your choice was excellent," Luo Lan Yu looked at his son. "Cultivate well on the Martial Dao path going forward."</p><p></p><p>"Because..." Luo Lan Yu said this but didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>"Because what?" Luo Lan He asked with relish.</p><p></p><p>"Because..." Luo Lan Yu's expression was profound, his tone tinged with emotion. "This may very well become the tenth supreme evolution path of my human civilization."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

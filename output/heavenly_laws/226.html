            <p>Chapter 226: Ordinary Member of the Magic Jade Tower (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of self-mockery in Zuo Qiu Guang's words. Once upon a time, she and Gao Wufeng, along with a few other Evolvers, had looked down upon Lin Yuan's timid actions. They believed that on the path of evolution, forging ahead without hesitation was the right way. For example, Gao Wufeng had forcibly tried to overcome his heart demon tribulation. </p><p></p><p>But now, Gao Wufeng had nearly gone mad. She had also decided to give up voluntarily. The other Evolvers had also successively failed in their cultivation during this period. The small group from back then, now only Lin Yuan was still persisting.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the results, the few of them had gained nothing in the past few years. Moreover, because the path of evolution was contained within the body they cultivated, their mental willpower had all been affected to a certain degree. Even if it wasn't as serious as Gao Wufeng's case, they still needed a lot of time and many treasures to recover.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, look at Lin Yuan. All he sought was to use the pressure of mental willpower to temper his own mental willpower. Now it seemed that his gains were not bad. Although, in the eyes of Zuo Qiu Guang and the others, tempering mental willpower was not a difficult matter. But at least compared to themselves, not only was Lin Yuan unharmed, he had even obtained something.</p><p></p><p>Putting the two side by side formed a stark contrast. </p><p></p><p>"I just chose not to cultivate." Lin Yuan sighed. In fact, not cultivating was easier said than done. The supreme path of evolution was right in front of them. Who could control themselves and not cultivate? With delicacies on the table, could you resist and only eat rice?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to control himself because he had a heaven-defying comprehension ability and the Gate of Myriad Realms. He believed that even without relying on that body, he could still find a way to become a supreme expert. Even the offspring of supreme experts would have to fight for such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the rules set by the supreme experts are to have Evolvers enter and comprehend in batches, rather than all at once." Lin Yuan thought to himself. If they all comprehended at the same time, and if a collective problem occurred, wouldn't that impact the entire human civilization? Even if the ones comprehending that body were mainly seventh-stage Evolvers, having too many Evolvers at this level disappear at once could easily cause instability.</p><p></p><p>But having them enter in batches didn't have this problem. If this batch had issues, at most they would just temporarily suspend access to that body. Once they had mostly recovered, they could gradually open it up again.</p><p></p><p>"The further one cultivates the path of evolution contained in that body, the greater the impact on oneself, especially if the cultivation fails." Lin Yuan glanced at the body under the sky. If one failed right at the beginning of cultivation, there likely wouldn't be much impact. At most, they would need to recuperate for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>But if one was like Gao Wufeng and had achieved some success before failing again in cultivation, then it wouldn't just be a matter of recuperating for a while. Therefore, Zuo Qiu Guang's choice to voluntarily give up was based on this consideration. At least giving up now would exact a much lighter price compared to being forced to give up later after a cultivation failure. Gao Wufeng was an example.</p><p></p><p>"If I cultivated and comprehended a certain path of evolution, perhaps with my heaven-defying comprehension I could go very far, much further than Gao Wufeng. But once I failed, the consequences would be devastating." Lin Yuan shuddered at the thought.</p><p></p><p>"I can't cultivate it." </p><p>"I even have to be extremely careful when comprehending it." Lin Yuan furrowed his brows slightly as he thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the Vermilion Roc. Lin Yuan's consciousness disconnected from the virtual world, intending to rest for a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Power of Realm-Breaking." Lin Yuan's mind arrived at the depths of his sea of consciousness, gazing at that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms. At the same time, Lin Yuan sensed the abundant information being transmitted from the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. During these past few years when he wasn't traversing, and was constantly comprehending that body and tempering his mental willpower, the Power of Realm-Breaking had unknowingly accumulated to five strands.</p><p></p><p>"If my Yin Spirit hadn't been constantly in the battlefield against the alien races, the Power of Realm-Breaking now would be at most three or four strands." Lin Yuan raised his head and looked in a direction. That was the alien battlefield he had specifically chosen to let his Supreme Yin Avatar go to, staying beneath that permanent spatial rift to accelerate the accumulation of the Power of Realm-Breaking.</p><p></p><p>"Five strands of the Power of Realm-Breaking allows for five traversals. However, these five traversals are all random and cannot select the scope and level of the world." Lin Yuan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The 'random traversal' made Lin Yuan uneasy. If he were to traverse to a low-level world like the first time, let alone getting stronger, he wouldn't even be able to recover to his peak state. Wouldn't that be a waste of a traversal opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"If I don't do a random traversal, I currently have two choices." Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>One was to go to the Spirit Realm. This was the coordinates related to the Spirit Realm that Lin Yuan had captured in the Zhongtu Divine Prefecture world during his fifth traversal. With these coordinates, Lin Yuan could expend ten strands of the Power of Realm-Breaking to quietly descend into the Spirit Realm. With the level of the Spirit Realm, it was enough for Lin Yuan to cultivate for a very long time. At least the eighth stage or even the ninth stage wouldn't be an issue.</p><p></p><p>The second choice was to deeply develop the Tianqing World, or more precisely, the outer void of the Tianqing World. That place was filled with evil gods, and there were even legendary evil gods who had grown to the ninth stage and established gathering places.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was also a third option. That was to expend a hundred strands of the Power of Realm-Breaking to 'customize' the world he would traverse to. The so-called 'customization' was completely based on Lin Yuan's requirements. For example, if Lin Yuan wanted to traverse to a primordial great world, he could directly customize it and then traverse there.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Lin Yuan wanted to specify the 'scope' and 'level' of the world he traversed to, he could also customize it. Of course, the starting point for 'customized' traversal was a hundred strands of the Power of Realm-Breaking. If the customized world was special, the consumption would be even greater. But generally speaking, as long as the Power of Realm-Breaking was sufficient, Lin Yuan could go to any world. Dimensions and realms could not stop him.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianqing World." Thinking of the Tianqing World, Lin Yuan decided to receive the information transmitted from it. With the Ancestral Demon Tree controlling the Heavenly Dao, Lin Yuan could barely receive information from the Tianqing World through the world coordinate imprint of the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p>"So many things have happened in these years?" Lin Yuan's mind focused on the world coordinate imprint of the Tianqing World. Instantly, a large amount of information from the Ancestral Demon Tree surged into his mind.</p><p></p><p>From the end of the sixth traversal until now, only a few years had passed in the main world. But for the Tianqing World, due to the difference in time flow, several thousand years had passed. During these several thousand years, the living beings in the Tianqing World had lived well. However, those few outer realm evil gods had actively approached several times, wanting to contact Lin Yuan, but they were all turned away by the Ancestral Demon Tree according to Lin Yuan's instructions.</p><p></p><p>"Those few outer realm evil gods..." Lin Yuan narrowed his eyes slightly. He had noticed back then that those few outer realm evil gods were acting suspiciously, actually wanting to invite him to explore some void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Ancestral Demon Tree guards the world, there is nothing to fear." Lin Yuan was not concerned at all. The Ancestral World Tree had become the 'Heavenly Dao' of the Tianqing World. It was not comparable to the original world consciousness. Wielding the vast power of the world, even if ten outer realm evil gods came to kill, the Ancestral Demon Tree could still contend against them.</p><p></p><p>Time passed. Another year went by. Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the peak of a mountain, observing the body under the sky.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Truncated body.</p><p></p><p>[Your enlightenment is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious body, you have comprehended the 3,331st path of evolution.]</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar</p><p></p><p>"The 3,331st Path of Evolution"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up slightly, and he immediately began to analyze this path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"This is called the path of evolution, and it's actually related to time? The combination of time and space? The essence of space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>The rules of time, along with the rules of space and life, are one of the main pillars supporting the world.</p><p></p><p>The ability of the strongest to "resurrect" relies on reversing space-time. This requires a complete grasp of the rules of time, breaking free from the constraints of the river of time, going against the current, and then resurrecting people from the past.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the resurrected person's life essence must reach a certain level. Otherwise, if the life essence is too weak, even if the strongest goes against the current, they will not be able to "fish them out" and place them on the current timeline.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully comprehended that time has no form or substance, yet it is omnipresent. It is too difficult to comprehend time, especially now that Lin Yuan is only at the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The level is too low. Even with heaven-defying enlightenment, the effect is minimal.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until after reaching the eighth stage to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"Now, focus on comprehending the rules of space."</p><p></p><p>"Only by having a deep enough comprehension of the rules of space can one better comprehend the rules of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave up on comprehending the rules of time, as it was too unprofitable for him.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>More and more human evolution geniuses entered the virtual world to comprehend that truncated body.</p><p></p><p>These evolution geniuses, being latecomers, knew the fate of the evolution geniuses who first comprehended the truncated body.</p><p></p><p>But none of the evolution geniuses gave up. Since they could be called evolution geniuses, they were all extremely confident, believing that they could definitely accomplish what others could not.</p><p></p><p>"I am a body of empty spirit, and I am also favored by the Goddess of Wisdom, who hides and keeps my information secret. I will definitely be able to comprehend the supreme path of evolution."</p><p></p><p>In a certain virtual world, a young man sat on the top of a mountain, looking up at the truncated body under the sky.</p><p></p><p>A few months later.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?"</p><p></p><p>"Where am I?"</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now?"</p><p></p><p>This young man looked confused, and his body exploded with a bang.</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme path of evolution. I have already reached the extreme of the eighth stage, and there is basically no hope of entering the ninth stage. It is not even possible to reach the invincibility of the eighth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than this, it's better to take a risk and give up everything to comprehend that truncated body. Once successful, one will be nurtured by the entire human civilization."</p><p></p><p>An old man with an ancient face made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A year later.</p><p></p><p>This old man with an ancient face sat on the top of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the truncated body under the sky.</p><p></p><p>His expression was extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Something is wrong."</p><p></p><p>"This truncated body is not right."</p><p></p><p>"The path of evolution I have cultivated is not right."</p><p></p><p>This old man with an ancient face kept recalling something. He felt that a part of his memory was beginning to be missing.</p><p></p><p>This symptom even had a tendency to spread.</p><p></p><p>"This body is too demonic. How could the strongest release such an uncontrollable thing?"</p><p></p><p>The old man with an ancient face calmed himself down and indeed gave up on comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to comprehend and cultivate, he felt that all his memories would be erased.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he might become a puppet without any memory?</p><p></p><p>"This body I have now is a special life I possessed not long ago. Its innate talent is powerful, far surpassing that of humans. Using it to comprehend that truncated body should be twice the result with half the effort, right?"</p><p></p><p>A green-skinned man with a dragon horn on his forehead showed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>In terms of innate talent, humans can never compare to those special lives in the depths of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the incomparability here refers to the entire race. If it is an individual, with the population base of human civilization, monsters and demons will be born every once in a while, which are not inferior to those special lives.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Among the special life races, there will also be genius demons.</p><p></p><p>And this green-skinned man with a dragon horn, the object he possessed, was a genius from a certain special life race.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of various rules was extremely terrifying, and his blood was strong, his flesh body was unmatched, and he could be described as frightening.</p><p></p><p>In order to comprehend the supreme path of evolution, this green-skinned man with a dragon horn paid a huge price. It was not an easy task to capture such a special life genius alive.</p><p></p><p>A year and a half later.</p><p></p><p>The green-skinned man with a dragon horn looked difficult, and his mind and consciousness were shrouded in layers of blurry shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, didn't they say that only a very few evolution paths would attract heart demons?"</p><p></p><p>The green-skinned man with a dragon horn let out a sigh of relief. He was originally an eighth-stage evolution expert, and his mental will index exceeded ten thousand points. It was not difficult for him to pass the heart demon tribulation again.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is the nine-layered heart demon tribulation."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the green-skinned man with a dragon horn let out a wail.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many geniuses in human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the top of the mountain and watched batch after batch of human genius evolution experts come in.</p><p></p><p>These evolution experts, although they may be far inferior to Lin Yuan in terms of enlightenment, they all have their unique features in other aspects, such as physique, bloodline, soul, and so on.</p><p></p><p>This is only the virtual world where Lin Yuan is located.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this virtual world, there are countless other virtual worlds where one can comprehend that truncated body.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, they all failed."</p><p></p><p>"So far, among all the genius evolution experts who participated in comprehending the body, not a single one has found that supreme path of evolution?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the strongest were wrong? This truncated body does not contain the so-called supreme path of evolution at all?"</p><p></p><p>"Or, the body containing the supreme path of evolution is not this one, but the body in the hands of other top races?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>"But what does this have to do with me?"</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to comprehend that supreme path of evolution."</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending and analyzing the ordinary evolution paths contained in the body, I am already very satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he continued to observe the truncated body under the sky.</p><p></p><p>[Your enlightenment is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious body, you have comprehended 3,333 paths of evolution.]</p><p></p><p>I don't know how long it has been.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehended another path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>If the first path of evolution he comprehended is counted until this one, Lin Yuan has already comprehended 3,333 paths of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Analyze."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could analyze this path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's memory, the 3,332 paths of evolution he had previously comprehended, and this 3,333rd path of evolution, actually produced some kind of mutation.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, these 3,333 paths of evolution formed a "nine-layered black building" mark and merged into the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The sound of vague murmurs from the mental will pressure of that truncated body, which had caused great pressure on Lin Yuan, suddenly became clear.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend 3,333 paths of evolution, form the Demon Jade mark, and automatically become an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Building."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was serving as the executor in the Qingyun Academy, primarily responsible for organizing and cataloging ancient books, scrolls, and jade slips.</p><p></p><p>This type of position was quite relaxed. </p><p></p><p>It was usually held by the older generation of predecessors who had dedicated themselves wholeheartedly to the Holy Sect for many years and had established sufficient merits.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was not very old, he had once been invaded by demonic energy that corrupted his mind. However, with the approval of the Sect Master, he was able to take on this position quite smoothly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had also made contributions to the Holy Sect by forewarning the Eldest Disciple about his impending descent into demonic cultivation, helping the Sect avoid significant losses.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, while recovering his strength, Lin Yuan was mainly researching his physical body, as the potential of this flesh body he had descended into was shockingly strong, almost as if he were a direct descendant of a 13th-tier time life form.</p><p></p><p>The potential was unbelievably high. In the first source world, the six great ancient nations had the bloodlines of the six ancestral progenitors flowing through their inhabitants, but it was extremely diluted, almost non-existent. However, in this source world, the potential of the physical body was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Before the great celestial changes, the cultivation system of this source world was based on runes, which were used to embody and interpret all the laws and principles of the world," Lin Yuan contemplated as he examined the inherited jade slips left behind from before the great changes.</p><p></p><p>The Dao and its rules were originally formless, invisible and untouchable even to cultivators, who could only perceive them through intuition. But runes were tangible, using concrete runes to interpret the formless Dao and its rules. As a result, the number of cultivators in this world before the great changes was staggeringly high.</p><p></p><p>With a larger base of powerful cultivators, the chances of even stronger ones emerging naturally increased. The Qingyun Holy Sect was a hegemon in this region before the great changes, with Transcendent Realm experts guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Even the lowest level of the Transcendent Realm was comparable to the Chaotic Supremes of the Chaotic Void. However, after the great changes and the subsequent great demonic invasions, the peak strength of the Qingyun Holy Sect had only reached the pinnacle of the Eternal Realm, which was the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Sect's protective formations, they could barely display the defensive power of the Transcendent Realm experts. This was the reason why the Qingyun Holy Sect was still able to withstand the repeated great demonic invasions.</p><p></p><p>The great demons were terrifying beings that directly rivaled the pinnacle of the Eternal Realm, and in some aspects had even surpassed it.</p><p></p><p>"After the great changes, demonic energy permeated the world, and the Dao rules became obscured. Even with the rune inheritance, it was difficult to perfectly interpret the vague Dao rules," Lin Yuan felt the deep, powerful aura pervading the heavens and earth, his eyes suddenly gleaming, "Runes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's palm began weaving strands of energy, and in an instant, a "gold" character was formed. This was a rune of this world, embodying the essence of the gold element.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!" Lin Yuan exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Rune Diagrams stored in the treasuries of the six great ancient nations in the first source world were essentially runes left behind by the ancestral progenitors. Even Lin Yuan, as a descendant, would find it difficult to replicate them.</p><p></p><p>However, the rune inheritance of this world could imprint and embody everything in the heavens and earth, transforming the formless into the tangible. This greatly reduced the difficulty of comprehension and had boundless applications.</p><p></p><p>"With runes as the foundation, I now know how to sustain the endless particle worlds I wish to open," Lin Yuan's thoughts raced. The true body of the first source world was attempting to imitate the Abyss Dragon, opening boundless worlds within each of its own particles.</p><p></p><p>That Abyss Dragon, in terms of innate foundation, was still above Lin Yuan. What was its secret? Wasn't it the particle worlds as numerous as grains of sand?</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could also successfully emulate this and open up particle worlds the size of endless sands, and then reconstruct them using the "Infinite Void" inheritance, his final strength would be...Lin Yuan didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it would be far beyond his current level.</p><p></p><p>"That Abyss Dragon can simultaneously maintain the particle worlds the size of endless sands because of its innate talent, as the first life form born in the source world, a gift bestowed by the source world itself," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"But I don't have that kind of talent, so I can only rely on mental power to maintain the opening of particle worlds. Mental power is limited, while the particle worlds are infinite."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind raced. Now that the rune inheritance had appeared, he saw hope in being able to simultaneously maintain the endless particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>By imprinting the Dao rule runes on the surface of every particle world at all times, he could stabilize the particle worlds and eventually give rise to the infinite particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, this seems to be the simplest and most promising method," Lin Yuan thought to himself. The true body of the first source world had repeatedly tried to find a better solution, but either it couldn't last long or the hidden dangers were too great.</p><p></p><p>Now, the rune inheritance of this world seemed to perfectly match Lin Yuan's plan to open his own endless particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>"It's not by chance, the rune inheritance is inherently compatible with any cultivation system, using runes to replicate the Dao rules and even to nourish oneself, it's a perfect auxiliary means," Lin Yuan realized.</p><p></p><p>"I'll start by trying to open particle worlds in this world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had made up his mind. Firstly, the potential of this physical body was high enough to accommodate the opening of countless particle worlds. Even if he failed midway, Lin Yuan had already prepared resurrection and protective measures, so he could start over from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, by opening particle worlds from weak to strong, he could better experience the operation of these particle worlds, which would greatly benefit the cultivation of his true body.</p><p></p><p>As for the current situation where the world had undergone great changes, demonic energy permeating the environment, making it difficult to comprehend the Dao rules even with the rune inheritance - that was a challenge for other powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan possessed an extraordinary comprehension, so as long as the Dao rules still existed, he would be able to cultivate the rune inheritance smoothly. Even if the Dao rules of this source world were completely suppressed by demonic energy, Lin Yuan could still perceive the Dao rules of other dimensions. The so-called demonic energy was only limited to this source world and would have a very limited impact on him.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the potential of this physical body in this source world, I wonder what kind of divine abilities it will eventually give birth to?" Lin Yuan suddenly felt a sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The physical body of the first source world did not have particularly high potential, as even the royal bloodlines were far from the ancestral progenitors. The reason it was able to grow to such a high level was entirely due to Lin Yuan's own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But this source world? The physical body Lin Yuan had descended into could be considered a direct descendant of a 13th-tier time life form. In the six great ancient nations, this would be an undisputed supreme bloodline, far surpassing even the core royal families.</p><p></p><p>The current core royal families of the six great ancient nations were far from being direct descendants of the ancestral progenitors, only having a relatively higher concentration of ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>True direct descendant bloodlines of the ancestral progenitors were extremely rare. At the level of the ancestral progenitors, the restrictions on giving birth to true direct descendants were immense.</p><p></p><p>It was easy for the ancestral progenitors to have descendants, but to have direct descendant offspring? That was very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was the second year since Lin Yuan entered the Qingyun Academy as the Executor.</p><p></p><p>His physical body had completely transformed and embarked on the path of martial cultivation. He immediately began to nurture the fundamental power deep within his bloodline, and started to cultivate new physical techniques.</p><p></p><p>"It will take at least ten thousand years to nurture them." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan determined in his heart, based on the rules of how his previous physical techniques had been cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The longer the cultivation time for a physical technique, the greater its potential and power would be. For example, the previous physical technique "Blazing Sun Opens the Heavens" had been cultivated for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But this new physical technique, its cultivation time was directly over ten thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but feel anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened in this source world? What is this great transformation of the heavens and earth? And after this great transformation, why have the physical bodies of all living beings become so terrifying?" Doubts arose in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Enhancing the potential of his own physical body was not difficult for Lin Yuan, but trying to simultaneously enhance the physical potential of the countless living beings in this source world would be an extremely arduous task, even for a Thirteenth Realm Temporal Life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the magnitude of the increase in physical potential before and after the great transformation of the heavens and earth was truly staggering.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about this is too premature right now," Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>His own strength had not yet fully recovered, so even if he knew the truth about this source world, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>When he regained his peak power, many secrets would become clear to him even without asking.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Chen Tong (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Gatekeeper of the Myriad Realms]</p><p>[Innate Talent: Transcendent Comprehension]</p><p>[Technique: Bloodline Rebirth]</p><p>[Technique: Blazing Sun Opens the Heavens]</p><p>[Technique: In Cultivation...]</p><p>[Current State: Consciousness Descended]</p><p>[Remaining Residency Time: Unlimited]</p><p></p><p>"My residency has no time limit, I still have plenty of time," Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Twelfth Realm, as long as the host body did not completely perish, his consciousness could continue to reside indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan's fourth year since entering the Qingyun Academy as the Executor.</p><p></p><p>The entire Qingyun Sacred Mountain began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun Sacred Mountain was the location of the Qingyun Sect, and after being refined by the powerful cultivators of the sect over generations, it had become an incredibly powerful sacred weapon, no longer just a simple mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Demon, the Great Demon has begun attacking the mountain!" </p><p></p><p>The countless disciples of the Qingyun Sect trembled in their hearts. Demons were divided into four levels: Demonic Spirits, Great Demons, Source Demons, and Demonic Gods.</p><p></p><p>Demonic Gods need not be considered, as they had only appeared at the very beginning of the great transformation of the heavens and earth, and had not shown up since then.</p><p></p><p>As for Source Demons? They were extremely rare, and even if they appeared, they would be attracted by the major eternal sects.</p><p></p><p>The greatest threat to the Qingyun Sect now was the Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Demons did not have independent intelligence, but rather wandered the heavens and earth like mindless undead.</p><p></p><p>If a passing Great Demon happened to notice the abnormality of the Qingyun Sect, it would attempt to attack, which was known as a "Great Demon attack on the mountain."</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun Sacred Mountain was normally shrouded by a suppressing formation, which ordinary "Demons" could not detect. But Great Demons were different - if they got too close, they might notice something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if after attacking for a while they did not discover anything more, the mindless Great Demon would retreat on its own accord.</p><p></p><p>This meant the Qingyun Sect had weathered this Great Demon attack.</p><p></p><p>During a Great Demon attack, the Qingyun Sect absolutely could not counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would attract even more Great Demons, and even the powerful Qingyun Sect would be worn down and destroyed by these hordes of Great Demons.</p><p></p><p>"A Great Demon?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in front of the Qingyun Academy, gazing afar at the towering figure outside the Qingyun Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This figure was surrounded by endless demonic qi, and large amounts of demonic qi were now converging and slamming against the Qingyun Sacred Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The trembling of the Qingyun Sacred Mountain was caused by the impact of these terrifying demonic attacks.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Demon, each of its attacks reaches the peak of the Chaotic Realm, and it can exhale endless demonic qi. It will indeed be very difficult to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully. More importantly, Great Demons were almost immortal - even if a Transcendent Realm expert tried to subdue this Great Demon, at most they could only suppress it, but could not completely destroy it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was true for any Demon. Even if their demonic body was annihilated, the "Demon" itself would reform and reappear elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>To truly eliminate a Demon, one would have to become a Demon Cultivator and devour it.</p><p></p><p>Since the great transformation of the heavens and earth, the reason why there were now Demon Cultivators was not only because cultivating as a Demon would greatly increase one's power, but also because only Demon Cultivators could completely destroy Demons.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The Qingyun Sacred Mountain shook and swayed.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the Great Demon outside, the Qingyun Mountain was just an ordinary giant mountain. After attacking for a while and gaining nothing, this Great Demon shook its head and lumbered away.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Demon has left?"</p><p>"We withstood the attack."</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Qingyun Sect felt a slight relief in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Every Great Demon attack posed a dangerous threat of annihilation to the Qingyun Sect. Whenever the disciples saw that towering Great Demon figure, an indescribable sense of oppression would well up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to really lack intelligence," Lin Yuan thought to himself as he watched the Great Demon leave.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, the Qingyun Sect won't be able to withstand many more Great Demon attacks."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently mused. Although he had not yet fully recovered his peak strength, his perception was still keen. He could sense the "weakness" the Qingyun Sacred Mountain was revealing in its defense against the Great Demon attacks.</p><p></p><p>The choice of the Sect's Elder Brother Li Qing to become a Demon Cultivator in an attempt to save the Qingyun Sect was not without reason. As the Sect's Elder Brother, Li Qing must have been very clear about the dire situation the Sect was facing.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the source of the great transformation of the heavens and earth is in the center of the world, where the demonic qi erupted. The few eternal sects have only temporarily held it back. Compared to that, the Great Demons the Qingyun Sect is facing are nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Something capable of plunging an entire source world into such a desperate situation could not be accomplished by mere Great Demons. Even Source Demons would not be enough - only Demonic Gods would have that kind of power.</p><p></p><p>"I should continue my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the Qingyun Academy and resumed his study of the Talisman Inheritance, intending to integrate it with the opening of the Endless Sand Particle Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few years, aside from recovering his strength, Lin Yuan had devoted all his remaining efforts to this.</p><p></p><p>"I have already opened twelve particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, observing the twelve particles within his body. Their surfaces were covered in intricate talismans, containing boundless worlds within.</p><p></p><p>"Maintaining these twelve particle worlds does not require me to expend any mental effort. The method of using the Talisman Inheritance as the foundation to sustain the Endless Sand Particle Worlds is working well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was slightly uplifted, but then he thought of the biggest problem he was facing.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 307 - The Ninth Crossing! The World of Gods (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the galaxy, Lin Yuan also closed his eyes. </p><p></p><p>His mind sank deep into his mind, in front of that majestic and grand Gate of Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Gate of Myriad Worlds radiated light, and the last world mark at the "threshold" below was also glowing.</p><p></p><p>"In this crossing, we must pay attention to the situation in the 'Xuanhuang' secret realm at all times. Once Xilan can't hold on, directly annihilate the sun avatar." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Xilan told him that she could hold on for three years, Lin Yuan naturally would not place all his hopes on her. </p><p></p><p>After all, the opponent was Hun Yi, the strongest ninth-level life form of the Tianyu race. Who knows what hidden cards and tricks he hasn't used yet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would absolutely not let his sun avatar fall into the hands of the enemy, even if that sun avatar was just an empty shell, with the core spiritual will having long escaped into the Gate of Myriad Worlds, descending to other dimensional worlds.</p><p></p><p>As for how to annihilate the sun avatar? Lin Yuan had long set up means around the sun avatar. Once triggered, the sun avatar would quickly collapse.</p><p></p><p>Of course, by doing so, he would most likely be unable to figure out the secret of that "calling sensation" during the opening of the Xuanhuang secret realm this time.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, it wasn't an unbearable loss.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't obtain the opportunities within the Xuanhuang secret realm, Lin Yuan could still walk to the pinnacle of the universe. It would just take a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>"This crossing, the duration will be about 1,100 years, with a time flow ratio of over 300 to 1. Over 2 years will pass in the main world."</p><p></p><p>"In the 1,100 years of the crossing world, I must at least cultivate to the level of millions of layers and open up millions of spatial layers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan set a plan for himself.</p><p></p><p>With his inner world spanning nearly 200 million miles, even if he only opened up millions of spatial layers, he could still crush special ninth-levels like Hun Yi who had opened up over 30 million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundation that came from the inner world itself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the Gate of Myriad Worlds before him became more and more dazzling. Time and space were slightly fluctuating, and his mind and will were all absorbed into it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only felt his consciousness blur and his thoughts swaying, barely managing to open his eyes, and he noticed the weakness coming from his entire body.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat up, unable to even take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>This body was too weak, basically rotten to the core.</p><p></p><p>"The fluctuations of many spatial layers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>At his level, even if he had no power, his realm couldn't possibly fall. He could easily see the subtle changes between spaces.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could only see, not drive or utilize them. The body and soul must be strong enough for that.</p><p></p><p>"My identity is the grandson of Viscount Longshan? The third in line to inherit the Longshan family? My favorite thing to do is to favor the maids? The maids here are not limited to human females?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly received the memories. No wonder this body was so weak.</p><p></p><p>Indulging in lust, leaking the essence. If not for regularly consuming some tonics, he probably would have "died from exhaustion" long ago.</p><p></p><p>"The world I descended to this time..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although the original body was unlearned, he still knew some common knowledge about the world.</p><p></p><p>This world was boundless. In addition to the "human realm" where Lin Yuan was currently in, there were also the Sea of Light and the Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Sea of Light or the Abyss of Darkness, those were places where deities resided. It was said that the Sea of Light and the Abyss of Darkness each had the twelve strongest chief gods.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-four chief gods were high above, overlooking the human realm and the myriad gods.</p><p></p><p>"Deities."</p><p></p><p>Information about deities surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>To become a deity, one must spread faith, then raise a divine kingdom and enter the Sea of Light or the Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Deities needing to raise a divine kingdom is roughly equivalent to eighth-level opening an inner world in the main world?" Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So far, he didn't know what kind of strength the deities of this world actually had. He could only associate divine kingdoms with eighth-levels of the main world.</p><p></p><p>"The path the powerhouses of this world walk is spreading faith?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive. The so-called faith was the purest emotion and desire in the hearts of living beings.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary scholars of the main universe's human civilization discovered this type of power very early on and even specially created some evolutionary paths that utilized this type of power.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, purely using the faith of living beings as the source of one's own power had very big hidden dangers. In the end, it could even lead to the evolutionary being themself getting lost in the desires of the masses.</p><p></p><p>Faith could lead to success.</p><p></p><p>But faith could also lead to failure.</p><p></p><p>However, in this world, the path of faith seemed to be very smooth.</p><p></p><p>At least many deities relied on the faith of living beings to raise divine kingdoms and ascend to godhood.</p><p></p><p>Even the twenty-four chief gods of the Sea of Light and Abyss of Darkness relied on the power of faith to wield the authority of laws?</p><p></p><p>"Faith."</p><p></p><p>Spreading faith was a completely different concept from spreading one's own evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>The essence of faith was fanatical worship, unreserved worship. But spreading an evolutionary path was different.</p><p></p><p>For example, with Lin Yuan's martial dao evolutionary path, future cultivators cultivating the martial dao didn't need to know about Lin Yuan as a person.</p><p></p><p>"The Longshan family was granted the title of imperial viscount. The first generation Viscount Longshan made great contributions to the empire."</p><p></p><p>"The territory of the Longshan family is called Longshan Territory, spanning about 60 million miles... It seems the size of this world exceeds my expectations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>The territory of just a viscount reached 60 million miles. Then how big was the entire empire? And the empire where Longshan Territory was located was just one nation on the "Plateau of Myriad Nations".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rubbed his brow. Just from a rough estimate, he deduced that the size of this world had to exceed 500 light-years.</p><p></p><p>And this was only the human realm. The Sea of Light and Abyss of Darkness were not included.</p><p></p><p>"The main cultivation system of this world is the 'Knight' cultivation system, divided from low to high into first-grade, second-grade, third-grade, fourth-grade, fifth-grade, sixth-grade, and seventh-grade."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Fifth-grade knights were also known as Grand Knights. The first generation Viscount Longshan back then was of this level of strength when he established the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>Sixth-grade knights were "Legendary" knights. As for seventh-grade knights? At least none had been born in the empire. Traces of them occasionally appeared on the Plateau of Myriad Nations.</p><p></p><p>Seventh-grade knights were also known as "Demigods". Powerhouses of this level all had the qualifications to create their own "God Name" to spread faith in an attempt to break through to that next step.</p><p></p><p>"Knight cultivation system." A knight cultivation method automatically surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was the Longshan Cultivation Method of the Longshan family, the high-grade knight cultivation method that the first generation Viscount Longshan relied on to shake the world.</p><p></p><p>However, the Longshan Cultivation Method in Lin Yuan's mind only had the basic parts.</p><p></p><p>"Average, roughly equivalent to the main world's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Five-Stage Evolution Path of Dragon Mountain Cultivation." Lin Yuan glanced at it and came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Cultivation Method is the foundation of cultivation for five-star great knights. Countless knights yearn to take a glimpse at it, even if it's just the basic part.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan comes from the vast Main Universe with countless evolution paths, and he himself is a nine-star powerhouse, so naturally he looks down on it.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Long Shanyuan (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Wielder of the Gate of Myriad Realms] </p><p>[Innate Talent: Heaven-defying Comprehension]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Moving Mountains]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Strengthening]</p><p>[Current State: Consciousness Descended]</p><p>[Remaining Residence Time: 1,110 years]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged as he looked at the illusory text below his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>"The residence time is over 1,100 years, not bad." Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had long sensed the residence time of this crossing, but only had a general idea. The specifics could only be determined after descending.</p><p></p><p>With over a thousand years, Lin Yuan was very confident that with his heaven-defying comprehension, as long as he didn't die prematurely, he could easily open up millions of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Die prematurely?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>The scene from last night surfaced in his mind. He had been invited by a good friend to attend a gathering.</p><p></p><p>That gathering was extremely extravagant. One beautiful woman after another came out. In the end, Lin Yuan took a liking to a fox woman with a charming temperament, and the two spent a passionate night together.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't remember what happened after that. His impression was filled with euphoria, but when Lin Yuan woke up just now, he found that his inner essence had been severely depleted.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan hadn't taken over this body in time and instinctively locked down the leakage of his essence, even if he didn't die now, his physical strength would have plummeted drastically. He probably wouldn't even be able to get out of bed.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>"Or intentional?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan narrowed his eyes. The place he was in now was not Dragon Mountain Ridge, but Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>Anpu City was the intersection of Dragon Mountain Ridge and several other territories. It was extremely prosperous in trade and had various entertainment venues from within and outside the empire.</p><p></p><p>It was also the place that descendants of viscounts like Long Shanyuan liked to visit the most.</p><p></p><p>More than half a month ago, Long Shanyuan had brought his guards to Anpu City and had been playing with a few fox friends until now.</p><p></p><p>In a dark palace.</p><p></p><p>A woman wearing black gauze, her enchanting figure vaguely visible, stood under a divine statue.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Divine Envoy." Below, a fox woman with a charming temperament knelt there respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? How is that Long Shanyuan?" The enchanting woman asked in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Pay attention to the limits. Long Shanyuan can only die of natural causes." The enchanting woman frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>Long Shanyuan was the grandson of the Viscount of Dragon Mountain. If there were any unusual factors in his death, it would definitely arouse the fury of the Viscount of Dragon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if it was thoroughly investigated, things would become troublesome.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they feared the Viscount of Dragon Mountain. The current generation's Viscount of Dragon Mountain was old and frail.</p><p></p><p>And the first and second in line to inherit the title were also not young.</p><p></p><p>Even if they became the new Viscount of Dragon Mountain, they probably wouldn't live for long.</p><p></p><p>And their church had already secretly controlled the fourth in line to inherit Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>As long as Long Shanyuan "died normally" without arousing the suspicion of the Viscount of Dragon Mountain, in a few decades, the entire Dragon Mountain Ridge would be theirs.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Divine Envoy, I know my limits." The fox woman's face turned pale and she immediately assured, "I only absorb a tiny bit each time. Outsiders definitely won't be able to tell. At most seven times, and the cause of Long Shanyuan's death can only be overindulgence."</p><p></p><p>Given Long Shanyuan's previous behavior of indulging in women, dying from overindulgence would be more than normal. Even the Viscount of Dragon Mountain himself wouldn't have any suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Although regarding this matter, Long Shanyuan's parents and the Viscount of Dragon Mountain himself had spoken to Long Shanyuan many times.</p><p></p><p>They even grounded him, but to no avail. Long Shanyuan still remained incorrigible.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>The enchanting woman nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Once they controlled Dragon Mountain Ridge, it would greatly benefit the spread of faith for the deity behind their church.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ridge spanned over 60 million miles and had over 100 billion subjects. If they could thoroughly seize this huge source of faith, they would definitely receive rewards from the deity.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>All of this had to be done in secret, especially the matter of spreading faith. If it was leaked, they would be surrounded and annihilated by the empire.</p><p></p><p>In the empire, only one deity was worshipped, and that was the God of Order, one of the twelve main gods of the Sea of Light, with immeasurable divine power.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the God of Order, all other faith churches were evil cults that needed to be eradicated.</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>Ever since speculating that he might be targeted, Lin Yuan immediately began examining himself, circulating his blood and qi, assessing the amount of essence depletion.</p><p></p><p>"There is indeed a problem."</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, even if one indulged in women, the rate of physical deterioration wouldn't be too fast.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the grandson of the Viscount of Dragon Mountain, Long Shanyuan often consumed some highly nourishing items, which could make up for his essence depletion to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"That fox woman?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the fox woman with whom he had spent a passionate night. She was indeed a beauty, making Long Shanyuan indulge and forget himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, there must be a big problem with her.</p><p></p><p>However, the fox woman shouldn't be the mastermind. What mastermind would personally take action? There must be someone else behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly wants to make a move against me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a bit of a headache. Long Shanyuan was arrogant and domineering in his daily life, offending countless people. Searching for enemies among them was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those who could think of using a woman's charms to lure Long Shanyuan, using such an imperceptible method to slowly hollow out Long Shanyuan, the forces behind them must not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression suddenly moved. He raised his right hand, pressed it against his brow, and finally slowly moved it away.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of pale pink aura lingered on his fingertips and gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Divine power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned, and then his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was a wisp of demigod power, condensed by a seven-star knight level powerhouse. As long as there was sufficient faith, this wisp of demigod power had the hope of transforming into complete divine power.</p><p></p><p>"The one targeting me is a demigod?"</p><p></p><p>"No, how could a demigod-level existence be interested in me? It should be a church established by a demigod to spread their own faith that is targeting me."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, numerous thoughts surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the empire, and even the entire Myriad Nations Plateau, it was the domain of the twelve main gods of the Sea of Light.</p><p></p><p>In addition, any demigod who wanted to spread their own faith was considered heretical.</p><p></p><p>Even the twelve main gods of the Dark Abyss were no exception.</p><p></p><p>However, since ancient times, the matter of demigods secretly spreading their own faith on the Myriad Nations Plateau had never stopped.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it. The amount of faith in this region was simply too abundant. Many seven-star level demigods couldn't resist this temptation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook.

        <h1>Chapter 606</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Heixiao, I'll go in first as well."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint instantly appeared in front of the entrance to the Xuanhuang Universe, then strode in.</p><p></p><p>The slap from Lin Yuan had caused Heixiao Great Saint's Heixiao Domain to contract, unable to suppress the space-time any longer. The Savage Great Saint immediately traversed the void to the outside of the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Tianluo Great Saint, Yingmo Great Saint, and the other six Great Saints subsequently entered the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Heixiao Great Saint was slapped by Lin Yuan into a dazed state, allowing the last six Great Saints to seize the opportunity and rush into the Xuanhuang Universe ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, these Great Saints were destined to enter the Xuanhuang Universe after the fifth one, but Heixiao Great Saint being knocked away had collectively elevated their entry order by one rank.</p><p></p><p>"Us..."</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Venerable observing from afar were immediately stirred. Now that the space-time suppression was lost, even the weakest Chaos Venerable could instantly traverse the void to the entrance and then enter.</p><p></p><p>The conflict between the Shuangyuan Great Saint, Heixiao Great Saint, and the others had made them realize the extraordinary nature of this post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>But before any of the Chaos Venerables could make a move,</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>An extremely dark aura frantically spread in all directions, and Heixiao Great Saint reacted, with his invisible Heixiao Domain beginning to spread madly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Heixiao Great Saint was extremely frustrated, "That Shuangyuan guy schemed against me."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Heixiao Great Saint also realized that Shuangyuan Great Saint did not actually have the means to hold back Lin Yuan for too long, or even if he did, he would not use them.</p><p></p><p>As long as Shuangyuan Great Saint could enter first, that was all that mattered. </p><p></p><p>As for Heixiao Great Saint? Entering later, Shuangyuan Great Saint might have one less competitor.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Heixiao Great Saint appeared almost simultaneously next to the entrance of the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the previously restless Chaos Venerables, they instantly became very obedient - if Heixiao Great Saint did not enter, they absolutely would not approach.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when Heixiao Great Saint was knocked away, some of the Chaos Venerables had reddened their eyes, but upon further reflection, even if they could rush into the Xuanhuang Universe first, what would it matter? The Tianluo Great Saint and the other six Great Saints dared to rush in because they were also Great Saints, at least having a chance to save their lives. </p><p></p><p>But these Chaos Venerables? Facing the enraged Heixiao Great Saint? What could they use to resist? If they really entered the Xuanhuang Universe first and provoked Heixiao Great Saint's wrath, pursuing them into the universe, who could survive leaving this universe?</p><p></p><p>After calming down, all the Venerables naturally knew what to do.</p><p></p><p>"I've really messed up this time."</p><p></p><p>Before entering the Xuanhuang Universe, a sense of regret surged in Heixiao Great Saint's heart.</p><p></p><p>If he had not joined forces with Shuangyuan Great Saint, he could have secured the third or second place to enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>But now? He was the tenth to enter the universe.</p><p></p><p>If he had not recovered in time, some of the Venerables might have entered the universe before him.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully it's not too late, this post-heaven universe was left behind by the Xuanhuang Great Saint thousands of universe eras ago." Heixiao Great Saint's figure disappeared as he entered the universe.</p><p></p><p>Just like Shuangyuan Great Saint, Heixiao Great Saint also knew some of the background of this universe, aware of how powerful the Xuanhuang Great Saint had been in the past.</p><p></p><p>That was a peerless Great Saint who, with his own power, established a dominion spanning tens of thousands of void realms. If not for an unexpected incident that caused the Xuanhuang Great Saint to mysteriously disappear, in a few dozen or a few hundred universe eras, the Xuanhuang Great Saint might have become the legendary invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>To become an invincible Great Saint, one not only needed the strength to sweep away other peerless Great Saints, but also the time to prove it, allowing the other peerless Great Saints to acknowledge their own inferiority.</p><p></p><p>And this required a long, long time.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Great Saint? At the peak of his power, he suddenly disappeared, never receiving the recognition of all the peerless Great Saints of that era.</p><p></p><p>After Heixiao Great Saint entered the Xuanhuang Universe,</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a large number of Chaos Venerables immediately boiled over, quickly traversing the void and rushing into the Xuanhuang Universe as well.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still quite a few Chaos Venerables who did not make any moves, not entering the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"This post-heaven universe may be extraordinary, but what does it have to do with us? Ten Great Saints have gone in, and so many peak Venerables have also gone in. Even if there are precious treasures and rarities, they will all be divided up. If we go in, not only will we not get any treasures, we might even lose our lives."</p><p></p><p>Many Chaos Venerables were very clear-headed. The confrontation between Lin Yuan, Heixiao Great Saint, and the others had made many Chaos Venerables realize the reality.</p><p></p><p>A large part of the Venerables, although they knew of the Great Saints' power and had seen Great Saints clash before, had never encountered a situation like the recent conflict between Heixiao, Shuangyuan, and the other four Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Great Saints generally rarely fought each other, especially those powerful ones.</p><p></p><p>The impact caused by the clash between Lin Yuan, Heixiao, and the others had allowed some Venerables to deeply realize their own weakness.</p><p></p><p>If it were just ordinary Great Saints, they might still have a chance to muddle through, but these overwhelmingly powerful Great Saints? How could they muddle through?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that many peak Venerables had also gone in.</p><p></p><p>"Although we're not going in, just witnessing such high-level Great Saints clash in person is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, even if we've seen images of past Great Saint battles, how can those images compare to the real scene in terms of impact?"</p><p></p><p>"You all must remember that last Great Saint who appeared. In the future, if you encounter him, absolutely do not provoke him."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerable Ones were quite relaxed, but after giving up on entering the Xuanhuang Universe, they naturally didn't have much pressure in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have just transmitted the images of the previous battle to many of my good friends, so that they can also pay attention to it," said one of the Chaos Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the reputation of the Chaos Supremes will spread across countless void domains.</p><p></p><p>As long as they take action once and are noticed by other Chaos Venerable Ones, the news will spread from one to ten, ten to a hundred, and a hundred to a thousand.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Lin Yuan, who possesses the powerful strength of a Supreme, but has never had any relevant information or intelligence, is rare. He can only be attributed to the Supremes from the ancient eras, and the lives that knew his information have long perished in the past.</p><p></p><p>Further away, </p><p></p><p>within a distorted space-time, several massive consciousnesses were gazing from afar.</p><p></p><p>These massive consciousnesses were vaguely manifesting in different forms, some with giant eyes, some with ancient and mottled altars, and even a broken long sword.</p><p></p><p>"This person has not evolved the path of Chaos power, yet his strength can actually rival that of the Chaos Realm Perfected, remarkable, truly remarkable," the ancient and mottled altar spirit emitted a soul fluctuation, revealing a sense of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They were all special existences, not normal lives, but means left behind by the Thirteenth Hierarchy beings. They had gained sentience and had seen countless Chaos Supremes and Peerless Supremes over the eons.</p><p></p><p>But someone like Lin Yuan, this was the first time they had seen.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Lin Yuan's strength was particularly powerful, but that a life that had not even mastered the Chaos evolutionary power could actually fight evenly with those at the Chaos Realm Perfected.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level of insight, the more they could perceive the difficulty within.</p><p></p><p>Why could the Chaos Realm Perfected far surpass the Venerable Ones? Essentially, both were in the Chaos Realm, but the former had evolved their own path of power from the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>This was a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>And also the prerequisite for breaking through to the Thirteenth Hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that his foundation is terrifyingly powerful, perhaps he has obtained a certain Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritance?" the broken long sword also emitted a soul fluctuation. Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritance? For Twelfth Hierarchy beings, it was something that was hard to come by, and even many Chaos Supremes and Peerless Supremes had never heard of it.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of these special existences, Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritances were not a secret. They even knew the locations of certain Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritances. Many ancient and powerful Thirteenth Hierarchy beings would deliberately leave behind their own inheritances when they were in the mood.</p><p></p><p>However, these inheritances were related to a certain Thirteenth Hierarchy time being, and even though they, as special existences, knew about them, they dared not leak them to the outside. After all, Thirteenth Hierarchy beings could see through the past and future, and there were basically no secrets that could be hidden from them.</p><p></p><p>If the location of their own left-behind inheritances were to be leaked and taken advantage of, even though they were the handiwork of a Thirteenth Hierarchy being, the consequences would not be good, at the very least their current consciousness would be erased.</p><p></p><p>"Even if he has obtained a Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritance, for him to cultivate it to this level is still very difficult," the ancient and mottled altar spirit said.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritances indeed had extremely extraordinary effects, but to cultivate them? It was equally difficult, and some Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritances didn't even have the possibility of being cultivated, completely belonging to the theoretical speculation of the creator.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, it seems that in the not-too-distant future, the Chaos Void will have another invincible Supreme," the broken long sword spoke.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the other consciousnesses did not refute them at all.</p><p></p><p>With the strength Lin Yuan had currently revealed, as long as he evolved his own Chaos-specific power, becoming a Peerless Supreme was a certainty. And if he cultivated that Thirteenth Hierarchy inheritance to a certain level, he would steadily become an invincible Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"In my Chaos Void, how long has it been since a new invincible Supreme was born? Who was the last invincible Supreme? Was it called 'Demon Jade'?" the ancient and mottled altar spirit casually said.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the others, the consciousness manifesting as a giant eye, the All-Seeing Eye, did not say much.</p><p></p><p>"This galaxy is much stronger than I imagined," the All-Seeing Eye secretly marveled, for it understood Lin Yuan better than the other special existences.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the battle outside the Xuanhuang Universe quickly spread across countless void domains.</p><p></p><p>Especially the confrontation between the four Supremes - Lin Yuan, Shuangyuan, Heixiao, and Kuangman - made many Chaos Venerable Ones tremble.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the strength of these four Supremes was a level above the other six Supremes.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, the Ancient Ming Venerable One also received the image footage of the battle from the outside of the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Chaos Supreme," the Ancient Ming Venerable One sighed, "The Nine Phoenix Supreme and the Shadow Demon Supreme are also there?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable One immediately recognized these two Supremes. Not long ago, the Chaos Continent he was in had been forced to relocate here due to the fierce battle between these two Supremes.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of these four Supremes," the Ancient Ming Venerable One trembled, but soon noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>"The last Supreme that appeared, why does he look so much like 'Brother Silver'?" the Ancient Ming Venerable One was shocked.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

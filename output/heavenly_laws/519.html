        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Lord, what is your true strength level?" the Xia Qin Supreme Being couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, after Lin Yuan had advanced to the 12th level, he had told them that he was equivalent to the peak of the Path-Breaking Realm. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the nine Supreme Beings of human civilization were amazed. The peak of Path-Breaking Realm was already a level they could only dream of reaching.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Peak of Path-Breaking Realm? Could someone at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm casually subdue dozens of ultimate 12th level beings with a wave of their hand?</p><p></p><p>And these dozens of ultimate 12th level beings were even under the protection of a peak Path-Breaking Realm defensive treasure.</p><p></p><p>Forget about Lin Yuan being at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm, as the nine Supreme Beings of human civilization observed from afar the dozens of avatars Lin Yuan casually conjured, they felt that any single avatar had strength close to the peak of Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Within the universe, I'm at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm," Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Under the overall suppression of the universe, Lin Yuan could only maintain combat power at the peak of Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of Path-Breaking Realm?" The Virtual God Supreme Being blinked. Could the peak of Path-Breaking Realm really be this strong?</p><p></p><p>"If it's the peak of Path-Breaking Realm within the universe, then what about outside the universe?" the Xuanyuan Supreme Being suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>From the first time Lin Yuan answered about his strength until now, he had always added the limitation of "within the universe" before saying peak of Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>At first the Xuanyuan Supreme Being didn't think much of it, after all they also lived within the universe. It wasn't until witnessing Lin Yuan's terrifying power that he realized something was off.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the universe, it would be equivalent to the Sovereign Realm," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>His realm was at the peak of Path-Breaking, but his accumulation and foundation in various aspects were unprecedented. His overall combat power was not at all inferior to the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Realm?" The hearts of Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the others violently contracted.</p><p></p><p>They had received some inheritances from the chaotic void and knew how terrifying Sovereign Realm powerhouses were. It was a domain completely transcending the Path-Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this claim was very likely to be true. If Lin Yuan didn't have Sovereign Realm strength, how could the avatars he casually conjured unleash such terrifying combat power?</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Realm? Just entering 12th level and already Sovereign Realm?" the Xia Qin Supreme Being said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Although they had long known that with Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude, as long as he could break through to 12th level, he would inevitably surpass them very quickly.</p><p></p><p>But this speed was too fast, right? It had only been a few days since breaking through to 12th level?</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Lord, how do you plan to deal with those alien 12th level beings?" the Guli Supreme Being asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Them? Just keep them suppressed for now," Lin Yuan said carelessly.</p><p></p><p>These 12th level aliens had all fallen into Lin Yuan's hands. Even if he couldn't do anything to them now, it was only a matter of time given Lin Yuan's growth rate.</p><p></p><p>"Suppressing them is good," the Xuanyuan Supreme Being nodded.</p><p></p><p>If these 12th level beings were really released, there would be certain hidden dangers. Directly suppressing them now was the simplest solution.</p><p></p><p>"What about the other races?" asked the Xuanyuan Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>All the alien 12th level beings had been suppressed by Lin Yuan. Now this universe could be said to have become the backyard of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Those peak races, having lost the protection of their 12th level ancestors, would have no ability to resist human civilization even if Lin Yuan didn't take action.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't even need human civilization to make a move - those peak races would surrender on their own initiative.</p><p></p><p>As for the powerful races and ordinary races beyond the peak races, it was even more so. The same went for the powerful ancient gods who had originally been free and unfettered.</p><p></p><p>Originally they could still leverage the forces of the 12 peak races to balance each other and seek certain benefits for themselves. Now there was only human civilization left.</p><p></p><p>These free and unfettered ancient gods no longer dared to remain undecided. They would naturally choose to submit to human civilization without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"As for them..." Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The powerful races and ordinary races were controlled by the peak races and had little autonomy. Lin Yuan did not intend to save them.</p><p></p><p>As for the forces of the ten peak races... "Incorporate all the powerful races, ordinary races, and weak races into human civilization. Try to integrate the peak races as much as possible. As for the 9th level and above powerhouses of the major peak races, just kill them all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>9th level and above lifeforms had extremely long lifespans. Leaving such powerhouses behind would still pose hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on the alien battlefield, basically every 9th level alien had their hands stained with the blood of countless human civilization evolvers. It would be simpler to just kill them all.</p><p></p><p>As for the peak race members below 9th level? They could be kept, but of course many measures would need to be implemented to restrict their growth at the genetic level.</p><p></p><p>Bloodlines that could grow into peak races were certainly extraordinary. Human civilization might have use for them as reference in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the other eight Supreme Beings nodded.</p><p></p><p>There was no hint of pleading or sympathy.</p><p></p><p>The struggle between races was inherently cruel. If the Galaxy Lord had come from another peak race force instead of human civilization,</p><p></p><p>The fate of human civilization would probably be much worse than these peak race forces. This universe might not even have the human race existing in the future.</p><p></p><p>From a certain perspective, Lin Yuan was already quite merciful. At least he gave those peak race bloodlines a chance to be passed down.</p><p></p><p>The battle where the ten peak races gathered all their strength to fight human civilization to the death ended in this manner.</p><p></p><p>The remaining major peak races all chose to submit to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Our race has defeated human civilization many times on the battlefield. Surrender? I don't want to surrender!"</p><p></p><p>"If you don't surrender then you'll die. Take your pick."</p><p></p><p>Many members of the peak races found themselves in a dilemma, but most</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Most still chose to submit.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization didn't pressure them too much about this, especially the ordinary members of those peak clans. Basically, their lives continued as before.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that the rulers had changed to the human civilization, and their daily lives were now under surveillance, but at least they survived.</p><p></p><p>"The human civilization will be the absolute ruler for the long ages to come," said the Ancient God Sizhong, bringing the Traveler Maduo along with other special life ancient gods, as they descended onto one of the main planets in the human civilization's territory.</p><p></p><p>This main planet was specifically used to register the many special life forms that had pledged allegiance to the human civilization. Once invincible and powerful ancient gods now stood in line outside this planet.</p><p></p><p>Even eleventh-level perfected ancient gods didn't dare cause trouble, and obediently followed the rules set by the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"You're Ancient God Sizhong, right? The great Galactic Lord once said that if Ancient God Sizhong came, he should be directly granted the position of Class A Guest Elder," a human evolver immediately said upon seeing Ancient God Sizhong.</p><p></p><p>"Class A Guest Elder?" Ancient God Sizhong felt a surge of joy.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization divided the powerful ancient gods who pledged allegiance into four levels.</p><p></p><p>A, B, C, and D.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient gods who once stood in opposition to the human civilization, regardless of their strength, were all classified as Class D Guest Elders.</p><p></p><p>Class D Guest Elders had the lowest status among guest elders. They needed to guard secret realms on frontier planets, enduring for hundreds of millions or billions of years and accumulating enough merits before having the chance to be promoted to Class C Guest Elders.</p><p></p><p>As for Class C Guest Elders? They were basically the ancient gods from the human civilization's alliance.</p><p></p><p>Class B Guest Elders were ancient gods who had made contributions to the human civilization. These contributions were limited to the period when various peak clans coexisted.</p><p></p><p>As for Class A Guest Elders? Ancient gods at this level had some say within the human civilization, basically faced no restrictions, and could even enjoy many benefits from the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Ancient God Sizhong becoming a Class A Guest Elder of the human civilization would likely lead to an even more comfortable life than before.</p><p></p><p>"Sizhong, congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>"Sizhong, you must give us a hand in the future."</p><p></p><p>Many powerful ancient gods looked at Ancient God Sizhong with envy.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, of course, of course." Ancient God Sizhong's face broke into a smile, and he was overjoyed inside.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought the Galactic Lord might not even remember him, considering he had failed in his task of contacting Ancient God Tuoba for the Galactic Lord back then.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed the Galactic Lord still valued loyalty. He remembered even that small bit of help and rewarded it so generously.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I'm also a Class B Guest Elder," the Traveler Maduo couldn't help but say beside him.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the invincible ninth-level Tianyu clan member had asked him to use karma to locate the Galactic Lord's position, but Maduo had refused.</p><p></p><p>Maduo even thought the Galactic Lord might not know about this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord..." Ancient God Sizhong said with emotion, feeling that the most correct thing he had done in his life was to become acquainted with the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>Central Star Region.</p><p></p><p>The core area of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood shoulder to shoulder with Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings, gazing at the vast starry universe.</p><p></p><p>"With so many powerful beings pledging allegiance, if it weren't for the three goddesses, we really wouldn't be able to handle it all," said Supreme Being Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>Each of the ten peak clans had a scale no weaker than the human civilization. Their collective submission was equivalent to the human civilization suddenly swallowing ten times its own size in food.</p><p></p><p>Add to that the powerful clans, weak clans, and special life forms.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the three goddesses had terrifying computational power, allowing everything to proceed in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Galactic Lord, your evolution tower has been established," said Supreme Being Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan reached the twelfth level, the nine supreme beings had been preparing to build the tenth evolution tower.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's in the central star region of human civilization," said Supreme Being Xiaqin.</p><p></p><p>Including Supreme Being Xuanyuan's, the nine evolution towers of human civilization were all stationed at the edges of their territory to deter enemy peak clan forces.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The human civilization no longer had any enemy forces.</p><p></p><p>And all of this was because of Lin Yuan, so naturally, Lin Yuan's evolution tower was established in the center of human civilization, symbolizing the strongest evolution tower of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Have you thought of a name for the evolution tower?" Supreme Being Yudie smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Martial Dao Evolution Tower," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Evolution towers were related to the evolution path taken by supreme beings. Lin Yuan's evolution tower would naturally be called the Martial Dao Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, let's go sit in your evolution tower together," Supreme Being Xiaqin said with a smile. "It'll also help you get familiar with it. Xuanyuan and the others put in a lot of effort to build that evolution tower."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, thank you all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up and went with the nine supreme beings to visit the tenth evolution tower of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>(End of this volume) The next volume - Universe's Great Collapse - will begin tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>The plot about the Chaos Void and Origin World will also gradually unfold.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I realize this book has reached two million words, which is quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>So I'll take this chance to ask for some monthly votes~ (PS: These last few lines are not charged)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 679</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The venerable ones who were carefully observing the nearby void domain were also unable to react.</p><p></p><p>The supreme great sage had arrived at the Milky Way Chaos Continent, summoning the Milky Way Great Sage to come out and meet him. Although his posture was slightly arrogant, it was still in line with the identity of the supreme great sage.</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Great Sage's strength was indeed terrifying, sweeping away the Chaos Great Sages with ease, but based on his performance in the Xuanhuang Universe, he was still a little short of being a true supreme great sage.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan acted with the purpose of establishing his might, the scene of the two supreme great sages being annihilated was not obscured, and the Sovereign Realm experts could see it clearly, while the venerable ones could see it even more distinctly.</p><p></p><p>Countless experts watched in dismay as the two supreme great sages with terrifying auras were completely annihilated under the scorching sun formed by the Milky Way Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>There was no struggle. </p><p></p><p>No resistance.</p><p></p><p>They melted away as easily as ice and snow encountering sunlight.</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>How could the supreme great sages be so weak? Or was the Milky Way Great Sage too strong?</p><p></p><p>But even if he was that strong, how could he kill the supreme great sages as easily as killing ants?</p><p></p><p>The venerable ones felt a sense of absurdity. The supreme great sages who were so lofty and domineering in the chaotic void, actually had such a fragile day?</p><p></p><p>"Were those two really supreme great sages?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've heard of their reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Just how strong is the Milky Way Great Sage!"</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the many experts completely erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the scene of the Milky Way Great Sage's decisive strike against the two supreme great sages quickly spread through the circles of the venerable ones.</p><p></p><p>The vast chaotic void, the battles between supreme great sages were already rare, let alone such a one-sided crushing? Two supreme great sages being one-sidedly crushed?</p><p></p><p>In the largest city of the Milky Way Chaos Continent, the human civilization's Nine Sovereigns looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Milky Way..." Xuanyuan Sovereign, as if dreaming, had been greatly alarmed when the two supreme great sages arrived, fearing that Lin Yuan would suffer some loss before them.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the supreme great sages turned out to be so fragile?</p><p></p><p>"This is too terrifying," the Void God Sovereign found it hard to believe. Since the beginning of his home universe, he had already sensed Lin Yuan's terrifying talent.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was indeed the case, leading the entire human civilization through the cosmic great destruction, establishing a foothold in the chaotic void, and now opening up the Milky Way Chaos Continent, making the human civilization clan the absolute overlord of the surrounding tens of thousands of void domains.</p><p></p><p>But now? The scene of those two supreme great sages being wiped out like bubbles left the Void God Sovereign in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Those were the supreme great sages, the top experts of the chaotic void with millions of years of history.</p><p></p><p>Yet they were killed by the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Milky Way has already crossed into the Thirteenth Realm?" the Feather Butterfly Sovereign couldn't help but say, as such an effortless killing of supreme great sages seemed beyond their capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"He shouldn't have crossed yet," the Summer Qin Sovereign thought for a moment and continued, "To cross into the Thirteenth Realm would definitely cause earth-shattering phenomena."</p><p></p><p>The other Sovereigns nodded in agreement, deeply convinced, and their spirits were greatly exhilarated at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan came from the human civilization, the stronger his strength became, the more the human civilization could bask in his glory.</p><p></p><p>In the gloomy secret realm, the bald man's true body suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The bald man dared not believe it, his mind constantly flashing with the scene of the Milky Way Great Sage's incarnation as the Eternal Scorching Sun illuminating the entire universe, and he couldn't help but tremble with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong, too strong."</p><p></p><p>The bald man swallowed hard, even when facing the Rahu Great Sage, he had never felt such a suffocating pressure.</p><p></p><p>The Rahu Great Sage was indeed very strong, especially the Thirteenth Realm inheritance he had cultivated, but no matter how strong, the bald man still felt he could struggle and resist.</p><p></p><p>But facing Lin Yuan, the bald man didn't even have the thought of struggling and resisting.</p><p></p><p>"That Milky Way Great Sage..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a thin figure descended in the form of an incarnation, sitting in front of the bald man.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme great sages were close in relationship, otherwise they wouldn't have worked together for the Rahu Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>"How could such a strong one be born in this chaotic void?" the bald man looked at the thin figure, saying something unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either," the thin figure shook his head, he was also very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"But the Milky Way Great Sage has only annihilated our main combat incarnations, and has not attacked our other incarnations, it seems we should be safe?" the thin figure sighed with relief.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The bald man heard this and was also certain.</p><p></p><p>Since the Milky Way Great Sage could instantly annihilate all the incarnations of the Nine Phoenixes Shadow Demon's life-saving methods, he must be proficient in the art of causal curse killing. Such a powerful expert would not only be able to curse and kill their numerous incarnations, but could also clearly lock onto the causal origins of all of them.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto the causal origins and then eliminating them one by one, with the Milky Way Great Sage's strength, they, the two supreme great sages, had no chance of resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the only way for them to survive might be to give up and undergo reincarnation together.</p><p></p><p>But even for supreme great sages, reincarnation also carries risks. If it fails, the result would be an eternal fall into the cycle of reincarnation, which would be much more tragic than being trapped in a time loop.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now? About the Rahu Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Sage's strength is too powerful, I'm sure the Rahu Great Sage won't blame us." The bald man said, "But we still have to go see the Rahu Great Sage and explain the situation."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>The thin figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>They were only working for the Rahu Great Sage, not his servants, and had the right to choose.</p><p></p><p>Even an invincible great sage would not easily push a supreme great sage too hard.</p><p></p><p>In the majestic palace, towering in the deepest reaches of time and space, the throne at the highest point was occupied by a figure shrouded in gray mist.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Sage?" </p><p></p><p>The gray-misted figure was none other than the Rahu Great Sage. At this moment, he murmured to himself, as images of the scene outside the Milky Way Chaos Continent constantly flashed before him.</p><p></p><p>The token he had bestowed was crushed, and the incarnation he had sent down had naturally also witnessed Lin Yuan's action.</p><p></p><p>"Just how many Thirteenth Realm inheritances has this Milky Way Great Sage cultivated?" The gray-misted figure found it hard to believe. Although it was only a brief glimpse, he could vaguely sense that during the annihilation of his incarnation, the Thirteenth Realm forces involved were estimated to be three or four kinds.</p><p></p><p>Such as the ubiquitous time and space suppression, and the scorching sun incarnation of the Milky Way Great Sage, etc. </p><p></p><p>All of them contained powers that surpassed the Twelfth Realm, likely being some kind of Thirteenth Realm inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"Three or four Thirteenth Realm inheritances, not only have they all been cultivated...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Sage of the Milky Way - How could he have perfectly fused the two Thirteen Realms Inheritances together? The Great Sage Rahu just couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>After mastering one Thirteen Realms Inheritance, trying to cultivate a second Thirteen Realms Inheritance would drastically increase the difficulty. The Thirteen Realms Inheritance contains the power of the Thirteen Realms, and it's already arduous to bear the power of the Thirteen Realms with a Twelve Realms cultivation base, let alone carrying more than one type?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bald man and the thin figure appeared in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>The bald man and the thin figure slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"No need to say more, I already know."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sage Rahu looked down at the two supreme great sages: "From now on, you don't need to worry about that Milky Way Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The bald man and the thin figure responded. Even if Great Sage Rahu asked them to deal with the Milky Way Great Sage, the two supreme great sages would refuse. What a joke? To deal with the Milky Way Great Sage? It's no different from seeking death. "Great Sage Rahu, the Milky Way Great Sage..."</p><p></p><p>The bald man tentatively asked. They only knew that the Milky Way Great Sage was very strong, but they didn't know the specifics of how strong he was.</p><p></p><p>But Great Sage Rahu's strength was far beyond theirs, so he probably understood more than they did.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Sage...is very, very strong. I am far from being his match."</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu fell silent for a while and spoke truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only caught a fleeting glimpse of a clone, and hadn't even seen the Milky Way Great Sage's true strength, Great Sage Rahu was well aware that he was far from being the Milky Way Great Sage's match. </p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a clone, it shared the same spiritual will, and at that time, Great Sage Rahu felt as if the entire Chaotic Void was collapsing upon him.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu had a feeling that even if he faced the Milky Way Great Sage's true self, the result would be no different - he would be reduced to ashes under the scorching sun the Milky Way Great Sage had manifested.</p><p></p><p>The bald man and the thin figure fell silent at Great Sage Rahu's candor.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme great sages indeed felt that Great Sage Rahu was not as strong as the Milky Way Great Sage, and the pressure from the two was different.</p><p></p><p>But Great Sage Rahu's frank admission made the bald man and the thin figure even more alarmed.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the gap in strength was not only present, but also exceptionally large, to the point that Great Sage Rahu didn't even have the desire to fight.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you don't need to follow me anymore. Go do as you please."</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu looked at the two supreme great sages and sighed inwardly. He had originally planned to sweep through the Chaotic Void and establish his reputation as the "Invincible Great Sage", which was why he had recruited some supreme great sages to serve under him in the future to dominate a vast expanse of the void.</p><p></p><p>Every Invincible Great Sage would typically build their own power base with many followers. </p><p></p><p>But now? Great Sage Rahu knew that this plan could not be realized.</p><p></p><p>With the Milky Way Great Sage around, even if he possessed the typical strength of an Invincible Great Sage, he could never become the true Invincible Great Sage, because he was simply no match for the Milky Way Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The bald man and the thin figure looked at each other and did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>As supreme great sages, their willingness to follow Great Sage Rahu was based on the expectation that he would one day become an Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>Now that this possibility was gone, the bald man and the thin figure naturally had no intention of continuing to follow him.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu watched as the bald man and the thin figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He then gradually dismissed the other great sages he had recruited, and finally completely sealed off the palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Void, vast and ancient - no matter how strong one's cultivation, it can only reign for a time. Only by breaking through to the Thirteen Realms and becoming a being of time and life can one attain true freedom."</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Rahu's mind was at peace, and he was about to immediately attempt the breakthrough to the Thirteen Realms.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he had reached the pinnacle in all aspects - his realm, strength, and understanding of the power of the Thirteen Realms Inheritance, etc.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his plan to leave his mark in the Chaotic Void and establish his reputation as the Invincible Great Sage, he would have started the breakthrough to the Thirteen Realms long ago.</p><p></p><p>In the distorted space-time.</p><p></p><p>Several special existence consciousnesses were watching the distant Milky Way Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"This Milky Way Great Sage is not one of the top five or top three Invincible Great Sages in the history of the Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the broken sword said: "He is the strongest Invincible Great Sage. Even the earliest primal lifeforms born at the dawn of the Chaotic Void would not be able to match the current Milky Way Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>The broken sword's consciousness spoke with a sense of awe. They had observed closely and discovered even more of Lin Yuan's depths. Although effortlessly annihilating two supreme great sages was just a casual strike, in the eyes of these special existences, the power involved was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest Invincible Great Sage..."</p><p></p><p>The other special existence consciousnesses sighed deeply. The primal lifeforms born at the dawn of the Chaotic Void, endowed with the creative power of the Chaotic Void's birth, had such abundant foundations, yet they were still no match for the Milky Way Great Sage? Even these special existences found it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly has the Milky Way Great Sage cultivated?"</p><p></p><p>The consciousness of the ancient altar spirit said, as it simply defied common sense.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Sage..." The Myriad Laws Eye was delighted.</p><p></p><p>It had high expectations for Lin Yuan, but it didn't expect him to grow to this extent - the strongest Invincible Great Sage in the history of the Chaotic Void?</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the news of the battle outside the Milky Way Chaotic Continent spread with a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>Many Chaotic Sages and even supreme great sages witnessed the scene of the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong."</p><p>"Not a match."</p><p>"I'm not a match either."</p><p>"How can we resist? This battle, the Milky Way Great Sage probably didn't even use his full strength."</p><p></p><p>Many ancient supreme great sages, after seeing the battle footage, had no desire to challenge him at all, directly admitting their inferiority.</p><p></p><p>As supreme great sages, they had a very clear grasp of their own strength. If it were just a slight gap, they would not have surrendered so readily. But the difference between them and the Milky Way Great Sage was not just a small gap, it was simply abysmal.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Great Sage is the Invincible Great Sage of this era."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the undisputed Invincible Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>Some supreme great sages voiced this opinion, and although it did not receive the full endorsement of the many supreme great sages, none of them opposed it either.</p><p></p><p>Who dared to oppose it?</p><p></p><p>And for the supreme great sages, not opposing meant tacit acceptance.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Milky Way Chaotic Continent, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also felt the impact his actions had caused on the Chaotic Void, to the point that he was already recognized as the Invincible Great Sage of this era.</p><p></p><p>"Invincible Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was strange. The Invincible Great Sages in the history of the Chaotic Void had all experienced countless fierce battles, defeating those supreme great sages and finally earning the title of Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>But he had only acted once, and was already recognized as the Invincible Great Sage?</p><p></p><p>"However, with my current strength, I doubt any special place spirit would dare to be my enemy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded, thinking about the blurry future timeline fragments he had seen under the influence of the Heavenly Void Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

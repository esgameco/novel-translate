        <h1>Chapter 592</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanli immediately retracted the Scorching Sun Divine Body, and the vast and boundless Scorching Sun World quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River, with your strength, I estimate you can even rival those Celestial Emperors."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>A normally grown-to-the-limit core royal clan, relying solely on their own strength, could at most exchange a few moves with a Celestial Emperor. As for truly fighting with full force? They would definitely lose to the Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the feeling Lin Yuan gave the Crimson Treasure King was no less than those Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan did not use his full strength, and the two sides only collided in the Scorching Sun World.</p><p></p><p>If they truly fought, there would still be too many variables, and the strongest aspect of the Celestial Emperors was not the Scorching Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>But the Crimson Treasure King still had this feeling.</p><p></p><p>"I should still not be a match for the Celestial Emperors," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're not, the gap is not that much," the Crimson Treasure King said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, upon hearing this, did not deny it.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan's strength was already very close to the true Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>In fact, to say he was on par with them would be completely fine, as Lin Yuan could now go back and forth with some newly ascended Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Once I cultivate the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', and my inner universe undergoes another major transformation, I will be able to truly contend with the Celestial Emperors and Chaos Supremes," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' was only meant to allow Lin Yuan's inner universe to reach a scale close to that of a Chaos Supreme.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he would still not be a true match for a Chaos Supreme.</p><p></p><p>But the fusion and devouring of the Scorching Sun Source in his inner universe caused an unexpected transformation and enhancement.</p><p></p><p>As a result, even before Lin Yuan cultivated the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', he already possessed an inner universe at the Supremes level.</p><p></p><p>It could be predicted that once the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' was cultivated, Lin Yuan's inner universe would likely surpass the normal Chaos Supremes' inner universes.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if there were shortcomings in other aspects, on average, he would be a true Supreme-level combat force.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, good, good, good!" The Crimson Treasure King was delighted in his heart. The stronger Lin Yuan became, the happier he was, as it meant the Scorching Sun Ancient Country's royal clan lineage would have greater backing in the future.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan could not break through the Celestial Emperor's shackles, with his current strength, he would be able to stand tall against those Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River, when will you come with me to the capital?" the Crimson Treasure King asked.</p><p></p><p>He was now impatient to take Lin Yuan back.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a bit longer," Lin Yuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>According to the current speed of the transformation and tempering of his bloodline, it would take about a few more months before he could reach a blood concentration close to the core royal clan.</p><p></p><p>Only then would Lin Yuan be able to go to the capital without any worries.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the Crimson Treasure King nodded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't ask further why they had to wait a bit longer, as this was Lin Yuan's own matter.</p><p></p><p>"This spatial-temporal fluctuation?" </p><p></p><p>Below, Crimson Pine King and Crimson Jade King were receiving those young men and women.</p><p></p><p>These young men and women had come with the Crimson Treasure King to provide support for the war on this side. The Crimson Treasure King was an extreme limit core royal clan, and the Spiritual Monarch was as well. </p><p></p><p>The peak combat strengths of the two sides were about the same, so at this time, having an additional Great Emperor was very important, especially since these young men and women were royal clan Great Emperors, with strengths on par with ordinary peak Great Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Crimson Treasure King sparring with Senior Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Jade King's pupils shrank slightly, and the expressions of the other few also changed.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King was recognized as an extreme limit core royal clan, and Senior Silver River was the same. Killing the Spiritual Monarch was proof of his strength.</p><p></p><p>These two were sparring? "The Crimson Treasure King"</p><p></p><p>The young men and women looked at each other, and since they had come with the Crimson Treasure King, they naturally hoped the Crimson Treasure King would win.</p><p></p><p>The royal clan lineage of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country was also divided into many branches, and the branch with an extreme limit core royal clan as its pillar was absolutely powerful.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the young men and women changed.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Treasure King lost?"</p><p></p><p>Although they could not perceive the specifics, they could still feel the two extremely scorching auras colliding, and the aura belonging to the Crimson Treasure King was clearly at a disadvantage. Finally, the two scorching auras quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the sparring had ended.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Silver River is too strong," Crimson Pine King couldn't help but sigh inwardly. Perhaps when Lin Yuan killed that Spiritual Monarch, the latter had just recently reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>But the Crimson Treasure King? He was an old-school extreme limit core royal clan.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Crimson Jade King's expression was also one of amazement. He could see that Lin Yuan and the Crimson Treasure King were only sparring slightly, but the latter conceded so quickly, which also showed how powerful Lin Yuan's strength was.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Pine, you're really lucky," Crimson Jade King looked at Crimson Pine King and said.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan, the two of them wouldn't be sitting here chatting so leisurely now.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Crimson Pine King nodded.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, a few months had gone by.</p><p></p><p>In Qingfan City, people came and went, the prosperity still remained.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the topic of Senior Silver River was definitely the most discussed in Qingfan City. A few months ago, during the war between the two domains, when Senior Silver River took action, he had slain the Spiritual Monarch.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine King reversed the situation and saved the Qingfan Domain and dozens of other major domains.</p><p></p><p>"My friends, I have more information related to that war," said a black-skinned man in a common tavern, where a group of Eleventh-Realm cultivators had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Tell us about it."</p><p></p><p>The other Eleventh-Realm cultivators became interested, as they were not even at the Dao Realm and did not know much about the war between the two domains, only knowing that the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way played a crucial role, almost single-handedly sweeping the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong was also there.</p><p></p><p>He had just left the Yu family a few months ago and had just arrived in Qingfan City today. Over the past few months, more and more information about Lin Yuan's deeds had been confirmed, and Yu Chaolong had even heard numerous rumors about the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way killed that Spiritual Deity King?" the black-skinned man said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Deity King was an Extreme Core Imperial Clansman, with unrivaled strength. Even if the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way could kill him, it must have been an arduous battle, right?" speculated one of the Eleventh-Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This was the most logical assumption. In fact, if not for all the rumors saying that the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way had killed the Spiritual Deity King, the Eleventh-Realm cultivators present would have believed that the Spiritual Deity King had only retreated, not died.</p><p></p><p>Killing an Extreme Core Imperial Clansman, was that an easy task?</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no," the black-skinned man shook his head. "The Grand Celestial of the Milky Way killed that Spiritual Deity King without much effort, finishing him off in just a few moves."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all the other Eleventh-Realm cultivators looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Kill the Spiritual Deity King? In just a few moves?</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>"But he was an Extreme Core Imperial Clansman!"</p><p>"Could it be that the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way has already reached the Celestial Venerable Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Many Eleventh-Realm cultivators spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I don't know about that, I just know for sure that the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way is not a Celestial Venerable," the black-skinned man said. "If a Celestial Venerable had intervened, the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom would not have remained so inactive."</p><p></p><p>In wars between ancient kingdoms, the intervention of Celestial Venerables was prohibited, as a rule. Because if one side deployed a Celestial Venerable, the other side would certainly do the same.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom showed no signs of movement, indicating that the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way was not a Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you believe me?" the black-skinned man swept his gaze around the group. "You must have all heard about the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way capturing all the Grand Venerable experts from the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If the battle between the Spiritual Deity King and the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way had dragged on, those Grand Venerables from the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom would have been able to escape."</p><p></p><p>The black-skinned man said.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p>"If the Spiritual Deity King's defeat was not extremely swift, the Grand Venerables from the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom would have been able to react."</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh-Realm cultivators pondered for a moment and felt that the black-skinned man's words made sense. The Grand Celestial of the Milky Way must have overwhelmed and crushed the Spiritual Deity King without much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom would not have had all its Grand Venerables captured, becoming the Grand Celestial of the Milky Way's prisoners.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Celestial of the Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the tavern, Yu Chaolong listened quietly. He had heard such discussions too many times on his journey, and the shock in his heart had never subsided.</p><p></p><p>In the Fengtianhall, Lin Yuan sat in meditation, and the Blazing Sun Source within his body constantly emitted blazing solar radiance, resonating with the eternal blazing sun outside and drawing in mysterious, scorching energies.</p><p></p><p>Under the permeation of these scorching energies, the Blazing Sun bloodline flowing within Lin Yuan's body rapidly became more concentrated and pure.</p><p></p><p>"It has reached the threshold of the Imperial Clansman bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>In the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, there were indeed methods and techniques to refine and purify the Blazing Sun bloodline, but they were all extremely arduous, such as becoming the Emperor. Lin Yuan's ability to easily refine and temper his own bloodline was truly unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's refinement and tempering of the Blazing Sun bloodline, while appearing simple, was even more difficult than becoming the ancient kingdom's Emperor.</p><p></p><p>First, he had to awaken the "Blazing Sun Primal Chaos" divine ability, a power derived from the Blazing Sun Ancestor, which the Emperor might not even possess.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he had to possess the "Infinite Void" internal cosmos, which was even more difficult than ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Either of these two conditions alone would be more challenging than becoming the ancient kingdom's Emperor, and with both combined? Only Lin Yuan could accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and he appeared outside the Fengtianhall.</p><p></p><p>He also split off a clone to stay and guard the Fengtianhall.</p><p></p><p>The Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom still needed to ransom back its captured Grand Venerables, so Lin Yuan had to leave a clone behind to handle this and other miscellaneous matters.</p><p></p><p>At the Qingfan City spatial transmission array.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King had been waiting for a long time, and seeing Lin Yuan appear, he smiled and said, "Brother Milky Way, everything is ready?"</p><p></p><p>"It's ready."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the capital, it will be far more prosperous than this domain."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King chuckled, "Brother Milky Way, your potential can only be fully unleashed in the capital."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King immediately activated the spatial transmission array, connecting it to the distant capital, and then stepped into it. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the spatial transmission array and did not hesitate, stepping into it as well.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

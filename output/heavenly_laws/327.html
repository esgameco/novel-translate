            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 327 - Cultivation Results (Please Subscribe) </p><p></p><p>In the vast Martial Realm, since the first Martial God ascended here a hundred years ago, the originally silent and lifeless Martial Realm has gradually become lively.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Realm was created by Lin Yuan, and its scale far exceeds the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss. Even Martial Gods have not explored it to the end.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, with the ascension of Martial Gods one after another, the Martial Realm has gradually formed three regions.</p><p></p><p>One region is the gathering place of the Martial Gods of the Longshan family, centered around Longshan City. </p><p></p><p>Another region is the gathering place of Martial Gods outside the Longshan family, centered around Wanxiang City.</p><p></p><p>As for the third region, it is the cultivation place of the great Longshan Patriarch, occupying the center of the Martial Realm, where the Origin Qi is most abundant.</p><p></p><p>The spread of martial cultivation methods and the creation of the Martial Realm all originated from the Longshan Patriarch. Any Martial God who ascended from the mortal world has boundless respect for the Longshan Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>He is the peerless powerhouse who ended the era of gods and opened the martial era.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, although the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss still exist, and new gods continue to be born, they are simply incomparable to the power of the Martial Realm.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Longshan Yuan (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Wielder of the Gate of Myriad Realms] </p><p>[Innate Talent: Defying Heaven's Perception]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Rebirth from a Drop of Blood]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Moving Mountains]  </p><p>[Divine Ability: Strengthening]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Elemental Body]</p><p>[Current State: Descended Consciousness]</p><p>[Remaining Time: Three Years]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes and glanced at the illusory text below his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>"The time limit for my stay is approaching."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked ahead, and everything that happened in the vast Martial Realm was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>As the creator of this world, nothing that happens in the Martial Realm can be hidden from him. It is almost equivalent to a second inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when I killed the gods, it caused a large amount of faith to overflow in the mortal world. In addition, after several times of popularizing martial cultivation methods, the first Martial God was born in just five hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, Martial Gods correspond to the eighth stage of martial arts, but of course, there are also significant differences between the two.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of Martial Gods lies in the power of bloodline, so the cultivation speed is extremely fast before the seventh level. As long as the upper limit of the bloodline is high enough, there will be almost no bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>After the seventh level, igniting the divine fire, in theory one should hibernate for a long time, secretly gathering faith, but with the fall of the gods, there is no need to be so secretive.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Lin Yuan's existence, martial cultivators are full of confidence. After the first Martial God entered the Martial Realm, a large number of other Martial Gods were quickly born.</p><p></p><p>In just a hundred years, the number of Martial Gods in the Martial Realm has exceeded one thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Among the one thousand Martial Gods, the number of Martial Gods belonging to the Longshan family is less than one hundred?"</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the geniuses of the Longshan family are not motivated enough and cannot compare to the geniuses from other places in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this is also very normal. Even with Lin Yuan's presence, the Longshan family is still just one family after all, and the number of family members is limited, naturally far less than the masses of the mortal world in terms of population base.</p><p></p><p>However, even though the Longshan family has only a few dozen Martial Gods, they still occupy an absolute dominant position in the Martial Realm. The Martial Gods outside the Longshan family simply do not dare to offend the Martial Gods of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>And all this, of course, is because of Lin Yuan, the Longshan Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of years ago, some youngsters from the Longshan family begged me to suppress the Martial Gods outside the family and suppress the martial arts geniuses in the mortal world from the source of faith."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were calm, and he naturally did not agree to this request.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's goal has always been to better spread martial arts. As for the rise and fall of the Longshan family itself? He doesn't care much, as long as the martial cultivation method is still spreading in this world, it meets expectations.</p><p></p><p>As for limiting the development of martial cultivation methods for the sake of the Longshan family's dominance, Lin Yuan naturally would not do it.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Longshan family, Lin Yuan is gradually letting go. In the past few decades, he has not let his avatar return to Longshan Ridge in the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"Their lifespan should be reaching the limit..." Lin Yuan looked down, and everything in the mortal world was in his sight.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's help, the couple Longshan Fang reached the most perfect state allowed by this world in terms of physique.</p><p></p><p>That is, the sixth-level Legendary Knight level, directly possessing a thousand-year lifespan.</p><p></p><p>However, after a thousand years, if the divine fire is not ignited, one will still face the fate of dying of old age.</p><p></p><p>The old age here does not refer to the decay of the physical body, but the decay of the soul and even the will of the mind.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, as long as he maintains the nourishment of the inner world, the Longshan Fang couple could probably live for several thousand more years.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite is not to stop the nourishment. However, Lin Yuan will eventually return to the main world. Once he leaves, the Longshan Fang couple will lose the nourishment, and their souls and minds will quickly wither.</p><p></p><p>"Igniting the divine fire..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were deep. In this world, igniting the divine fire is of utmost importance, the dividing line between mortals and demigods.</p><p></p><p>To ignite the divine fire, one must rely on one's own unparalleled will and mind. External forces cannot play any role in this aspect, similar to the "Heart Demon Tribulation" from the seventh to the eighth stage in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Although in the past six hundred years, the number of martial demigods in the mortal world has exceeded one hundred thousand, it depends on what kind of population base it is built upon.</p><p></p><p>On average, there may not even be one martial demigod out of tens of billions of people.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Yuan's parents are just ordinary people and have not experienced any setbacks or hardships.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan's rise, their days have been very comfortable every day, and the possibility of igniting the divine fire is almost zero.</p><p></p><p>"Those who are not the strongest will eventually have to face the limit of their lifespan." Lin Yuan had an epiphany in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the face of eternal time, the minds of weak creatures will gradually become distorted and decayed. Their cognition and understanding of all things will be affected by time.</p><p></p><p>For the same thing, creatures that have lived for ten thousand years and creatures that have lived for a hundred years may have completely different views.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Immortal Kings and the gods have only lived for not long enough. If they live for another hundred million years, billion years, or ten billion years, they may go crazy and even have thoughts of suicide.</p><p></p><p>The mind and will cannot withstand the baptism of time.</p><p></p><p>Only the strongest, the ultimate existence of a certain path of evolution, a twelfth-level life, has an eternal and indestructible mind and will. They are the truly eternal ones.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even the strongest will die, but they will definitely not die due to lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"I possess the Gate of Myriad Realms and numerous life-saving means. It can be said that I will not die unless I seek death, but as long as I do not become the strongest, there will still be a day when I die, and no one will be able to save me then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart about the strongest in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There are also close relatives, parents and siblings, but as long as one does not become the strongest, there will be a day of old age and death.</p><p></p><p>The strong ones who have fully comprehended the rules of time can achieve "another kind of eternity" by controlling the flow of time on their body's surface, essentially slowing down the baptism of time on their own mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years pass in the outside world, while only one day passes for oneself. The time experienced by the mind and will is just one day.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..." Lin Yuan closed his eyes, and his consciousness descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The vast 1.995 billion li inner world, and the seven colored liquids in the mysterious gourd, each can amplify Lin Yuan's physical body and inner world by 3.33 times.</p><p></p><p>After fully absorbing the first six liquids, the final amplification will reach 1.998 billion li.</p><p></p><p>And the 1.995 billion li inner world means that Lin Yuan's absorption of the sixth blue liquid is approaching perfection and is about to start touching the last purple liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I need to reach the tenth stage to fully absorb the purple liquid?" Lin Yuan secretly guessed.</p><p></p><p>The amplification of the inner world needs to consider the strength of the physical body and soul, and the strength here is the basic strength.</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan travels, he waits until he recovers to his peak before summoning the mysterious gourd. One reason is to ensure that he has sufficient self-protection power.</p><p></p><p>The second reason is that if the strength is too low, even with the high-level "rebirth from a drop of blood", the physical body and soul may not be able to bear such a large inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Space layers..." Lin Yuan's gaze turned to the deeper space of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The size of the inner world, Lin Yuan had long predicted in his heart. The amplification of each colored liquid was clear to him. Before starting this travel, he had estimated the final size of the inner world after the end of the travel.</p><p></p><p>But the space layers... were a complete surprise.</p><p></p><p>The divine power of this world's creation, in terms of the development of space layers, was definitely beyond Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's expectation, as long as he could develop ten million space layers in this travel and reach the ninth stage ten million layer realm, it would be considered a perfect completion of the goal.</p><p></p><p>As early as 600 years ago, when Lin Yuan comprehended the essence of the space leading to the world from the demigod power, the space layers of his inner world had reached 120 million.</p><p></p><p>In the following 600 years, Lin Yuan comprehended various true divine powers and main divine powers with spatial attributes, and in the development of space layers, he reached—</p><p></p><p>"2.331 billion layers..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze penetrated through the layers of space, and the depth and foundation of his inner world had reached an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, many ninth-stage powerhouses regard the ten million layer realm as the peak of the ninth stage, while Lin Yuan has already developed 2.331 billion space layers?</p><p></p><p>In terms of the number of space layers, it is 233.1 times that of a normal ninth-stage ten million layer realm.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of actual power, how many times more than ten thousand or a hundred thousand times?</p><p></p><p>"The gains from this travel are really too great."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but be amazed in his heart. 2.331 billion space layers, this is the number of space layers that all ninth-stage lives in the main world and main universe have been desperately hoping for since their birth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan dared not say that the number of space layers he developed was unparalleled in the main world, but it was definitely unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>The "ancients" here are not limited to human civilization, but include all races in the starry sky, including those top races and unique special lives. It is impossible for them to have this number of space layers at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what my inner world will look like when it evolves into an inner universe in the future?" Lin Yuan looked forward to it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The evolution of the inner world into an inner universe is the ultimate sublimation, breaking all shackles and limitations.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the inner universe will not be limited to the size of ten million li, and the space layers will also spontaneously derive more, deeper and wider.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific degree of sublimation, it depends on the original size and depth of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The strongest ninth-stage life of the Tianyu race, Hun Yi, developed more than 30 million inner worlds. Could it be that he developed it just for fun?</p><p></p><p>With the time to develop more than 30 million inner worlds, he could have probably entered the tenth stage long ago. The improvement in combat power would definitely far exceed the space layers from ten million to 30 million.</p><p></p><p>As for the ninth-stage powerhouses of other races, as long as they have the spare capacity, they will develop as many space layers as possible at the ninth stage. The ten million layer realm is just their minimum threshold.</p><p></p><p>Why develop so many space layers at the ninth stage? It is for the sublimation that breaks all shackles and limitations when the inner world evolves into an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter..." Lin Yuan's attention shifted from his inner world to his perfected Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter.</p><p></p><p>Compared with the previous Seventh Stage Chapter and Eighth Stage Chapter, the key to the Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter lies in the adjustment of the inner world structure, making the inner world more stable and powerful.</p><p></p><p>With the same size of inner world, the same number of space layers, and the same foundation, the ninth-stage powerhouse with Martial Dao will definitely have an advantage.</p><p></p><p>In addition, according to the bloodline cultivation path of this world, Lin Yuan specially developed a bloodline purification cultivation method for the Martial Dao evolution system.</p><p></p><p>While comprehending the laws of the great Dao, Martial Dao evolutionists can take time to tap into the potential of their own bloodline. As long as the upper limit of the bloodline is high enough, the speed of strength improvement will definitely far exceed the speed of comprehending the laws of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this cultivation method is only suitable for those citizens with high-level bloodlines and extremely rich bloodlines, and the upper limit is only the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>Because the main world values human rights and cannot gather faith, relying on this cultivation method cannot independently develop a divine kingdom and enter the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, those Martial Dao evolutionists with high-level bloodlines can fully tap into the limit of their own bloodline, reach the fifth, sixth, and seventh levels of the great Dao at the fastest speed, and then stand on a higher level to re-comprehend the laws of the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline evolution path... is ultimately not the great Dao." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>None of the nine supreme powerhouses of human civilization and the supreme powerhouses of other top races became the ultimate by relying on their own powerful bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The supreme powerhouse presiding over the Star Space Grand Alliance, which is completely composed of special lives, has a noble bloodline, but what ultimately enables him to step into the twelfth stage is definitely not the bloodline.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, bloodline is actually a shackle to reaching the peak.</p><p></p><p>"By perfecting the Martial Dao Ninth Stage Chapter and adding branches to the Martial Dao evolution path, the overall foundation and strength of Martial Dao evolutionists have been improved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his right hand, and with a slight movement of his mind, the flow of time on the surface of his skin began to distort, either slowing down or pausing, completely different from the main time flow.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of time..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in high spirits. In the past 600 years, he had indeed spent a lot of energy on comprehending the laws of time.</p>

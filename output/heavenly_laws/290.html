            <p>Chapter 290: Influencing One Alien Battlefield After Another (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, it took more than half an hour to kill the top ten geniuses of the Tianyu race at the 8th stage, who wielded 9th-stage secret treasures. This was the result of him holding back with all his might.</p><p></p><p>He even had to be cautious during this period, afraid that he might accidentally crush his opponents prematurely.</p><p></p><p>The observing human 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries were all shocked to the core.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master has killed another 8th-stage invincible wielding a 9th-stage secret treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"This 8th-stage invincible was also one of the ten strongest 8th-stage lives of the Tianyu race?"</p><p></p><p>The 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries exclaimed in astonishment. Even among 8th-stage invincibles, there were differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>The few 8th-stage invincibles sent out by the Tianyu race were undoubtedly the most elite, and they even wielded 9th-stage secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>Yet, they were killed one by one by the Galaxy Master?</p><p></p><p>How incredible was this?</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Galaxy Master!" White Cloud Master's expression was exhilarated. Lin Yuan, by his own strength, had crushed the Tianyu race's top combat power.</p><p></p><p>This greatly boosted the morale of the human side.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, White Cloud Master dared to guarantee that they would at least not lose this battle.</p><p></p><p>"Seize the moment and launch a counterattack immediately."</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master was about to command the numerous 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>But then he witnessed an unimaginable scene.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race seemed to be frightened by something and began to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master was a little dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand why the Tianyu race would fully retreat.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the other party had completely abandoned this battlefield and this war.</p><p></p><p>Why was this?</p><p></p><p>Although the Galaxy Master had shown a strong performance, it wasn't too outrageous. It took him more than half an hour, and the Tianyu race could have sent out more 8th-stage invincible experts to keep him in check.</p><p></p><p>Why retreat directly?</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Master couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>The 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries of the human civilizations also couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who was standing in the sky above the battlefield, disappeared without a sound.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the layers of space, the 9th-stage expert of the Tianyu race suddenly had a drastic change in expression.</p><p></p><p>This 9th-stage expert wanted to take action, but in the end, he held back.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared above the heads of the fleeing 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, and the power that fused the laws of space and various cosmic forces swept out.</p><p></p><p>This power was not fully formed and only half-fused, but it could still be used barely.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The invisible fused power swept in all directions, and the 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race were as fragile as thin paper, all turning into powder.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>The few Tianyu race 8th-stage invincibles who had escaped further away showed a horrified expression. Then, the invisible fused power swept over and they also turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the dozens of Tianyu race 8th-stage invincibles who had scattered and were fleeing towards the rear all perished.</p><p></p><p>Although these 8th-stage invincibles still had their true bodies and were not completely dead, refining a clone with strength close to the true body was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>It could be expected that for a long time to come, these 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race would not be able to support other battlefields.</p><p></p><p>"Space bracelet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and dozens of spatial storage treasures from those Tianyu race 8th-stage invincibles all fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Although these 8th-stage invincibles would not carry overly precious treasures on their bodies, to ensure the combat power of their clones, they would at least carry 8th-stage weapons and secret treasures.</p><p></p><p>The value of these weapons and secret treasures was not high individually, but added together, it was still a considerable fortune, not less than 200,000 cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"This, this..."</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyu race's territory, the true bodies of the 8th-stage invincibles opened their eyes. Their clones had just perished, and at this moment, their expressions were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Master, his strength is too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"9th-stage, this must be 9th-stage. The human civilization has violated the rules and mobilized 9th-stage evolutionaries."</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be 9th-stage. Otherwise, our race's 9th-stage experts would have taken action long ago. However, even if the Galaxy Master is not 9th-stage, his combat power definitely exceeds the 9th-stage threshold. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to crush us like this."</p><p></p><p>A 9th-stage expert who had just entered the 9th-stage and had not yet comprehended the complete laws of space would have difficulty killing an 8th-stage invincible.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Galaxy Master could sweep through a group of 8th-stage invincibles and easily kill them. His combat power was not something ordinary 9th-stage experts could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Master had been hiding his strength all along."</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand now why our race's 9th-stage expert issued the order to retreat."</p><p></p><p>"The human civilization is truly favored by the universe to give birth to such a monster like the Galaxy Master."</p><p></p><p>The 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race spoke with complex tones, feeling fear, panic, awe, and a hint of admiration for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With an 8th-stage body, he could unleash 9th-stage combat power. Although they didn't know how the Galaxy Master achieved this, from the perspective of evolution, he was undoubtedly ahead of them.</p><p></p><p>Not just ahead, but far surpassing all the 8th-stage lives of this generation.</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented in ancient and modern times, among the myriad races of the cosmic starry sky, including those few peak races, all the 8th-stage lives of this generation appeared exceptionally insignificant before the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>On the human side.</p><p></p><p>All the evolutionaries watched with their own eyes as those 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race turned into powder under Lin Yuan's feet.</p><p></p><p>They subconsciously fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The scene before their eyes was too shocking. Originally, Lin Yuan spent more than half an hour killing those Tianyu race geniuses wielding 9th-stage secret treasures one by one.</p><p></p><p>This had already made the numerous human evolutionaries excited, but now, the Galaxy Master killing those 8th-stage invincibles was as simple as killing chickens.</p><p></p><p>No, it was even easier than killing chickens. Chickens would at least struggle a few times, but those 8th-stage invincibles of the Tianyu race couldn't even struggle and directly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionaries on the human side had thought that under the leadership of the Galaxy Master, they would win the war against the Tianyu race, but that would inevitably involve arduous battles and even require the fall of some human 8th-stage invincibles to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>As for now?</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Master had solved everything?</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, except for White Cloud Master taking action, they, as 8th-stage invincible evolutionaries, were like ornaments watching from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Invincible Galaxy Master!"</p><p></p><p>All the 8th-stage invincibles were completely fanatical. They had never seen an 8th-stage life so strong that it could completely rebel against the 9th-stage. This was too rare for the evolutionaries of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The human population of the human civilization was vast, and the average individual aptitude was at the bottom among the peak races. Although...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Genius monsters are often born.</p><p></p><p>But those powerful members of the apex races also give birth to monstrous geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Sovereign, at the Eighth Stage, doesn't know how far he has surpassed other Eighth Stage lives from the apex races.</p><p></p><p>Deep within layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Stage powerhouse from the Tianyu Race stared intently at Lin Yuan, eyes brimming with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>The strength currently displayed by the Galaxy Sovereign was so powerful that even he felt his scalp go numb. Such an unparalleled genius - each additional day he lives, the Tianyu Race will suffer tremendous losses in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Race immediately started contacting the Ancestor of the race.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Race, along with the Human Civilization, Insect Race and others, all belonged to the apex races, standing at the universe's pinnacle, looking down upon myriad races.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Race had seven Ancestors in total, each an ultimate powerhouse. In most situations, the seven Ancestors did not intervene in matters.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Ninth Stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Race felt it necessary to report the matter of the Galaxy Sovereign to the Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor's reply arrived in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme powerhouse from the Human Civilization is paying attention to this place."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Stage powerhouse of the Tianyu Race was slightly startled, knowing he could do nothing to the Galaxy Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ancestor took action, the supreme powerhouse from the Human side would also act. At that time, not only would they fail to kill the Galaxy Sovereign, it would also escalate the intensity of the war.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, within layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Stage Evolver "Xilan" from the Human side had a tense expression. He also contacted a supreme powerhouse in advance.</p><p></p><p>In the few breaths of time it took Lin Yuan to kill dozens of invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses from the Tianyu Race, he realized the severity of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Sovereign's talent far exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>Relying on just himself, a single Ninth Stage powerhouse, it would be very difficult to withstand the Tianyu Race's murderous intent. So he directly contacted a supreme powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The result was a reply from the supreme powerhouse...</p><p></p><p>He had long been paying attention to this place and told him not to panic.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Galaxy Sovereign's terrifying innate talent had long ago caught the attention of several supreme powerhouses from my Human Civilization," Xilan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But just now, from the tone of the supreme powerhouse's reply to him, it seemed he was also spectating?</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>He appeared beside the Eighth Stage invincibles from the Human side.</p><p></p><p>"I'll trouble you all to handle the rest," Lin Yuan looked at the White Cloud Sovereign, "I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the Galaxy Sovereign." The White Cloud Sovereign and the group of Eighth Stage invincibles spoke in excited, inspired tones. The youngest among them was nearly 100,000 years old, but at this moment, they were filled with respect and admiration for Lin Yuan, even a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign, I presume your strength has already surpassed many Ninth Stage powerhouses, right?" The White Cloud Sovereign couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Surpassed the Ninth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The strength possessed by the Taiji Primordial Spirit did indeed surpass ordinary Ninth Stage powerhouses. But Lin Yuan's most powerful combat strength still lay in his true body.</p><p></p><p>The internal world spanning over 100 million miles underwent a qualitative change in amplifying his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Go handle the rest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke casually.</p><p></p><p>Having lost dozens of invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses, the Tianyu Race definitely could not continue reinforcing this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Continue reinforcing?</p><p></p><p>Sending reinforcements over for Lin Yuan to continue killing?</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Race had abundant foundations. Losing a few dozen invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses did not have much of an impact. But that didn't mean they were fools.</p><p></p><p>The combat power currently displayed by Lin Yuan completely exceeded expectations. No matter how many more invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses came, they would just be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, they might as well directly give up on battlefield B0001. That way, they could minimize their losses.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remained in place, paying attention for a moment as the Human Evolvers quickly took over the situation. After confirming the Tianyu Race no longer had any interest in this battlefield, his figure silently disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had gone on a killing spree at the alien battlefield B0001, slaying dozens of invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses, six of whom were the strongest Eighth Stage lives of the Tianyu Race.</p><p></p><p>This matter spread like a hurricane to the other battlefields.</p><p></p><p>The aliens on the medium-sized battlefields were struck with fear. Since Lin Yuan had appeared on battlefield B0001, he could naturally also descend upon the battlefields they were on.</p><p></p><p>Who could stop the Galaxy Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the pressure on the major races skyrocketed. Under unavoidable circumstances, the major alien races began contracting their strategies on the battlefields. Unless absolutely necessary, they would not easily venture out from their "strongholds".</p><p></p><p>The pressure on the Human Civilization Evolvers on the major battlefields suddenly lessened and the situation was reversed.</p><p></p><p>Even the few apex races secretly bestowed Tenth Stage secret treasures, all to prevent the Galaxy Sovereign from descending.</p><p></p><p>Since the Human Civilization began expanding outwards, there had never been an Eighth Stage life who, by their own strength, could influence all the medium and small-scale alien battlefields, making the numerous alien races on the battlefields tremble in fear and actively change their strategies.</p><p></p><p>This was something only supreme powerhouses could accomplish.</p><p></p><p>After taking action, Lin Yuan returned beneath that 30,000-meter long permanent spatial rift and continued accumulating Realm-Breaking Origin Force.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, sweeping across a battlefield like this can only be done once. The second time, the danger and risk would rapidly increase."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was able to punch through the alien battlefield B0001 so smoothly purely because he had caught the Tianyu Race off guard.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Race had never anticipated that Lin Yuan's strength would be so terrifying, able to casually kill invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>But after experiencing this, the aliens on the other battlefields were all on alert. They definitely all arranged countermeasures against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For example, Tenth Stage secret treasures?</p><p></p><p>For example, other one-time use precious items that could erupt with terrifying might?</p><p></p><p>Tenth Stage secret treasures, even if wielded by invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses who couldn't bring out one percent of their might, could still pose a threat to Lin Yuan. After all, those were the killing weapons of Tenth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Because they are on guard against my appearance, those aliens on the battlefields can only act with utmost caution for some time. This can also ease some pressure for the Human Evolvers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Him influencing the other battlefields by his own strength was purely taking advantage of the rule that only Eighth Stage level lives could take action on medium-scale alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>And to truly influence the overall situation and the other apex races, one had to become a supreme powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit hurried over, bringing the spoils of war from battlefield B0001.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Primordial Spirit was stationed beneath that 30,000-meter long permanent spatial rift in order to maintain the accumulation "efficiency" of one thread of Realm-Breaking Origin Force every 150 days.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yin Primordial Spirit, it was free and was used to deliver the spoils of war to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Huge profit."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Only he knew how great the harvest was this time.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? The Goddess of Liberty has already settled one-tenth of the total merits? The merit points are already in my account?"</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could even take stock of the spoils of war he obtained, he received more good news.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many merit points it is." Lin Yuan had an expectant expression and immediately went to check.</p>

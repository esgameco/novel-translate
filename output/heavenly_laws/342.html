        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 342: The Threat Level of Lin Yuan (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>A large number of ninth-rank alien beings fled towards the inner area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The main continent of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is divided into three areas: the outer area, the inner area, and the core area. </p><p></p><p>The outer area has the smallest area, so the ninth-rank evolved beings of human civilization were able to form a blockade line, forcing all ninth-rank alien beings into that distant canyon.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the outer area, the inner area is much vaster. </p><p></p><p>The current number of evolved beings from human civilization cannot cover the inner area at all.</p><p></p><p>Those ninth-rank alien beings who fled to the inner area can quickly get away from being tracked by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the safety of the inner area is only temporary. </p><p></p><p>Once the secret realm opens after a hundred years, it will close again. Any powerful beings not in the outer area will be eliminated by the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the void, watching the many frenzied alien beings flee far away, not taking action to kill them.</p><p></p><p>With thousands or tens of thousands of ninth-rank alien beings scattered and fleeing, even if Lin Yuan pursued and killed them while maintaining his two billion-layer spatial realm strength, it would be very difficult to kill them all.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, those alien powerful beings voluntarily fled to the inner area, which was in line with Lin Yuan's intentions, saving him the trouble of taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, those ninth-rank alien beings have hidden in the inner area, we estimate there's nothing we can do," Duo Ke walked up and stood behind Lin Yuan, saying apologetically.</p><p></p><p>The inner area being too vast was one reason.</p><p></p><p>Another reason was that the extremely powerful native lifeforms scattered throughout this area.  </p><p></p><p>If human civilization made a big fuss like setting up a blockade line in the outer area, those ninth-rank alien beings might not be found, but they would likely be driven to distraction by those native lifeforms first.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Duo Ke felt slightly relieved in his heart.  </p><p></p><p>He was worried the Galactic Sovereign would feel conflicted.  </p><p></p><p>After all, according to the countermeasures they had discussed before, the Galactic Sovereign would get 90% of the gains for each ninth-rank alien being killed.</p><p></p><p>But now, with all the alien beings fleeing to the inner area and few ninth-rank alien beings killed, the Galactic Sovereign's final gains would not be very high.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the Galactic Sovereign's strength, he could completely pursue and kill them, and spend some time to leave at least a few hundred ninth-rank alien beings."</p><p></p><p>Duo Ke thought to himself, but didn't dare ask too much. In fact, he had some guesses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Sovereign used a one-against-four to kill the Son of the Tree Realm, the Dragon Scale King and two other legendary ninth-rank beings, using some kind of explosive secret technique.  </p><p></p><p>And after using this kind of explosive secret technique, there is generally a price to pay afterwards, such as a period of weakness?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the reason why the Galactic Sovereign did not pursue and kill them? After killing the Son of the Tree Realm and the other three legendary ninth-ranks, the Galactic Sovereign had paid some price?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Duo Ke suddenly felt it made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>"Since these alien beings have fled to the inner area, don't let them out," Lin Yuan said softly with his hands behind his back, his gaze revealing a killing intent as he looked at the fleeing ninth-rank alien beings.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Duo Ke could completely understand the actions of these ninth-rank alien beings.  </p><p></p><p>Even in death, they could not let human civilization benefit.</p><p></p><p>If Duo Ke was in the position of the alien beings, he would also make this choice.</p><p></p><p>But understanding is one thing, actually doing it is another.</p><p></p><p>Since you alien beings want to die in the secret realm so badly, then all of you go die.</p><p></p><p>Although hiding in the inner area greatly reduced the gains for the ninth-rank evolved beings on the human civilization side, it was just a reduction in gains.</p><p></p><p>For the alien beings' side, it was an outright devastating loss. Not only did they gain nothing from entering the secret realm this time, they also lost an avatar body.</p><p></p><p>In the distant canyon, the many ninth-rank powerful beings observing felt quite pensive.</p><p></p><p>Originally when the legendary ninth-ranks like the Son of the Tree Realm and the Dragon Scale King appeared, they thought the situation would change.  </p><p></p><p>At least the invincible Galactic Sovereign would be restrained.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that those four legendary ninth-ranks could not even put up much resistance against the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Just how did the Galactic Sovereign cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying, it's fortunate my race has no major conflicts with human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"The few top peak races must be heartbroken now."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-rank powerful beings had varying emotions - some were in awe, some were shocked, some found it inconceivable, and some reveled in the misfortune of others.</p><p></p><p>In the vast depths of the universe, in a certain spatial layer...</p><p></p><p>This was also a universe secret realm, immensely vast. In the center of the secret realm, a deep green towering ancient tree took root.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree pierced the heavens, its roots enveloping the entire universe secret realm.</p><p></p><p>And beside this towering ancient tree, a much shorter ancient tree was swaying.</p><p></p><p>If observed carefully, one would find that the time flow rate on the surface of the towering ancient tree was vastly different from the main universe's time flow rate.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, perhaps tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years, or millions of years had passed. But for this towering ancient tree, perhaps only a day had passed? Or just a month?</p><p></p><p>The aura of this smaller ancient tree subtly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Child, what's wrong?" The towering ancient tree immediately noticed and restored its surface time flow rate to normal, sending out a faint psychic ripple to dote on the smaller ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>It was the Mother of the Tree Realm, an eleventh-rank lifeform capable of negotiating with Paramount Ones.  </p><p></p><p>The vast universe had some eleventh-rank lifeforms, but it was rare to find ones the Paramount Ones did not wish to compel. Just how overbearing were the Paramount Ones?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they treated their own kind as elders and predecessors with gentleness, but towards alien races, they mostly had the attitude of "obey me and prosper, defy me and perish."</p><p></p><p>Human civilization was like this, the Insect Race was like this, and the Feather Heavenly Race was the same.</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm looked kindly at the smaller ancient tree. It was a unique, special lifeform in the universe. Even after growing into the eleventh rank, it never had the concept of a race.</p><p></p><p>Until the birth of this smaller ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>The smaller ancient tree was not born from the Mother of the Tree Realm, but was born from the Tree Realm itself, just like how the Mother of the Tree Realm was born.</p><p></p><p>"Mother," the smaller ancient tree also sent out a psychic ripple with a hint of doubt, "You said our Tree Realm race's innate talents and aptitudes truly surpass all living beings in the universe?"</p><p></p><p>"That's natural," the massive Mother of the Tree Realm smiled, "The universe is vast, giving birth to endless living beings. But our Tree Realm race is unique and unmatched - our innate talents and aptitudes naturally transcend all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"What about the Paramount Ones?" the smaller ancient tree immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Ones did not wish to compel the Mother of the Tree Realm, because the Mother had the ability to prevent the Paramount Ones from gaining any advantage over her. But in terms of strength and all other aspects, the Mother was still far inferior to the Paramount Ones.</p><p></p><p>"The Paramount Ones, ah..." the Mother of the Tree Realm was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>There were many Paramount Ones in the universe who had experienced far longer eons than her.</p><p></p><p>"The Paramount Ones are an exception," the Mother of the Tree Realm thought for a moment. "Becoming a Paramount One has little to do with innate talents and aptitudes."</p><p></p><p>"But below the Paramount Ones, our Tree Realm race definitely looks down upon everything else. Or perhaps some other special lifeforms in the universe have talents and aptitudes not much weaker than our race - at most slightly stronger - but overall they are on the same level."</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"But Mother, not long ago, an emissary from the Insect Race had me split off an avatar to go to that Xuanhuang Secret Realm to deal with the Galactic Sovereign of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The smaller ancient tree immediately began speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," the Mother of the Tree Realm nodded. She did not know about the Galactic Sovereign - the Galactic Sovereign had risen too quickly, in less than a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, the Mother of the Tree Realm maintained an extreme difference in time flow rate between herself and the outside world in order to live longer.</p><p></p><p>The Tree Realm race did have an incredibly long lifespan, but without becoming a Paramount One, they were still just lives in the long river of time, unable to achieve eternity.</p><p></p><p>The last time she awoke was still millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Even after watching the video of the Galactic Sovereign in action, when she actually faced the Galactic Sovereign, she had doubts.</p><p></p><p>Was I the special lifeform, or was it you, the Galactic Sovereign, who was the special lifeform?</p><p></p><p>"Killed by the Galactic Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>The Mother of the Tree Realm fell silent. "The other party did not rely on any external forces?"</p><p></p><p>Here, external forces referred to higher-level secret treasures or life-saving objects, like that "Time Black Hole" possessed by the Traveler Mahdo.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign..." The Mother of the Tree Realm immediately extended her consciousness outside the Tree Realm to receive all the information about everything that had happened during her slumber, including the many pieces of intelligence about the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Shattering the eighth-rank myth.  </p><p></p><p>The youngest ninth-rank in the history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Child..."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Mother of the Tree Realm finally sent out another psychic ripple, "No..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about the Galactic Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>New69book.com</p><p></p><p>"What use is the Galactic Sovereign's high innate talent and aptitude? As long as he doesn't become an supreme being, he definitely won't outlive you."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, the Mother of the Tree Realm finally came up with a consoling reason. </p><p></p><p>The Tree Realm clan had an incredibly long lifespan. A ninth-rank ancient tree had experienced eons far exceeding hundreds or thousands of times the normal lifespan of an eleventh-rank being.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign won't outlive me..." The ancient tree felt a bit displeased hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Feather Clan.</p><p></p><p>Many tenth and eleventh-rank celestials watched the "video footage" before them. </p><p></p><p>It depicted Lin Yuan killing the "Son of the Tree Realm", the "Dragon Scale King" and other legendary ninth-rank beings in the Profound Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The number of spatial layers the Galactic Sovereign opened in this battle is indeed around 200 million, consistent with the power he displayed when he killed the Hunyi previously."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Galactic Sovereign also possesses an explosive secret technique that can temporarily unleash power over twice his own limit."</p><p></p><p>"Such an explosive secret technique should have significant hidden flaws. Otherwise, with the Galactic Sovereign's strength, he should have continued pursuing instead of just watching our powerful experts escape into the inner area."</p><p></p><p>The various tenth and eleventh-rank celestials of the Celestial Feather Clan tried to deduce the Galactic Sovereign's specific information based on the "video footage".</p><p></p><p>They paid a considerable price, inviting a legendary ninth-rank being into the Profound Yellow Secret Realm, just to probe the Galactic Sovereign's true limits.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the many tenth and eleventh-rank celestials of the Celestial Feather Clan, the Galactic Sovereign would definitely make a big impact on major battlefields in the future.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't grasp his true limits now, the losses in the future would only be greater.</p><p></p><p>"Based on the Galactic Sovereign's current strength, if he reaches the tenth rank and undergoes metamorphosis, his threat level within a thousand years will reach 'B' rank. Extending the timeline, he will likely reach 'A' rank within five thousand years."</p><p></p><p>An eleventh-rank celestial spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were evolutionary humans or powerful beings from other races, once reaching the tenth rank of life, their strength could no longer be precisely graded.</p><p></p><p>At the ninth rank, their strength was graded based on the number of spatial layers they could open.</p><p></p><p>But at the tenth rank, after their life essence underwent metamorphosis, the number of spatial layers, while still influencing a tenth-rank being's combat prowess, was no longer the deciding factor.</p><p></p><p>The main means of tenth-rank beings was the application of various fundamental rules, such as rule integration.</p><p></p><p>Integrating the spatial rules with a basic rule was the prerequisite for breaking through from the eighth to the ninth rank. Upon reaching the tenth rank, one needed to integrate more rules. Apart from the time rules, other pillar rules could also be attempted for integration.</p><p></p><p>For instance, integrating the pillar rules of life and death into the cycle of life and death rule would result in terrifying killing power that no number of spatial layers could withstand.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it was the life rule or the death rule, they were both pillar rules. The integration between pillar rules was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Hence, there were no specific standards for grading the strength of tenth-rank beings. Everything was evaluated based on their threat level.</p><p></p><p>The various major races in the cosmos adopted a unified standard to divide the threat levels of tenth-rank experts into six tiers: </p><p></p><p>A, B, C, D, E, F.</p><p></p><p>Beings who had just entered the tenth rank were generally only at the "F" level, able to open millions of spatial layers and just beginning rule integration.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the integration of pillar rules, even the integration of pillar rules with ordinary rules was still at the level of breaking through to the ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>Among tenth-rank beings, "F" was the weakest, while "A" was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Generally, "A" rank tenth-ranks had integrated two pillar rules. Some extremely powerful "A" ranks had even integrated the time rules with an ordinary rule.</p><p></p><p>The integration of pillar rules with ordinary rules did not necessarily require comprehending that pillar rule.</p><p></p><p>Just like integrating the spatial rules with ordinary rules, one only needed to comprehend the spatial rules to a large extent to proceed with the integration.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching 'B' rank threat level within a thousand years of entering the tenth rank, and even having the prospect of 'A' rank within five thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>The celestials present were a bit stunned. That eleventh-rank celestial's evaluation of the Galactic Sovereign was too high.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only deducing based on the Galactic Sovereign's current strength and past growth rate," the eleventh-rank celestial calmly replied, but his heart was also stirring. How long did it take him to reach "A" rank after initially entering the tenth rank?</p><p></p><p>"Knowing the Galactic Sovereign's future strength in advance."</p><p></p><p>At this point, another eleventh-rank expert spoke up. Whether it was a "B" rank or "A" rank tenth-rank, knowing in advance made it easier to deal with and at least allowed them to prepare countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>If not for this probe, they would be unaware of the Galactic Sovereign's exact strength after reaching the tenth rank. What if they sent out "D" or "C" rank tenth-ranks to deal with him on a major battlefield? Wouldn't that be sending them to their deaths?</p><p></p><p>At the tenth rank level, even the weakest "F" rank was the elite foundation of a race. They could not be sacrificed casually.</p><p></p><p>And this was just a peak race. For a powerful race, tenth-rank beings were the pillars of their clan.</p><p></p><p>In the Profound Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure vanished, arriving at the deepest part of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was sensing every detail within the secret realm, especially the many alien experts who had fled to the inner area.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid revealing too much strength and conceal the fact that he had become the master of the Profound Yellow Secret Realm, Lin Yuan could not directly kill these ninth-rank alien experts.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait for the secret realm to close, at which point they would all be eliminated by the secret realm. Then he could go "collect the spoils".</p><p></p><p>"Eight thousand seven hundred and ninety-two ninth-rank alien experts." Through his control over the secret realm, Lin Yuan easily confirmed all the alien experts in the inner area.</p><p></p><p>"How much gain can so many ninth-rank alien experts bring me?" A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Since the Profound Yellow Secret Realm opened, all the ninth-rank treasures obtained from those who tried to remain in the secret realm and were eliminated totaled only a few hundred pieces.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a small number, but the ninth-rank experts who attempted to stay in the secret realm had all prepared for death, bringing out their personal treasures through various means.</p><p></p><p>So the ninth-rank treasures added up to less than three hundred pieces.</p><p></p><p>But the situation was different for those eight thousand plus ninth-rank alien experts who had fled to the inner area.</p><p></p><p>They had made no preparations at all. The treasures and weapons on their bodies were still there. Although not particularly precious, the sheer quantity made up for it.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect."</p><p></p><p>"What I lack most in cultivating the 'Profound Yellow Body' are all kinds of resources. Whether treasures or weapons, they can all become nourishment for the 'Profound Yellow Body'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of the three major protective secret techniques of the Profound Yellow Sect, the so-called imperishable "Profound Yellow Body" not only consumed vast amounts of Profound Yellow crystals in cultivation but also required various other resources.</p><p></p><p>Treasures, weapons and the like could all be devoured and then transformed into the foundation of the "Profound Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>As for the "Profound Yellow Strike" and "Spatial Steps", Lin Yuan could rapidly cultivate them to great perfection relying on his extraordinary comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But the "Profound Yellow Body" was essentially an accumulation of resources. Comprehension alone was useless - he had to truly invest vast resources to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>But with the contribution of nearly ten thousand alien experts, Lin Yuan believed his cultivation progress in the "Profound Yellow Body" would advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if Lin Yuan obtained those treasures and weapons, he could not easily take them out, or he might be recognized.</p><p></p><p>So he might as well refine them all into nourishment for the "Profound Yellow Body", saving himself from having to purchase other resources to supply the cultivation of this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>"The urgent task now is to refine the secret realm's core as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and that amber crystal appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Even after dealing with the "Son of the Tree Realm" and other legendary ninth-ranks not long ago, Lin Yuan maintained his refinement of this secret realm core.</p><p></p><p>Those observing experts thought Lin Yuan had already gone all out to suppress the "Son of the Tree Realm" and the other four legendary ninth-ranks, even resorting to using an explosive secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know, Lin Yuan was just toying with them. The over 20 billion spatial layers he occupied only utilized 2 billion spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>As for the explosive secret technique? Once the "Profound Yellow Strike" was fully cultivated, it could achieve a "constant state", with every strike unleashing power exceeding his limits.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a higher consumption, there was no other cost.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't pursue them, it was simply going with the flow.</p><p></p><p>Those ninth-rank alien experts who fled to the inner area would eventually be eliminated by the secret realm anyway. Their treasures, weapons, and even corpses would all fall into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>A year went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's refinement of the secret realm core had reached its final stage.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 461 The Eleventh Transition (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Meritorious points are linked to contributions to the overall human civilization.</p><p></p><p>And the incomparable deterrence against alien and even peak ethnic groups is also beneficial for the external expansion of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Even greater than the deterrence of the strongest.</p><p></p><p>At least the strongest in human civilization still have the ability to resist the major peak ethnic groups.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Overlord?</p><p></p><p>What can withstand the 11th level?</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Galactic Overlord's performance on the super-large battlefields, except for the 12th level ultimate, who can contend with it?</p><p></p><p>Absolute invincibility makes many peak ethnic groups at the 11th level utterly desperate.</p><p></p><p>"Over 200 billion meritorious points," Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>He was at a loss for a moment on how to use such a huge amount of meritorious points.</p><p></p><p>"First, upgrade the citizen level to level 10," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The meritorious points required to upgrade from level 9 citizen to level 10 citizen is 50 billion.</p><p></p><p>Before the opening of the super-large battlefield, Lin Yuan had never thought that he could amass such a huge amount of meritorious points in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Probably only after the complete opening of the 11th level of the Martial Dao chapter would it be possible.</p><p></p><p>But now? </p><p></p><p>50 billion meritorious points? </p><p></p><p>It's just a quarter of the 200 million-plus meritorious points.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan upgraded his citizen level, his meritorious point balance quickly decreased by 50 billion points.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's citizen level also changed from 'Level 9' to 'Level 10' in half a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Level 10 citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were bright. </p><p></p><p>As far as he knew, the highest citizen level in human civilization is Level 11.</p><p></p><p>As for Level 12 citizen? In theory, a Level 12 citizen could control the entire human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, it's just a theory. To advance to Level 12 citizen is not just a matter of meritorious points.</p><p></p><p>Even for Level 11 citizens, human civilization only has nine, which are the nine strongest.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a Level 10 citizen is basically the most revered citizen under the strongest in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest would not ignore a Level 10 citizen, as each Level 10 citizen has an indelible contribution to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The currently living Level 10 citizens in human civilization can be counted on one's fingers, and they are all from the dormant years of human civilization before the Star Sea Era.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the difficulty of obtaining meritorious points during the dormant years of human civilization was much simpler than the current Star Sea Era. </p><p></p><p>After all, at that time, human civilization was not the peak civilization that swept across the alien tribes as it is now. Even if they obtained the ultimate opportunity, it was still treading on thin ice, so the threshold for the issuance of meritorious points was naturally lower.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, Lin Yuan is the first Level 10 citizen born since the opening of the Star Sea Era in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>50 billion meritorious points, even for those evolution scholars who are adept at obtaining meritorious points, they would be far from able to accumulate it within 200 million years.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The highest president of human civilization is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows, finding a video request.</p><p></p><p>The highest president of human civilization is a position, similar to a planetary governor, which is rotated every few years.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the citizens who can serve as the highest president must be impeccable in all aspects, after all, this is the highest leader of human civilization on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Assisting the three goddesses in jointly governing the vast human civilization.</p><p></p><p>And the strongest, in general, the strongest do not interfere with the routine affairs of human civilization, unless they encounter the situations stipulated in the charter, the three goddesses will prioritize consulting the strongest.</p><p></p><p>For human civilization, the strongest are more of a spiritual symbol.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the strongest do not interfere with the routine affairs of human civilization because they are too lazy to do so. In fact, the strongest have great power in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Galactic Overlord"</p><p></p><p>The video connected, and on the illusory screen, a white-haired old man bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Lin Yuan is the existence second only to the 12th level in human civilization, or even the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>In terms of citizen level, Lin Yuan is now a Level 10 citizen, and he is the first Level 10 citizen born after the opening of the Star Sea Era, with an extremely high status and significance.</p><p></p><p>Even the highest president of human civilization, when facing Lin Yuan, has to show respect.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He then chatted with the highest president for a while.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of the highest president's video call was to congratulate Lin Yuan on becoming a Level 10 citizen.</p><p></p><p>He also personally introduced the various welfare benefits for Lin Yuan as a Level 10 citizen.</p><p></p><p>The basic welfare benefits of a Level 10 citizen are the upgraded version of a Level 9 citizen, covering various aspects. Even if Lin Yuan wants to serve as the highest president, he has a 100% chance.</p><p></p><p>The discounts for purchasing various resources and weapons have reached 60%.</p><p></p><p>This 60% discount is a full 60% discount, even for redeeming the strongest weapons, 12-star rare treasures, and so on, the redemption value is also 60%.</p><p></p><p>It's basically human civilization selling at a loss to you.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other upgraded welfare benefits, just the 60% discount alone is enough to recoup the investment. Given Lin Yuan's need for resources in his cultivation, earning back the value of 50 billion meritorious points worth of 12-star rare treasures is just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The various permissions in the virtual world have also been upgraded?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After ascending to the 10th-level citizen, Lin Yuan could access any personal information of other citizens if he wished.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, there are virtually no secrets for 10th-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>"The Ultimate Opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the information about the Ultimate Opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Ultimate Opportunity refers to the greatest opportunity that human civilization obtained from the descent of countless inherited treasures from beyond the universe, before the civilization went into dormancy for many years.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Opportunity allowed human civilization to give birth to nine supreme beings. Additionally, many blessings from this opportunity have enabled human civilization to develop to this day, with most tribal weapons and essences originating from that Ultimate Opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"The 10th Path of Supreme Evolution?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred. Among the Ultimate Opportunities obtained by human civilization, the 10th Path of Supreme Evolution was the most important.</p><p></p><p>These 10 Paths of Supreme Evolution were supreme evolutionary paths without any ultimate existence, and their value was immeasurable. The paths taken by the nine supreme beings of human civilization were among these 9 Paths.</p><p></p><p>The 10th Path of Supreme Evolution, however, was exceptionally obscure and abstruse. So far, no one in human civilization had successfully cultivated and progressed through this path to reach the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"It's completely different from the Martial Dao evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>After briefly reviewing the information, Lin Yuan realized that upon becoming a 10th-level citizen, he had automatically obtained this Path of Supreme Evolution.</p><p></p><p>In the entire human civilization, only citizens with extraordinary merits could be granted this evolutionary path. The other 9 Paths of Supreme Evolution were widely disseminated.</p><p></p><p>This was because the other 9 Paths had ultimate existences overseeing them, while this 10th Path was the grand dao leading to the 12th Realm. It would not be disseminated until a sufficient number of 11th Realm cultivators had been produced.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining this Path of Supreme Evolution, Lin Yuan saw that there were less than a hundred cultivators practicing it, with the strongest one at the 4th stage of the 11th Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. This Path of Supreme Evolution did not involve cultivating the physical body, the soul, or the inner world, but rather aimed to ultimately analyze all things, the universe, and the chaotic void. </p><p></p><p>Although it had a very high potential ceiling, it was a completely different path from the Martial Dao evolutionary path that Lin Yuan had opened up. There was not much reference value between the two.</p><p></p><p>"This is what it means to be a 10th-level citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a general understanding of all the privileges and powers granted to 10th-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>In summary, it could be described in four words: "Able to do anything."</p><p></p><p>A 10th-level citizen, especially one who had ascended through the most standard path after the Star Sea Era, could basically do anything within human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan, there had been other 10th-level citizens, but they were born before the Star Sea Era, so the threshold conditions they had crossed were different from the current ones. Therefore, the privileges and powers they enjoyed were not as extensive as Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the benefits and powers enjoyed by those previous 10th-level citizens were a "castrated version" compared to what Lin Yuan was experiencing now.</p><p></p><p>"There is nothing urgent for now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts. "I can proceed with the 11th Traversal."</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the need to oversee the super-large-scale battlefield, Lin Yuan estimated that he would have started the 11th Traversal decades ago.</p><p></p><p>Although the outcome of the super-large-scale battlefield had been predetermined 90 years ago, Lin Yuan still waited until the war had completely ended and concluded before preparing for the next Traversal.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lin Yuan's mind sank deep into his consciousness, arriving at the majestic and grand Multiversal Gate.</p><p></p><p>"This Traversal, I shall set it to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm was the upper-level world of the Spiritual Realm. When Lin Yuan ascended to the 9th Realm of the Spiritual Realm, he discovered a vast world that towered above the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>By obtaining the world coordinates of this place, that was the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan had gathered in the Spiritual Realm, both the Spiritual Realm and the lower-level Middle Celestial Continent World were influenced by the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Dao, who was the only ultimate existence beyond the main universe that Lin Yuan knew of, had once dreamed and traveled through countless worlds, spreading the cultivation system of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"During the Traversal, my true body and main self will continue to absorb resources and cultivate the 'Primordial Dao Body'," Lin Yuan arranged his affairs.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's cultivation of the "Primordial Dao Body" had already become instinctive. Even without his conscious will controlling it, it would naturally cultivate and consume various resources to strengthen itself, just like how the heart continues to beat and the body functions even while sleeping.</p><p></p><p>"This descent into the Immortal Realm will last for 2,100 years?"</p><p></p><p>"And the time flow ratio between the Immortal Realm and the main universe is 1 to 20? Meaning that 2,100 years will pass in the Immortal Realm, while only 100 years will elapse in the main universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split off a wisp of his spiritual will and briefly observed the vast world of the Immortal Realm, obtaining some information.</p><p></p><p>The 1 to 20 time flow ratio indicated that the Immortal Realm's realm was already very close to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"I will announce that I will be in seclusion for the next 100 years."</p><p></p><p>After making all the preparations, Lin Yuan immediately activated the 11th Traversal.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum.</p><p></p><p>The Multiversal Gate faintly emanated fluctuations as Lin Yuan's entire spiritual will surged into it.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 488: Beyond the Universe (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a hazy state.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around and let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>Since returning from the super-large battlefield, the true body of Lin Yuan had entered the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because this place can be considered absolutely safe, even the Twelve Tribulations Dao Severing Realm cultivators cannot find it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sovereign Realm and the Chaos Realm?</p><p></p><p>Unless the Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm masters of this universe, the outsiders who have reached the Twelve Tribulations Realm are rejected by the universe and cannot even enter, let alone lock onto the coordinates of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>And to break through to the Sovereign Realm within a single universe cycle is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. It is unknown how many universe cycles it would take for such a figure to emerge.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the ordinary Sovereign Realm cultivators cannot lock onto the coordinates of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>As a peak Chaos Realm expert, Emperor Xuan dared to set up the inheritance place of the Mysterious Yellow lineage within the universe, surely believing that it would be safe enough.</p><p></p><p>With the protection of the universe, even if Emperor Xuan were to perish, the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm could exist for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>The true body of Lin Yuan was hidden in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was naturally to guard against the ultimate Twelve Tribulations Realm experts of other peak faction forces.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's performance on the super-large battlefield was too outstanding.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that he single-handedly swept away the other peak faction forces.</p><p></p><p>Those Twelve Tribulations Realm ultimate experts of the Eleven Peak Factions might just put aside their pride and launch a sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the strongest figures of human civilization must also be wary of this.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, Lin Yuan still felt that the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm was the safest place.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The use of space-time is actually so profound?"</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Seventh Realm of Space-Time, the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm appeared different in Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The spatial-temporal mysteries involved were such that even Lin Yuan at this moment could only glimpse a little.</p><p></p><p>The energy contained in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm is not high, but the profundity is absolutely at the Chaos Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos?"</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan looked, the deeper he delved, and he vaguely sensed a trace of Chaos power at the core of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, countless rules were turning, and the Chaos rules were flowing in his body. The Chaos rules that were nurtured in the Immortal Realm were instantly grasped by Lin Yuan upon returning to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom - the entire Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm began to tremble slightly. Lin Yuan guided the trace of Chaos power at the deepest part of the secret realm, and he vaguely saw an ancient and primordial scene.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Chaotic Void, there was a majestic figure, wearing a golden dragon robe, with black hair fluttering. He raised his right hand, and 33,333 strands of Chaos power surged into the boundless void, merging into 33,333 universes, forming the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Emperor Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled. Although he had never seen Emperor Xuan before, he was convinced that this majestic figure was Emperor Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"So the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm was created all at once by Emperor Xuan, not opened up one by one?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he cultivated the "Illusory Reality" secret technique, he had seen the projection left behind by the Master of the Demon Jade Pavilion, but compared to the present Emperor Xuan, it seemed a bit weaker.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it could also be that the projection left by the Master of the Demon Jade Pavilion was too insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"33,333 Mysterious Yellow Secret Realms?" Lin Yuan understood that by connecting to the Chaos origin of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm with Chaos rules, he was able to see these scenes.</p><p></p><p>"I should have completely mastered this secret realm now, right?" Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not the creator of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm. Even if he became the new master of the secret realm, his control over it would still be lacking.</p><p></p><p>But now, after communicating with the Chaos origin of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, Lin Yuan could be said to have completely grasped the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm. Even if Emperor Xuan returned, he would not be able to compete for the control of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>High above the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, a six-armed figure was filled with shock at the changes in the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, the six-armed figure naturally had a thorough understanding of every detail of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the trembling of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm and the pulling of the Chaos origin at its core were all detected by him.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos origin of the secret realm?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure found it unbelievable. The Chaos origin was the foundation of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm and the power left behind by Emperor Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Although after merging with the universe, the Chaos origin had been assimilated by the universe and had no connection with Emperor Xuan, the level of power was still there.</p><p></p><p>To guide the Chaos origin of the secret realm, the prerequisite was to comprehend the Chaos rules, and this was something that the majority of Sovereign Realm experts could not achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos rules? Has the master comprehended the Chaos rules?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's mind was in a daze. Just grasping the Chaos rules alone was not enough to guide the Chaos origin of the secret realm. It had to be done by the master of the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the current changes in the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm were caused by Lin Yuan, who had already comprehended the Chaos rules.</p><p></p><p>"Master... has the master not yet broken through to the Twelve Tribulations Realm?" the six-armed figure thought with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Not yet broken through to the Twelve Tribulations Realm?</p><p></p><p>Comprehended the Chaos rules?</p><p></p><p>Even with Emperor Xuan's high realm, he had never seen such a peerless genius before. He had only heard of such figures in ancient records, and it was uncertain whether they had truly existed.</p><p></p><p>And now, this kind of peerless genius was allowing this secret realm spirit to witness it.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure appeared not far from Lin Yuan, looking at the young man sitting cross-legged, with the aura of Chaos flowing on his body, and called out with a slight reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>"Has the master comprehended the Chaos rules?" Although his heart was already firmly convinced, the six-armed figure still couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"I accidentally comprehended them," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Chaos rules were not comprehended, but rather, they could not be directly comprehended.</p><p></p><p>It was nurtured by countless rules, and the path Lin Yuan took was precisely this.</p><p></p><p>"Really comprehended them?" The six-armed figure's heart was once again stirred by towering waves.</p><p></p><p>After sending away the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to observe the changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>The moment he comprehended the Chaos rules in the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan's physical body, soul, heart, will, and inner world had all undergone significant leaps in strength.</p><p></p><p>Now, returning to the main universe with his true body, Lin Yuan also sensed the changes in his physical body, soul, and inner world.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious change was in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan's inner world was only a little over 200 million li in radius, without any profound foundation accumulated. But it could still expand ten or even a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>The inner world of Lin Yuan's true body in the main universe had the Chaos Void origin accumulated from breaking through to the Eleventh Realm. After the fusion of the Chaos rules, it began to terrifyingly increase.</p><p></p><p>Before his Eleventh Realm crossing, Lin Yuan's inner world was less than 9 billion li in radius.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Rumbling~ The inner world began to undergo frantic expansion, and a large amount of the chaotic void origin submerged deep within the inner world was absorbed.</p><p></p><p>In just ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>The inner world had reached 90 billion li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Another ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>200 billion li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Ten more breaths.</p><p></p><p>500 billion li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Until this moment.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the inner world gradually slowed down.</p><p></p><p>"510 billion li in diameter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into the inner world, overlooking the vast and boundless heaven and earth, and his heart was filled with endless emotions.</p><p></p><p>510 billion li in diameter. In fact, it can already be measured in a different unit.</p><p></p><p>510 billion li, roughly equals two light-years.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the diameter of Lin Yuan's inner world has reached two light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the enhancement of the essence of life by comprehending the chaotic rules is still inferior to the enhancement by breaking through to the 12th Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after successfully breaking through the 11th Realm and entering the 12th Realm, the inner world would expand to thousands of light-years in a short time, transforming into an inner universe.</p><p></p><p>As it gradually reaches the range of tens of thousands of light-years to a hundred thousand light-years, this is the normal standard of the ultimate 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the inner world of a 12th Realm Dao Ancestor cultivator should be between ten thousand light-years to a million light-years.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's inner world has only expanded to two light-years and then stopped.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this does not mean that breaking through to the 12th Realm is more difficult than comprehending the chaotic rules.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the difficulty of comprehending the chaotic rules is much higher than breaking through to the 12th Realm, let alone an 11th Realm cultivator comprehending the chaotic rules.</p><p></p><p>Many Sovereign Realm peak experts have been stuck and unable to comprehend the chaotic rules.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the chaotic rules and breaking through to the 12th Realm have completely different focuses.</p><p></p><p>The former is more inclined towards techniques, while the latter is purely about the level of life.</p><p></p><p>For example, a master-level expert in ordinary skills may be able to eat dozens of pounds of food in a single meal at most. But a giant hundreds or thousands of meters tall can easily consume hundreds of tons of food.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference brought about by the level of life.</p><p></p><p>"Although my inner world is not as good as the ultimate 12th Realm, I should not be weaker than those 12th Realm experts in the universe now," Lin Yuan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The inner world is his weak point. His life level is also not as high as the ultimate 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of rule comprehension, Lin Yuan surpasses all the 12th Realm experts in the universe, whether it's the Seven Realms of Time and Space or the Chaotic Rules.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in terms of the physical body, the "Xuanhuang Body" has reached the 12th Realm level when cultivated to the 11th Realm perfection, and has been further enhanced by the nurturing of the Chaotic Rules.</p><p></p><p>The strength of his will and consciousness also needs no further elaboration. With his consciousness index reaching 40 million, even if his soul has weaknesses, Lin Yuan can easily resist the soul and consciousness attacks from other 12th Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan decided to delay his breakthrough to the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>When he finally breaks through to the ultimate, he will receive another influx of the chaotic void origin. The stronger his physical body, inner world, and soul are, the more chaotic void origin he can bear, and the greater the benefits he will obtain.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's inner world is only two light-years in diameter, and the benefits brought by the Chaotic Rules have not been fully digested yet. If he waits a little longer, the final size of his inner world may reach five light-years or even ten light-years.</p><p></p><p>The amount of chaotic void origin that a five or ten light-year inner world can bear is not just three or five times more, but dozens of times more than the current two light-year inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally does not want to give up this great advantage.</p><p></p><p>"It will take at most a decade to reach the pinnacle, and then I will break through to the ultimate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has made up his mind. With his current strength, whether he breaks through to the ultimate or not doesn't make much difference. Even if he doesn't break through, there is no 12th Realm expert in the main universe who can kill him.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's avatar appeared out of thin air, this is his solar divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"The universe and time-space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was far-reaching, and the comprehension of the Seven Realms of Time and Space made him sense something terrifying. The vast universe, the countless spatial layers, everything was reflected in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the entire universe?" Lin Yuan was slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although he could already perceive the details of the Immortal Realm when he was there, now, overlooking the entire universe, his heart was still touched. The sheer volume of the universe was a hundred times that of the Immortal Realm, and the complexity was thousands or even tens of thousands of times greater.</p><p></p><p>"There are dozens of places where the time-space is completely sealed off? I can't even sense the specifics?" Lin Yuan found that there were still some secrets in the starry sky that he had not explored.</p><p></p><p>"These dozens of places, seven of them are occupied by human civilization's sacred lands?" Lin Yuan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Any peak group would have their ancestral lands, these places are the inheritance of the group, such as the human civilization's ancestral stars and the most important sacred lands.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the prying of the 12th Realm experts, these ancestral lands are heavily guarded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the Insect Tribe has four, the Tian Yu Clan has five, the Yu Clan has eight."  Lin Yuan's gaze swept across them.</p><p></p><p>As for these time-space seals that prevented him from sensing, Lin Yuan did not try to forcefully explore them, but merely glanced at them from afar before shifting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? The Calamity Tribe, only one?" Lin Yuan's expression showed slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>Among the ten greatest peak tribal powers in the universe, the Calamity Tribe is undoubtedly the most mysterious and powerful. Only the peak experts of the primordial universe tribes could rival them.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Calamity Tribe originated from the previous universe era and was targeted and suppressed by the will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it could not obscure the strength of the Calamity Tribe. The two 12th Realm experts of the Calamity Tribe have already reached the peak of the Dao Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>If not for the aversion of the universal consciousness, the Calamity Tribe would not be far from dominating all the tribes in the universe.</p><p></p><p>However, even the Insect Tribe and the Tian Yu Clan have several time-space sealed ancestral lands, but the more powerful Calamity Tribe only has one?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze penetrated through the layers of time-space, looking towards the depths of the Calamity Tribe's territory.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could not sense the specific location of the Calamity Tribe's ancestral land, and it looked like an ordinary wooden house, but this house had blocked the vision of his Seven Realms of Time and Space.</p><p></p><p>"I can't feel any aura from this wooden house at all?" Lin Yuan carefully observed, and when facing the ancestral lands of other peak tribes, he could at least infer some information, but in front of this wooden house, there was no clue whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was curious, and began to approach the wooden house, trying to observe it from different time-space perspectives.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the door of the house was pushed open, and a figure shrouded in mist walked out, "Who dares to spy on the ancestral land of my Calamity Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

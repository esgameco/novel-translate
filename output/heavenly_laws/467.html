            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 467 - Transaction (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"What reward will the Sect Master have me refine a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixir for?" Lin Yuan asked directly, without beating around the bush.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Daoist Cloud Seer, shouldn't you first ask how many Nine Revolutions Elixir pills you will be refining?" The Sect Master of the Azure Dragon Sect was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"I prefer to ask about the reward first, that way I'll have the motivation to refine the elixir," Lin Yuan replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as long as the Azure Dragon Sect could provide the materials for the Nine Revolutions Elixir, Lin Yuan could refine as many as they wanted.</p><p></p><p>"I see, our sect plans to request that Senior Daoist Cloud Seer refine twenty Nine Revolutions Elixir pills, and as for the reward, how about one million top-grade immortal crystals?" The Sect Master pondered for a while before speaking.</p><p></p><p>One million top-grade immortal crystals was an enormous sum, equivalent to ten times the wealth of an ordinary Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years ago, the resources Lin Yuan had obtained from Cloud Seer to 'revive' himself amounted to at most a hundred thousand top-grade immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>"One million top-grade immortal crystals?" Lin Yuan looked at the Sect Master again, "It seems the Sect Master is not very sincere."</p><p></p><p>If this had been tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years ago, a reward of one million top-grade immortal crystals for refining twenty Nine Revolutions Elixir pills would have been a reasonable price. </p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Demon Great War was about to begin, and the value of all kinds of immortal elixirs and resources was skyrocketing, especially for strategic immortal elixirs like the Nine Revolutions Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Daoist Cloud Seer, how much do you want?" The Sect Master asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ten million top-grade immortal crystals," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Ten million?" The Sect Master's expression turned unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragons Commerce Association was a powerful organization, and they could afford to provide ten million top-grade immortal crystals, but for the reward of refining the Nine Revolutions Elixir?</p><p></p><p>"Or you could give me a piece of 'Immortal Source' from the Nine Dragons Commerce Association, that could also offset the reward for refining the Nine Revolutions Elixir," Lin Yuan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Source was said to come from the source of the Immortal Realm and had great benefits for comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, only the Patriarchs of the Dao and their direct disciples could enter the source of the Immortal Realm, and Immortal Source was extremely rare in its outflow.</p><p></p><p>For the past five hundred years, Lin Yuan had tried both openly and secretly, but he had never obtained a piece of 'Immortal Source'.</p><p></p><p>Now, while helping the Nine Dragons Commerce Association refine the Nine Revolutions Elixir, he had the chance to see if he could acquire one.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragons Commerce Association had a significant influence in the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, so they should have the means to obtain 'Immortal Source'.</p><p></p><p>"A piece of 'Immortal Source'? Senior Daoist Cloud Seer should know the value of 'Immortal Source'," the Sect Master said.</p><p></p><p>'Immortal Source' was too rare to be measured by immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Revolutions Elixir I refine should be worth a piece of 'Immortal Source'," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot give you 'Immortal Source'," the Sect Master stood up, "It seems we cannot cooperate with Senior Daoist Cloud Seer."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragons Commerce Association could provide 'Immortal Source', but the Sect Master felt that the reward for refining a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixir was not worth that price.</p><p></p><p>"No matter."</p><p></p><p>"We can cooperate in the future."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the Sect Master left.</p><p></p><p>In another immortal dwelling in Cangwu Immortal City, the Sect Master's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"How did the transaction with that Senior Daoist Cloud Seer go?" An old man with white hair, also a Jade Immortal, who had introduced the Cloud Seer to the Sect Master, asked.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't work out," the Sect Master frowned, "That Cloud Seer made an outrageous demand, asking me for ten million immortal crystals or a piece of 'Immortal Source'."</p><p></p><p>"Ten million immortal crystals?" The old man thought for a moment, "It is indeed a bit high, but you also understand the current situation, the Immortal-Demon Great War is approaching, and the reward for refining the Nine Revolutions Elixir has naturally increased."</p><p></p><p>"But ten million immortal crystals is still too high, with that kind of money, I could easily hire the top-tier elixir refiners," the Sect Master said.</p><p></p><p>"Before the last Immortal-Demon Great War, Cloud Seer's elixir refinement skills were just average, and it's only in the past few hundred years that he's been able to refine some decent immortal elixirs. But that's just a recent development, how can he compare to those top-tier elixir refiners?" </p><p></p><p>The quality of elixirs refined by elixir refiners had an element of randomness, depending on their state and luck. </p><p></p><p>It's possible that Cloud Seer's state has been good recently, allowing him to refine decent immortal elixirs, but those top-tier elixir refiners could maintain that level of quality consistently.</p><p></p><p>In the Sect Master's view, Cloud Seer's good state might not last, and he might even fail to succeed in refining the Nine Revolutions Elixir.</p><p></p><p>If an elixir refiner fails, the Nine Dragons Commerce Association would have to bear the loss of the materials, so the Sect Master naturally didn't want to pay too much for Cloud Seer.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought this Cloud Seer, as a newcomer to the ranks of elixir refiners, would be more humble, but it turns out he's also very greedy. These elixir refiners, taking advantage of the impending Immortal-Demon Great War to arbitrarily raise their rewards, they all deserve to die," the Sect Master's gaze turned icy.</p><p></p><p>The old man with white hair couldn't help but find it a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Nine Dragons Commerce Association currently doing the same thing, shamelessly profiting from the impending war?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't mind too much that the Sect Master didn't accept the conditions.</p><p></p><p>As his reputation as an elixir refiner spread, there were often powers or powerful Jade Immortals who would request him to refine immortal elixirs, and he didn't really need to cooperate with the Nine Dragons Commerce Association.</p><p></p><p>"It seems 'Immortal Source' is really hard to obtain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>From the Sect Master's attitude, Lin Yuan could see that the value of a piece of 'Immortal Source' was far beyond even ten million immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>At least when faced with a reward of ten million immortal crystals, the Sect Master showed some contemplation, but for 'Immortal Source'? Lin Yuan could tell the other party didn't even consider it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the only way to obtain Immortal Source is...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Through plundering?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Lin Yuan did not want to do this, as it would create too much commotion.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had not yet grown to the invincible power of the immortal realm, so he was still mainly in a state of hibernation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was pondering.</p><p></p><p>His expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Yun Zhenzi's figure appeared, "the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion is looking for you."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Pavilion was an important part of the Cangwu Immortal City, responsible for the cave mansion area, and the Pavilion Master was one of the major figures in the immortal city, second only to the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, compared to forces like the Nine Dragons Trading Company at the Jade Immortal level, the Immortal Pavilion was under the Cangwu Immortal City, and the Cangwu Immortal City was established by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>The backing of the Nine Dragons Trading Company was the nine Jade Immortals of the Dragon Clan, while the backing of the Cangwu Immortal City was the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion appeared before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master Yun Zhenzi," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion smiled as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master," Lin Yuan nodded, and his attitude towards the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion was a bit better than towards the Blue Dragon Sect Leader.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion was a major figure in the Cangwu Immortal City, and Lin Yuan was currently stationed in the Cangwu Immortal City, so he had to show some courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Dragon Sect Leader just came to cooperate with the Grand Master, did he succeed?" the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion asked.</p><p></p><p>Before visiting Lin Yuan, the Blue Dragon Sect Leader had inquired about Grand Master Yun Zhenzi's information and intelligence many times, and the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion had also heard about it.</p><p></p><p>"No," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Blue Dragon Sect Leader is overbearing, he must not have been willing to suffer any losses," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe he didn't see anything in me," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master Yun Zhenzi's alchemy attainments, the Blue Dragon Sect Leader must have misjudged," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion thought for a moment and continued, "Since Grand Master Yun Zhenzi did not cooperate with the Blue Dragon Sect Leader, why don't you cooperate with our Cangwu Immortal City?"</p><p></p><p>"Cooperate with you?" Lin Yuan looked at the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion, not at all surprised.</p><p></p><p>Given the Pavilion Master's identity, coming to visit him specifically, he must have something to ask for.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want me to refine?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Just like the Blue Dragon Sect Leader, it's also a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixirs," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion said.</p><p></p><p>As a strategically important immortal elixir, not only was the Nine Dragons Trading Company extremely concerned about it, but the Cangwu Immortal City also had a great demand for it.</p><p></p><p>Facing the impending immortal-demon war, the Cangwu Immortal City was under tremendous pressure, and at this time, an extra Nine Revolutions Elixir might just be able to restore the full combat power of a Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"How many Nine Revolutions Elixirs?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"For now, we need fifty," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion said.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty," Lin Yuan pondered, "Pavilion Master, what reward do you plan to give?"</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Dragon Sect Leader told me that Grand Master Yun Zhenzi needs 'immortal source', so for these fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs, I will give you three portions of 'immortal source' as a reward," the Pavilion Master said.</p><p></p><p>"Three portions of 'immortal source'?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>From the Blue Dragon Sect Leader's attitude, one could see the value of the 'immortal source'.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Dragon Sect Leader didn't even consider trading the 'immortal source' with Lin Yuan, and even if their cooperation could be negotiated, it would definitely be rewarded with tens of millions of immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>Immortal crystals could be earned.</p><p></p><p>But immortal source, that was a different story.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion actively offered the immortal source as a reward?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't believe that the Pavilion Master couldn't come up with a few million top-grade immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>"I have great confidence in Grand Master Yun Zhenzi's alchemy attainments, and in the future, our cooperation will be extensive, I only hope that Grand Master Yun Zhenzi will not refuse in the future," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion spoke.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan heard this and immediately understood the Pavilion Master's intention.</p><p></p><p>The other party was offering three portions of immortal source not only for this cooperation, but also for future cooperation.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master thinks so highly of me?" Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I just believe in Grand Master Yun Zhenzi," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion said, "If the Grand Master agrees, I will go apply for the immortal source, and it will be delivered to you in at most half a month."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With such immortal source delivered to his doorstep, Lin Yuan naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>In a certain secret space of the Immortal Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master's figure appeared and immediately began to apply for the transfer of the 'immortal source'.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, the three portions of immortal source are merely the reward for that Yun Zhenzi to refine fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs?" a figure beside him asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Immortal source was extremely precious, and three portions of immortal source would be very difficult to buy even with a hundred million top-grade immortal crystals.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that there was simply no channel to sell immortal source.</p><p></p><p>Even with the impending immortal-demon war, using three portions of immortal source to refine fifty Nine Revolutions Elixirs was extremely unbelievable, even those top-tier alchemy grandmasters would not dare to quote such a price.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think Grand Master Yun Zhenzi is just an ordinary alchemy grandmaster?" the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion glanced at the figure beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" the figure was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Not an ordinary alchemy grandmaster, then what kind of alchemy grandmaster?</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion shook his head. "Using three portions of immortal source to secure Grand Master Yun Zhenzi's future cooperation with our Cangwu Immortal City is not a losing deal."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can leave now," the Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion no longer spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The figure beside him, despite having countless doubts in his heart, could only retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion sat there alone, thinking to himself:</p><p></p><p>"In the past four to five hundred years, the number of high-quality immortal elixirs produced by the Cangwu Immortal City has increased by a large margin, even top-tier alchemy grandmasters would not be able to continuously refine so many high-quality immortal elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"And Yun Zhenzi has also been residing in the immortal city's cave mansion for the past five hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of the Immortal Pavilion's gaze was profound.</p>

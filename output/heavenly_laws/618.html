        <h1>Chapter 618</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Xuanhuang Universe, Lin Yuan did not send out his incarnations to scour the area. This was because he was worried about exposing the locations of the precious treasures recorded on the beast skin map.</p><p></p><p>In the outer regions of the Xuanhuang Universe, the locations of most of the treasures and rare items were extremely hidden. Even for Lin Yuan, without the guidance of the beast skin map, it would be difficult for him to find them in a short period of time. The other Supremes were the same.</p><p></p><p>At this time, if he were to send out his incarnations to search, wouldn't that be pointing out the targets for the other Chaos Supremes? But right now, apart from Lin Yuan, there were only some Chaos Nobles in the entire Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, even if he were to split into hundreds of incarnations, each incarnation would be able to maintain a power close to that of a Chaos Noble Sovereign. Dealing with those Chaos Nobles would not be a problem. Of course, those Chaos Nobles also did not dare to compete with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his inner universe, while heading towards the Xuanhuang Mausoleum, Lin Yuan also sent a wisp of consciousness to descend into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this Ominous Heavenly Heart will have any effect on me," Lin Yuan looked at the dark and profound crystal before him. The other Chaos Supremes basically did not have any means that could rival the Ominous Heavenly Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Ominous Heavenly Domain had just condensed, but it had already surpassed the Black Brilliance Domain of the Black Brilliance Supreme. Therefore, many Chaos Supremes, even if they obtained the Ominous Heavenly Heart, would not think about whether it would be useful for them.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that this suppression technique was something that many Chaos Supremes had long dreamed of. The Savage Supreme was not weaker than the Black Brilliance Supreme in pure combat power, but the Black Brilliance Supreme looked down on the Savage Supreme, thinking that the latter was just a brute.</p><p></p><p>What was the reason? Wasn't it the Black Brilliance Domain? Lin Yuan was able to easily subdue the Black Brilliance Supreme, the Savage Supreme, and the other eight Supremes, relying on the domain suppression power of his outer universe.</p><p></p><p>If he did not have the outer universe, even if Lin Yuan's comprehensive combat power surpassed the eight Chaos Supremes, it would still be difficult for him to completely subdue them.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of domain and spatial aspects, Lin Yuan already had the outer universe. He was worried that this Ominous Heavenly Heart might overlap with his own methods.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try refining it first."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Lin Yuan immediately began the refinement.</p><p></p><p>This peerless Supreme-level treasure, the Ominous Heavenly Heart, was definitely best used on himself. As for trading it away? Unless it truly had no effect on him, Lin Yuan would not choose to trade it away.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds. The majestic universal forces began to refine that tiny dark and profound crystal, and waves of extremely pure Ominous Heavenly Origin began to surge forth.</p><p></p><p>This Ominous Heavenly Origin was extremely miraculous and was quickly absorbed and devoured by his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's useful," Lin Yuan's expression brightened. As he slowly refined the Ominous Heavenly Heart, he clearly felt that the foundation of his inner universe was increasing in strength at a certain rate.</p><p></p><p>After a few hundred breaths, Lin Yuan opened his eyes. At this moment, the dark and profound crystal had disappeared, and at the same time, Lin Yuan's inner universe had become vast and mighty, with its power increased by at least 20%.</p><p></p><p>"20% increase in power, not bad," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Chaos Supremes to refine the Ominous Heavenly Heart, their strength would increase dozens of times, allowing them to reach the peak Supreme level. But for Lin Yuan, who was already far stronger than ordinary Chaos Supremes, the 20% increase in his inner universe's power was not insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"If it's now, the Dual Source Supreme should not be able to escape my outer universe," Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Dual Source Supreme had desperately burned the fusion of the Dual Source to tear open a crack to the outside world and escape.</p><p></p><p>This made Lin Yuan quite regretful. After all, that was 1 billion Chaos Stones. And the Dual Source Supreme must have been carrying some precious treasures and weapons, so the loss was not just 1 billion Chaos Stones.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the need to be cautious, Lin Yuan would have really wanted to chase and kill him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self was rampaging through the Xuanhuang Universe. With the guidance of the beast skin map, he was able to avoid many dangerous areas in the Xuanhuang Universe, saving a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived at the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Universe. This place was empty, with wisps of Xuanhuang Qi permeating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Universe was filled with this Xuanhuang Qi everywhere, which made Lin Yuan feel very comfortable. The "Xuanhuang Body" seemed to have returned to its mother body in this environment filled with Xuanhuang Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan carefully observed the surroundings, his expression revealing a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the mausoleum?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan compared the beast skin map, and according to the instructions on it, this should be the location of the mausoleum, but there was no trace of any mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>"Is it hidden in the depths of space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to observe, sweeping his gaze through layer after layer of space-time, but still found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"This beast skin map... it shouldn't be wrong."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into contemplation. The authenticity of the beast skin map had been verified many times. Whether it was the Life Spirit Stone in the Life Source Star or the other precious treasures and the Ominous Heavenly Heart, they all matched the indications on the beast skin map.</p><p></p><p>In addition, many of Lin Yuan's incarnations were searching for a large number of treasures and rare items based on the various regions marked on the beast skin map. Basically, the map had been proven reliable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that there are other conditions required to enter the Xuanhuang Mausoleum?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred. Since it was called a mausoleum, it must be a place highly valued by the Xuanhuang Emperor, and it was very likely not open to other Supremes. Why was Lin Yuan able to know about this mausoleum?</p><p></p><p>It was because he had obtained this beast skin map, which was kept in a golden box that could not be opened even after the passage of countless universes. Lin Yuan was able to open the box and obtain the map due to the Xuanhuang Imprint in the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Imprint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful. He then began to release the aura of the Xuanhuang Imprint from the depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>Humming sounds! As the aura of the Xuanhuang Imprint continued to spread, ripples appeared on the space-time before him, and a majestic palace gradually materialized.</p><p></p><p>When this majestic palace first appeared, it seemed unreal, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in the water. But as time passed, the illusion faded, and the reality became apparent.</p><p></p><p>"Such mastery of space-time!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was greatly shocked. He had once seen the image of the Xuanhuang Emperor casually opening 33,333 Xuanhuang secret realms in a single thought. That was the ultimate pinnacle of the Nine Layers of Space-Time Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the way this majestic palace appeared had already surpassed the level of opening the Xuanhuang secret realms at that time.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Xuanhuang Emperor's final achievement was in the mastery of space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go further?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor left this mausoleum after opening the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>During that time, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor must have made some breakthroughs in his understanding of the mysteries of time and space, which was only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the majestic palace that had appeared, paused for half a breath, and then strode directly into it.</p><p></p><p>The palace interior was also extremely empty. Numerous murals were engraved on the towering walls, depicting a young emperor who emerged from the innate universe and ultimately established a domain in the chaotic void, with many powerful experts from various void realms coming to pay their respects at the peak of his reign.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor, born from the innate universe within the chaotic void?" Lin Yuan thought to himself. So far, most of the Chaotic Revered Ones he had seen were either powerful extraordinary life forms or forces from certain tribes of the chaotic void. As for the strong ones who emerged from the innate universe and eventually reached the level of Chaotic Revered Ones, they were not many, let alone someone as peerless and great as His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to look at the subsequent murals. The murals showed the Mysterious Emperor's power reaching the ultimate level, sweeping through one void realm after another, with many peerless great saints from even more ancient eras being defeated by him.</p><p></p><p>"An invincible great saint, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor must have the strength of an invincible great saint," Lin Yuan said solemnly. The images in the murals, though simple, clearly showed that even peerless great saints were no match for the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." Lin Yuan looked at the last few murals, which recorded that the Mysterious Emperor accidentally entered a dangerous place, and after emerging from that dangerous place, he immediately opened the Mysterious Yellow Universe and went into seclusion, then broke through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Strange." Lin Yuan frowned. The All-Seeing Eye had said that the Mysterious Emperor had once been extremely close to becoming an invincible great saint. But now it seemed that this "closeness" was not in terms of strength, but in terms of time. As long as the Mysterious Emperor lived a little longer, his reputation would continue to spread, and he would inevitably be recognized by all the peerless great saints, becoming the invincible great saint of that era.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mysterious Great Saint did not do so. Instead, he chose to break through to the Thirteenth Realm immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Because of the last dangerous place he entered?" Lin Yuan looked at the last few murals, and it was after coming out of that dangerous place that the Mysterious Emperor made this change.</p><p></p><p>"The Master of the Demon Jade Tower said that the Mysterious Emperor had once entered the dimensional interstice. Was that dangerous place the dimensional interstice?" Lin Yuan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was pondering, a voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Are you curious about what the Emperor experienced and why he chose to break through to the Thirteenth Realm after returning from that dangerous place?"</p><p></p><p>This figure was extremely old, yet also had a certain youthfulness, exuding a sense of extreme contradiction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled and looked to the side. Unbeknownst to him, a man in a mysterious yellow robe had quietly stood beside him, watching the murals together.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Lin Yuan asked solemnly, but he was not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>If this mausoleum was truly the last place left by the Mysterious Emperor, it must have been set up with many measures. If the Master of the Demon Jade Tower could still awaken a sealed consciousness after breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm, the Mysterious Emperor, whose strength was no less than the Master's, should also be able to do the same.</p><p></p><p>"I am the spirit of this mausoleum, created by the Emperor before he broke through to the Thirteenth Realm," the man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, this mausoleum would not have appeared, even if the Mysterious Yellow Universe outside was destroyed, it would not have been affected."</p><p></p><p>"But before the Emperor broke through to the Thirteenth Realm, he left behind nine treasure chests," the man looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Treasure chests?" Lin Yuan immediately realized that the golden box he had obtained was one of those treasure chests.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure chests contain maps of the mausoleum and the Mysterious Yellow Universe. With the maps, one can find the location of the mausoleum and then actively release the map's aura and the Mysterious Yellow seal to make the mausoleum manifest."</p><p></p><p>The man paused for a moment and continued, "But to open the treasure chests, there are two prerequisites."</p><p></p><p>"First, you must be the Emperor's heir. You have inherited a Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm, so your identity qualifies."</p><p></p><p>The man smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then he became a bit puzzled. "What's the second condition?"</p><p></p><p>"The second condition is that it must be three hundred million universe cycles after the Emperor broke through to the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The man looked at Lin Yuan. "The correct identity and the correct time - both are indispensable. If the time has not arrived, even if you are the Emperor's heir, you cannot open the treasure chest and obtain the map inside. And vice versa."</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred million universe cycles..." Lin Yuan's thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had no specific concept of the era the Mysterious Emperor lived in, only knowing that it was in the ancient past, long before the current time.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had determined that it was at least three hundred million universe cycles ago.</p><p></p><p>"After three hundred million universe cycles have passed, if the Emperor has not yet broken through to the Thirteenth Realm, he would most likely be unable to escape the cycle of time. At that time, if there is still the Emperor's heir outside, and this heir has entered the Mysterious Emperor's universe..."</p><p></p><p>The man looked at Lin Yuan. "Then this mausoleum can be summoned, and you can inherit everything the Emperor left behind."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there listening quietly. He now understood.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as the Mysterious Emperor did not have the confidence to break through to the Thirteenth Realm. That's why he specifically arranged this mausoleum as a last resort.</p><p></p><p>"Then why did the Emperor rush to break through to the Thirteenth Realm?" Lin Yuan asked, voicing his doubt.</p><p></p><p>With the Mysterious Emperor's strength, he could have waited a little longer, at least gaining the title of Invincible Great Saint before attempting the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Because the Emperor obtained a certain precious treasure in that dangerous place, a treasure that needed the power of the time cycle to suppress."</p><p></p><p>The man shook his head and said, "So the Emperor chose to break through to the Thirteenth Realm earlier. It didn't really matter to him whether he did it earlier or later, as he had already reached the limit of the Chaotic Realm. As for the title of Invincible Great Saint, the Emperor didn't care much about it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was inwardly shocked upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>A precious treasure that needed the power of the time cycle to suppress?</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>The man extended his right hand and gave a light flip.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the surrounding space began to tremble, and Lin Yuan felt the world change as he found himself in a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, his pupils slightly constricting.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the merits were determined, Lin Yuan had thought that his merits would be quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected it to be this much, a full 360 billion merits.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, it was also very reasonable. The entire Golden Mist Precious Land was completely due to Lin Yuan's efforts that it was returned to the Scorching Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to Lin Yuan, with his own strength, snatching this precious land from the hands of the other Ancient Country's Supreme Celestials.</p><p></p><p>With such high merits, this was only normal.</p><p></p><p>As for the fact that this precious land is now completely owned by Lin Yuan, it is not considered a loss for the Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor had already said that in the future, when Lin Yuan breaks through to the final step, and the precious land is guarded by his descendants, the relationship between it and the Scorching Sun Ancient Country will return to normal.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, this Golden Mist Precious Land will still belong to the Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of a longer timeline, the Scorching Sun Ancient Country is not at a loss.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan successfully crosses into the Ancestor realm and opens the Seventh Ancient Country, he will be able to continue to control this precious land.</p><p></p><p>However, once he reaches the Ancestor realm, he probably won't even care about the rare treasures produced within the precious land.</p><p></p><p>So far, among the many precious lands controlled by the Six Great Ancient Countries, there has been no news of any Ancestor having a need for them.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Supreme Celestial."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial tentatively asked, "How many merits did you obtain?"</p><p></p><p>After asking, the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial felt he had been a bit reckless, and quickly added, "I was just asking."</p><p></p><p>"360 billion merits," Lin Yuan said directly without concealing anything.</p><p></p><p>At his level, the merits of many treasures could be protected, and there was no need to hide or be low-key about it.</p><p></p><p>"So many merits!" The Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial exclaimed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Even if one had achieved victory in a full-scale war against the other Ancient Countries, the commander would be far from obtaining so many merits.</p><p></p><p>But considering Lin Yuan's overwhelming power within the precious land, the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial had no other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>These merits were all that the Silver River Supreme Celestial deserved.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yuan had a few more conversations with the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The latter then stood up and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>During the period of contending for the precious land, the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial often came to Lin Yuan's door, asking him how to excavate the Ancestor bloodline to the Supreme Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally opened his mouth to guide him, and in the subsequent planning, he would spread the cultivation path of the Martial Dao branch, which included the methods and means of excavating one's own Ancestor bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Now, guiding the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial was equivalent to subtly pulling him into the Martial Dao path, which would also have a very good effect on establishing 'anchors' and 'signposts' for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier Supreme Celestial actively taking the Martial Dao path, the impact on the evolution of the Martial Dao path would far exceed that of billions and billions of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan would generally give guidance when other Supreme Celestials sought his advice.</p><p></p><p>It was all to lay the groundwork for the spread of the Martial Dao path.</p><p></p><p>Compared to spreading the Martial Dao path from the bottom up, starting from the top down would certainly be faster and better.</p><p></p><p>"What should I exchange these 360 billion merits for?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial off, Lin Yuan began to ponder how to use so many merits.</p><p></p><p>In the treasury of the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, the highest exchange for merits was 100 billion merits, which included opportunities for Ancestor possession, the Highest Inheritance, Ancestor Weapons, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The Highest Inheritance referred to the Thirteenth-Tier Inheritance, and the Ancestor Weapons were Thirteenth-Tier weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan diverted a wisp of his divine sense and entered the Ancient Country's treasury, quickly browsing through it.</p><p></p><p>The treasury of the Ancient Country contained a vast ocean of precious inheritances and treasures. Lin Yuan first completely exchanged the remaining Chaotic Profundity Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Profundity Diagrams that Lin Yuan previously needed to exchange bit by bit, he could now exchange without even blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly glanced at the "Chaotic Profundity Diagrams" he had exchanged. They were all representations of the remaining Chaotic Tripartite Realm profundities.</p><p></p><p>These carriers containing the fundamental veins of Chaos were worth exchanging, as they had the highest cost-performance ratio, being the best guidance for inheritances.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining ones..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to observe from the highest to the lowest.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Weapon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed a scarlet-red long spear.</p><p></p><p>This long spear was a weapon of the Scorching Sun Ancestor, and it was also a Thirteenth-Tier weapon. What Lin Yuan saw was only the image of this long spear, but he felt that this spear seemed to be able to pierce through the entire Source World, pierce through the constraints of time and space, pierce through the constraints of cause and effect, and pierce through all obstacles.</p><p></p><p>"A purely offensive Thirteenth-Tier weapon, nothing can stop this one strike. I even feel that with full force, it could pierce a hole through the entire Source World," Lin Yuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He also had a Thirteenth-Tier weapon, which was the Heavenly Void Cauldron obtained from Emperor Xuan.</p><p></p><p>But that Heavenly Void Cauldron was not a purely offensive weapon, as it had defensive and suppressive effects.</p><p></p><p>As for this scarlet-red long spear, it had only one use - to pierce through everything in front of it.</p><p></p><p>"100 billion merits can be used to comprehend this Ancestor Weapon for 10,000 years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the introduction information of this long spear and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Thirteenth-Tier weapon was not very useful to him.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Lin Yuan had already reached the invincible Supreme Celestial realm and had no need to borrow this Ancestor Weapon.</p><p></p><p>In terms of comprehension, Lin Yuan was currently comprehending the fundamental operation of the Source World through the Golden Mist Precious Land. This long spear must contain the Scorching Sun Ancestor's understanding of the Dao rules, but it is still derived from this Source World.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending this Ancestor Weapon was not as beneficial to Lin Yuan as directly comprehending the fundamental operation of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan comprehended that Heavenly Void Cauldron because he could not see the fundamental operation of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"The Highest Inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over several Ancestor Weapons and then turned to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the Supremely Exalted Inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Each Supremely Exalted Inheritance is worth trillions of merit, and this is the path to becoming the mightiest Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Of course, cultivating a Supremely Exalted Inheritance and mastering it are two completely different matters.</p><p></p><p>The Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns of the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms have basically all exchanged for one Supremely Exalted Inheritance. Although trillions of merit is a huge amount, it is still very achievable for Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns who have accumulated merit for billions of years.</p><p></p><p>However, while there are many Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns who cultivate Supremely Exalted Inheritances, the ones who can ultimately master it and reach the level of the mightiest Celestial Sovereign are still very few.</p><p></p><p>"These Supremely Exalted Inheritances..." Lin Yuan carefully examined them. The treasury contained nine Supremely Exalted Inheritances in total. Excluding three that had side effects that were too severe, such as the "Heart of Scorching Sun" which required the cultivator to lose most of their rationality, Lin Yuan was unwilling to cultivate those.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining six Supremely Exalted Inheritances, Lin Yuan carefully selected among them.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing in cultivating a Supremely Exalted Inheritance is compatibility. For example, Lin Yuan was extremely compatible with the "Infinite Void", which allowed him to easily enter and cultivate it to his current level.</p><p></p><p>"I should take it slow with the Supremely Exalted Inheritances."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind and looked towards the top of the treasury.</p><p></p><p>That was where the guidance inheritance coveted by all the Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns from the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms who were about to take the final step was located.</p><p></p><p>The Opportunity to Possess the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>Many Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns may have diverse choices when it comes to Supremely Exalted Inheritances, but they all unanimously exchange for the opportunity to possess the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, a large portion of Pinnacle Celestial Sovereigns have exchanged for the opportunity to possess the Progenitor multiple times, as long as they have enough merit.</p><p></p><p>"Possessing the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts, observing the world from the perspective of a 13th-tier Time Life. What an astonishing opportunity this was! Even the peerless great saints or invincible great saints in the Chaotic Void would not dare to dream of such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"I have now reached the perfect Chaotic Realm, so I can definitely try possessing the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Possessing the Progenitor and perceiving the space-time from the Progenitor's height would undoubtedly have a tremendous impact on himself.</p><p></p><p>Especially for an existence like Lin Yuan, whose comprehension was heavenly, this would be of immense significance.</p><p></p><p>"I will exchange for it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately chose to exchange.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, his "merit balance" decreased by a trillion.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after exchanging for the "Possess the Progenitor" opportunity,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan received a voice transmission from the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Silver River, I knew you would exchange for this."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom was not at all surprised.</p><p></p><p>Any Pinnacle Celestial Sovereign who had accumulated a trillion merit would first exchange for the opportunity to possess the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>"I currently only have one incarnation. Will that affect the possession?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"It won't have any impact."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom said.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If there would be any impact, he would switch back to his true body guardian of the Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>"Now, come over here."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately went to the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>In the grand hall,</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan and reminded him, "The first time you possess the Progenitor, the insights you gain will be the greatest."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's begin."</p><p></p><p>"I will send you to a space-time realm where the Progenitor has left a mark. Once you arrive there, just call out to the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom said.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Progenitor normally does not pay attention to the affairs within the ancient kingdom, as their mind is focused on higher-level machinations. They would only respond if the Scorching Sun Kingdom was under threat or if they were called upon.</p><p></p><p>"Got it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space-time realm, there was a scarlet-red platform.</p><p></p><p>This was the most secretive place of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom, where one could directly contact the Scorching Sun Progenitor. Only those who had accumulated a trillion merit and exchanged for the opportunity to possess the Progenitor could enter this place.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared out of thin air, observing his surroundings, and immediately walked towards the scarlet-red platform.</p><p></p><p>The platform was empty, but Lin Yuan could feel a sense of oppression, as if facing the source of the world itself.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the scarlet-red platform and called out to the Scorching Sun Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke,</p><p></p><p>A figure began to take shape on the platform above.</p><p></p><p>This figure was seated in a cross-legged position, similar to the majestic figure Lin Yuan had seen standing at the highest point in the Flame World, but even more real, as if it was right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Behind the figure were a pair of fiery wings, seemingly containing endless space-time, vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Progenitor is so terrifying. Just this single mark can easily destroy all of my true bodies, incarnations, and clones." Lin Yuan understood this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his true body and original soul in the Chaotic Void would not be destroyed, as they were separated by two dimensions, and even a Time Life would have difficulty affecting them.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The cross-legged figure slowly opened its eyes and looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately bowed his head.</p><p></p><p>The gaze of the Scorching Sun Progenitor fell upon Lin Yuan, and as a Time Life, wherever the gaze reached, the future would unfold like unrolling paper.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The Scorching Sun Progenitor's expression showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>The past is set, but the future is uncertain. Every moment of the future will branch out into countless possibilities.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Progenitor instantly observed dozens of future timelines regarding Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely this detailed observation of the future that left the Scorching Sun Progenitor extremely surprised, even incredulous.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

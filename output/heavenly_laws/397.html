        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, elder." Lin Yuan immediately paid his respects. </p><p></p><p>Although he did not know who this half-meter tall old man was, since the other party was able to sit before the painting scroll, he was most likely the true master of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>His own entry into the Heavenly Gate and appearance here was perhaps by this being's will.</p><p></p><p>"You are quite courteous." </p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the face of the half-meter tall old man. It had been too long since he last communicated with a living being. Although there were many lifeforms inhabiting this two-dimensional world, none could arouse his interest.</p><p></p><p>"Courteous?" Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>When facing an existence of unknown depths, would it not be foolish to be discourteous and attack directly?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was no fool.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, now you should know that this enormous painting scroll before you is the low-dimensional space you currently reside in," the half-meter tall old man said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"This low-dimensional space is one of the first low-dimensional spaces to come into existence, replicating as closely as possible the lower-dimensional world envisioned by the creator," the old man continued.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly. </p><p></p><p>He had already obtained a general understanding of this low-dimensional space from the six-armed figure in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji in the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>"The creator made this low-dimensional space to help explore lower-dimensional worlds. It is also a game world that can accommodate billions upon billions of lifeforms at once," the half-meter tall old man said, glancing at Lin Yuan. "Any lifeform that falls into this low-dimensional space is participating in this game. Losers lose the spiritual will they invested, while winners receive rewards - these are the game rules."</p><p></p><p>"A game world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly. The six-armed figure in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had mentioned that low-dimensional spaces were divided into entertainment and gambling types. This "game world" the old man spoke of seemed to be the gambling type, since it involved punishment.</p><p></p><p>"And now, you have emerged victorious from this game as the sole winner," the half-meter tall old man smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The sole winner?" Lin Yuan's expression showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't think those game participants in the low-dimensional space could leave, did you? They no longer have that chance."</p><p></p><p>"From beginning to end, this game could only have one winner," the old man said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate was indeed a way to leave the two-dimensional world, but it could only allow one powerful being from the myriad races to enter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to create specialized cultivation methods for the eleven evolved beings like Xuanyuan Duo after leaving, to help them increase their strength and improve their chances of entering the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the strongest human civilization experts like Xia Qinzhisheng, who could only replicate a fraction of the two-dimensional world derived from the Virtual Realm to sense and deduce from, Lin Yuan's real experiences in the two-dimensional world gave him more insight.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that idea was dashed.</p><p></p><p>According to the half-meter tall old man, apart from Lin Yuan, none of the other powerful myriad races could leave the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>"Since you are the victor, you may now choose your reward," the half-meter tall old man abruptly asked, changing the subject.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what kind of reward would you like?"</p><p></p><p>The old man gazed at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If it were any other victor, even a legendary eleventh-stage perfected being like the Four Divine Kings, the old man would not have such great interest.</p><p></p><p>But the comprehension ability Lin Yuan displayed was simply too terrifying. In the low-dimensional space, everything would return to its starting point, and the path walked afterwards relied mainly on one's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for comprehension ability, higher-level lifeforms would surpass lower ones - this was normal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's level of existence was not the weakest among the lifeforms that fell into this low-dimensional space, but it also had no relation to the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Yet under such circumstances, he managed to break through the limit of 129 worlds in just over ten thousand years. The half-meter tall old man felt he should treat Lin Yuan differently.</p><p></p><p>"Reward?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had also mentioned that emerging victorious from a gambling-type low-dimensional space would earn a corresponding reward.</p><p></p><p>But the rewards possessed by different dimensional spaces varied.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what rewards there are," Lin Yuan inquired tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"The rewards correspond to the punishments," the talkative half-meter tall old man said. "The punishment is the permanent loss of the spiritual will fragment that entered."</p><p></p><p>"Then the rewards are aspects like the physical bodies, souls, bloodlines, memories, and understanding of the rules from all the game participants who entered the low-dimensional space."</p><p></p><p>"Physical bodies, souls, bloodlines, memories, and understanding of the rules?" Lin Yuan's expression showed slight confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if you choose physical bodies, you can select any one participant and replicate their physical body for your comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"If you choose memories, you can replicate the corresponding memories for observation," the half-meter tall old man patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Since the low-dimensional space could permanently deprive participants of their spiritual will fragments, it was equivalent to gaining those spiritual will fragments, then bestowing portions of them as rewards.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>For the victor.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The guiding space within the black planet was a portion of the insights into the fusion rules of the Twelfth Realm lifeforms, forcibly extracted and allowing other lifeforms to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of the half-meter-tall old man was to separate the spiritual will avatars of all the powerful experts of the myriad races who fell in here into many parts and let Lin Yuan choose.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the extraction in the two-dimensional world was more ingenious than the black planet.</p><p></p><p>"Which one should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts spun rapidly. </p><p></p><p>Among the numerous powerful experts of the myriad races who fell into the two-dimensional world, quite a few were special lifeforms, and not a few were unique special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>If their fleshly bodies and bloodlines could be perfectly extracted, it would undoubtedly be of great help to Lin Yuan, at least allowing him to further enhance his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>"Senior," Lin Yuan pondered carefully, having made up his mind, "I want the part about insights into the rules."</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the fleshly body and bloodline were not as important as insights into the rules. The deeper his insights into the rules, the more perfect and stable the world within his body would be, which would also greatly benefit his fleshly body.</p><p></p><p>It might even increase Lin Yuan's chances of breaking through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>"Insights into the rules?" The half-meter-tall old man nodded. This aspect was indeed the most precious.</p><p></p><p>"Your comprehension is the highest I've seen," the half-meter-tall old man pondered and continued, "So I'll give you two more choices."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want all the insights into the rules of a certain participating lifeform, or do you want the insights into a certain rule from all the participating lifeforms?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man looked at Lin Yuan. "You decide how to choose."</p><p></p><p>"Which one to choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The so-called insights into all the rules of a certain participating lifeform, the subject was the lifeform. For example, if Lin Yuan chose the Four Divine Kings, he could obtain the Four Divine Kings' complete insights into the rules.</p><p></p><p>As for the insights into a certain rule from all the participating lifeforms, the subject was the rule itself. For instance, if Lin Yuan chose the rule of life and death cycles, he could obtain the insights into the rule of life and death cycles from all the powerful experts of the myriad races who fell into the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Different lifeforms, even if contemplating the same rule, would have different understandings and insights.</p><p></p><p>Just as the rule of space had many facets, comprehending the complete rule of space was only comprehending one facet. Even for the most powerful experts, they could not grasp all facets of the rule of space.</p><p></p><p>The same applied to other rules and fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as the Four Divine Kings, they could not guarantee that their insights into the rules were the most perfect or comprehensive, ultimately only representing themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, if the insights into a certain rule from all the powerful experts of the myriad races who fell into the two-dimensional world were gathered and integrated, it would undoubtedly be far more powerful than the insights of a single powerful expert of the myriad races, if not perfect.</p><p></p><p>For the fusion rules at the Pillar level, the depth of insights was divided into nine levels from the First Realm to the Ninth Realm. Without a doubt, the higher the realm, the more comprehensive and perfect the understanding and insights into that Pillar-level fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>"I choose the rule. I want the complete insights into the fusion of space-time rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of space-time rules was the most arduous and abstruse among all fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Well, that wasn't entirely accurate. The most abstruse and difficult fusion rule was not the fusion of space-time rules, but the rule of chaos.</p><p></p><p>However, the rule of chaos was no longer considered a fusion rule. It was the source of all rules. And among the powerful experts of the myriad races who fell into the two-dimensional world this time, it was estimated that none had gained insights into the rule of chaos, so Lin Yuan chose the fusion of space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of space-time rules?" The half-meter-tall old man nodded. "You choosing this one will probably require some more waiting."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lin Yuan immediately replied. He had already waited for ten thousand years, so he didn't mind waiting a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>After the half-meter-tall old man finished speaking, his gaze returned to the enormous scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged beside him, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time here doesn't seem to differ from the main universe," Lin Yuan's true self and Tai Yin Yuan Shen were in the main universe and could sense the flow of time between them.</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self opened his eyes, and his consciousness began to connect to the virtual world, applying to enter the personal world of the Paramount Expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's application was almost instantly approved, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared before the Paramount Expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Expert," Lin Yuan slightly bowed, clearly aware that Xia Qin had been waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan with concern. "What's really behind the Heavenly Gate? I didn't sense any spatial fluctuations outside that 'blank paper.' Where were you transmitted to?"</p><p></p><p>"And are you safe now?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin rapidly inquired.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very safe now," Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"That's a relief," Xia Qin let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was unharmed, there was room for resolution.</p><p></p><p>"I met the true master of the two-dimensional world within that 'blank paper,'" Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The true master?" Xia Qin was startled.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

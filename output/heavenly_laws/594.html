        <h1>Chapter 594</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Has the merit been distributed?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>In the war between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain, the King of Chisong was the commander, and the Qingfeng Domain achieved victory. Logically, the greatest merit should belong to the King of Chisong.</p><p></p><p>However, the King of Chisong had transferred all the war merits to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The merits obtained by the war commander can be directly exchanged for precious resource inheritances from the ancient country's treasury, which is extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>This is also the greatest backing for the fierce kings of the Lieyang Ancient Country to win the war.</p><p></p><p>The lofty Celestial Exalted Ones, why do they obey the imperial clan of the ancient country? Isn't it because of the many resource inheritances in the ancient country's treasury?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River, your merit is 120,000." </p><p></p><p>The King of Chisong said, "120,000 merit, that's quite a lot. A normal Celestial Exalted One-level secret treasure weapon is only around 70,000 to 80,000 merit."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the war between the Qingfeng Domain and the Zimen Domain, Lin Yuan gained too much, and the merit was just a part of it.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were also the spoils obtained from the various great exalted ones on the battlefield, as well as the 'ransom' from the ancient Ling Country that would come soon.</p><p></p><p>"The 120,000 merit has been distributed. Brother Silver River, if you want to exchange it, just go to this place." The King of Chisong gave Lin Yuan a location, which was the entrance to the country's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Any contributor to the Lieyang Ancient Country can enter and exchange their rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly expectant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The treasury of the Lieyang Ancient Country contained resource inheritances of all kinds, and most importantly, the vast majority of the resources would never appear in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue chatting with the King of Chisong, his expression changed, and he looked outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" the King of Chisong asked.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has come to visit me." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had just arrived in the capital, without any relations, yet someone had come to visit him so quickly? "Ah, I forgot." The King of Chisong's face broke into a smile: "This manor has been watched by many people. Even if His Majesty didn't announce it publicly, it couldn't be hidden that you have taken over this manor."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the nine-striped battle ship that welcomed Lin Yuan was also very conspicuous, and it must have attracted a lot of attention.</p><p></p><p>"Then would Brother Silver River like to go out and take a look?" </p><p></p><p>The King of Chisong smiled and said, "Those who come to visit you first are basically with good intentions."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and then walked out of the manor together with the King of Chisong.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver River."</p><p>"Brother Silver River."</p><p></p><p>A series of figures immediately approached.</p><p></p><p>"I was just curious about who had His Majesty send the nine-striped battle ship to welcome, and it turns out to be Brother Silver River."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, no wonder."</p><p></p><p>Those who came to visit Lin Yuan were mostly from the imperial clan. At this moment, these imperial clan members were all looking at Lin Yuan with great enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan responded to each of the imperial clan members one by one.</p><p></p><p>Even before arriving in the capital, the King of Chisong had explained the situation in the capital to him.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Lieyang Ancient Country was mainly divided into two forces: the imperial clan and the Celestial Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>Among the imperial clan, there were seventeen major branches, each with an ultimate core imperial clan member stationed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the seventeen major branches, there were some other imperial clan members, but they did not form a scale and could only rely on the seventeen major branch imperial clans.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, with Lin Yuan's strength, he could easily establish the eighteenth branch of the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>"Those who came to visit me are mostly from the imperial clan, but not a single one of those Celestial Exalted Ones has come?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Is it that the Celestial Exalted Ones don't know he has taken over this manor? That's obviously impossible.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that those Celestial Exalted Ones who were crowned as kings don't have a good impression of my appearance." Lin Yuan understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>The important resources of the Lieyang Ancient Country must be tilted towards the core imperial clan. Every additional core imperial clan member is equivalent to a share of the resources being divided, so the Celestial Exalted Ones naturally feel unhappy about it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strength Lin Yuan has displayed has exceeded the normal limit of the core imperial clan members, and he has gone far on the path of breaking the shackles of the Celestial Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>This makes those Celestial Exalted Ones even more wary.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan is not worried, because in the Lieyang Ancient Country, the imperial clan is the absolute ruler, and the Celestial Exalted Ones, no matter how wary they are, dare not make any moves.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the imperial clan members who came to visit, Lin Yuan parted ways with the King of Chisong and headed to the entrance of the country's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Holding 120,000 merit, Lin Yuan was already eager to take a look at the treasures and inheritances stored in the country's treasury.</p><p></p><p>This is also the main purpose of Lin Yuan's visit to the capital, to use the resources here to accelerate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Lieyang Ancient Country was vast, like a spatial maze. Following the map provided by the King of Chisong, Lin Yuan finally arrived in front of a grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the grand hall in front of him, with no one guarding the outside, only two statues standing as sentinels.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the two statues, vaguely sensing some mysterious energy fluctuations from them.</p><p></p><p>"These statue sentinels are at least at the Celestial Exalted One level of strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed, sensing a threat. With his current strength, the only ones who could pose a threat to him were Celestial Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Blood lineage verified, merit verified, permission granted to enter." Just as Lin Yuan was observing the two statue sentinels, a voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can I go in?" Lin Yuan immediately walked towards the front.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the grand hall opened, and Lin Yuan stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>After entering the grand hall, Lin Yuan arrived at an independent space.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, flames converged, forming a vague old man who smiled and said, "Descendant of the Blazing Sun, please choose the heritage you wish to exchange for."</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look."</p><p></p><p>The vague old man waved his hand, and endless flames intertwined, forming various information on precious resource inheritances.</p><p></p><p>"These precious resource inheritances are ranked from high to low according to the required merit." The vague old man smiled.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and immediately started observing from the highest level.</p><p></p><p>The first item on the list was not a resource inheritance, but an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It required ten billion merit to exchange - the opportunity to possess the Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the Ancestor, to comprehend the many mysteries of the Ancestor's realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes widened in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Possess the Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Possess the Blazing Sun Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancestor was a thirteenth-tier time life. To possess such an existence and observe the timelines from the thirteenth-tier perspective, this was something Lin Yuan did not dare to even imagine.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence were the thirteenth-tier time lives? How could they allow these ant-like beings to possess them?</p><p></p><p>Cultivating disciples, for the thirteenth-tier time lives, did not require any cultivation at all. Even if they were interested, they would create some inheritances and toss them out, and whoever could obtain them would cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As for possession?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the thirteenth-tier time lives, even Lin Yuan would not allow other beings to possess him, as in the possessed state, they could feel Lin Yuan's physical body and soul, and many secrets would be difficult to conceal.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Ancestor really..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, able to sense that the Blazing Sun Ancestor had agonized over cultivating his descendants, even offering the opportunity of possession.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know how to increase the chances of passing through the time loop, possessing a time life and experiencing the past and future of the timelines will definitely enhance my understanding of the essence of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The drop of time bloodline left behind by the Demon Jade Pavilion Master had allowed Lin Yuan to gain much insight, let alone possessing a living thirteenth-tier time life?</p><p></p><p>"But ten billion merit?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mouth twitched slightly. Originally, he thought that his twelve million merit was a huge sum, but now compared to ten billion merit, it was almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was Lin Yuan's own efforts that had turned the tide of the war between the Azure Flame Domain and the Purple Dream Domain, and he had even killed the Spiritual God King, a pinnacle core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, Lin Yuan had only gained twelve million merit. </p><p></p><p>Normally, winning a war of such a level, just by withstanding the enemy domain's invasion, the commander's merit would only be around two to three million, or even less.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Crimson Treasure King said that Lin Yuan's twelve million merit was already a lot.</p><p></p><p>Half of Lin Yuan's twelve million merit came from killing the Spiritual God King, a pinnacle core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, I must seize the opportunity to possess the Blazing Sun Ancestor." Lin Yuan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although ten billion merit was extremely distant for the current Lin Yuan, at least there was a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>This was already infinitely better than the Chaotic Void's great saints.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void's peerless great saints had paid countless prices to search for the traces of the thirteenth-tier time lives, and Lin Yuan could directly possess a thirteenth-tier time life?</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and continued looking down.</p><p></p><p>The following precious inheritance resources and opportunities to enter certain mysterious realms were equally invaluable, making Lin Yuan covet them all.</p><p></p><p>For example, the opportunity to cultivate in the source realm of this world? Lin Yuan had once entered the source realm of the Immortal Realm, where the true manifestation of a realm's laws was as simple as eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to cultivate in the source realm of this source world? It must contain the manifestation of so many true body laws.</p><p></p><p>However, this cultivation opportunity, although not requiring ten billion merit, still required ninety million merit, which was still out of Lin Yuan's reach.</p><p></p><p>There were also some mysterious treasure weapons with unimaginable power.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed his mind and continued looking down.</p><p></p><p>"For me, there's no need to exchange for treasure weapons." Lin Yuan thought to himself. He was more inclined to exchange for some inheritance guidance.</p><p></p><p>Because by comprehending the inheritance guidance, he could also apply it to the true body, divine soul, and incarnations in the Chaotic Void, with a higher cost-performance ratio. As for the treasure weapons? To bring them to the Chaotic Void would require paying the price of Dimensional Shattering Source Force.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan currently had a lot of Dimensional Shattering Source Force, having absorbed and accumulated over a million of it during the opportunity of the Cosmic Great Cataclysm, he didn't need to use this precious Dimensional Shattering Source Force on this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, compared to treasure weapons as external power, Lin Yuan was more inclined towards the enhancement of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Relying on treasure weapons to improve strength has many limitations, and once the treasure weapons are lost, they will revert to their original form.</p><p></p><p>"Which one should I exchange for?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly set his sights on the inheritance guidance below one million merit. In fact, many inheritance guidance worth hundreds of millions or even tens of millions of merit were more attractive to Lin Yuan, but he had no choice, as he lacked the merit.</p><p></p><p>"This is the one."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Yuan finally made a decision.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

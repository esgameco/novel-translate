        <h1>Chapter 626</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng planned to leave, as this trip to the Xuanhuang Universe was basically over.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor had just personally intervened, gathering all the precious treasures and rarities from the various regions of the universe, and then gifting them to Lin Yuanzheng.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for Lin Yuanzheng to search for them himself anymore.</p><p></p><p>The majority of valuable items in the entire Xuanhuang Universe were now in Lin Yuanzheng's possession.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly -</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng's expression changed slightly as the space-time in front of him began to distort.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a large number of treasures fell out from the distorted space-time, floating before Lin Yuanzheng.</p><p></p><p>"These treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p></p><p>The fallen treasures and rarities were not many, only over a dozen items, but the aura they emanated caused Lin Yuanzheng's heart to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Life Spirit Stones?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng looked at one of the crystal stones.</p><p></p><p>This crystal stone was only the size of a fist, far inferior to the nearly 3-meter-large Life Spirit Stone he had obtained earlier.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, the moment Lin Yuanzheng saw this crystal stone, he vaguely felt it to be infinitely more precious than the Life Spirit Stone.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a Life Spirit Stone, this is a Life Source Stone!"</p><p></p><p>Many thoughts surfaced in Lin Yuanzheng's mind.</p><p></p><p>Life Spirit Stone.</p><p>Life Source Stone.</p><p></p><p>Though only differing by one character, </p><p>the two were completely different things.</p><p></p><p>If the mysterious realm of the Chaotic Void - the Sea of Life - would periodically drop Life Spirit Stones,</p><p>then the Life Source Stone was the very foundation of the Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the Life Spirit Stone and the Life Source Stone was akin to that of a child and its mother.</p><p>As long as the mother remains, theoretically, countless children can be born.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely why the Life Source Stone had almost never appeared in the Chaotic Void before.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng recognized the identity of this crystal stone based on the abundant information he had received from the master of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>"The Life Source Star of this universe must be a fragment of a Life Source Stone, so with the help of the special rules in the surrounding environment, it was able to nurture Life Spirit Stones, which can be considered a smaller version of the Sea of Life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Treasures as rare as the Life Stones could not be directly nurtured even by Supremely Saintly Beings who could formulate specific rules. They would need to rely on external forces.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, throughout the history of the Chaotic Void, with the birth of countless Supremely Saintly Beings, such precious rarities would not be so scarce that even Chaotic Saints could hardly come by them.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuanzheng had only confirmed that the Xuanhuang Universe was capable of nurturing Life Spirit Stones.</p><p></p><p>And the external force required to nurture Life Spirit Stones was the Life Source Stone.</p><p></p><p>However, in order to form the environment for nurturing Life Spirit Stones, the Life Source Stone must be completely integrated into the universe, forming the special rules of the Sea of Life.</p><p></p><p>In such a case, the Life Source Stone would be fused with the entire universe, inseparable.</p><p></p><p>Even the Mysterious Emperor, the creator of the universe, would be unable to revert that Life Source Star back into a Life Source Stone.</p><p></p><p>Yet, looking at the fist-sized Life Source Stone before him, Lin Yuanzheng felt as if he was gazing upon an infinite number of Life Spirit Stones.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Life Source Stone, the other treasures and rarities that had fallen down were equally astonishing.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Mineral Crystal.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Thunder Core.</p><p>The Myriad Source Soil.</p><p></p><p>Each precious item was no less remarkable than the Life Source Stone, originating from some mysterious realm, or even being the very foundation of that mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called mysterious realms referred to places related to Thirteenth-Tier Lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the long history of the Chaotic Void, while many invincible Supremely Saintly Beings had the power to forcefully enter these mysterious realms, they dared not do much, fearing to attract the attention of the Thirteenth-Tier Time Lifeform behind them.</p><p></p><p>Even though the possibility was minuscule, the invincible Saintly Beings did not dare to take the risk, as they were more aware of the might of the Time Lifeform than other Supremely Saintly Beings.</p><p></p><p>But the Mysterious Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Having broken free from the time loop, the Mysterious Emperor was destined to perish, so he naturally did not care whether the Thirteenth-Tier Time Lifeform would notice him or not.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he dared to directly approach these mysterious realms and demand benefits.</p><p></p><p>The spirits of the mysterious realms, although reluctant, knew that as long as they feared the Mysterious Emperor's reckless warfare, they could only swallow this loss.</p><p></p><p>They did not want to seek help from the Thirteenth-Tier Time Lifeform behind them either.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng looked at the precious treasures before him, naturally understanding that they were gifts from the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuanzheng had been puzzled as to whom the Mysterious Emperor wanted to visit, but he never expected it to be these ancient and enduring mysterious realms.</p><p></p><p>"With these precious treasures, my internal universe should become more complete."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng collected the dozen or so precious items, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although these treasures were not as massive in scale as the mysterious realms of the Chaotic Void, they were essentially the same in nature.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng instinctively felt that they would benefit his internal universe. The ultimate goal of the Thirteenth-Tier inheritance of the "Infinite Void" was to transform his internal universe into a colossal entity comparable to the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Chaotic Void had those mysterious realms, replicating them in his internal universe would certainly not be wrong.</p><p></p><p>Especially the special rules formed by the mysterious realms - they might play a crucial role for his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had no effect,</p><p>the ability to nurture the special environments of the mysterious realms in his internal universe would mean that Lin Yuanzheng could harvest a large number of the Chaotic Void's rare and precious treasures at regular intervals.</p><p></p><p>It would be like a money tree, no, a whole forest of money trees.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuanzheng's thoughts were expanding,</p><p>he felt a slight tremor in his mind, vaguely sensing that the source of a certain evolutionary path he had mastered had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Evolutionary Path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng fell silent. Although this evolutionary path was not the one he had primarily cultivated, he had once practiced it as a secondary path.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and conversed with the Realm Spirit, he had wondered why this evolutionary path had not yet given birth to an ultimate existence? With the many inheritances of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, cultivating a Twelfth-Tier Lifeform should not have been too difficult, even if it took multiple attempts.</p><p></p><p>But after the Mysterious Emperor's assault on the Thirteenth-Tier, this evolutionary path had not produced a Twelfth-Tier cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Later, Lin Yuanzheng realized that perhaps the Mysterious Emperor had not truly perished, so the ultimate end of this evolutionary path still existed, preventing later generations from crossing into the Twelfth-Tier.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Lin Yuanzheng had surmised, the Mysterious Emperor, who had assaulted the Thirteenth-Tier and fallen into the time loop, had not truly died. </p><p></p><p>In fact, throughout history, every Chaotic Realm cultivator who had reached the Thirteenth-Tier had not completely perished, at most becoming trapped in the time loop.</p><p></p><p>But just now,</p><p>Lin Yuanzheng had sensed the suppression of the Xuanhuang Evolutionary Path had completely disappeared, and in the future, this evolutionary path would be able to give birth to an ultimate existence once again.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not based on causality - in fact, with the Mysterious Emperor's strength and realm, he could have long since shielded against causality, and even Lin Yuanzheng would be unable to sense anything.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if I can cross into the Thirteenth-Tier and become a Time Lifeform, I will revive you," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzheng thought, his gaze fixed on the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was silent for a while, thinking to himself: "I'll take the opportunity to revive your shijie (senior martial sister) as well."</p><p></p><p>The method to revive a 13th-stage life form does not rely on external objects. As long as the life existed in the past timeline of the chaotic void, it can be revived.</p><p></p><p>Although the Mysterious Emperor perished due to forcibly breaking free from the time loop, he had once existed, so naturally, he could also be revived.</p><p></p><p>With the might of a 13th-stage temporal life form, reviving a past deceased life is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Mysterious Emperor was ultimately unwilling to break through the time loop and enter the 13th stage by forgetting his shijie was that this kind of forgetting was complete, erasing the emotions as well.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, if the Mysterious Emperor crossed into the 13th stage this way, even if he regained his memories, his shijie would be of no importance to him, and he would not bother to revive her.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward, arriving at the entrance of the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, and immediately crossed into it.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious-Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerable Ones who saw Lin Yuan, although their expressions were awe-filled, were not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Before this, other Chaotic Venerable Ones had also come out from the universe.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerable Ones were concerned about the fates of the two peerless Great Saints, Hunxiao and Yulian, but as for Lin Yuan? Apart from the All-Encompassing Eye, no other life form knew that Lin Yuan had obtained the inheritance left behind by the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>They could not accurately estimate Lin Yuan's gains within the Mysterious-Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the Mysterious Emperor's emergence, he would definitely retrieve all the treasures and rarities within the universe, and Lin Yuan, the invincible powerhouse among the Chaotic Great Saints, would most likely leave empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>As for why Lin Yuan did not die while the Great Saints Hunxiao and Yulian were completely destroyed, the ordinary Chaotic Venerable Ones might have doubts, but the Chaotic Great Saints and the peerless Great Saints knew clearly that Hunxiao and Yulian had driven the Mysterious-Yellow lineage to extinction, and it was only natural for the Mysterious Emperor to strike down these two Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He had not interfered with the Mysterious-Yellow lineage, and this time he entered the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, he was no different from the other Chaotic Venerable Ones, and the Mysterious-Yellow had not attacked the Chaotic Venerable Ones either.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze around, seeing a Chaotic Venerable One approaching him nervously - it was the Divine Wind Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>Before the Mysterious-Yellow Universe had opened, this Chaotic Venerable One wanted to invite Lin Yuan to join forces with other Chaotic Venerable Ones to fight, but was directly rejected by Lin Yuan, leaving him quite displeased, thinking that Lin Yuan lacked vision.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan displayed the strength to match the Chaotic Great Saints like the Black Jade Great Saint and the Dual Source Great Saint outside the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, the Divine Wind Venerable One trembled with unease.</p><p></p><p>He unhesitatingly chose to withdraw from the competition for the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, and even directly distanced himself from the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, afraid that Lin Yuan would settle accounts with him afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Later on, the Divine Wind Venerable One heard about Lin Yuan's divine might within the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, single-handedly suppressing eight Chaotic Great Saints, and even the Dual Source Great Saint, a powerful Great Saint, had to timely submit and bow his head to avoid disaster.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning this news, the Divine Wind Venerable One, who had already fled far away from the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, dared not move at all.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was just a normal Chaotic Great Saint, he might have a chance to save his life by fleeing so far away. But Lin Yuan's strength was almost at the invincible level among the Chaotic Great Saints, suppressing the same-level Great Saints was no difficulty for him, let alone a mere Chaotic Venerable One like himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if he managed to escape, could he really save his life? Realizing this, the Divine Wind Venerable One, although still fearful and uneasy, gritted his teeth and returned to the outskirts of the Mysterious-Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"I did not know that I dared to act in such a way in front of the Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wind Venerable One looked at Lin Yuan and waved his hand, bringing out something he had treasured for many years. "I deserve to die. I hope the Great Saint can forgive me."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wind Venerable One had already prepared to lose this physical body. As long as it could make Lin Yuan's anger subside a little, the loss of a main combat body was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Divine Wind Venerable One, but he had never really cared about this Chaotic Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Divine Wind Venerable One was overjoyed, immediately placing the treasured item he had held for many years on the ground, then respectfully retreated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the treasure in front of him, the treasure of a Chaotic Venerable One. Compared to Lin Yuan's current wealth, it was somewhat insufficient, but even a small mosquito is still meat.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still collected it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In a distorted space-time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there, and a huge eye was looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? Did you gain anything worthwhile this time?"</p><p></p><p>The All-Encompassing Eye looked at Lin Yuan and casually said.</p><p></p><p>It knew that Lin Yuan had already obtained the Mysterious Emperor's inheritance, and this time he entered the Mysterious-Yellow Universe and encountered the Mysterious Emperor breaking free from the time loop prematurely, he must have encountered some fortuitous opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the All-Encompassing Eye had no interest in these fortuitous opportunities. Even if it was an invincible Great Saint dominating an era, in their eyes, it was just that.</p><p></p><p>What the All-Encompassing Eye did not know was that the Mysterious Emperor had left Lin Yuan a 13th-stage weapon.</p><p></p><p>With the power of this weapon, Lin Yuan could even threaten these special existences.</p><p></p><p>"It was alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, not going into too much detail.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>The All-Encompassing Eye nodded. "Then I'll send you back now."</p><p></p><p>This void domain was who knows how far from the Ancient Chaotic Continent. Even with Lin Yuan's strength having improved greatly compared to before, it would still take him dozens or even hundreds of years to return on his own.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Venerable One hesitated, not knowing whether he should pay a visit to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was already aware of Lin Yuan's exploits in the Mysterious-Yellow Universe, suppressing and slaughtering numerous Chaotic Great Saints, so he had the idea to visit Lin Yuan, but was also worried about disturbing him.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Venerable One thought it over and still felt he should go and pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>After all, a Chaotic Great Saint was right on his Chaotic Continent, and if the Ancient Venerable One ignored him, wouldn't that be disrespectful to the Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>Although he had visited Lin Yuan many times before, but now that Lin Yuan had formally revealed his Great Saint strength, the meaning of this visit was different from the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Ancient Venerable One arrived outside the 'Shattered World' of Star Tears.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Xuan Tian and the Mighty Xia Qin immediately came out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Although this Ancient Venerable One had always been very humble towards Lin Yuan, the Mighty Xuan Tian and the others, the human civilization's mighty ones, would not look down on this Chaotic Venerable One because of that.</p><p></p><p>"I wish to seek an audience with the Silver Galaxy Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Venerable One immediately stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Seek an audience with the Silver Galaxy Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Xuan Tian and the Mighty Xia Qin were initially not too concerned, as the Ancient Venerable One often came to visit Lin Yuan, but they soon realized something was off.</p><p></p><p>The title the Ancient Venerable One used for Lin Yuan was what? Silver Galaxy Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>The Mighty Xuan Tian and the Mighty Xia Qin were a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 724</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, it was just a trivial matter anyway.</p><p></p><p>The yin and yang forces converged in the gaps between regions here. Even if the ice mountain and fire mountain were taken away, </p><p></p><p>After a long period of time, new ice and fire mountains would be nurtured again.</p><p></p><p>And between the ice and fire mountains, yin-yang dual flowers would grow again.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>After placing the ice and fire mountains into his inner universe, Lin Yuan turned and hurried back towards the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional gaps were filled with too many variables and uncontrollable factors. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not yet truly entered the 13th level, and even though there was no difference from normal temporal life,</p><p></p><p>He still tried to stay as little as possible.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the yin-yang dual sacred flower being very useful for improving his Chaotic Taiji Dao,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wouldn't have specially sent out his Taiji primordial spirit to come here.</p><p></p><p>As for the many gains and nightmare fruits along the way? They weren't absolutely necessary either.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the several decades spent traveling from the chaotic void to the land of ice and fire mountains,</p><p></p><p>The time to return to the chaotic void was much shorter.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-yang dual flower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the wondrous flower that was already in full bloom at the junction of the ice and fire mountains.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of yin and yang fusing and generating each other permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>"God, great god."</p><p></p><p>On the ice and fire mountains, countless extreme yin and extreme yang lifeforms bowed and worshipped Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In their view, Lin Yuan was an indescribably great being who could take away their home of countless years with just a stretch of his right hand, bringing them along with it.</p><p></p><p>Such an existence could probably annihilate all extreme yang and extreme yin lifeforms with just a breath.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but be in awe.</p><p></p><p>"Continue with your lives."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not make things difficult for these extreme yin and extreme yang lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>He even planned to create a special breeding area for these dimensional lifeforms in his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite looking forward to seeing what kind of life would be born from the combination of extreme yin and extreme yang lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious wondrous flower, your insight into the Chaotic Taiji Dao has greatly improved]</p><p></p><p>Just by briefly observing and contemplating the yin-yang dual flower, Lin Yuan felt countless inspirations arise in his Chaotic Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>The powers of supreme yin and supreme yang swirled around Lin Yuan, sometimes forming a Taiji diagram that could suppress everything, sometimes forming a Taiji sword that could destroy all things, sometimes forming...</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang? Taiji?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone brightly as he rapidly absorbed the insights flooding his mind while continuing to observe the yin-yang dual flower.</p><p></p><p>Even the two ice and fire mountains were within the scope of Lin Yuan's observation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"According to the normal timeline, for me to advance my Chaotic Taiji Dao to the third level before reaching the 13th level, it would take at least tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly, "But now? A few thousand years will be enough."</p><p></p><p>The yin-yang dual flower had an extremely strong guiding effect for Lin Yuan. It was born from the mysterious dimensional gaps, a fruit of the Dao resulting from the fusion and symbiosis of yin and yang.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension ability, the two together were far more than simply one plus one equals two.</p><p></p><p>This was a qualitative change!</p><p></p><p>"The third level of the Chaotic Taiji Dao is the true limit of my path before the 13th level. This is the limit of the path, not the limit of secret techniques and methods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>For example, opening up countless sand particle worlds within his body belonged to secret techniques and methods.</p><p></p><p>It required Lin Yuan to spend time to open them up, but the Chaotic Taiji Dao? This was Lin Yuan's true path.</p><p></p><p>This truly belonged to Lin Yuan, and he could use it at any time even when conducting consciousness transmigration and descent, without any other restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had opened up 33 posterior universes, and some of the elites of the human civilization had already moved to these 33 posterior universes,</p><p></p><p>The Milky Way Chaos Continent was still undisputedly the main base of human civilization. The 33 posterior universes were the foundation of human civilization, ensuring an endless continuation of human civilization's heritage.</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of 12th level evolvers from human civilization gathered together to discuss matters.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh~ A figure descended, it was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The dozens of 12th level evolvers from human civilization felt their hearts race, and immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Except for the nine supreme beings who initially left their home universe with Lin Yuan, the other 12th level evolvers had rarely even seen Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They naturally felt great awe towards this invincible great sage who had swept through the chaotic void unrivaled in the current era.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy." The Xuanyuan supreme being greeted.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to add some rare treasures to exchange in the clan treasury," Lin Yuan said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>After his Taiji primordial spirit returned, Lin Yuan gathered all the odds and ends he couldn't use and planned to package them up to send to the human civilization treasury.</p><p></p><p>As the pillar holding up human civilization, Lin Yuan naturally didn't mind giving back to the clan.</p><p></p><p>When still in their home universe, weren't many of the 12th level rare treasures collected in the human civilization treasury given back by the nine supreme beings?</p><p></p><p>At that time, with the strength of the nine supreme beings, these rare treasures were equivalent to being completely given to the clan's younger generation, the kind given without expecting anything in return.</p><p></p><p>"Add rare treasures to exchange?" </p><p></p><p>The Xiaqin supreme being and Xushen supreme being looked at each other and said in low voices: "Galaxy, your help to the clan is already</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's big enough now, don't delay your own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Opening up the Milky Way Chaos Continent to shelter the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Later, thirty-three post-celestial universes were opened up to forge an indestructible foundation for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of help, Xia Qin and the other eight supreme beings didn't know how to repay. And now he's come to supplement the exchange of treasures?</p><p></p><p>"It's no trouble, these treasures don't mean much to me," Lin Yuan said, glancing at the other respectful 12th-level evolvers. "You can also take a look. If you need anything, just exchange it for merits."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a large number of 'items' fell down.</p><p></p><p>In addition to some normal treasures, there were many 'corpses'.</p><p></p><p>They were all 'corpses' of dimensional gap lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Primordial Spirit had wandered in the dimensional gaps for so long, occasionally taking action against gap lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>These lifeforms were incredibly weak to Lin Yuan, but in the eyes of the many evolvers of human civilization, they were naturally extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>When still in their home universe, human civilization obtained the corpse of a 12th-level lifeform that had drifted in from the universe cracks, which led to a battle among the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>In the end, human civilization obtained a section of the corpse for the civilization's talented evolvers to study.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also gained a lot through that section of the corpse.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of powerful lifeforms contained the paths they had taken.</p><p></p><p>Compared to directly perceiving the rules of the Great Dao, perceiving the physical structure of powerful lifeforms was easier.</p><p></p><p>"These corpses?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, Xuanyuan, and the other seven supreme beings, as well as many other 12th-level evolvers, all felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of corpses that Lin Yuan casually threw out each gave them great pressure.</p><p></p><p>"These corpses are from some dimensional lifeforms. They contain some good paths within them. I specially kept them for the civilization's evolvers to study," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Lifeforms that could survive in the dimensional gaps mostly followed extreme paths, pursuing the ultimate in power.</p><p></p><p>But extremes also have their advantages. In any case, it's up to the civilization's evolvers to choose.</p><p></p><p>"What was the strength of this corpse when it was alive?" Yudie, a supreme being, looked at an octopus-like corpse whose aura seemed illusory, faintly condensing into a miniature world.</p><p></p><p>"Probably a bit stronger than an Invincible Great Saint, considered weak among this group of 'corpses'," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Stronger than an Invincible Great Saint?" Xuanyuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings looked at the remaining thousands of corpses. According to Lin Yuan, that octopus corpse was considered weak among them, so were all these corpses stronger than Invincible Great Saints when alive? Thousands of lifeforms stronger than Invincible Great Saints, all killed and sent over by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings took deep breaths. Although they had watched Lin Yuan grow and were aware of his terrifying growth rate, they still found it incredible to see thousands of corpses stronger than Invincible Great Saints laid out before them.</p><p></p><p>"These..."</p><p></p><p>Although the nine supreme beings were shocked, they were vaguely prepared. For them, any incredible scene involving Lin Yuan could be quickly accepted.</p><p></p><p>However, for the dozens of newly born 12th-level evolvers of human civilization, their minds went blank.</p><p></p><p>Dimensional gap lifeforms stronger than Invincible Great Saints?</p><p></p><p>Since when could Invincible Great Saints appear in groups?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Milky Way Great Saint also an Invincible Great Saint?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, feel free to study these treasure corpses. I've erased the killing intent and chaos within them," Lin Yuan continued to instruct for a few more sentences before his form disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Left behind were the supreme beings and 12th-level evolvers of human civilization, staring blankly at the many treasure corpses.</p><p></p><p>Soon, news of the addition of a batch of dimensional gap treasures to the human civilization's treasury spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>"So many dimensional gap treasures? Many of the dimensional corpses are even stronger than Invincible Great Saints? Corpses of Invincible Great Saints? So many?" Many evolvers of human civilization looked at the treasury exchange list, too shocked to calm down.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that the dimensional gaps were fraught with danger, and even World-class Great Saints wouldn't dare to explore deeply? Where did these dimensional gap treasure corpses come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop guessing. They were bestowed by the great Milky Way Great Saint. It's said that the Milky Way Great Saint explored the dimensional gaps once, casually took these treasures, then selected some to bestow upon us for cultivating the younger generation."</p><p></p><p>Some well-informed evolvers said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was now absolutely the spiritual pillar of human civilization, single-handedly bringing human civilization to the pinnacle of power in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>"What level of strength is the Milky Way Great Saint at now? Has he entered the 13th level? Why do the perilous dimensional gaps seem like nothing to the Milky Way Great Saint? Like his own backyard."</p><p></p><p>"What great fortune does our human civilization have to produce an existence like the Milky Way Great Saint?" Many of the older generation, evolvers who had come out of the home universe, wept with emotion.</p><p></p><p>They clearly remembered the immense pressure they faced from other alien races when they were in the home universe.</p><p></p><p>But since the rise of the Milky Way Great Saint, pressure? The only pressure on human civilization was that the Milky Way Great Saint's growth rate was too fast for them to keep up with.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

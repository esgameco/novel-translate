        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just now, as the universe began its great collapse, large areas of the edge realms started crumbling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately noticed that the speed at which he was accumulating boundary-breaking source power began to skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, after multiple tests by Lin Yuan, </p><p></p><p>The upper limit of the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power had always been locked at the efficiency of accumulating one strand every ninety days.</p><p></p><p>As for increasing it?</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan actively tore apart the cosmic void, creating unprecedented permanent spatial rifts,</p><p></p><p>He still couldn't increase the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>However now,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan clearly felt that the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power was rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Not just increasing.</p><p></p><p>But rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>From the initial one strand every ninety days,</p><p></p><p>To one strand every fifty days.</p><p></p><p>One strand every twenty days.</p><p></p><p>One strand per day.</p><p></p><p>Ten strands per day.</p><p></p><p>A thousand strands per day.</p><p></p><p>As the universe's great collapse continued, more and more star regions disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power seemed to be climbing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>In just a few dozen breaths,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had accumulated several hundred strands of boundary-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>"The universe's great collapse actually helps accumulate boundary-breaking source power this much?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was pleasantly surprised. All along, he hadn't figured out exactly what kind of energy boundary-breaking source power was.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds accumulating it, he wouldn't have been able to detect boundary-breaking source power at all.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan crossed into the twelfth level, more uses of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds had been discovered, among which boundary-breaking source power played an almost omnipotent role.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, as long as there was enough boundary-breaking source power, even Chaos Great Saints and Supreme Great Saints would be suppressed without any power to resist.</p><p></p><p>But killing and suppressing were just the most insignificant aspects of boundary-breaking source power. The most crucial use of boundary-breaking source power was creation and omnipotence.</p><p></p><p>"Over a thousand strands of boundary-breaking source power now."</p><p></p><p>While pondering, Lin Yuan found that the boundary-breaking source power he had accumulated had unknowingly exceeded a thousand strands.</p><p></p><p>A thousand strands of boundary-breaking source power, at the normal accumulation speed, would take two to three hundred years to possibly achieve.</p><p></p><p>But how long had it been now? Not even ten minutes!</p><p></p><p>"This great collapse of the universe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted, realizing that the universe's great collapse wasn't entirely a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>At least at the current efficiency of accumulating boundary-breaking source power, from the start to the end of this universe's great collapse, he would ultimately obtain at least a million strands of boundary-breaking source power to start with.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the universe's complete disintegration?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly. At first, he thought the universe's great collapse was related to permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>Because when located under a permanent spatial rift, the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power would get a certain degree of increase, until it was fixed at an accumulation speed of ninety strands per day.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't until crossing into the twelfth level that he realized this wasn't the case.</p><p></p><p>Being close to a permanent spatial rift could increase the accumulation speed, not because of the permanent spatial rift itself, but because it was closer to the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Until the permanent spatial rift was large enough, and the void aura spilling into the universe reached its peak, equivalent to being in the chaos void, the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power would be one strand every ninety days.</p><p></p><p>For example now, one of Lin Yuan's avatars was in the chaos void. Even without other avatars beside permanent spatial rifts, the accumulation speed of boundary-breaking source power was still one strand every ninety days.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation speed of one strand of boundary-breaking source power every ninety days was the normal accumulation speed when in the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, but couldn't figure it out. The universe's destruction and rebirth was the result of the chaos void's rules operating. Even Supreme Great Saints couldn't fully comprehend it. Thinking about these things had no meaning for him at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Crash!</p><p></p><p>Large areas of space collapsed, turning into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the twelfth-level ultimates immediately began transferring the life essence imprints of their universe's people within them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the universe rapidly collapsed, the origin consciousness fell into unprecedented weakness. Transferring the life imprints of living beings within their universes at this time would result in the lowest backlash.</p><p></p><p>The river of time began to gradually dry up.</p><p></p><p>The many twelfth-level ultimates took action, transferring all life imprints to the river of time within their internal universes.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, varying degrees of backlash struck.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of many twelfth-level ultimates became solemn as they silently endured the backlash from the universe itself.</p><p></p><p>The backlash they endured was like ripples stirring on a water surface with internal undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>Every twelfth-level ultimate knew in their hearts that they hadn't carried more lives into their internal universes than they could bear, so the backlash they faced was within the estimated range.</p><p></p><p>"It's my turn."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged under the starry sky. Seeing the many twelfth-level ultimates enduring the backlash from the universe's origin consciousness, he immediately began transferring the life imprints of all citizens in his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz!</p><p></p><p>If transferring the life essence imprints of beings in their internal worlds by other twelfth-level ultimates was like stirring up slight ripples on a calm water surface,</p><p></p><p>Then when Lin Yuan began transferring the life essence imprints of countless citizens in his internal universe, the water surface didn't just stir up slight ripples, but directly boiled, as if exploding.</p><p></p><p>The universe's origin consciousness, which had fallen into weakness and was about to enter slumber, suddenly jolted awake, incredulously sensing countless life essence imprints constantly disappearing within the universe.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>An unparalleled backlash gathered, enveloping Lin Yuan. Other twelfth-level ultimates felt this backlash and couldn't help but tremble inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If they were facing such backlash, they would probably be obliterated instantly, unable to last even a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Milky Way's supreme powerhouse."</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way's supreme powerhouse has brought all citizens of the human civilization into his internal universe. Transferring so many lives in an instant has triggered an unprecedented backlash from the universe."</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the universe's origin consciousness is angry!"</p><p></p><p>The scalps of the twelfth-level ultimates exploded. The universe's origin consciousness had no specific emotions, but now it was rarely showing signs of anger.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Lin Yuan's actions had completely shattered its bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after the universe's great collapse, countless lives would perish along with the universe, then turn into nutrients, serving as the driving force to start the next cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had transferred away most of the lives, losing so many lives meant that after the universe's great collapse, it would take a much longer time to nurture new life. This loss was enormous.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way..."</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme powerhouses of human civilization also looked towards Lin Yuan at the same time, their expressions slightly worried.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had great confidence in Lin Yuan, when truly feeling the anger from the universe's origin consciousness, they still felt some unease.</p><p></p><p>"Angry?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also sensed the "emotion" of the universe's origin consciousness, but he didn't stop. Instead, he continued transferring the life imprints of countless citizens in his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The backlash descended.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying pressure enveloped and covered him, but in the end, it was as if entering mud, not even touching Lin Yuan's clothes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lifted up.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, many 12th-level alien races were observing Lin Yuan's movements, wanting to see how the Milky Way's strongest being would withstand this wave of backlash.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Has the universe's backlash really descended upon the Milky Way's strongest?"</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like the Milky Way's strongest didn't even move?"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the 12th-level alien ultimates took a deep breath, gaining a deeper understanding of the Milky Way strongest's power.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way's strongest... is too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The two ultimates of the Calamity race exclaimed in awe. As peak Realm Openers, combined with the sensing of their ancestral house, they clearly knew what kind of backlash the Milky Way's strongest was facing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even a Sovereign Realm powerhouse would be severely injured and near death if they endured such backlash, but Lin Yuan seemed as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>One universe after another entered the Great Destruction ahead of schedule, attracting a large number of powerhouses. Outside each universe undergoing the Great Destruction, there was a large group of powerhouses waiting.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for the 12th-level ultimates inside the universe to escape, so they could subdue and plunder them.</p><p></p><p>"Following behind the Great Saint of Shadow Demons and the Great Saint of Nine Phoenixes, I have already plundered eleven universes. The value of the treasures obtained is probably close to 100,000 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>"100,000 chaos stones ah... If I were to earn this normally, who knows how long it would take, one cosmic era? Two cosmic eras? Now just waiting outside the universe, it can be easily obtained. It's too easy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, these 12th-level beings inside the universes lack combat and fighting experience. Plus, with us hiding in the dark, they don't even have the ability to resist."</p><p></p><p>The plunderers waiting outside the universe chatted casually.</p><p></p><p>They occupied different areas outside the universe. Those 12th-level beings who had exhausted themselves escaping from inside the universe would immediately fall into their encirclement and killing net.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the two Great Saints move too fast. Plus, we need to wait for the timing of the universe's Great Destruction. More universes that are undergoing the Great Destruction have probably already been occupied by the powerhouses ahead of us."</p><p></p><p>"Why think so much? At least the nearby few universes are ours."</p><p></p><p>Many plunderers were still unsatisfied. If they could keep following behind the two Great Saints, their gains would probably be immeasurable. However, this was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>How fast were Chaos Great Saints? Even if they were just fighting, Sovereign Realm powerhouses couldn't keep up.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, following behind Chaos Great Saints was also very particular. If one got too close, the result would probably be the same as those universes, engulfed by the aftershocks of the fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Even universes with a scale comparable to Venerable Ones were prematurely destroyed. Sovereign Realm powerhouses basically had no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>And if they were too far, either the universe's Great Destruction would end and the 12th-level powerhouses inside would escape and leave, or it would be occupied by plunderers who were following closer.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the degree had to be grasped well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this applied to Sovereign Realm and Realm Opening plunderers.</p><p></p><p>As for Chaos Venerable Ones? Chaos Venerable Ones didn't dare to approach the battlefield where the two Great Saints were fighting.</p><p></p><p>In the view of Chaos Great Saints, Sovereign Realm powerhouses were too insignificant to care about, but Chaos Venerable Ones? They would definitely be noticed by the Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if the Chaos Great Saints had any malicious intent, the fate of the Chaos Venerable Ones would be unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Venerable Ones were basically beings who had opened up a Chaos Continent, with stable and enormous sources of chaos stones. There was no need to follow behind Great Saints to 'pick up scraps'.</p><p></p><p>The gains from one universe were somewhat insignificant for Chaos Venerable Ones. To risk so much for this, the Venerable Ones weren't fools, they would naturally weigh the gains and losses.</p><p></p><p>Outside Lin Yuan's home universe.</p><p></p><p>A huge black ship quickly sailed over. This ship was about a million miles long, with an unfathomable aura like an abyss. Centered on the ship, a cold domain spread out for tens of millions of light-years in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Even peak Realm Opening powerhouses would find it difficult to move a step under the suppression of this domain.</p><p></p><p>"This universe has also entered the Great Destruction. Let's wait here."</p><p></p><p>A figure stood at the bow of the ship, over ten meters tall, with an indifferent gaze, quietly looking at the distant universe.</p><p></p><p>The figure was named Blood Blessing, a famous peak Sovereign Realm powerhouse who had also joined the ranks of plunderers this time, targeting universes entering the Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice, those 12th-level powerhouses inside the universes were too easy to deal with. There was almost no risk, and stable resources and treasures could be obtained. This was very attractive even for peak Sovereign Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the other side of the home universe, a floating island of the same million-mile scale appeared, tearing through the void.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, so it's Sovereign Blood Blessing!" A figure also stood on the floating island, with a snake head and human body, emanating a terrifying aura, looking at the black ship from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Snake Demon?" Blood Blessing Sovereign frowned. Although Snake Demon Sovereign wasn't at the peak of the Sovereign Realm, he was very close, with bizarre methods. Blood Blessing Sovereign was also unwilling to offend him.</p><p></p><p>The two Sovereign Realm powerhouses looked at each other from afar for a moment. Their target was obviously the distant universe that was falling into the Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Blessing, why don't we split this universe in half? That area belongs to you, this area belongs to me, how about it?" Snake Demon Sovereign spoke.</p><p></p><p>As Sovereign Realm powerhouses, unless absolutely necessary, they wouldn't fight each other, and the benefits of one universe weren't worth fighting to the death for.</p><p></p><p>So they directly discussed in advance, half for each.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign nodded.</p><p></p><p>The so-called half for each meant that after the universe's Great Destruction, the 12th-level beings escaping from inside the universe would belong to whoever's area they entered.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the 12th-level beings inside the universe could escape from any position.</p><p></p><p>So dividing the areas in advance would avoid fighting over them after the 12th-level beings escaped.</p><p></p><p>On the black ship.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign gazed at the distant universe.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>At this time, dozens of figures appeared behind Blood Blessing Sovereign, respectfully saying.</p><p></p><p>"All of you station yourselves in these areas." Blood Blessing Sovereign thought for a moment, arranging tasks for his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>The universe was too vast. Even half the area was difficult to seal off.</p><p></p><p>Even a peak Sovereign like Blood Blessing might not be able to pay attention to all positions at all times, so he needed to arrange for his subordinates to guard, preventing any fish from slipping through the net.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures nodded, disappearing one by one. They were all peak Realm Opening powerhouses, following Blood Blessing Sovereign and working for him.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign would occasionally guide these subordinates, or bestow inheritance secret techniques and so on.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Great Destruction ends quickly."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign thought to himself. He still had to hurry to the next universe entering the Great Destruction.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he never took the 12th-level beings inside the universe seriously.</p><p></p><p>They were nothing but a group of Realm Openers living in a greenhouse. Let alone compared to him, they were far inferior even to those battle-hardened subordinates.</p><p></p><p>In Blood Blessing Sovereign's view, these 12th-level beings inside the universe were all living chaos stones, their greatest use was to become nourishment on his path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Being able to become nourishment for him, Blood Blessing Sovereign, was their honor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

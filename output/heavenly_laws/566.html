        <h1>Chapter 566</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Ninth Profound Venerable was unable to lock down this mysterious space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a while, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious space was deeply fused with the fabric of space-time, not reaching the level of the Demon Jade Space, but still aiming for that.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it required the comprehension of the Nine Realms of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Realms of Space-Time, basically only the Chaotic Great Saints could venture into, and as for the peak of the Nine Realms of Space-Time? Many peerless great saints might not even be able to reach it.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang's most self-satisfied technique was the comprehension of the peak of the Nine Realms of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>"This mysterious space should have been left behind by a Chaotic Great Saint, according to Cang Yu Long's description, it is likely the inheritance site of a great saint."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached this conclusion in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"That Chaotic Tree"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also saw the Chaotic Tree in the depths of the mysterious space, swaying and emanating boundless Chaotic Qi.</p><p></p><p>"This trip was not in vain."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was certain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't have this inheritance space, as long as he got his hands on that Chaotic Tree, what would offending a Venerable-level enemy matter? Venerables rarely slaughtered each other, because there were no treasures worth them fighting over, but the Chaotic Tree? Just look at how the Ninth Profound Venerable imprisoned the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Refining this space will take time, I'll do it after the sparring session."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan locked the space-time coordinates of this inheritance space, so that no matter how the other party moved it, they couldn't hide it from him.</p><p></p><p>"You wait here first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Cang Yu Long.</p><p></p><p>To spar with the Ninth Profound Venerable, he would definitely need to let the two great spiritual beings fuse, forming the Supreme Ultimate Spiritual Being. A single spiritual being would have a hard time defeating the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Although, even if Lin Yuan lost, there wouldn't be any real loss.</p><p></p><p>But losing to the Ninth Profound Venerable would create a series of hidden troubles, such as making the Ninth Profound Venerable feel that Lin Yuan's strength was inferior to his, and then start searching for Lin Yuan's whereabouts after the sparring, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan must try his best to win against the Ninth Profound Venerable in the sparring. Even if he couldn't win, he had to make the Ninth Profound Venerable realize that he was not someone to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>As for leaving Cang Yu Long here? Lin Yuan was not worried that the other party would run away.</p><p></p><p>Now that the mysterious inheritance space was in his hands, the greatest opportunity had been obtained, and Cang Yu Long had no need to escape.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ninth Profound Sect.</p><p></p><p>One gathering point after another began to migrate towards the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>These gathering points were home to a large number of tribal life forms, all relying on the protection of the Ninth Profound Venerable, and of course, each cosmic cycle would offer the Venerable many precious Chaotic Stones.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable's protection, of course, was not free of charge.</p><p></p><p>The many 'fragment worlds' outside the Ancient Bright Chaotic Continent also needed a large amount of Chaotic Stones to be purchased.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Ninth Profound Venerable is going to spar with another Venerable outside the secret realm?" The Ninth Profound Venerable did not deliberately hide this matter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it couldn't be hidden, once the sparring with Lin Yuan was over, the fluctuations of the Venerable-level battle could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Profound Venerable is sparring with another Venerable? Which Venerable is it?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter which Venerable it is, hurry up and enter the secret realm now, otherwise by the time the sparring begins, we'll be outside and won't be able to withstand the aftershocks of the Venerables' fight."</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts outside the secret realm were panicked, even the Sovereign Realm masters were trembling, the clash between Venerables was completely a disaster for them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the treasures can be taken away, but the residences we've built up over the years can't be moved in a short time, I hope we can still leave something behind."</p><p></p><p>"Residences? Just being able to survive is good enough."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and enter the secret realm, if you're late, you won't be able to get in."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the many subordinates of the Ninth Profound Venerable were also helping with the relocation, and actively opening the formations outside the secret realm, otherwise, it would be impossible to move everything in just half an hour.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what kind of grudge the Ninth Profound Venerable has with which Venerable, why do they have to spar?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, no matter what the Venerables' affairs are, we'd better not pry, just in case..."</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts hurriedly relocating discussed this matter cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Outside the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure silently condensed in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's sun and yin had fused into one, forming the Supreme Ultimate Spiritual Being.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable frowned as he looked at Lin Yuan, the current Lin Yuan gave him a slightly different feeling from just now, although he had lost that earth-shattering momentum, the Ninth Profound Venerable's brow was still throbbing, sensing an even greater threat.</p><p></p><p>"Those who can cultivate to the Chaotic Realm are basically not unknown, but I've never heard of you before."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable looked at Lin Yuan and expressed his puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>He even began to ponder the Sovereign Realm peak experts he knew, in case Lin Yuan was a recent Chaotic Realm ascendant, but the number of Sovereign Realm peak experts was not small, and none of them matched Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The growth of a powerful being has a trajectory, especially those who can ascend to the Chaotic Realm, before ascending to the Chaotic Realm, their information would definitely not be completely unknown.</p><p></p><p>What the Ninth Profound Venerable didn't know was that Lin Yuan was currently only at the Dao Splitting Realm, and the traces he had left in the Chaotic Void were pitifully few, after leaving the universe, he had been staying in the Ancient Bright Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Even except for the Ancient Bright Venerable and the All-Seeing Eye, the outside world hardly had any information about Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So even if the Ninth Profound Venerable thought about it, he couldn't know Lin Yuan's true background.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Chaotic Void is so vast, what's one more Venerable?" Lin Yuan replied casually.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable, although he didn't agree with this, didn't think about it further, now what he could do was to try his best to win against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only by winning could he avoid a complete loss, and gain a clue to guide his own path, at least it would be some harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Since I entered the Chaotic Realm, I have cultivated for ten cosmic cycles and created ten killing techniques." The Ninth Profound Venerable's tone was solemn, "If you can block them, I'll admit defeat, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable suddenly unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>With one punch, the terrifying fluctuations instantly penetrated tens of millions, hundreds of millions, and millions of light-years, the space-time was torn apart like mud, and all the power rushed towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Space-Time Grinding Plate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, the space-time from all directions solidified, the infinite space-time power began to continuously grind and disperse the power of the Ninth Profound Venerable's punch, scattering it into the depths of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Such a exquisite use of space-time?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable's expression was solemn, this punch of his also contained the principles of space-time.</p><p></p><p>That Lin Yuan could block it with the principles of space-time meant that in the pure space-time contest, he was stronger.</p><p></p><p>"So what if your comprehension of the space-time principles is stronger?" </p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable didn't care, he was competing with Lin Yuan in sparring, not in escaping and preserving life, even if his comprehension of the space-time principles was stronger, he couldn't win against him.</p><p></p><p>"A Venerable skilled in offensive?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also looked at the Ninth Profound Venerable, that punch just now contained terrifying power, if it wasn't for Lin Yuan's current appearance being the strongest Supreme Ultimate Spiritual Being, a single Sun Spiritual Being or Yin Spiritual Being might have suffered some injury from that punch.</p><p></p><p>"Three Profound Heavenly Destruction."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable's aura began to surge, three completely different auras appeared in his body and began to converge towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not continue to resist, but stepped out, and the surrounding void began to become vast and boundless, replaced by a brand new power.</p><p></p><p>The 13th Tier Inheritance "Infinite Void" is a foundational inheritance, focusing on building an unparalleled foundation, to crush with absolute superiority, but over the years, Lin Yuan has also created some killing techniques based on the universe within him, and the Infinite Void is one of them.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The two completely different forces began to collide and intertwine, and the aura fluctuations spread to the endless distance.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Sect's defensive formation was frantically operating, trying to block the incoming aftershocks as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The clash between the two Venerable-level existences was so grand that it soon caught the attention of other Venerables in the Myriad Phenomenon Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? There are Venerables fighting?"</p><p></p><p>"That location, is it the Ninth Profound?"</p><p></p><p>"Which Venerable is the one fighting with the Ninth Profound?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't recognize him, never seen such an aura before."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerables looked on from afar, they had no intention of intervening, but instead began to chat.</p><p></p><p>"When the Ninth Profound was in the Sovereign Realm, he was already skilled in killing, and now that he has entered the Chaotic Realm, he is still the same."</p><p></p><p>"That unfamiliar Venerable is actually fighting the Ninth Profound on equal terms, he must have an extraordinary background."</p><p></p><p>"Those who become Venerables, which one is simple?"</p><p></p><p>"Right, we'll just watch."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerables observed the battle, among Chaotic Venerables, unless it was absolutely necessary, they wouldn't fight each other. </p><p></p><p>But the Chaotic Venerables did quite enjoy watching other Chaotic Venerables fight and kill each other.</p><p></p><p>After all, it didn't affect them at all, and they weren't the ones making enemies.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't like to watch some excitement?</p><p></p><p>The solidified void-like substance continued to spread, based on the "Infinite Void" inheritance, the Infinite Void killing technique created by Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The control over the void, although it has not reached the level of the divine ability 'World', </p><p></p><p>is still about two-thirds the strength of the divine ability 'World'. </p><p></p><p>The latter, however, has a limited duration and can only be maintained for a few seconds, while the Boundless Void has no such restriction, and Lin Yuan can maintain it for as long as he wishes.</p><p></p><p>"Such a terrifying void suppression." The Ninth Profound Venerable also felt troubled.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of the Boundless Void, his every move was greatly weakened, as if he was a trapped insect in a spider's web, extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"But it's useless against me."</p><p></p><p>"The Six Profundities subdue all things."</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Ninth Profound Venerable's face became more ferocious, and six brand-new forces instantly enveloped his body, sweeping in all directions. In order to defeat Lin Yuan and avoid a loss, the Ninth Profound Venerable had almost used up most of his lethal techniques.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The invisible Six Profundities forces began to shatter the void, and the Boundless Void operated by Lin Yuan also started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the Six Profundities forces unleashed by the Ninth Profound Venerable, although they had not yet shaken the Boundless Void, it was inevitable that they would continue to do so.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Void would have difficulty suppressing the powerful Six Profundities forces exerted by the Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Fighting the Venerable with just the Taiji Primal Spirit is a bit too much." Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, Lin Yuan is currently only at the Rift Dao Realm, forcibly crossing two major realms to fight the Venerable? Even as the direct descendant of a Thirteenth Realm being, he could not possibly achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had relied on many fortuitous encounters and foundations to raise himself to this level.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll just use my trump card."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had made up his mind. So far, with the battle prowess displayed by the Ninth Profound Venerable, ordinary means would be difficult to deal with him, let alone defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes closed slightly, then opened.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The four directions of the void changed.</p><p></p><p>An extremely stable and vast aura permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>Within the range, time and space were all affected, and Lin Yuan was the sole creator of this void.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within a range of tens of millions of light-years, everything was under the enclosure of Lin Yuan's cosmic domain.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable felt an unprecedented suppression, and the originally unstoppable Six Profundities forces were now completely suppressed and rapidly contracting.</p><p></p><p>"Subjugation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down indifferently at the Ninth Profound Venerable and began to mobilize the power of the external cosmos to crush him.</p><p></p><p>Although the power of the external cosmos was terrifying, the duration was limited, so Lin Yuan did not hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable suddenly felt excruciating pain in his body and soul, as the terrifying suppression descended upon him. His physical body began to crumble inch by inch, and his soul also started to dissipate. Under this crushing suppression, all of the Ninth Profound Venerable's resistance was futile.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying suppression kept descending, and the originally mighty Ninth Profound Venerable had his arms crushed and distorted, his severed limbs flying away, and his flesh and skin riddled with large holes, with a tendency for his internal cosmos to collapse.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable kept retreating, his expression filled with horror, and he unhesitatingly activated his strongest life-saving technique.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Profound Spiritual Armor."</p><p></p><p>Nine brand-new forces collided and formed a barrier outside the Ninth Profound Venerable, resisting the terrifying suppression descending from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan controlled the power of the external cosmos to constantly suppress the Ninth Profound Venerable, but the latter's barrier formed by the nine forces was still stubbornly resisting, although it was being distorted and deformed.</p><p></p><p>"Troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned. This Ninth Profound Venerable was indeed difficult to deal with. Although he was just a newly promoted Venerable, his life-saving trump cards were no weaker than those of some powerful Venerables.</p><p></p><p>After all, within the range of tens of millions of light-years, everything belonged to Lin Yuan's internal cosmos, and his killing power in this range would make ordinary Venerables shudder.</p><p></p><p>"Only one second left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that the maintenance time of the external cosmos was about to end.</p><p></p><p>"Explode!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan unhesitatingly detonated the external cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Since the time was up, the external cosmos would dissipate anyway, so it was better to detonate it to unleash the maximum power.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The void in all directions began to collapse, and the annihilation forces born from it all converged towards the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was greatly alarmed. Originally, he had relied on the Nine Profound Spiritual Armor, a powerful life-saving technique, to resist with great difficulty, but now the pressure he was facing had increased exponentially, and his fear was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void Domain, various Chaotic Venerables were still paying attention.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Ninth Profound Venerable and that mysterious Venerable have really ignited the true fire."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what exactly happened to make the two Venerables fight so fiercely."</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious Venerable's void-shattering strike has very high killing power."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it seems to have forced the Ninth Profound Venerable to continue using his trump cards."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerables discussed with each other and commented a few words.</p><p></p><p>Being able to witness the lethal techniques of two Chaotic Venerables was a rare opportunity, let alone one of them was a Venerable they had never heard of before? Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The void was shattered, and the chaos was torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of tens of millions of light-years, everything was rapidly disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>Even the distant Nine Profound Secret Realm had been damaged by half, and if it were not for the strongest defensive formation at its core, it might have been erased directly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood silently in the void, his aura showing a certain degree of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Directly detonating the external cosmos was also a kind of consumption for him, but the problem was not too serious. A brief rest would allow him to recover.</p><p></p><p>Hum! At this moment, in the collapsing void, a aura condensed and quickly regained its state.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha haha haha."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was in an extremely disheveled state, but his aura had not weakened much, and he laughed wildly.</p><p></p><p>"Was that your strongest trump card? You can't use it a second time in a short time, and you'll also be weakened?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable could see Lin Yuan's state at a glance. To withstand Lin Yuan's detonation of the external cosmos, he had not hesitated to activate his life-saving treasure.</p><p></p><p>It was a life-saving treasure, not a technique.</p><p></p><p>Techniques can be used repeatedly, but life-saving treasures are one-time use.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable had already paid a price to defeat Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's my turn."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable naturally extended his hand, covering the sky with a palm, and grabbed towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to give Lin Yuan any chance to recover and planned to keep attacking until the other admitted defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Still a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, watching the Ninth Profound Venerable's approaching palm.</p><p></p><p>In the distant space.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long was also paying attention to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with his strength, he could only vaguely sense the fluctuations of the battle, and as for the details of the confrontation, he could not see them.</p><p></p><p>However, in the depths of Cang Yu Long's sea of consciousness, the youthful consciousness could still be explored, continuously providing Cang Yu Long with a 'commentary' on the ongoing battle.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, the Ninth Profound Venerable actually managed to hold on? Your senior is going to lose."</p><p></p><p>A youthful voice came from the depths of Cang Yu Long's sea of consciousness, with a slightly regretful tone.</p><p></p><p>"My senior is going to lose?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long was a bit stunned, even though he had long anticipated this possibility, he still felt a sense of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Losing is normal, after all..."</p><p></p><p>The youthful voice was about to continue comforting Cang Yu Long, but the next moment, as if it had sensed something, it dared not utter another word.</p><p></p><p>"After all what?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long was a bit puzzled and actively called out a few times, wanting to hear the youthful voice continue.</p><p></p><p>But the youthful voice was as silent as the dead, not daring to speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long finally realized that something was wrong, and he instinctively looked around.</p><p></p><p>However, this one look.</p><p></p><p>Made Cang Yu Long's eyes widen.</p><p></p><p>He saw a figure standing next to him.</p><p></p><p>The figure was a young man, with some resemblance to the senior Cang Yu Long had seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you're not..."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long was a bit dazed. The senior was not just fighting the Ninth Profound Venerable, how could he appear here? At this moment, Cang Yu Long vaguely sensed that the senior in front of him was somewhat different from the one he had just seen, such as his physical body being much more substantial, and just standing there seemed to be able to collapse the time and space.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long opened his mouth, but before he could say anything.</p><p></p><p>He saw Lin Yuan raise his right arm, spread his five fingers, and then lightly tear towards the direction of the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Five extremely deep and concentrated cracks flashed and disappeared from Cang Yu Long's vision.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, Cang Yu Long saw those five deep cracks, and his heart was filled with unparalleled fear.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was about to suppress Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ninth Profound Venerable's pupils contracted as he saw the tear that split the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

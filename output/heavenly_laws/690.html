        <h1>Chapter 690</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds did not know if Lin Yuan was still within the Azure Clouds Monastery.</p><p></p><p>But to pay respects to this senior, there was no other place to go besides the Azure Clouds Monastery.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's strength, even if he was not currently in the Azure Clouds Monastery, he would definitely know everything happening here, and would not be unaware of their coming to pay respects.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Patriarch of the Holy Sect respectfully expressed his intention to pay respects, and then stood quietly in his original spot.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was willing to see them, he would naturally be able to meet him.</p><p></p><p>If he was unwilling, the Patriarch would not dare to insist.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly sounded in the ears of the Patriarch and the four hundred and fifty-six elders.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Patriarch's heart was set.</p><p></p><p>Through this response, he was certain that Lin Yuan not only had no ill intentions towards the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds, but should even have goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have accepted their request to pay respects.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Patriarch and many elders entered the depths of the Azure Clouds Monastery.</p><p></p><p>"This place?"</p><p></p><p>As they went deeper, the Patriarch's expression changed slightly. At this moment, he could no longer sense the existence of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch, he could control the Azure Clouds Mountain at any time, but now he could not perceive the Azure Clouds Mountain at all, as if this place was completely isolated from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"The senior's mastery of space-time."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's heart trembled. To carve out such an independent space-time within the Azure Clouds Mountain? This method was no less than building one's own nest right under the nose of a tiger.</p><p></p><p>As the Patriarch of the Holy Sect, he could command the entire Holy Sect with a single thought, yet he had not discovered this for so many years.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan really had any murderous intent towards the Holy Sect, the Patriarch probably couldn't even resist, let alone react in time.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch and the many elders did not walk for long before arriving in a spacious area.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the center was a figure - Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch immediately bowed, and the hundreds of elders behind him also bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan nodded and casually asked, "What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, not long ago I used the Holy Sect's inheritance symbol divination technique and saw that giant demon."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch spoke truthfully, not hiding the fact that he had peeked at Lin Yuan's actions.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at the end of the symbolic weaving scene, the Patriarch had also realized that Lin Yuan had already discovered their prying.</p><p></p><p>At this point, to hide it would be nothing but self-conceit.</p><p></p><p>"This time we have come to thank the senior for protecting our Holy Sect for so many years," the Patriarch said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For a thousand years, he had been constantly clearing the demonic spirits and great demons in the vicinity, greatly reducing the casualties of the Holy Sect disciples going out to exterminate them. This could be considered a form of protection.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's temperament, if the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds truly encountered a life-and-death crisis, he would not turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, unless a group of source demons besieged them, the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds would probably be as stable as Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>So this "no need" was something Lin Yuan was fully qualified to say.</p><p></p><p>"That symbol divination secret technique..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked with great interest. He was quite interested in this kind of symbolic application technique, feeling that it had a profound origin, unlike something that came from the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds.</p><p></p><p>The founder of the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds was only a Transcendent Immortal Realm expert, about equivalent to a Chaos Great Saint. How could they have developed a secret technique that could almost escape his observation?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that symbol divination secret technique comes from the Eternal Sect in the center of the heavens and earth," the Patriarch immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Sect?" Lin Yuan looked at the Patriarch of the Holy Sect.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he had gathered, the Eternal Sect was a force with a Thirteen Realms Time Life Sovereign stationed there.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the great changes in heaven and earth, the source of the endless demonic qi emerged within the Eternal Sect's domain. Now, countless "demons" were rampaging in the heavens and earth, but the most powerful source demons were mainly concentrated in the center of the heavens and earth, being held back by the Eternal Sect's forces.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Patriarch nodded and said, "At the beginning of the great changes in heaven and earth, the Eternal Sect would often send envoys to visit our sects, providing some support. That secret technique was given by the Eternal Sect, specifically used to investigate the great demons and those above."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that it's been a long time since the last time an envoy came." The Patriarch sighed, guessing that the Eternal Sect was also under a lot of pressure now and could no longer take care of their sect.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he almost couldn't detect that secret divination technique, it was from the Eternal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Can you give me those secret techniques?" Lin Yuan directly asked.</p><p></p><p>These secret techniques from the Eternal Sect were not kept in the Azure Clouds Monastery, and Lin Yuan had no way of knowing about them.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The Patriarch took out a jade slip containing all the secret techniques from the Eternal Sect.</p><p></p><p>For the Holy Sect of the Azure Clouds, no matter how many secret techniques they had, they were far inferior to Lin Yuan's protection.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan begin to examine the contents of the jade slip, the Patriarch and the many elders tactfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful," Lin Yuan muttered as he went through the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes slightly brightened as he browsed through the secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>The application of these secret techniques in the Rune Dao had reached an unimaginable level. Even Lin Yuan, upon seeing them for the first time, was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Realm, these secret techniques must have all come from the hands of the Thirteenth Realm experts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was certain about this. He vaguely sensed the perspective of time and life from the Thirteenth Realm in these secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Only the powerful experts of the Thirteenth Realm, who could observe the countless timelines, could create such perfect secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his head and looked at the center of the heavens and earth, then continued to ponder.</p><p></p><p>After spending half a day, Lin Yuan had basically comprehended the dozens of rune secret techniques recorded in the jade slips.</p><p></p><p>These secret techniques covered various aspects, which was enough to see that as the great changes in the heavens and earth had just begun, the Eternal Sect was indeed trying to help many sects and forces get through the difficult times.</p><p></p><p>"The heritage of the Rune Dao is truly profound."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was deeply moved. He originally thought that his comprehension of the Rune Dao, if not reaching the level of complete enlightenment, had at least covered a large part of it. But now, seeing these dozens of secret techniques from the Eternal Sect, Lin Yuan realized that he was still far from fully comprehending the Rune Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The two Primordial Spirits have explored very far regions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep and tranquil. Ever since he discovered that the number of 'Demons' in the nearby area was not enough, Lin Yuan had sent out the two Primordial Spirits to explore further regions, with two purposes: one was to hunt down more 'Demons', and the other was to find forces similar to the Holy Sect of the Azure Cloud, and then obtain the corresponding rune inheritance.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the terrifying Giant Demon had appeared, causing Lin Yuan to directly mobilize his true body.</p><p></p><p>With the two Primordial Spirits not by his side, there was no need to re-condense them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue to open up the Particle Worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts. Now that he had just refined the terrifying Giant Demon that was close to the Source Demon, his resources were abundant.</p><p></p><p>Each time a Particle World was opened, Lin Yuan's strength would increase by a notch.</p><p></p><p>In a place far away from the Azure Cloud Sacred Mountain, Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit sat in a cross-legged position, and numerous incarnations spread out in all directions to explore.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the incarnations was far inferior to the true body, mainly serving as pathfinders. If they could handle the situation, the incarnations would deal with it; if they couldn't, then the Yin Primordial Spirit would step in.</p><p></p><p>Using the incarnations to conduct a comprehensive exploration was the most efficient method Lin Yuan could think of at the moment. Even if they encountered any danger, he could simply disperse the incarnations.</p><p></p><p>"According to the ancient records collected by the Azure Cloud Academy, before the great changes in the heavens and earth, the forces in this Source World were divided into five levels," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"The first level was naturally the Eternal Sect, with a Thirteenth Realm time life entity as its pillar, eternal and indestructible."</p><p></p><p>"The second level of forces was the Unsurpassed Holy Sect, with an Untamed Third Realm expert as its leader, a Unrivaled Great Saint, the strongest Heavenly Venerable level expert."</p><p></p><p>"The third level was the ordinary Holy Sects like the Azure Cloud Holy Sect, whose founders had reached the Untamed Third Realm. In fact, the Azure Cloud Holy Sect had only just barely entered this level."</p><p></p><p>"The fourth and fifth levels were forces established by Longevity Sixth Realm experts, and there were quite a few of them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. In this Source World, due to the prevalence of the Rune Dao, there were many Longevity Sixth Realm experts, and only those who had crossed into the Untamed Third Realm could be considered to have ascended.</p><p></p><p>"But after exploring for so long, I haven't found any traces of the second-level Unsurpassed Holy Sect forces, let alone the third-level Holy Sect-level forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. The forces he wanted to find were those that had been attacked and destroyed by the 'Demons'. As for the forces that could still maintain their inheritance, they were mostly hidden very deeply, making them extremely difficult to discover.</p><p></p><p>The sects and forces that had been attacked and destroyed by the 'Demons' would certainly not have any cultivators left, but many inheritances, especially the inheritances of the Rune Dao, would most likely still have remnants.</p><p></p><p>Those 'Demons' had no interest in inheritances, they only craved to devour living beings.</p><p></p><p>When a sect or force was attacked and destroyed, the sect master would often leave a glimmer of hope for the inheritance of the sect, at least allowing future cultivators who approached to discover their own inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, in addition to hunting down the 'Demons', Lin Yuan's two Primordial Spirits had been searching for the remnants of these forces attacked by the 'Demons', in order to obtain the remaining Rune Dao inheritances.</p><p></p><p>However, so far, the force remnants Lin Yuan had discovered were all of the fourth or fifth level sects. Even if there were any remnants of Rune Dao inheritances, they were not of much help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan yearned to find the remnants of higher-level sects, at least at the Holy Sect level.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, after the great changes, the major sects and forces, in order to avoid the 'Demon' disaster, have all controlled the relocation of their sect headquarters, making the pre-change maps useless. Only the Eternal Sect has the means to investigate the specific locations of some sects and forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Azure Cloud Holy Sect's headquarters, the Azure Cloud Sacred Mountain, was a Untamed Third Realm-level weapon. If necessary, it could even take the entire sect's disciples and leave.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not in a hurry, constantly monitoring the exploration progress of his various incarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly. One of his incarnations had discovered a sect remnant site.</p><p></p><p>This remnant site had extremely chaotic space-time. Although it had been completely destroyed by the 'Demons', over the course of countless years, the various formations in the remnant site had slowly begun to recover.</p><p></p><p>"This remnant site is not ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan narrowed his eyes and carefully observed the distant remnant site.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 326: Six Hundred Long Years (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>For the Martial Realm, Lin Yuan did not treat it as a simple cultivation place. üêªüí•ÔºñÔºôùì¢ƒß·µòÔΩò.ùïî·óù‚ìÇüêú‚úå</p><p></p><p>It was also the world where martial cultivators would reside in the future, after establishing the Divine Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivators here referred to those who, through the Martial Dao cultivation methods, stepped into the Eighth Level True God realm.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Realm, compared to the martial cultivators, was similar to the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss compared to the gods.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this world's suppression on lifespan is too harsh. Wanting to normally comprehend the essence of external laws and then break through to the Seventh Level within a thousand years is more difficult than ascending to the heavens," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao's evolutionary path, after Lin Yuan's localization, strengthened the excavation of one's own bloodline. </p><p></p><p>This way, one could indeed make rapid progress in the early stages.</p><p></p><p>But neglecting the comprehension of external laws made it very difficult to open up an inner world by relying on oneself.</p><p></p><p>Did the gods establish the Divine Kingdom because they were unwilling to incorporate the Divine Kingdom into their bodies?</p><p></p><p>It was because they couldn't. The Divine Kingdom condensed by the power of faith could not be absolutely controlled like the inner worlds of Eighth Level evolutionary experts of the main world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even with the world laws suppressing to this extent, Lin Yuan still left behind a way in the Martial Dao cultivation method to comprehend the external laws and then open up an inner world without relying on faith.</p><p></p><p>Even if this method would never be usable for the future martial cultivators of this world, Lin Yuan still left it behind.</p><p></p><p>"However, the advantages of the bloodline cultivation path are also very obvious. That is, by borrowing the power of the bloodline, there are almost no bottlenecks in the early stages of cultivation," Lin Yuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Every time he traversed a world, Lin Yuan would try his best to absorb the essence of this world's cultivation system, and then try to integrate it into his own Martial Dao evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Also, the structure of the gods' Divine Kingdoms in this world is more stable than the inner worlds of normal Eighth and Ninth Level experts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, and countless Divine Kingdoms of gods were quickly analyzed in the inner worlds of his two grand primordial spirits, especially the Divine Kingdoms of the main gods, whose complexity surpassed that of many Ninth Level Myriad Realms experts.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was not an exception and had opened up an inner world of 120 million layers, forming an overwhelming advantage over Ninth Level main gods.</p><p></p><p>If it was only the Myriad Realms, it would probably be very difficult to deal with those main gods.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could win, he would not be able to completely kill them. As long as the main gods hid in their Divine Kingdoms, it would be very likely that the Myriad Realms alone could not do anything to them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could naturally deal with the main gods by cutting off the faith of the mortal world, but the effect would be too slow.</p><p></p><p>The main gods had harvested the faith of the mortal world for who knows how many years, accumulating enough faith power to allow them to struggle on for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>"The structure of the Divine Kingdoms..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the details of the Divine Kingdoms of the twenty-four main gods.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing a large number of special world structures, your comprehension of the world itself continues to improve.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing a large number of special world structures, your comprehension of the world itself continues to improve.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing a large number of special world structures, your comprehension of the world itself continues to improve.]</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a large amount of insight surged in his mind, and Lin Yuan also subconsciously adjusted the subtle structure of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in high spirits. He had been hesitating all along, not systematically perfecting the Ninth Level Chapter of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Because the Ninth Level path of the Martial Dao that Lin Yuan walked was completely unreplicable. Could those Martial Dao evolutionary experts of the main world comprehend the Divine Sparks? And realize the essence of the laws contained within the Divine Sparks?</p><p></p><p>Without Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension, even if the Divine Sparks were truly placed in front of them, they would still not gain much.</p><p></p><p>The gods of this world had possessed the Divine Sparks for an incomparably long time, yet they had not directly comprehended the corresponding laws like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Divine Sparks were a special product of this world. The main world did not have the concept of Divine Sparks, so the Martial Dao evolutionary experts simply could not follow the path that Lin Yuan walked.</p><p></p><p>In that case, if it could not be popularized and adapted, even if Lin Yuan forcibly created the Ninth Level Chapter of the Martial Dao, there would be no outstanding aspects to it.</p><p></p><p>But now, through comprehending the numerous Divine Kingdoms of the gods and main gods, Lin Yuan keenly grasped the key to creating the Ninth Level Chapter of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the Eighth Level, Ninth Level, or even Tenth and Eleventh Levels, the inner world was the foundation and the source of one's own power.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the inner world, after countless evolutionary scholars of the main world's human civilization continuously perfected it, had already reached an extreme limit.</p><p></p><p>It was very difficult to improve even a little on things like the racial shackles of a myriad li square.</p><p></p><p>But the Divine Kingdoms of the gods in this world allowed Lin Yuan to see a completely different direction from the inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, Lin Yuan, relying on his heaven-defying comprehension, realized part of the concepts of the Divine Kingdoms and then integrated them into the Ninth Level Chapter of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"If it goes smoothly, the inner worlds of the future Ninth Level Martial Dao evolutionary experts will be more stable and perfect than the inner worlds of Ninth Level experts of the same level, making it easier for them to transform into inner universes in the future."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit was invigorated.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, this was equivalent to future Ninth Level Martial Dao evolutionary experts each possessing a World Tree.</p><p></p><p>The World Tree, as an Eleventh Star top-grade cosmic treasure, had the effect of stabilizing the inner world. After Lin Yuan perfected the Ninth Level Chapter of the Martial Dao, the stability of the inner world would not be much inferior to the World Tree.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that this kind of stability originated from the inner world itself and was not reliant on external forces, so it could make the final transformation of the inner world a bit easier.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the World Tree not only had the effect of stabilizing the inner world, but even so, compared to other experts of the same level, the Ninth Level Martial Dao evolutionary experts possessed an innate advantage.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to those special lifeforms compared to normal experts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it. With the same attack, your inner world was on the verge of collapse, teetering on the brink.</p><p></p><p>But the inner world of a Ninth Level Martial Dao evolutionary expert merely shook for a moment before returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Sparks, world structure, and the bloodline evolutionary path are the three biggest gains from my traversal this time."</p><p></p><p>The importance of the first two went without saying. As for the bloodline evolutionary path, although it had major drawbacks, it also depended on the specific situation.</p><p></p><p>A large portion of the countless citizens in the main world had too low comprehension and were very sluggish to the fluctuations of external laws, making them very suitable for the bloodline evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite was having a bloodline of sufficient strength within the body.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, it was still a path, much better than being unable to become an evolutionary expert for one's entire life.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the bloodline evolutionary path can also be integrated into the Martial Dao? Similar to how the body cultivation sect was previously integrated into the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline evolutionary path was not a specific evolutionary path. It was more like a method or means to use the power of one's own bloodline to increase strength.</p><p></p><p>There were many bloodline evolutionary families in the main world, but their understanding of blood-</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The excavation of the bloodline is necessary for the perfection of this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the human civilization of the main world, the evolutionary path of bloodline is only a minority evolutionary path. Its upper limit is easily locked, and to become a true powerhouse, one still has to rely on the path of comprehending the rules.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"There is still more than half of the time left to stay, plenty of time remaining."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged as he lowered his head to look down.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ridge, arrived.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longshan Palace.</p><p></p><p>The many clansmen of the Longshan family were still waiting patiently.</p><p></p><p>They could feel that the great Longshan Patriarch Longshan Yuan was still not dead, but alive and well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared silently in front of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, you're back?"</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ling and several confidants under him were the first to react, hurriedly paying their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the many excited Longshan family clansmen.</p><p></p><p>"I did it." Lin Yuan answered directly. At this point, there was no need to conceal it. He was now invincible in the world, so why hide a low profile?</p><p></p><p>"It's true." Hearing Lin Yuan's personal confirmation, Longshan Ling and the others from the Longshan family were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had long speculated this possibility, when it was truly confirmed, they still felt it was unbelievable. </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch is so powerful?</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing." Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, and a figure was teleported out.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the Pope of the Order Church.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was the divine spirit of this Pope located in the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's slaughter of the gods this time, this subordinate god was the only one who survived.</p><p></p><p>As for the reason, naturally it was because Lin Yuan had gotten along well with him over the years.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this Pope of Order only had the strength of a lower god. With the death of the Order Main God, as a subordinate god, his strength plummeted and could barely reach the threshold of a true god.</p><p></p><p>And as a subordinate god, his strength was permanently fixed and would not have any further improvement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it weren't for Lin Yuan's intentional rescue, the moment the Order Main God died, the Pope of Order should have been counter-attacked to death.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Longshan." The Pope of Order looked at Lin Yuan with a complex gaze.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the complete picture of Lin Yuan slaughtering the gods in the Ocean of Light. At this moment, there was no fear in the Pope of Order's heart.</p><p></p><p>Because being more fearful was meaningless. If Lin Yuan wanted to kill him, the Pope of Order had no hope of surviving at all.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave now." Lin Yuan had no intention of killing the Pope of Order.</p><p></p><p>A mere subordinate god, his godhood held no attraction to Lin Yuan and would not pose any threat to the Longshan family in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Patriarch Longshan for sparing my life." The Pope of Order took a deep breath, feeling inexplicably emotional.</p><p></p><p>Under the twilight of the gods, with the gods perishing, even the so-called strongest main gods had all died. Who would have thought that he, as the weakest subordinate god, would survive?</p><p></p><p>The strongest died.</p><p></p><p>The weakest still lived.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order's thoughts were complex.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Longshan." The Pope of Order silently chanted in his heart, knowing that his survival was entirely due to Patriarch Longshan's merciful compassion.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, it will be the era of Patriarch Longshan." A thought suddenly arose in the Pope of Order's mind as he left Longshan Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Even the mighty Light Main God and Dark Main God did not dare to put their divine names as a prefix to an era.</p><p></p><p>But from now on, Patriarch Longshan's name would completely surpass the era. Even after millions, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions of years, future living beings and gods would all fear the prestige of Patriarch Longshan.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longshan Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards Longshan Ling and the others.</p><p></p><p>"I will be leaving the human world next." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving the human world?" Longshan Ling and the other important members of the Longshan family looked at each other. Now standing in front of Lin Yuan, they all felt a certain pressure from the essence of life.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, where do you plan to go? The Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss?" Longshan Ling asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"I will go to the Martial Realm." Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Realm?" The many clansmen of the Longshan family looked puzzled. This was the first time they had heard of this place.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Martial Realm?" Longshan Ling asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Over there." Lin Yuan raised his right hand and made a slash. Space was torn apart and a complete layer of space emerged.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan strode into it. Under the shocked gazes of Longshan Ling and many other Longshan family clansmen, he began to calm the spatial turbulence.</p><p></p><p>Where Lin Yuan stood, everything stabilized. Energy became gentle, space became stable, and a thick earth and sky appeared.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>A world far surpassing the Ocean of Light and Dark Abyss was opened up. Its influence was so great that it even began to appear as a reflection in the human world.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone is opening up a new world, just like when the Light Main God and Dark Main God opened up the Ocean of Light and Dark Abyss back then."</p><p></p><p>"This person should be the one who ended the era of the gods. Now opening up a world should be to use it as his own residence."</p><p></p><p>The ancient demigods in the human world had not yet recovered from the fall of the gods when they witnessed such a shocking scene.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spent more than four hours to finally stabilize this layer of space. He nodded with satisfaction, "The foundation is roughly laid. Let's leave it at that for now."</p><p></p><p>Being in the world he opened up himself, Lin Yuan finally felt much more comfortable. Under the influence of the layers of heavy space, Lin Yuan felt a long-lost sense of freedom.</p><p></p><p>"Let's also inform the living beings." Lin Yuan glanced at the vast human world and directly manifested a towering figure, "From this day forth, the Martial Realm is opened. Any practitioner of martial arts who becomes a god can enter the Martial Realm."</p><p></p><p>After declaring to the human world, Lin Yuan didn't care about the huge shock it caused and returned to the Martial Realm again, sitting in the very center of it.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I can quietly cultivate and comprehend the Dao again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the numerous godhoods.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-four main godhoods, three thousand and sixty-three upper god godhoods, twenty-nine thousand six hundred and forty-two middle god godhoods, one hundred and twenty-three thousand two hundred and forty-two lower god godhoods..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. Just looking at this pile of godhoods, he felt numerous insights welling up and began to earnestly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how much these godhoods can improve my strength." Lin Yuan thought to himself. Relying on the godhoods of those demigods in the human world, Lin Yuan had already opened up to one hundred and twenty million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Then what about true godhoods?</p><p></p><p>And main godhoods?</p><p></p><p>"Let's start comprehending." Lin Yuan casually picked up a godhood. This godhood contained the attribute of space and was the "key" to the higher spatial essence of this world.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>Returning tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Starting the plot of sweeping the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Please give me some monthly tickets~~~</p>

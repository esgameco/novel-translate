        <h1>Chapter 490</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Grandmaster Xia Qin's thought process was lightning-fast, and he immediately discovered the key point of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter - the rule models.</p><p></p><p>Within the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier, there were numerous rule models, vastly different from the many rule models recorded in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the establishment and perfection of a rule model required the painstaking efforts of countless generations of evolution scholars. And some rule models could not be created just by wanting to create them.</p><p></p><p>Which of the rule models recorded in human civilization was not the result of the unremitting efforts of one generation of evolution scholars after another? But now?</p><p></p><p>Yet Grandmaster Xia Qin discovered a large number of completely new rule models within the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter.</p><p></p><p>Completely new rule models? A large number of them?</p><p></p><p>Grandmaster Xia Qin was filled with doubt and uncertainty, and immediately began to delve deeper into the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter, studying each of the rule models it contained.</p><p></p><p>The other eight human grandmasters also did the same, focusing most of their mental energy on the rule models.</p><p></p><p>"This is the rule model of the Boundless Space Rule? This pillar-level fusion rule, our human civilization has only a few evolvers who have mastered it, and yet there is a rule model for it?"</p><p></p><p>"And there is this rule model, the Destructive Thunder Rule Model? The fusion of the Great Destruction Rule and the Thunder Rule? The Great Destruction Rule is already a pillar-level fusion rule, and it has been fused with the Thunder Rule as well? There is also a rule model for this?"</p><p></p><p>"The Time Shadow Rule Model? The model is not a problem, but how did the Galactic Overlord create these rule models?"</p><p></p><p>As they continued to understand, a tremendous wave of shock swept through the minds of the nine human grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>The establishment and perfection of a rule model first requires the attainment of the ultimate level of insight into the corresponding rule.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, not only would they be unable to establish a rule model, they would not even be able to comprehend such a rule.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the established and perfected rule model must possess "universality".</p><p></p><p>A evolution scholar who has just attained insight into the Time Rule may, through great effort, be able to establish a complete Time Rule model. But this Time Rule model would only be applicable to that evolution scholar, and would not be of much help to the insight of the Time Rule for other evolvers.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of rule, it is boundless.</p><p></p><p>Even for the most basic Gold Rule, the Gold Rule grasped by different evolvers who have attained insight into it is not necessarily the same. They are merely different aspects of the Gold Rule.</p><p></p><p>Rule models are derived from the summarization of the corresponding rules, and the more aspects they encompass, the greater their universality.</p><p></p><p>But while it sounds easy, it is extremely difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The nine human grandmasters continuously observed the rule models within the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter, and were astounded to find that these rule models had an unbelievably high level of universality, completely reaching the standard of being fully disseminated among all the evolvers in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But how could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>The rules corresponding to the rule models they saw numbered in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Overlord would have to elevate his understanding of these rules to the ultimate level in order to establish the corresponding rule models.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of rules? And at least all of them are pillar-level fusion rules? Attaining ultimate insight?</p><p></p><p>The nine grandmasters were momentarily dumbfounded, as they had not reached such a level of rule comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The rule model of the Space-Time Fusion Rule."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Grandmaster Xia Qin's mind shook, for he had seen the core part of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter.</p><p></p><p>That was the rule model corresponding to the Space-Time Fusion Rule.</p><p></p><p>The most important rule for any evolutionary path, including the Grandmaster evolutionary path, is the Space-Time Fusion Rule.</p><p></p><p>Other pillar-level fusion rules, you can choose to comprehend them or not.</p><p></p><p>For example, to break through from the Tenth Tier to the Eleventh Tier, you only need to elevate one pillar-level fusion rule to the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>There is no requirement for which specific pillar-level fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>But the Space-Time Fusion Rule? To advance to the Eleventh Tier, the rule that needs to be comprehended is the Space-Time Fusion Rule.</p><p></p><p>Time and space are the two fundamental pillars of all rules, and the Space-Time Fusion Rule is even more so.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the Space-Time Fusion Rule is the "must-have" for every evolver who reaches the Eleventh Tier.</p><p></p><p>"The rule model from the First Realm to the Fifth Realm of the Space-Time Fusion Rule?"</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three rule models?"</p><p></p><p>"These rule models..."</p><p></p><p>It took the nine grandmasters more than an hour to fully examine the over thirty thousand rule models corresponding to the Space-Time Fusion Rule.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the nine grandmasters could not understand them, as their comprehension of space-time had reached the Sixth Realm upon entering the Twelfth Tier.</p><p></p><p>It was just that to determine whether a certain rule model had reached the standard for widespread dissemination, they not only needed to understand the essence of the rule involved, but also needed to examine the other aspects.</p><p></p><p>And the rule models of the Space-Time Fusion Rule were of utmost importance, so as the strongest in human civilization, they naturally wanted to review them several times before being satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"The rule models of the Space-Time Fusion Rule have a very high level of universality, reaching the standard for widespread dissemination," Guli Grandmaster said after a long while, his tone tinged with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Before seeing the Space-Time Fusion Rule models, they had been both expectant and apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>But after confirming it, they were almost unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>If the Space-Time Fusion Rule models came from the hands of Grandmaster Xuanyuan, the eight human grandmasters could have reluctantly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Grandmaster Xuanyuan's realm was there for all to see.</p><p></p><p>He was the strongest grandmaster in human civilization, with strength approaching the peak of the Paragon Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>A newcomer to the Eleventh Tier?</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord's rule comprehension must have surpassed ours," Xushen Grandmaster said after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>At least the nine grandmasters were unable to create and perfect so many rule models. They had been trying to establish the Space-Time Fusion Rule models, but were still far from perfecting them.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, in the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier chapter, they saw the incredibly perfected Space-Time Fusion Rule models, going all the way from the First Realm to the Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Surpassed us?" </p><p></p><p>Grandmaster Xia Qin and the other grandmasters looked at each other, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Although they had long recognized the potential of the Galactic Overlord and believed Lin Yuan to be the greatest evolutionary genius in the history of human civilization, surpassing them nine grandmasters who had not yet entered the Twelfth Tier, this was something they had not anticipated.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could break through to the ultimate and enter the Twelfth Tier, he might quickly become the second strongest after Grandmaster Xuanyuan in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Or even beyond that, directly surpass Grandmaster Xuanyuan and become the strongest grandmaster in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite for all this was Lin Yuan entering the Twelfth Tier.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, Lin Yuan was only at the Eleventh Tier, and his rule comprehension had already surpassed these grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>This was something that all the grandmasters had never imagined.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they had thought that Lin Yuan's attainment of the Twelfth Tier level of mental will might have an element of "cheating" in their eyes,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These special matters have caused a surge in spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>And even so, the nine supreme experts still felt that Lin Yuan's spiritual will was merely on the same level as theirs, and had not surpassed or exceeded them.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The establishment and perfection of so many rule models, especially the space-time fusion rule model, undisputedly demonstrates Lin Yuan's terrifying mastery of rules. Unlike spiritual will, there is no shortcut for rule comprehension - one can only rely on one's own understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Nine Supreme Experts, please make the final judgment on the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>Just as the Nine Supreme Experts were lost in their thoughts, the voice of the Goddess of Wisdom rang out.</p><p></p><p>"The final judgment on the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures?" The Nine Supreme Experts, including Xia Qin, focused their minds and began to ponder seriously.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the value of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is absolutely groundbreaking and immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the crucial space-time fusion rule model, even the thousands of other pillar-level fusion rule models will have an unprecedented impact on human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the influence of these rule models is not limited to Martial Dao cultivators, but can also be comprehended by cultivators of other evolutionary paths, albeit with less effective results compared to Martial Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that the countless generations of future human civilization's cultivators will be influenced by the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures, even those who do not follow the Martial Dao evolutionary path will still want to study and observe it.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the Martial Dao evolutionary path will surpass the nine major supreme evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivators of the nine major supreme evolutionary paths only account for one-tenth of the total human civilization's cultivators. There are a large number of cultivators who do not follow the supreme evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this proportion will be even greater as the cultivation level increases. Among the Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth Tier cultivators, four or five out of ten are from the supreme evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it still cannot match the influence of the Martial Dao evolutionary path. The numerous rule models in the Eleventh Tier Scriptures can be used by any cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, what is your judgment?" Xia Qin looked at Xuanyuan, the other seven human Supreme Experts also turned their gaze to him, as the value of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures was too great for them to make a conclusion lightly.</p><p></p><p>"My judgment is..." Xuanyuan spoke solemnly, "One hundred billion merit points."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the expressions of the eight Supreme Experts varied. Most of their judgments were only around five or six billion merit points, but Xuanyuan directly gave a judgment of one hundred billion merit points?</p><p></p><p>"One hundred billion merit points?" Xia Qin's expression was one of surprise. In his heart, he had also made a judgment on the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures, but it did not reach the terrifying figure of one hundred billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>One hundred billion merit points, what a concept! Since the dawn of the Stellar Era, human civilization has not yet seen such a massive expenditure of merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Appreciating the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is also appreciating the Galactic Overlord," Xuanyuan said, then looked at the other Supreme Experts, "Do you all agree with this judgment without any objections?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p>"The Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is worth this price."</p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>The eight Supreme Experts nodded, having no objections.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Supreme Experts, the final judgment on the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is one hundred billion merit points. Shall we convert it to the corresponding Rank Value for an upgrade?"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Wisdom continued.</p><p></p><p>Rank Value is a data determined by the three Goddesses based on factors such as the potential and popularity of each evolutionary path, used for ranking on the Evolution Leaderboard. The higher the Rank Value, the higher the ranking of the evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Rank Value is only internal data known to the Nine Supreme Experts, and other cultivators are unaware of this data standard.</p><p></p><p>"Rank Value." Xuanyuan paused for a moment and said, "Just follow the rules."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan was well aware of why the Goddess of Wisdom specifically raised this question. If the value of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures truly reached one hundred billion merit points, the final Rank Value obtained would surpass some of the supreme evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine major supreme evolutionary paths, there are also Rank Values, ranging from eighty billion to one hundred and twenty billion.</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Overlord's Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position. This time, the time he had to wait after uploading the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures was much longer than the previous ten times.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not feel any surprise, as the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures contained too much content, especially those rule models, which even the Supreme Experts had to spend time confirming and judging.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Tenth-Level Citizen, the great scholar Lin Yuan, the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures you have uploaded has passed the final judgment."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom rang out.</p><p></p><p>"It has passed the judgment?" Lin Yuan's face showed interest.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, he had speculated that the judgment of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures was not led by the three Goddesses alone, but must have involved the participation of the human civilization's Supreme Experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also quite curious about the Supreme Experts' assessment of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>"The final judgment value of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is one hundred billion merit points."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom quickly stated.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred billion merit points." Lin Yuan let out a relieved sigh.</p><p></p><p>Even not long ago, when Lin Yuan single-handedly broke through the super-large battlefield and won a large amount of territory for human civilization, the final merit points he obtained were only around two billion.</p><p></p><p>But now, the value of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures has reached one hundred billion? "Is it because of those rule models?" Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>If the Martial Dao evolutionary path is only applicable to Martial Dao cultivators, those rule models can be used by any cultivator, with an unimaginably high degree of popularization.</p><p></p><p>This has led to the skyrocketing judgment of the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the super-large battlefield and winning a large amount of territory for human civilization can certainly improve the foundation of human civilization to a certain extent, but compared to the overall size of the territory, the improvement in the foundation is ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Dao Eleventh Tier Scriptures is different. It is not just a simple improvement of the foundation, but an instant leap of human civilization's foundation by several levels.</p><p></p><p>"With so many merit points, according to the human civilization's exchange rate of one hundred million merit points for one Twelve-Star Rare Treasure, ten billion merit points can exchange for ten Twelve-Star Rare Treasures. Then ten billion merit points would be able to exchange for ten thousand Twelve-Star Rare Treasures?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand Twelve-Star Rare Treasures? Probably all the Twelve-Star Rare Treasures in human civilization combined wouldn't even amount to that many.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, the ranking of the Martial Dao evolutionary path." Lin Yuan's mind stirred, remembering this matter.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

            <p>Chapter 218: Golden Dragon Star Lord: Jin Tianzhao, this is your doing! (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"These privileges..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully browsed through the email sent from the Central Star Domain. New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùìºùì±ùìæùîÅ.ùì¨ùì∏ùì∂</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan's citizenship level was promoted, he would receive blessings and introductions from the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Level 6 citizens, the additional privileges and benefits for Level 7 citizens were not many, but each one was of great importance.</p><p></p><p>First of all, every Level 7 citizen would receive a Level 7 Evolution Potion and a Level 7 Life Extension Potion gifted by the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Level 7 Evolution Potion was similar in use to the Level 6 Evolution Potion. After taking it, one could elevate their physical body and soul to the Level 7 realm without any side effects. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the elevation here was only at a foundational level. As for the abilities such as comprehending laws that Level 7 Evolvers possessed, those were not included.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Central Star Domain did this was because they considered that many Level 7 citizens may not have high evolution talent.</p><p></p><p>Throughout their lives, they may not be able to cultivate to Level 5 or 6.</p><p></p><p>The Evolution Potion was to make up for this deficiency.</p><p></p><p>Although they wouldn't comprehend laws, elevating to Level 7 realm meant their lifespan could surge to over 100,000 years at least.</p><p></p><p>Plus with the Level 7 Life Extension Potion, even if a Level 7 citizen had poor evolution talent, they could still live for 200,000 to 300,000 years.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization valued every Level 7 citizen, hoping they could live a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>It was also considered a way to repay their contributions to human civilization. And if Level 7 citizens lived longer, perhaps they could make even more contributions to human civilization?</p><p></p><p>"Level 7 Evolution Potion..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed slightly. Who knows how many major powers and great families wanted to obtain this kind of potion that could elevate people to Level 7 without side effects.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't for themselves.</p><p></p><p>But for their closest kin or beloved descendants.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, so far, only the human civilization's authorities could stably provide such evolution potions.</p><p></p><p>As for other forces? The potions they provided to increase strength basically all had some hidden dangers or risks.</p><p></p><p>"Automatically becoming a 'Councilor' of the Annan Star Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the second privilege of Level 7 citizens.</p><p></p><p>The Annan Star Alliance belonged to the Chikun Star Domain and covered hundreds of surrounding star domains.</p><p></p><p>Although the Annan Star Alliance did not have absolute command over the Chikun Star Lord, it also had the right to relatively control him.</p><p></p><p>Those who could become "Councilors" of the Annan Star Alliance were all absolutely major figures, on the level of the Chikun Star Lord and Golden Dragon Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary star domain lords simply could not accumulate the 2 million merit points required to be promoted to Level 7 citizenship.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were a total of 56 councilors in the Annan Star Alliance, 31 of whom had hidden their identities, while the other 25 were all titans of great renown across many star domains.</p><p></p><p>"Star Alliance Councilors have the power of one veto. As long as they think there is a problem with a certain debate, they can veto it and wait for the next Star Alliance Conference to reconvene to discuss it."</p><p></p><p>"This veto power can be used at most three times on the same matter. After three times, it can no longer be vetoed."</p><p></p><p>This was mainly to prevent a councilor from being unreasonable, but even so, it was still quite unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the reason the three Goddesses allowed the Star Alliance Councilors to have this power was that the debates that could appear at the Star Alliance Conferences basically had no impact on the overall situation of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Or they did not involve any bottom lines or red lines related to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>No matter who won or lost, the result would be about the same.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the above,</p><p></p><p>Level 7 citizens also had the right to reside in the Central Star Domain, the right to apply for a guard team stationed by Level 8 Evolvers, the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully read it several times. With the status of a Level 7 citizen, if Lin Yuan applied to the Wisdom Goddess for a position, he would at least be an administrator on a main planet in the Central Star Domain, with a high position and great authority.</p><p></p><p>An administrator on a main planet in the Central Star Domain was incomparably higher in status than the Canglan Star administrator. The two were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>Even some Level 8 Evolvers were extremely eager to serve as administrators on the main planets of the Central Star Domain. This was not only about status, but also a stable channel for obtaining merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I have no interest in management..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The position of administrator required devoting a lot of time to planetary management. Generally, only Level 8 Evolvers who had hit a bottleneck would be interested.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan now, it was the golden period for cultivation. As long as he opened up the Level 8 chapter of the martial dao evolution path, it would be incomparably better than serving in any administrator position.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, do you wish to hide your Level 7 Citizen identity?" </p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Wisdom Goddess came.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a Level 7 Citizen, Lin Yuan's information would automatically appear on the list of councilors in the Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>In order to protect citizens' privacy, every Level 7 Citizen could choose whether to hide their identity or not.</p><p></p><p>Among the current 56 councilors of the Annan Star Alliance, 31 had hidden their identities.</p><p></p><p>"Hide it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After hiding his citizen identity, the information displayed on the councilor list was the code name information that Lin Yuan had set in advance.</p><p></p><p>That is, "Thirteen".</p><p></p><p>Choosing the code name "Thirteen" was also Lin Yuan's casual act. As for whether it would reveal his true identity, there was no such worry at all.</p><p></p><p>The Annan Star Alliance encompassed hundreds of star domains and over trillions of life planets. There were countless things related to the number thirteen.</p><p></p><p>The two were not on the same track at all. One was an evolution talent, and the other was the founder of an evolution path. The fields they excelled in were completely different.</p><p></p><p>On the official website of the Annan Star Alliance,</p><p></p><p>A name silently appeared in the 57th position of the councilor list.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen.</p><p></p><p>This change.</p><p></p><p>Immediately attracted the attention of a large number of Evolvers and high-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>"What? Our Annan Star Alliance has another councilor?"</p><p></p><p>"Even hiding their identity, I don't know which star domain's Level 7 Citizen it is..."</p><p></p><p>"No need to say, it must be someone from our star domain."</p><p></p><p>"As if your star domain could produce a Level 7 Citizen?"</p><p></p><p>Many Evolvers discussed and speculated.</p><p></p><p>Under the long history of the Annan Star Alliance, there were only a total of 56 councilors accumulated. Now suddenly one more appeared, naturally it would make many people curious.</p><p></p><p>But most Evolvers only discussed it curiously for a while.</p><p></p><p>After all, Star Alliance Councilors were too far away from them. Those lofty figures, where not even one could appear in dozens of star domains, were simply not someone they could come into contact with.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen..."</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng had just taken a sip of fine wine when he received the link sent by his friend. Clicking on it and taking a look, he almost spat out the wine in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit, it can't be such a coincidence, right?"</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng found it a bit unbelievable. He remembered he also had a good friend called Thirteen?</p><p></p><p>"It can't be..."</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng hurriedly contacted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In his personal space,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat leisurely on the armchair, listening to the sound of the stream around him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Thirteen, I just saw a new name appear on the councilor list..." Red-nosed Shi Feng asked in a tense voice.</p><p></p><p>This matter was too unbelievable. Although there was a high probability it was just a name coincidence, he still came to confirm it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually that becoming an Annan Star Alliance Councilor, as long as he didn't expose his true identity, there was no need to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>After all, becoming a councilor</p><p></p><p>After that, there are still many benefits from the Annan Star Alliance that will be actively sent over, unless Lin Yuan plans to give up these benefits. Otherwise, he will eventually have to interact with the outside world with the identity of "Thirteen".</p><p></p><p>"Is it really not Thirteen Brother, but Thirteen Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng was dumbfounded. Even though he had guessed this before coming, he still felt it was unbelievable. </p><p></p><p>He, Shi Feng, had actually addressed a high and mighty council member as brother?</p><p></p><p>"Sit down and talk."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." However, Red-nosed Shi Feng didn't relax at all.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was only a level six citizen, he would still dare to joke and laugh. But a level seven citizen was a completely different class.</p><p></p><p>99.99% of level six citizens could never become level seven citizens in their lifetime. </p><p></p><p>This included those level eight evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen Lord."</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly his expression changed. After pausing for a few breaths, he cautiously said, "People from the Wangyue Star Domain found me and asked if Thirteen Lord is that Star Alliance council member."</p><p></p><p>The Annan Star Alliance's official website was open to all citizens. Changes in Star Alliance council members were definitely a big deal for the high-level members of star domains, as it would affect the future structure of the Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, people from the Wangyue Star Domain were constantly paying attention. Especially when the name of the newly added Star Alliance council member was the same as Lin Yuan's code name, they immediately came to find Red-nosed Shi Feng for confirmation.</p><p></p><p>"Tell them then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually. </p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Red-nosed Shi Feng respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen Lord, the people from Wangyue Star Domain want to see you," Red-nosed Shi Feng said tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Meet them then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a cold expression walked over.</p><p></p><p>It was the Star Lord of Wangyue Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Wangyue Star Domain was not a very powerful star domain, and its Star Lord was just an ordinary level eight evolved being.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord's attitude was slightly respectful.</p><p></p><p>No matter what Lin Yuan's strength was, since he could become a level seven citizen, his status could be on par with those peak level eight evolved beings. Addressing him as "Lord" was not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Wangyue Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, when my Wangyue Star Domain cooperated with you, Lord, as long as you voted for my Wangyue Star Domain, you would receive remuneration. Now it seems that my Wangyue Star Domain was negligent and gave too little remuneration."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"Too little?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled ambiguously.</p><p></p><p>However, the Wangyue Star Lord was more tactful. The conditions he gave before were for Lin Yuan as a level six citizen.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan was a level seven citizen, if the Wangyue Star Domain played dumb, Lin Yuan would only simply vote and not do anything else.</p><p></p><p>Star Alliance council members also had voting rights. Compared to level six citizens, a Star Alliance council member's vote was worth ten.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Compared to Thirteen Lord's identity, it's too little."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord said, "Thirteen Lord should know about the dispute between my Wangyue Star Domain and the Jinlong Star Domain."</p><p></p><p>"I know a bit." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The problem between Wangyue Star Domain and Jinlong Star Domain originated from a resource planet.</p><p></p><p>At the border of Wangyue Star Domain and Jinlong Star Domain, there was an area with only many dead stars floating around.</p><p></p><p>What are dead stars?</p><p></p><p>They are neither suitable for human habitation nor have any resources.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, dead stars are the most numerous.</p><p></p><p>Whether dead stars or normal life planets, they are not stationary.</p><p></p><p>They slowly change positions along with the various gravitational forces in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was a dead star that moved from the border area between Jinlong Star Domain and Wangyue Star Domain into Wangyue Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when people from Wangyue Star Domain came to explore, they were surprised to find that this dead star was a resource planet containing precious resources.</p><p></p><p>Its value was so great that if fully mined, it would be equivalent to at least 10,000 universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>And this attracted the attention of Jinlong Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The evolved beings of the Jinlong lineage, based on the fact that this dead star was once located at the border of the two star domains, believed it should be jointly managed by the two star domains and wanted to take 80% of the revenue.</p><p></p><p>Wangyue Star Domain naturally disagreed. Since the dead star had drifted to their side, it naturally belonged to them.</p><p></p><p>The two sides started arguing.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord of Jinlong Star Domain, relying on his wide connections, took the initiative to submit this matter to the Star Alliance Congress. My Wangyue Star Domain could only keep inviting other level six citizens."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"My Wangyue Star Domain is willing to pay 2,000 universe crystals, hoping to ask Thirteen Lord to veto this matter with one vote and delay it as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord stated his purpose.</p><p></p><p>The reason for delaying was that the resources on the resource planet could be collected.</p><p></p><p>The longer the delay, the more the evolved beings of Wangyue Star Domain could collect. As long as they could delay past this Star Alliance Congress, Wangyue Star Domain was confident they could collect 70% of the resources before the next Star Alliance Congress.</p><p></p><p>"2,000 universe crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>This remuneration was already considered acceptable. The inheritance left by the level eight evolved being Ou Yin contained only 1,000 universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>2,000 universe crystals was already equivalent to most of the fortune of a level eight evolved being who had been adventuring for many years.</p><p></p><p>"If Thirteen Lord thinks it's low, then 3,000 universe crystals."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could successfully collect 70% of the resources, it would probably only be worth about 7,000 universe crystals. After deducting various costs, Wangyue Star Domain could get at most 6,000 universe crystals. Giving Lin Yuan 3,000 universe crystals was already very sincere.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Thirteen Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Wangyue Star Lord heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of 56 council members in the Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Excluding those who were often absent, there were only a dozen or so who normally participated in the Star Alliance Congress.</p><p></p><p>And among these dozen or so, the Wangyue Star Lord couldn't get a single one to agree, either because they were unwilling to offend the Jinlong Star Lord or for other reasons.</p><p></p><p>Jinlong Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Jinlong Main Star.</p><p></p><p>The Jinlong Star Lord sat on a golden throne, his consciousness connected to the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Annan Star Alliance has an additional council member? Code name is 'Thirteen'?"</p><p></p><p>"Why does this Thirteen sound so familiar?"</p><p></p><p>The Jinlong Star Lord, with his status, thought for a moment and confirmed that "Thirteen" had the same name as the mysterious level six citizen that Jin Tianzhao had offended, as he had confessed to him before.</p><p></p><p>"Same name?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, the Jinlong Star Lord immediately started inquiring.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the same name. This new council member is that 'Thirteen'."</p><p></p><p>The Jinlong Star Lord immediately felt trouble. If Lin Yuan was just a level six citizen, he could ignore him. But how many level seven citizens were there in the entire Annan Star Alliance?</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Jinlong Star Lord had ignored Lin Yuan before was because he thought that even if Lin Yuan had the potential to become a level seven citizen, it would be many years later.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought it would be so soon?</p><p></p><p>"This Jin Tianzhao, he just won't give me peace. Casually offending someone, he offended a level seven citizen?"</p><p></p><p>The Jinlong Star Lord frowned and immediately summoned Jin Tianzhao.</p><p></p><p>"Master called for me?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Tianzhao had just come out of seclusion not long ago and received the Jinlong Star Lord's summons.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Master's tone sounds like he's in a bad mood?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Tianzhao felt a bit apprehensive as he arrived at the grand hall where the Jinlong Star Lord was.</p><p></p><p>"Jin Tianzhao."</p><p></p><p>The Jinlong Star Lord looked down at Jin Tianzhao. "What good things have you done!?"</p>

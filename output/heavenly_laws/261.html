            <p>Chapter 261: Dragon Palace in the Palm (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"In which direction is the Huai Dragon Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal was stunned for a moment, not understanding the meaning behind Lin Yuan's words. </p><p></p><p>Was he planning to personally visit the Huai Dragon Palace?</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>With the dignity of a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King, once he personally arrived at the Huai Dragon Palace,</p><p></p><p>Even if that Palace Master was domineering, he would have to obediently lower his head.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Spiritual Realm, no True Immortal dared to defy the will of an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>True Immortals like the Cangqing Immortal and the Huai Dragon Palace Master, although known as half-step Immortal Kings,</p><p></p><p>Were incomparably far from genuine Tribulation Transcending Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal had passed the Spiritual Tribulation, possessing a powerful soul and will,</p><p></p><p>Yet he was toyed with by Lin Yuan at will, trapped in an illusion without self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>This was also because Lin Yuan was no ordinary Tribulation Transcending Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>But even for a common Tribulation Transcending Immortal King, dealing with a half-step Immortal King,</p><p></p><p>Was merely a matter of a single thought.</p><p></p><p>"It's there."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal immediately pointed out a location.</p><p></p><p>As the old rival of the Huai Dragon Palace, he naturally knew the whereabouts of their lair.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Huai Dragon Palace relied on the core water veins of the Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>Even if a group of half-step Immortal Kings besieged it, they could do nothing. It was as solid as a golden fort.</p><p></p><p>So even if the Cangqing Immortal knew the location of the enemy's lair, there wasn't much he could do.</p><p></p><p>In the past large-scale decisive battles between the Huai Dragon Palace and the Morality Immortal Sect,</p><p></p><p>Even if the Morality Immortal Sect, with the help of the Profound King Hall, repelled the Huai Dragon Palace, it was difficult to truly heavily damage them.</p><p></p><p>Those Dragon Lineage True Immortals, once discovering they couldn't win, would hide inside the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to standing on invincible ground.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, actually there is no need for you to go personally. You only need to bestow a decree, and I can bring it to the Huai Dragon Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal hesitated for a moment before saying softly.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal King's decree contained the aura of an Immortal King and could not be imitated. It symbolized the will of a certain Immortal King. When the decree arrived, it was equivalent to the Immortal King arriving.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Huai Dragon Palace was audacious, they wouldn't dare defy an Immortal King's decree.</p><p></p><p>But who knows how many tens of thousands of years ago this old matter was, whether it was true or false was unclear. Even if that Tribulation Transcending Dragon King truly existed, it was impossible for him to offend another Tribulation Transcending Immortal King over a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Cangqing Immortal and said indifferently, "Just grab them directly."</p><p></p><p>With that said,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand.</p><p></p><p>The black and white Taiji forces intertwined at his fingertips, slightly distorting space. The Cangqing Immortal only took one glance before feeling a splitting headache.</p><p></p><p>It was too profound.</p><p></p><p>Too complex.</p><p></p><p>Just from Lin Yuan's hand-raising motion, the Cangqing Immortal felt that all the spatial profundities he comprehended in more than half his life were contained within, and only accounted for one in ten thousand, one in a hundred thousand of the whole.</p><p></p><p>The remaining spatial profundities were a realm the Cangqing Immortal was far from being able to touch.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor's mastery of spatial profundities has actually reached such a level?"</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal was shocked in his heart, but no matter how much his head ached, he still stared closely at Lin Yuan's raised right hand.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps by observing it for a while longer, he would have hope of comprehending the Great Dao?</p><p></p><p>Under the Cangqing Immortal's gaze, Lin Yuan's raised right hand, facing the direction he had just pointed, palm facing down, lightly grabbed.</p><p></p><p>Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>The entire Nine Rivers Domain was composed of nine great rivers, each river running through dozens of large domains, finally all converging in the Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Nine Rivers Domain had unparalleled advantages, being the holy land of the aquatic races. The Huai Dragon Palace was a force formed by the Dragon Lineages, connected to the core water veins of the entire Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>To break through the Huai Dragon Palace, one had to break through the core water veins of the entire Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this advantage, the Huai Dragon Palace had prospered for millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Even if it weakened during a certain period, it did not affect the overall situation, always being one of the dominant forces in the Nine Rivers Domain.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master, who had passed the Physical Tribulation, looked at the single-horned man in front of her, her voice cold, "Your Heavenly Dragon Nest also wants the Essence of Heavenly Water?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dragon Nest was also a dominant force in the Nine Rivers Domain, on par with the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Lord has agreed to fully assist you in obtaining that Essence of Heavenly Water, but our Heavenly Dragon Nest wants half of it." The single-horned man said.</p><p></p><p>"Half..."</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master's face was expressionless.</p><p></p><p>But in her heart, she was pondering. After passing the Physical Tribulation, her strength had greatly increased. She was confident in repelling the Morality Immortal Sect, and even had the courage to deal with the Profound King Hall behind them.</p><p></p><p>But it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace knew the importance of the Essence of Heavenly Water, and so did the Morality Immortal Sect, let alone the Profound King Hall.</p><p></p><p>The three major forces of the Profound King Domain would definitely stop her at all costs.</p><p></p><p>They might even call on friends, gathering half-step Immortal Kings from other large domains.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, she still had some pressure.</p><p></p><p>If she could join hands with the Heavenly Dragon Nest...</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master had already made a decision in her heart.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Heavenly Dragon Nest had also sought to cooperate with her, similarly proposing to obtain half of the Essence of Heavenly Water, but was directly rejected by the Huai Dragon Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>Because at that time, she had not passed the Physical Tribulation, and her combat power was inferior to that Dragon Lord of the Heavenly Dragon Nest.</p><p></p><p>Rashly cooperating might even lead to the Huai Dragon Palace being swallowed by the other party.</p><p></p><p>But now she was different. Having passed the Physical Tribulation, she was not weaker than that Dragon Lord of the Heavenly Dragon Nest.</p><p></p><p>The cooperation between the two was more or less on an equal level.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty percent."</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty percent is too low." The single-horned man's expression was a bit unsightly.</p><p></p><p>In the end.</p><p></p><p>The two decided to split that Essence of Heavenly Water sixty-forty, with the Huai Dragon Palace occupying sixty percent and the Heavenly Dragon Nest occupying forty percent.</p><p></p><p>"With our two major forces joining hands, that Morality Immortal Sect and that Profound King Domain are nothing but clay chickens and tile dogs." A smile appeared on the single-horned man's face.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master was also in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>But with the promise of the Heavenly Dragon Nest's full assistance,</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace's confidence greatly increased, enough to deal with the oppression from the half-step Immortal Kings of the surrounding large domains.</p><p></p><p>Just as the single-horned man was about to return to the Heavenly Dragon Nest to inform the Dragon Lord of this matter,</p><p></p><p>His expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master was the same, suddenly raising her head to look at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the boundless sky, not knowing when it had dimmed.</p><p></p><p>It was not dimming, but a huge palm covered in black and white enveloping the entire Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly dares to be so presumptuous in front of my Huai Dragon Palace?"</p><p></p><p>One by one, True Immortal level Dragon Lineages soared into the sky, wanting to shatter that sky-covering giant palm.</p><p></p><p>But one after another, True Immortal level killing techniques fell onto that sky-covering giant palm without even stirring a ripple.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The sky-covering giant palm slowly descended, its five fingers beginning to close, as if wanting to grab the Huai Dragon Palace that spanned a million miles.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon-</p><p></p><p>In this excerpt from a Chinese novel, a powerful being named Lin Yuan effortlessly captures the entire Huai Long Palace, a major force in the Jiujiang Domain, along with its many dragon-blooded immortals.</p><p></p><p>The scene begins with the Huai Long Palace Master transforming into a massive true dragon, attempting to resist a colossal hand descending from the heavens. Despite being a half-step Immortal King, the Palace Master's attack proves futile against the hand's might. The hand grasps the entire palace, causing it to vanish without a trace, leaving only a massive crater where it once stood.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Lord of the Tianlong Nest, another powerful figure in the Jiujiang Domain, arrives at the scene, utterly shocked by the palace's disappearance. He realizes that only a Transcendent Immortal King could accomplish such a feat, and fears that the mysterious Immortal King's actions might bring consequences to the entire domain.</p><p></p><p>As other immortals gather, they discuss the implications of the event, with many deciding to flee the Jiujiang Domain to avoid potential repercussions.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the Martial Temple, Cangqing Immortal watches as Lin Yuan reaches out his right hand and seemingly grasps at the air. When Lin Yuan opens his palm, a miniature version of the Huai Long Palace appears, with the dragon-blooded immortals trapped inside, resembling tiny wriggling insects.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal is stunned, realizing that Lin Yuan had literally meant "directly grab" when referring to the Huai Long Palace, showcasing his immense power as a Transcendent Immortal King.</p>

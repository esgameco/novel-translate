            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Has the war ended?" </p><p></p><p>A group of young men and women looked at the old man with the red beard.</p><p></p><p>They had just arrived, and the war had already ended? And how did the war end?</p><p></p><p>Who won?</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual God King has died, killed by a powerful figure known as 'Silver River'," the old man with the red beard patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Just now, King Qisong had informed him of the latest news from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>And even if Qisong King had not, he would have soon learned of this.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual God King is dead?" </p><p></p><p>The young men took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qingfeng City was safe and sound, the old man with the red beard said the war had ended. </p><p></p><p>They began to vaguely speculate that perhaps an unexpected turn of events had occurred on the battlefield, causing the Spiritual God King to retreat.</p><p></p><p>But the old man with the red beard said the Spiritual God King was dead? </p><p></p><p>Dead and retreating were two completely different things.</p><p></p><p>According to the information they had received -</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual God King was a core royal family member who had grown to his limits.</p><p></p><p>Who could have killed such a powerful figure? A Celestial Master?</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Masters of the entire Raging Sun Ancient Kingdom were only a few, and none of them were called 'Silver River'.</p><p></p><p>"Qisong said that 'Silver River' is a core royal family member of our Raging Sun Ancient Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The old man with the red beard pondered. Now that the war had ended, and in a way that resulted in the victory of the Raging Sun Ancient Kingdom, he was no longer in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Which fellow clansman could it be?"</p><p></p><p>The old man with the red beard was curious. The Raging Sun Ancient Kingdom did have some ancient core royal families who had gone out to explore, trying to find a way to break through the shackles of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go pay a visit."</p><p></p><p>The old man with the red beard glanced at the young men beside him and rose to fly towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come this far, he also wanted to witness this "Silver River" that Qisong King had spoken of.</p><p></p><p>After all, this "Silver River" had so decisively killed the Spiritual God King, their strength must be even beyond that of the limit core royal families.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was casually chatting with King Qisong and King Qijiu.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Senior Silver River's intervention, Qingfeng Domain and dozens of other large domains around it would definitely not have been saved," King Qisong said with a sigh. "The grace of Senior Silver River towards me is truly too great."</p><p></p><p>Although they had lost the war, it was also because the Spiritual God King's strength had exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>But a loss was a loss, and the loss of dozens of large domain territories meant that he, King Qisong, would certainly have to go to the capital city to be punished.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a matter of grace," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Even if there had been no King Qisong, he would not have watched Qingfeng Domain be attacked.</p><p></p><p>"For Senior Silver River, it may not be much, but for me, it is a huge grace," King Qisong said solemnly, "But I don't know how I should express my gratitude to the senior."</p><p></p><p>"Precious treasures? Senior Silver River would certainly not care about them, and I can't provide what Senior Silver River wants."</p><p></p><p>King Qisong was just an ordinary royal family member, his strength a little stronger than the peak of the Great Venerable, but far inferior to the limit core royal families.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge gap in strength, the treasures in King Qisong's eyes were naturally not considered treasures by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So I have decided to transfer all the merits of this war to Senior Silver River, and then the senior can choose from the treasury in the capital city."</p><p></p><p>King Qisong spoke.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme commander of this war against the invasion of the Great Spiritual Ancient Kingdom, King Qisong would be punished if he lost.</p><p></p><p>But if he had won, he would certainly have received a lot of rewards.</p><p></p><p>And unlike the Qingfeng Marquis and the Red Leaf Great Venerable, the rewards he received would come directly from the Raging Sun capital city.</p><p></p><p>The Raging Sun capital city was the core of the Raging Sun Ancient Kingdom, where countless precious treasures were gathered, even Celestial Master-level experts were extremely eager for them.</p><p></p><p>"The merits to me, what about you?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at King Qisong.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Senior Silver River, I would already be on the way to being punished now," King Qisong said. "With the current outcome, I am already very satisfied, and besides the merits of this war, I really don't know what else I can use to repay the senior."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Silver River, just accept it, this time without you, Qisong would be punished, and I would also suffer a great loss."</p><p></p><p>King Qijiu beside him spoke up to persuade.</p><p></p><p>At least his main combat body would certainly have been defeated by the Spiritual God King.</p><p></p><p>Losing his personal weapon, and the time and effort to cultivate a new main combat body, Qijiu King could only feel grateful.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's intervention, the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at King Qisong's determined expression, thought about it for a while, and nodded, saying, "Since it's like that, I'll accept it."</p><p></p><p>"The senior accepting it is good." </p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on King Qisong's face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right." King Qisong seemed to have thought of something and immediately said, "Senior, King Qibao wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>"King Qibao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at King Qisong.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, when the Spiritual God King displayed the strength of a limit core royal family, I immediately called for reinforcements from the capital city," King Qisong explained. "King Qibao is the powerful figure sent from the capital city specifically to resist the Spiritual God King."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Specifically to resist the Spiritual God King? It must be either a fellow limit core royal family member or a Celestial Master.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that the latter was impossible, as in just a local battle, dispatching Celestial Master-level combat power could potentially push the situation in an unpredictable direction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So it seems that he is also an extreme core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Treasure King has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng looked towards the direction of Qingfeng City, and at this moment, the figure of an old man with a red beard appeared, and he immediately flew towards this side.</p><p></p><p>As he approached a certain distance, this old man with a red beard did not continue to traverse the void, but flew directly over.</p><p></p><p>"An extreme core imperial clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the old man with the red beard from afar, vaguely feeling the huge aura emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>It was a terrifying aura no weaker than the Spiritual Deity King.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old man with the red beard approached.</p><p></p><p>"So you must be Brother Silver, right?"</p><p></p><p>The old man with the red beard, who was the Crimson Treasure King, looked at Lin Yuan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go back and chat slowly."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng King said beside him, "I have already ordered the preparation of exquisite cuisine, let's eat and chat."</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng King had already arranged everything, and immediately led Lin Yuan and the others to his temporary small city dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The Yu Family.</p><p></p><p>Several patriarchs and Yu Chaolong had also received detailed intelligence about the war between Qingfeng Domain and Zimen Domain.</p><p></p><p>The war between the two major domains determined the future fate of their families, so the Yu Family was naturally extremely concerned.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong looked at the intelligence report in front of him, somewhat unable to react.</p><p></p><p>In the war between the two domains, the Silver River Grand Ancestor suddenly intervened, sweeping the entire battlefield with an absolute crushing posture, even killing the core imperial clan Spiritual Deity King.</p><p></p><p>This kind of "explosive" news and intelligence would definitely be spread throughout the Qingfeng Domain at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>After all, it could boost morale, that the mighty core imperial clan of the Ancient Spiritual Country actually died on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong and the several patriarchs had a muddle-headed feeling in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Grand Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"This Silver River Grand Ancestor, why does he sound so familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Grand Ancestor? I remember that Ayan's grand title is 'Silver River'?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, when they saw the words "Silver River Grand Ancestor", they had already associated it with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Especially the several Yu Family patriarchs, as Tenth Realm Dao Boundary experts, how fast could their minds operate? How could there be a "familiar" scene?</p><p></p><p>It was not familiar, but they dared not believe it, because according to the intelligence, the things that the Silver River Grand Ancestor had done were too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Deity King was a core imperial clan that had grown to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Renowned as the invincible Grand Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But he died at the hands of the Silver River Grand Ancestor? Was this Silver River Grand Ancestor really the Ayan they knew? "Could there be some misunderstanding?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong couldn't help but say, the content of the intelligence was truly unbelievable, to the point that he began to doubt the authenticity of the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"There's no misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Ancestor has already contacted me personally."</p><p></p><p>One of the Yu Family patriarchs' voice trembled. Even though the Yu Family had produced the new Grand Ancestor Ayan, the other Grand Ancestors would not contact the Yu Family for no reason.</p><p></p><p>How great was the existence of a Grand Ancestor? How many were there in a major domain?</p><p></p><p>"This, this, this..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong did not dare to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"We still need to confirm it in person."</p><p></p><p>Another Yu Family patriarch looked at Yu Chaolong, "Chaolong, go to Qingfeng City later and see how things really are."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Yu Chaolong calmed himself down. He also wanted to know whether the Silver River Grand Ancestor in the intelligence, who was like a divine being, was really his son.</p><p></p><p>In the luxurious pavilion of Qingfeng King's temporary city dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Crimson Treasure King sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>As for Qingfeng King and Qingjue King? After chatting for a while, seeing that the Crimson Treasure King and Lin Yuan had something to say, the two kings tactfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Silver, you shouldn't be an out-traveling core imperial clan, right?" The Crimson Treasure King looked at Lin Yuan and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Qingfeng King and Qingjue King were not at a high enough level, and although Qingjue King was a core imperial clan, he had not yet grown to the limit, so the information he had accessed was also limited.</p><p></p><p>So they thought Lin Yuan was a lucky core imperial clan who happened to be traveling and passing through the Qingfeng Domain.</p><p></p><p>But the Crimson Treasure King? As an extreme core imperial clan, the Crimson Treasure King was basically aware of all the extreme core imperial clans in the Ancient Country, and there was no one similar to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frankly admitted, "I have been cultivating in the past, condensing one after another Blazing Sun Seed, and then I have this kind of strength now."</p><p></p><p>The Qingfeng Marquis thought that Lin Yuan's bloodline had regressed to the ancestor, and the ancestor's bloodline had reached the core imperial clan level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was now also following the Qingfeng Marquis' conjecture to explain, disguising himself as a lucky one whose bloodline had regressed to the ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Country had existed for endless years, and there had indeed been similar cases, where the bloodline of a certain living being in the Ancient Country regressed to the ancestor and reached the core imperial clan level, and eventually rose up.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most suitable statement for Lin Yuan now, and the most impregnable statement, after all, Lin Yuan had condensed one Blazing Sun Seed after another, which was beyond the ordinary, and only core imperial clans could basically do it.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King immediately accepted Lin Yuan's explanation. He could feel the abundant Blazing Sun Qi emanating from this Silver River Grand Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the bloodline has regressed to the ancestor and reached the core imperial clan level, but without the help of external inheritance, to be able to cultivate to this step..."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King looked solemnly at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although being born into the imperial clan of the Ancient Country and having various external forces to assist, it was not easy to grow to the limit. Qingjue King was an example.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? His bloodline had regressed to the ancestor, and he had never received any external help since childhood, but he had reached this step. The Crimson Treasure King looked at Lin Yuan with amazed eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

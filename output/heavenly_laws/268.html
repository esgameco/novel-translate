They had never heard of such a creative power before.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Martial Ancestor said so, this power must exist.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the Eighth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lin Yuan headed towards the entrance of the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were no supreme immortal kings from the prehistoric era guarding the entrance of the Eighth Heaven. It was empty, with wisps of illusory power floating around.</p><p></p><p>This was the tribulation from the Seventh Heaven to the Eighth Heaven, a natural phenomenon within the Nine Heavens. Even if destroyed, it would recover.</p><p></p><p>Just like the barrier between the heavens torn apart by Lin Yuan, it was now quickly recovering.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go directly from the entrance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sized it up.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Taiji Primordial Spirit was ambushed by Lingxu Xianwang, Lin Yuan's true body was in a hurry, so he charged through recklessly. But now there was no need.</p><p></p><p>The entrance was right in front, he could go straight through.</p><p></p><p>The tribulation from the Seventh Heaven to the Eighth Heaven was similar to a spiritual illusion, similar to the Heart Demon Tribulation and Mind Tribulation, but many times stronger than the latter.</p><p></p><p>However, the many supreme immortal kings present had experienced long years, and their mental strength, even without deliberate cultivation, was not weak. They could easily pass through.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had experienced a relatively short time, his mental willpower index had been tempered by the supreme physique, plus the nourishment of the vast inner world.</p><p></p><p>He was only stronger, not weaker, than the supreme immortal kings present.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily arrived at the Eighth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The environment here was similar to the Seventh Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was a faint mysterious aura emanating from the Ninth Heaven above.</p><p></p><p>Beyond man there is man, beyond heaven there is heaven, and above the Nine Heavens there are celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>This had been the legend about the Ninth Heaven in the Spirit Realm since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The so-called celestial beings, according to the speculation of many supreme immortal kings, might be an invincible powerhouse sitting in the Ninth Heaven overlooking the vast Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal kings of the prehistoric era and the Three Thousand Dao States era longed to enter the Ninth Heaven in order to gain guidance from that invincible powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Eighth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed extraordinary, different from the Seventh Heaven."</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal kings like Kaitianxian Wang and Taishangxian Wang also followed.</p><p></p><p>This was their first time ascending to the Eighth Heaven. In previous battles to ascend to heaven, they were all beaten back by Lingxu Xianwang.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the barriers of the previous eight heavens, the barrier of the Ninth Heaven faintly emitted a pale golden color. Even Lin Yuan was not confident in breaking it.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he was confident in tearing it apart, but it would take a lot of time, because the barriers between the Nine Heavens would quickly recover once damaged.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tearing speed had to be much faster than the recovery speed of the barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the entrance to the Ninth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind. After searching the soul of Lingxu Xianwang, he was very familiar with the Eighth Heaven and directly flew towards the entrance leading to the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of figures stood there.</p><p></p><p>These dozens of figures were the most powerful supreme immortal kings of the prehistoric era. Each of them had cultivated at least one kind of high-level creative power to the third level.</p><p></p><p>Most of them had mastered more than two kinds of high-level creative powers at the third level. Lingxu Xianwang had suppressed the supreme immortal kings of the Three Thousand Dao States era like Kaitianxian Wang to the point of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>But among this group of supreme immortal kings, they basically belonged to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>The prehistoric era had experienced a complete era, plus the long years experienced by the current Three Thousand Dao States. The number of supreme immortal kings was far more than the immature Three Thousand Dao States era, and they were also much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal kings like Kaitianxian Wang and Taishangxian Wang also followed behind Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So many powerhouses?"</p><p></p><p>Kaitianxian Wang felt a bit numb. Only now did they realize how ridiculous their battle to ascend to heaven was.</p><p></p><p>The many supreme immortal kings standing at the entrance of the Ninth Heaven, if a few of them came out, they could suppress their more than twenty supreme immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>Taishangxian Wang was also nervous at this moment. If Lin Yuan wasn't standing in front of them, they might have had the idea to flee.</p><p></p><p>The supreme immortal king leading the many prehistoric supreme immortal kings had a tall figure, his aura was chaotically mixed, and he stood at the forefront of all the immortal kings, clearly the leader among the strong supreme immortal kings of the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Immortal King."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>Having searched the soul of Lingxu Xianwang, Lin Yuan naturally knew that Chaos Immortal King was the strongest immortal king of the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Immortal King turned around and looked at Lin Yuan solemnly, "Lingxu has already told me."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, your strength far surpasses mine."</p><p></p><p>"Whatever Martial Ancestor wants, just say it directly, I will agree to everything."</p><p></p><p>Chaos Immortal King said frankly, as if taking the initiative to yield was not an embarrassing thing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was indeed so. Lingxu Xianwang had already shown the scene that happened in the Seventh Heaven to Chaos Immortal King and other supreme immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>Including Chaos Immortal King, all the supreme immortal kings of the prehistoric era admitted that they could not do what Martial Ancestor did.</p><p></p><p>Even in Chaos Immortal King's many deductions, even if all their supreme immortal kings joined forces, facing Martial Ancestor, they could only struggle to survive for a while before being defeated in the end.</p><p></p><p>Since he already knew the outcome, Chaos Immortal King naturally would not resist and took the initiative to admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took an extra look at Chaos Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>This was good, saving him some trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Split out your soul and let me search it." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't choose to search directly, which could be considered a response to Chaos Immortal King's active cooperation.</p><p></p><p>There was no significant difference between splitting out the soul to be searched by Lin Yuan and being directly suppressed by Lin Yuan before searching the soul, but it was much better in terms of face.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Chaos Immortal King split out a part of his soul without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This part of the soul contained all his memories. Lin Yuan only needed to search this soul to know everything he wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the partial soul of Chaos Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>The soul search was completed in a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a bit enlightened.</p><p></p><p>In Chaos Immortal King's memory, there was the reason for the end of the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the prehistoric era, a treasure fell from the Ninth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>That great battle caused the Spirit Realm to seemingly fall into doomsday, with immortal kings at the Tribulation Transcendence stage falling in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Chaos Immortal King, as the victor, obtained that treasure and entered the Eighth Heaven with his many subordinates.</p><p></p><p>After the prehistoric era.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm recovered through long years and gradually entered the next era.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Three Thousand Dao Realms Era.</p><p></p><p>Until today, the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era is only in its initial stages, not even comparable to one ten-thousandth of the time experienced in the Prehistoric Era.</p><p></p><p>"Give me the treasure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the Chaotic Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>In the Prehistoric Era, the Chaotic Immortal King was only one of the strongest.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few Supreme Immortal Kings comparable to him, who could make the Chaotic Immortal King risk fighting against equally powerful beings and start a battle at the Supreme Immortal King level.</p><p></p><p>That treasure was obviously crucial.</p><p></p><p>"This is the treasure."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King hesitated for a moment, then readily handed over the treasure.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan searched part of his soul and understood the treasure no less than him, so there was no need for any concealment.</p><p></p><p>The treasure the Chaotic Immortal King gave to Lin Yuan was an irregularly shaped stone, vaguely emitting mysterious power and filled with primordial aura.</p><p></p><p>"This stone contains the aura of some kind of creative power, which surpasses high-level creative power. As long as one can comprehend it, even if they can't take that step, they can still make great progress in the Supreme Immortal King realm."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King looked at the irregularly shaped stone in Lin Yuan's hand and explained in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, after so many years, I have never been able to comprehend it. Even when I was infinitely close to the Ninth Heaven, I still couldn't comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King's tone revealed a hint of inexplicable meaning.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious aura emanating from the Ninth Heaven was similar to the stone. The Chaotic Immortal King believed that being close to the Ninth Heaven for a long time would help in comprehending this stone.</p><p></p><p>But after so many years, the Chaotic Immortal King's comprehension of the stone had come to a standstill, and he had gained nothing from the mysterious creative power that surpassed high-level creative power.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he handed over the stone without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Because the Chaotic Immortal King felt that even if given another era or ten eras, he would still be almost unable to comprehend the creative power within that stone.</p><p></p><p>"A creative power that surpasses high-level creative power?" Lin Yuan carefully observed the irregularly shaped stone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan meticulously examined the irregularly shaped stone.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious origin, your grasp of its power is deepening.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious origin, your grasp of its power is deepening.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious origin, your grasp of its power is deepening.]</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious origin." Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>One thing was certain: the aura contained within this irregularly shaped stone indeed surpassed high-level creative power.</p><p></p><p>If it were any other high-level creative power, Lin Yuan would have gained some insight after observing it for a while. However, when facing this irregularly shaped stone, he still had no significant gains.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "no significant gains" here meant that the gains were too small to be perceived.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the irregularly shaped stone and looked up at the entrance to the Ninth Heaven in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the entrances of the previous eight heavens, the entrance to the Ninth Heaven was incomparably wide, as if welcoming the Supreme Immortal Kings to ascend.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, after searching the memories of the Chaotic Immortal King, Lin Yuan knew that the tribulation leading to the Ninth Heaven was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Inside the entrance to the Ninth Heaven, there were life imprints of the ten strongest Supreme Immortal Kings in the history of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, to enter the Ninth Heaven, one had to defeat the ten strongest Supreme Immortal Kings born in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Actually, calling them the ten strongest Supreme Immortal Kings was somewhat inaccurate.</p><p></p><p>They should be called the ten strongest lives.</p><p></p><p>Because perhaps some of the Supreme Immortal Kings had already taken half a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The Prehistoric Era, the Three Thousand Dao Realms Era.</p><p></p><p>These were just the two most recent eras.</p><p></p><p>Before these two eras, there were even more ancient eras.</p><p></p><p>No one knew when the Spirit Realm was born. Although the Supreme Immortal Kings coexisted with the Spirit Realm, it didn't mean they wouldn't die.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, at the end of the Prehistoric Era, a large number of Supreme Immortal Kings died.</p><p></p><p>"With Martial Ancestor's strength, he can definitely challenge the entrance to the Ninth Heaven." The Chaotic Immortal King said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He had tried to challenge it, but couldn't even defeat the life imprint of the first Supreme Immortal King. He was nearly crushed and barely managed to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Chaotic Immortal King. "No rush."</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan wouldn't underestimate the ten strongest lives in the history of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just one era or one epoch, but since the birth of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would indeed go and challenge the entrance to the Ninth Heaven, but not now. He would wait until his strength reached its peak before attempting it.</p><p></p><p>Although the current Lin Yuan surpassed the strongest immortal kings of an era like the Chaotic Immortal King, he was far from reaching his own limits.</p><p></p><p>The green liquid in the mysterious gourd could still be absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The eighth stage of the martial dao evolution system had not been fully developed.</p><p></p><p>The complete core space model had not been comprehended.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Taiji power had not reached the third level.</p><p></p><p>The other several high-level creative powers and numerous ordinary creative powers were only at the first level.</p><p></p><p>There was also the irregularly shaped stone obtained from the Chaotic Immortal King, which contained a mysterious creative power that surpassed high-level creative power.</p><p></p><p>Just because the Chaotic Immortal King couldn't comprehend it didn't mean Lin Yuan couldn't. It was just a matter of how much time it would take.</p><p></p><p>There was still a long way to go before reaching Lin Yuan's upper limit.</p><p></p><p>And this time, Lin Yuan's maximum stay was as long as nine hundred years, and only four hundred years had passed so far.</p><p></p><p>Before being clear about what accidents might occur when entering the entrance to the Ninth Heaven, Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't rashly go in.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King had challenged it before but quickly retreated because he was facing the first life imprint.</p><p></p><p>That's why he had the leeway to turn back.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't sure if he could still retreat after failing to challenge the deeper life imprints.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Lin Yuan naturally prioritized stability.</p><p></p><p>Other Supreme Immortal Kings yearned to ascend to the Ninth Heaven because they wanted to take that step.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no such desire. The main world had many ways to improve, and Lin Yuan had many directions to step into the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>What he needed to do now was to safely spend the remaining time of his stay and transform it into gains to bring back to the main world.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"All of you immortal kings, give me a strand of your creative power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the Chaotic Immortal King and the other Supreme Immortal Kings of the Prehistoric Era and ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Immortal King was stunned for a moment. Although he didn't know what Lin Yuan wanted to do with so much creative power, he didn't dare to ask too much and honestly separated a strand of the creative power he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the dozens of additional strands of creative power, among which there were even a few high-level creative powers he had never seen before. He was quite satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body and original self remained in front of the entrance leading to the Ninth Heaven and once again began to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years flowed by like water.</p>

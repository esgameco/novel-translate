        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Pinnacle Sovereign Experts' eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>During this period of entering the Treasure Land, the Pinnacle Sovereign Experts have been focused on searching for the core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>But in the meantime, they have all obtained some golden mist to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>These golden mists are connected to the entire Treasure Land, clearly being rare treasures nurtured by the Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>As a newly born Treasure Land, the rare treasures it has nurtured have never appeared in the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms before, so the effects and functions are also unknown to anyone, and can only be slowly explored.</p><p></p><p>"Those golden mists," Lin Yuan was also very concerned. His external cosmic realm could detailed investigate the minutiae within a range of over a billion miles, and he had collected quite a few of these golden mists.</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Sovereign solemnly warned, "The golden mists contain the primal forces of time. Do not try to contact them with your soul or mind, or you may be forced to experience a time loop."</p><p></p><p>The Pinnacle Sovereign Experts' realms were perfected, so a single thought could allow them to impact the 13th Realm, bringing about a time loop.</p><p></p><p>However, the Pinnacle Sovereign Experts have been suppressing the urge to impact the 13th Realm, which is why a time loop has not descended upon them.</p><p></p><p>But once they try to contact the golden mists with their mental will, even if the Pinnacle Sovereign Experts continue to suppress it, they will be forced to impact the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Time loop?" The Crimson Lotus Sovereign and other Pinnacle Sovereign Experts were filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>Although most Pinnacle Sovereign Experts ultimately plan to attempt impacting the 13th Ancestral Realm, that is only when they have reached the limit of their progress. </p><p></p><p>As for now, many Pinnacle Sovereign Experts still intend to wait a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened nearby, his heart stirring slightly. "Forced into a time loop in advance?"</p><p></p><p>The other Pinnacle Sovereign Experts would be drawn into a time loop by contacting the golden mists with their mental will because their realms were already perfected.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? His true realm was still the Sovereign Realm, far from the perfected Chaotic Realm and impacting the 13th Realm. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan contacting the golden mists with his mental will likely wouldn't trigger a time loop, since his realm had not reached that level.</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately I didn't try that back then." Lin Yuan thought to himself. While he didn't have to worry about being forced into a time loop prematurely, who knows what other hidden dangers might exist?</p><p></p><p>"As for how to use the golden mists, the best method so far is to slowly absorb them with the physical body," Crimson Flame Sovereign said. </p><p></p><p>"The golden mists will gradually transform the physical body, forming a certain time-type constitution."</p><p></p><p>This was the conclusion reached by the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom after numerous experiments, even causing one Sovereign to prematurely enter a time loop.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly absorb with the physical body? Can it transform into a time-type constitution?" The Pinnacle Sovereign Experts pondered, this effect seemed similar to the Infinite Crystals.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that the Infinite Divine Body refined from the Infinite Crystals mainly focused on containment, able to accommodate any other constitution. But the constitution transformed by the golden mists, they didn't know what effects it would have.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Crimson Flame Sovereign gave a few more reminders, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait a bit longer before absorbing those golden mists," Lin Yuan decided. </p><p></p><p>The golden mists he had collected were still there, he could absorb them whenever he wanted. He would first wait for the other Pinnacle Sovereign Experts to try it out, then decide how to best utilize them based on the effects.</p><p></p><p>And according to Crimson Flame Sovereign, the golden mists could only be slowly absorbed by the physical body, as for completely transforming into the corresponding constitution, no one knew how much golden mist would be required.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, on the Silver River Chaotic Continent, ever since the Silver River Sage had opened up the Chaotic Continent, experts from thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of void domains had been flocking here.</p><p></p><p>This was quite normal, the Silver River Sage's name resounded throughout the Chaotic Void, attracting a large number of Chaotic Realm Sovereign Experts, each with their own intentions.</p><p></p><p>Some simply wanted to witness the Silver River Sage. </p><p></p><p>Others planned to follow the Silver River Sage, and so on.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who, seeing the gathering of many Sovereign Experts on the Silver River Chaotic Continent, knowing they couldn't attract the Silver River Sage's attention, decided to establish good relations with the other Sovereign Experts.</p><p></p><p>"That is the Chaotic Continent opened up by the Silver River Sage," the white-haired old man in a silver spacecraft said to the few young men and women beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Sage?" The young men and women also looked at the distant Silver River Chaotic Continent: "Master, what's so special about this Silver River Sage that you've decided to move the sect here?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man was a Chaotic Realm peak Sovereign Expert, he had also once opened up his own Chaotic Continent and established a force to carry on his legacy.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man had followed several Chaotic Sages before, but ultimately left them, and now he planned to bring the elite of his entire sect to reside permanently on the Silver River Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Sage is no ordinary Chaotic Sage," the white-haired old man said with a smile. "In that posterior universe, the Silver River Sage has left the Blackstone Sage and the Savage Sage in a state of absolute crushing defeat. While the Silver River Sage may not be as powerful as the Peerless Sage, he is not far off."</p><p></p><p>"Not far off from the Peerless Sage?" The young men and women were shocked. Even with the same information, experts at different levels would draw different conclusions.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired old man clearly inferred from the intelligence that...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The True Power Limit of the Galactic Sage.</p><p></p><p>In the far distance of space-time, three figures stood silently.</p><p></p><p>These three figures, just by standing there, caused the chaotic Dao rules around them to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"That Galactic Sage, as the only one to have emerged alive from the Xuanhuang Universe, may have obtained some opportunities left behind by the Xuan Emperor," said the leading figure.</p><p></p><p>The three figures were all peerless great saints, and they were extremely ancient, aware of the existence of Emperor Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuan had forcibly broken free from the time loop and completely killed five peerless great saints, causing many hidden peerless great saints to feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>These were peerless great saints after all.</p><p></p><p>In the history of the chaotic void, it was rare for peerless great saints to fight each other, with one side perishing.</p><p></p><p>But in such a fall, only the main combat body would perish, while the corresponding peerless great saint would not die.</p><p></p><p>To completely kill a peerless great saint, to eliminate all their true bodies, avatars, and life-saving methods, was truly too difficult, even invincible great saints could not achieve it.</p><p></p><p>"This chaotic continent involves space-time depths that require at least a space-time nine-layer realm of comprehension to open up," said the great saint on the right at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time nine-layer realm of comprehension? Even if we are not peerless great saints, we cannot harm him," the great saint on the right said.</p><p></p><p>Existences capable of reaching the space-time nine-layer realm of comprehension at the chaotic great saint level were extremely rare and precious, even more so than peerless great saints.</p><p></p><p>Such chaotic great saints, even if they were still not the match of peerless great saints, could easily retreat unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the last peerless great saint nodded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the three peerless great saints had planned to find the Galactic Sage and inquire about the events that had occurred in the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Since they could not harm the other party, even if they went to inquire, they would certainly not get the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it," the leading peerless great saint carefully thought it over and made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Sage was just an ordinary chaotic great saint, they could naturally manipulate him.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Galactic Sage had the confidence to resist them, and the three peerless great saints did not want to make an enemy out of him blindly before they knew what opportunities the Xuan Emperor had left him.</p><p></p><p>If they guessed wrong and the Galactic Sage had not gained much opportunity, wouldn't that just mean they had an additional enemy?</p><p></p><p>Peerless great saints were extremely cautious when dealing with their peers, just like how Huanxiao Great Saint and Yulian Great Saint waited until Emperor Xuan broke through to the thirteenth level before launching a massive retaliation against the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," the three peerless great saints finally looked at the distant chaotic continent one last time before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"They're gone?" Lin Yuan glanced in the direction where the three peerless great saints had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>These three peerless great saints only knew that Lin Yuan's space-time comprehension had reached the nine-layer realm, but they were unaware of Lin Yuan's true combat power, which was considered strong even among peerless great saints.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's perception, he had sensed the three peerless great saints the moment they approached.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength has now been surpassed by the true body and avatar of the Source World," Lin Yuan thought to himself, as the true body and avatar in the Source World had formed the Blazing Sun Great Cycle, truly surpassing the true body and avatar in the chaotic void for the first time.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, the cultivation of the Source World's true body and avatar contained the complete inheritance of the Blazing Sun Ancestor, a thirteenth-level time life, as well as the fusion of the thirteenth-level inheritance of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But the true body and avatar in the chaotic void could not condense the Blazing Sun Seed, leading to a lack of corresponding improvement.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can cultivate the 'Infinite Void' to the third layer, the gap between the two true bodies and avatars will likely be narrowed or even eliminated," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Once the thirteenth-level inheritance 'Infinite Void' was cultivated to the third layer, it would definitely bring about a significant improvement for both the true bodies and avatars of the chaotic void and the Source World.</p><p></p><p>But the specific improvement range would naturally be greater for the true body and avatar of the chaotic void, as the internal universe of the chaotic void was far more profound than the Source World's true body and avatar.</p><p></p><p>Different starting points of the internal universe would naturally result in different levels of improvement after cultivating the third layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>"Or I can also break through to the chaotic realm," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>The difference in the foundation and profundity of the internal worlds would lead to different levels of improvement after breaking through to the chaotic realm. It was clear that the true body and avatar of the chaotic void would benefit more in this aspect compared to the Source World's true body and avatar.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it slowly. I still have a lot to improve," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other great saint-emperors who had reached their limits, Lin Yuan was still very far from his own limits.</p><p></p><p>Not only the 'Infinite Void' and breaking through to the chaotic realm, but also the evolution of the Chaotic Taiji Force, could all bring Lin Yuan significant improvements.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the many supreme secret techniques passed down by the Blazing Sun Ancestor, the thirteenth-level inheritances, were also yet to be cultivated and explored by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>And so, time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years later.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

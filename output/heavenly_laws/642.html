        <h1>Chapter 642</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Twelve Celestial Lords sent by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, Crimson Flame Celestial Lord would definitely prioritize the fight for the precious land.</p><p></p><p>He would not make a special effort to take care of Lin Yuan, and give up the opportunity to refine the 'core' of the precious land.</p><p></p><p>But in choices that don't matter much, he still plans to lean a bit towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the newly born Grade-One precious land?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked far into the winding mountain ranges, where the chaotic forces of time were revealed, hinting at a vast world.</p><p></p><p>Each Grade-One precious land is located in relatively opposing spatial-temporal realms. Only after the birth of the first batch of rare treasures will it connect with the outside world, which is known as the precious land's emergence.</p><p></p><p>"The 'core' of a Grade-One precious land is likely between one hundred to two hundred in number. These cores are fused with the precious land itself, making it very difficult to find them in a short time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself: "So among the Twelve Celestial Lords sent by the major ancient countries, at least a few are adept at searching for the 'core'."</p><p></p><p>Within the Twelve Supreme Celestial Lords of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the Eternal Sun Celestial Lord is skilled in search techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit, the other ancient country's Celestial Lords will arrive soon."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Celestial Lord glanced at a few distant locations, where the spatial-temporal fabric was slightly distorted, indicating the presence of Celestial Lords from other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the precious land, you all should disperse as much as possible to search for the 'core'. Once found, immediately notify me and Broad Flame."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Celestial Lord instructed. Discovering the precious land's 'core' is not the end, the most important part is refining and defending it, which requires great strength.</p><p></p><p>Broad Flame Celestial Lord's evolved Chaotic Dao path is unique, possessing thirty-three incarnations, each with strength close to the true body, making him the most suitable Celestial Lord to defend the precious land's 'core'.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Crimson Flame Celestial Lord sat down cross-legged, and the rest of the Celestial Lords did the same.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided his spiritual awareness, distantly observing the new precious land, while using the remaining mental energy to cultivate and comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Celestial Lords of the Great Spirit Ancient Country were also patiently waiting. Their leader was the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord, whose power was terrifying, being an extremely ancient Celestial Lord of the Great Spirit Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord's eyes were like two endless and profound prisons, gazing at the distant winding mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Force Dao path evolved by the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord lies in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Nether Spirit Celestial Lord's eyes are two worlds named the Nether Prison. Once trapped within, even Supreme Celestial Lords would be suppressed for a time.</p><p></p><p>"Nether Prison, how does it feel? Do you have confidence?" The Spiritual Sense Celestial Lord next to him asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's still too early to talk about confidence now." The Nether Spirit Celestial Lord shook his head, "The Celestial Lords of the Great Submersion Ancient Country have not arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>The Great Submersion Ancient Country is one of the Six Great Ancient Countries, but unlike the other five, it was the first ancient country to be born in this source world. The ancestor of the Great Submersion Ancient Country was also the first time life.</p><p></p><p>The Great Submersion Ancient Country has unfathomable foundations, with two of the Five Thirteen-Tier Ancestral Lords coming from it.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the Six Great Ancient Countries compete with each other, but in reality, the Great Submersion Ancient Country is the most transcendent.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Great Submersion Ancestor, it is also because the Celestial Lord-level experts of this ancient country are too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Both in terms of quantity and strength, they surpass the other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Submersion Ancient Country." The Spiritual Sense Celestial Lord also felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>He understood the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord's meaning. If the strongest Celestial Lords of the Great Submersion Ancient Country came, the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord would not have much confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Except for the Great Submersion Ancient Country, you should have no problem with the other four ancient countries, right?" The Spiritual Sense Celestial Lord continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"The other four ancient countries..."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Spirit Celestial Lord swept his gaze over the locations of the Celestial Lords from the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the Dark Yin Ancient Country, the Thunder Roar Ancient Country, and the Savage Wilderness Ancient Country, but did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Based on past battle records, the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord would naturally have confidence. </p><p></p><p>But in the fight for a Grade-One precious land, the major ancient countries will basically use some of their foundational killing techniques, which has no limit.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the Dark Yin Ancient Country...</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Supreme Celestial Lords silently observed the Celestial Lord-level experts of the other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Spirit Ancient Country has actually sent the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord? That is quite troublesome." The Secluded Yin Celestial Lord's gaze was grave, looking towards the location of the Great Spirit Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Among the top Supreme Celestial Lords of the major ancient countries, the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord is definitely the most difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord's killing power is particularly strong, but rather his pair of eyes that can trap Supreme Celestial Lord-level experts.</p><p></p><p>This kind of technique is not a big deal in normal times, as even if trapped, Supreme Celestial Lords can still break out, only wasting some time.</p><p></p><p>But inside the precious land, the ordinary refining of the precious land's 'core' requires precisely that bit of time.</p><p></p><p>Imagine a Supreme Celestial Lord, who has finally discovered a precious land's 'core', just about to refine it. </p><p></p><p>But then he is captured by the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord into the Nether Prison, and by the time he breaks out, the precious land's 'core' has already been completely refined.</p><p></p><p>The many Supreme Celestial Lords of the Great Spirit Ancient Country have also gathered here.</p><p></p><p>It would be extremely frustrating.</p><p></p><p>"The Nether Spirit Celestial Lord's two Nether Prisons are indeed troublesome, but it's not impossible to deal with. Even if he captures some, with the seventy or eighty Supreme Celestial Lords of the Six Great Ancient Countries, how many can he capture before being overwhelmed?" </p><p></p><p>The Earth Yin Celestial Lord spoke.</p><p></p><p>Among the Twelve Supreme Celestial Lords of the Dark Yin Ancient Country, four can be considered top-tier, including the Secluded Yin Celestial Lord, the Earth Yin Celestial Lord, and two others.</p><p></p><p>"We still need to pay more attention." </p><p></p><p>The Secluded Yin Celestial Lord said. No matter what, the Nether Spirit Celestial Lord is definitely one of the most difficult to deal with among the many top-tier Supreme Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>In the Thunder Roar Ancient Country...</p><p></p><p>As one of the Six Great Ancient Countries, the experts of the Thunder Roar Ancient Country are essentially born from thunder and lightning. The ancestor of the Thunder Roar is said to be the first life in this source world that attained enlightenment through thunder.</p><p></p><p>Later, he was taken as a disciple by the Great Submersion Ancestor, eventually crossing into the Thirteen Tiers and establishing the Thunder Roar Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"In this fight for the precious land, if possible, we should seize this precious land. If we can't, we'll secretly help the Great Submersion Ancient Country take it."</p><p></p><p>The top Supreme Celestial Lord of the Thunder Roar Ancient Country said.</p><p></p><p>The Great Submersion Ancient Country and the Thunder Roar Ancient Country have a close relationship. Although the Thunder Roar Ancestor broke away from the Great Submersion Ancient Country to establish the Thunder Roar Ancient Country, the roots between them have not been severed.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Celestial Lords of the Thunder Roar Ancient Country nodded.</p><p></p><p>The fight for the precious land is limited to two thousand years. After two thousand years, whoever has refined the most precious land 'cores' will gain the right to control the precious land.</p><p></p><p>If in the end, the Thunder Roar Ancient Country has refined too few precious land 'cores' and can't even make it into the top three, they will secretly transfer the precious land 'cores' to the Celestial Lords of the Great Submersion Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>This can be seen as a way to mitigate the losses, at least the Great Submersion Ancient Country won't just take the precious land 'cores' for no reason.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it's not just the Thunder Roar Ancient Country...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With this approach, once other ancient nations discover the 'core' of the treasure lands they have refined, they will have no chance of being the first to obtain it, and will sell the core of the treasure lands at various 'prices'.</p><p></p><p>However, the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation and the Great Submission Ancient Nation have a close relationship, so they will prioritize selling it to the Great Submission Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which Celestial Exalted Ones the Great Submission Ancient Nation will send this time?" The leading Celestial Exalted One of the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation swept his gaze around. Now the Celestial Exalted Ones of the five major ancient nations have all arrived, only the Great Submission Ancient Nation is left.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Twelve towering figures stood there, with the flow of time and space faintly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Among the six ancient nations, the Great Submission Ancient Nation has the most first-grade treasure lands."</p><p></p><p>The leading supreme peak Celestial Exalted One scanned the surroundings, "While our Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation occupies the least number of first-grade treasure lands, only about ten or so."</p><p></p><p>The first-grade treasure lands produce rare treasures that are of great use to the Celestial Exalted Ones. Occupying more first-grade treasure lands may not have a significant impact in the short term, but over a longer time frame, the impact would be substantial.</p><p></p><p>Why is it that the Celestial Exalted Ones of the Great Submission Ancient Nation are the strongest overall and the most numerous? Is it because of the Great Submission Ancestor? Except for the occurrence of some major event, the ancestors of the six major ancient nations rarely intervene.</p><p></p><p>The various inherited secret techniques and opportunities for possession have mostly been left behind by the ancient nation ancestors. As for the rest, there is not much difference.</p><p></p><p>The history of the Great Submission Ancient Nation is the oldest, so naturally, more Celestial Exalted Ones have been born there. This is indeed one aspect, but not the main reason.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Great Submission Ancient Nation is so prosperous is that it occupies the most treasure lands, especially the first-grade treasure lands. This newly born first-grade treasure land, the Great Submission Ancient Nation has occupied nearly a third of it.</p><p></p><p>Occupying so many first-grade treasure lands that are of great use to the Celestial Exalted Ones, it would be difficult for the Great Submission Ancient Nation not to be powerful.</p><p></p><p>"So--" </p><p></p><p>The leading supreme peak Celestial Exalted One of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation continued, "This newly born first-grade treasure land, the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation must obtain it."</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, in order to obtain new treasure lands, it is necessary to initiate a full-scale war with other ancient nations and conquer the regions where the first-grade treasure lands are located.</p><p></p><p>In this way, one can naturally gain control over the corresponding first-grade treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>But this is too difficult.</p><p></p><p>The full-scale wars between ancient nations can be both large and small.</p><p></p><p>On a small scale, it only requires the mobilization of a few Celestial Exalted One-level powerhouses, and a brief clash between the two sides would suffice, involving the gain or loss of only tens or hundreds of major domains.</p><p></p><p>But on a large scale, the full-scale war would be terrifying. One Celestial Exalted One after another, one supreme peak Celestial Exalted One after another, and even one top supreme peak Celestial Exalted One after another would join the battle, capable of shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Compared to such a full-scale war, the current competition for the newly born first-grade treasure land is much more moderate.</p><p></p><p>At least there is a time limit of two thousand years, and only twelve supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones from each ancient nation are involved.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial factor is that the competition for the first-grade treasure land not only depends on strength, but also on luck. If one's luck is good, they can easily find a large number of 'cores' of the treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>In addition to luck, financial capability is also important.</p><p></p><p>For example, if other ancient nations see that they have no hope of being the first to refine the 'core' of their treasure lands, they will 'sell off' the treasure land cores. At this time, as long as the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation can afford the price, they can completely buy them over.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation can afford the price, there is a good chance of seizing this first-grade treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if they can purchase the 'cores' of the treasure lands through financial means, they will still try to obtain as many 'cores' as possible, so as to minimize the cost.</p><p></p><p>Although the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation is eager for this newly born first-grade treasure land, they are not foolish either.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Just as the many supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the five ancient nations were patiently waiting to enter the treasure land, suddenly a spatial disturbance quickly spread, causing all the supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones to look towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" Lin Yuan also opened his eyes. The supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the five major ancient nations had all arrived, only the most mysterious Great Submission Ancient Nation was left.</p><p></p><p>The space seemed to ripple and spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Twelve figures emerged from the depths of space. Leading them was a man dressed in a dark robe, who stood there silently without emanating the slightest aura, yet he suppressed the eleven supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones behind him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this man in the dark robe was the center of this space, and the other existences were merely supporting actors, dependent on him for their existence.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful." Lin Yuan was inwardly shocked. This man in the dark robe gave him a similar feeling to the Lord of the Mysterious Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was not comparable to Emperor Xuan. The last time Lin Yuan saw Emperor Xuan, he had forcibly broken free from the time loop, equivalent to taking a half-step towards the Thirteenth Realm on the basis of the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The power of an Invincible Sage?" Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Blazing Yang Celestial Exalted One, the Vast Flame Celestial Exalted One, the Eternal Sun Celestial Exalted One, or the other top supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the other ancient nations, they were only approaching the level of an Invincible Sage. But this man in the dark robe was definitely an Invincible Sage.</p><p></p><p>Here, the term "Invincible Sage" refers to the Invincible Sage of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>As for in this source world? He should not yet be considered an Invincible Celestial Exalted One.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the nourishment of the many Thirteenth Realm ancestors, each major ancient nation must have produced more than one Invincible Sage-level Celestial Exalted One. Since there is more than one, he cannot be considered truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, my fellow Celestial Exalted Ones, the Great Submission Ancient Nation has arrived late. I hope you can forgive us." The man in the dark robe smiled slightly as he spoke to the other supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the five ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>His voice seemed to have a mysterious infectious power, causing the distant casual Great Exalted Ones who were cautiously observing to have a sense of their thoughts being distorted.</p><p></p><p>The supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation, the Dark Yin Ancient Nation, and others frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One?"</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One surpasses that of the top supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones. Is the Great Submission Ancient Nation so focused on this treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One was already preparing to break through to the next level? Why is he still here?"</p><p></p><p>The various top supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones immediately felt the pressure, especially the supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the Savage Wilderness Ancient Nation. They were determined to obtain the first-grade treasure land, but facing the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One?</p><p></p><p>Although they could ultimately pay the price to buy the 'cores' of the treasure lands refined by the other ancient nations, if the final gap in the number of treasure land 'cores' was too large - for example, the 'cores' of the other five ancient nations combined were still less than one of them - then this action would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to feel pressured." </p><p></p><p>The Blazing Yang Celestial Exalted One swept his gaze over the other supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, "The Profound Void Celestial Exalted One is indeed very strong, but we are not without a chance."</p><p></p><p>To compete for this first-grade treasure land, the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation had brought out some profound killing techniques that could withstand the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One also had similar methods, the other four ancient nations would not just watch as the Profound Void Celestial Exalted One wreaked havoc. They would be forced to unite and resist him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Yang Celestial Exalted One waited for a moment, then led Lin Yuan and the other supreme peak Celestial Exalted Ones towards the winding mountain range.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 312: The Fear of a Demigod (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the throne, deep in thought. For the past hundred years, he had intentionally allowed the Church of Desire to operate, after all, behind it stood the powerful Demigod of Desire.  </p><p></p><p>In theory, even if Lin Yuan removed all the Church of Desire's agents in Longshan City, it would be very difficult to provoke the Demigod of Desire to take action against him.</p><p></p><p>But one can never be too careful. </p><p></p><p>Anyway, with the members of the Church of Desire hiding in Longshan City, it wouldn't affect Lin Yuan at all. Compared to the situation when he was still "developing", Lin Yuan had never feared anyone before.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to deal with the Church of Desire," Lin Yuan decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was because of the grudges from his previous life as Longshan Yuan, or the little actions the Church of Desire had taken against the Longshan clan over the past hundred years, Lin Yuan had no reason to let the Church of Desire off the hook.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan lacked sufficient strength. When he recovered to the seventh level, he was worried that fighting the Demigod of Desire would cause too much commotion and attract the attention of the Church of Order.</p><p></p><p>But now, at least in the human realm, Lin Yuan was invincible. Even the divine incarnations of the twenty-four main gods would pale in comparison before him.</p><p></p><p>Underground in Anpu City.</p><p></p><p>This was a luxurious palace where groups of beautiful women clad in sheer robes strolled about.  </p><p></p><p>A short, stout man followed behind one of the groups, his immense spiritual perception taking in every detail within the palace.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the largest base recently established by the Church of Desire," said the short, stout man, who was naturally Lin Yuan's sun spirit avatar.</p><p></p><p>With his martial arts spirit avatar able to take on myriad forms, Lin Yuan had simply transformed into this appearance to come here.</p><p></p><p>To deal with the mere Church of Desire, there was no need for his true self to make an appearance.</p><p></p><p>"The Church of Desire seems to have done quite well for itself over the past hundred years," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the demigod behind the Church of Desire was not a true god, she still possessed some abilities related to "desire" that could make people feel intoxicated with lust.</p><p></p><p>With such abilities, the Church of Desire had successfully "controlled" some of the upper echelons of Anpu City as well as core members of several surrounding baronies over the years.</p><p></p><p>The group Lin Yuan was following consisted of some of the younger generation from Anpu City who had come here to indulge in pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"If the demigod behind the Church of Desire could condense faith and ascend to a divine throne, becoming an eternal celestial in the heavens, then all the desire produced by humans would become the source of her faith."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. For example, the War God, one of the twelve main gods of the Dark Abyss, grew stronger as war and conflict raged more fiercely in the human realm, the source of his faith.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the War God constantly tried to instigate all kinds of wars among humans. In contrast, the twelve main gods of the Ocean of Light tended to be more peaceful, with the God of Order striving to maintain order in the human realm, directly opposing the War God.</p><p></p><p>The distinction between the gods of the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss was not based on good and evil, but rather the type of authority and faith they presided over.</p><p></p><p>The demigod behind the Church of Desire advocated indulging desire, thus leaning towards the Dark Abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, whether gods from the Ocean of Light or the Dark Abyss, the foundation of their existence lay in the faith of living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed young masters, I will now take you inside to experience true bliss. I will ask each of you for your identity and name," said a woman who appeared gentle and frail, easily evoking a man's protective instincts.</p><p></p><p>The young scions of Anpu City lined up ahead of Lin Yuan all nodded in agreement. Some among them were already impatient, clearly not their first time visiting.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the gentle and frail woman approached Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This young master..." The gentle woman gave Lin Yuan a careful look, her expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>As the person in charge of the Church of Desire, she basically knew all the young masters of Anpu City. Asking for their identities was just a formality.</p><p></p><p>But now? The gentle woman realized she did not recognize this short, stout man at all.</p><p></p><p>With such a unique appearance and build, if she had met him before, she would definitely have a deep impression. It was impossible for her to be so unfamiliar with him.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, who are you exactly, and what brings you here?" The gentle woman grew wary, though her expression remained unchanged as she tried to keep Lin Yuan calm.</p><p></p><p>The screening process to enter the underground palace was extremely strict. One could not simply follow the crowd to get in.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's sudden appearance here must not be a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for you to know who I am," Lin Yuan grinned, revealing his white teeth. "As for why I'm here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan paused for a moment before calmly stating, "I'm here to kill your god!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the gentle woman's head exploded first. Centered on Lin Yuan, within a radius of several hundred miles, the heads of all the beautiful women in the luxurious underground palace burst open.</p><p></p><p>The young scions of Anpu City and members of surrounding baronies who had come to indulge also met the same fate.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire underground luxurious palace was devoid of life, including twelve fourth-level knights and even four fifth-level great knights, all dead.</p><p></p><p>"Only the deepest part remains," Lin Yuan did not stop, continuing towards the depths of the palace.</p><p></p><p>There was a special divine force there, resisting the enveloping of Lin Yuan's illusory world.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength, even as just a spirit avatar, a mere seventh-level demigod would be no match for him.</p><p></p><p>However, if Lin Yuan unleashed too great a power, it would be detected by the Goddess of the Divine Web.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of the Divine Web was one of the twenty-four main gods, at the ninth level peak, nearing the tenth level of power. Before recovering to his own peak, Lin Yuan was unwilling to attract the attention of such a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the Goddess of the Divine Web became aware, the other twenty-three main gods would surely know as well.</p><p></p><p>Although the twenty-four main gods of this realm were divided into the Ocean of Light and Dark Abyss factions, they all stood on the side of the gods and could completely join forces if necessary.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest hall, the divine envoy and several high priests of the Church of Desire had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The young son of the lord of Anpu City has been completely controlled by us. Once we deal with the other heirs, the entire Anpu City will become our church's playground."</p><p></p><p>"The fifth heir of Baron Qingluan is also under our control. In at most two hundred years, the five million square mile territory of Baron Qingluan will also belong to our church."</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred years ago, those mad dogs from the Church of Order drove us out from the most prosperous imperial capital to this place. One day, we will kill our way back. My god will ascend to the divine throne and become an eternal celestial in the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>The several high priests of the Church of Desire spoke with enthusiasm. They each had the strength of sixth-level legendary knights, the core forces of the church.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, as the Church of Desire took root in Anpu City and its influence grew, the high priests had witnessed it all.</p><p></p><p>Although Anpu City was far from as prosperous as the imperial capital with its many believers, it was much safer.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital under the domain of the Church of Order, the Church of Desire was like a street rat, one careless move and...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>They would be surrounded and annihilated. </p><p></p><p>However, Anpu City was much safer. As long as they were careful here and didn't take direct action, it would be difficult to draw the attention of the Order Church.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that we failed to take Dragon Ridge a hundred years ago. Otherwise, Anpu City and many surrounding territories would now belong to our Church of Desire," sighed a bishop.</p><p></p><p>When the Church of Desire fled to Anpu City, their initial target was Dragon Ridge. </p><p></p><p>The Church of Desire went to great lengths to control the fourth heir of the Dragon Family. If they could have gotten rid of the Dragon Lord at that time by making him die unexpectedly, in a few decades at most, they could have controlled all of Dragon Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Then, with the power of Dragon Ridge radiating outwards, the other subordinate baronies and Anpu City would have been unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately...</p><p></p><p>That profligate son Dragon Lord was unreasonable and suddenly became a knight genius of the Dragon Family instead, causing the Church of Desire's early investment to be completely wasted with no return.</p><p></p><p>If not for that Dragon Lord obstructing their divine steps, with the Church of Desire's ability to stir up storms even in the imperial capital, how could it have taken nearly two hundred years without fully controlling Anpu City?</p><p></p><p>"That Dragon Lord blocked our divine path. He should die. When our divine light shines on Dragon Ridge, I will make sure he cannot live nor die," said a bishop.</p><p></p><p>The priestess standing under the divine statue glanced at the bishops below but said nothing more. She also despised that Dragon Lord for delaying the church's precious development time.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the main hall suddenly began to shake violently. Streaks of pink divine power surged, trying to protect the people inside. However, under the pressure of an unknown force, all the pink divine power began rapidly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"My divine force field is automatically activating?"</p><p>"Were we just attacked?"</p><p></p><p>The bishops turned pale with shock, and even the normally calm priestess looked incredulous.</p><p></p><p>This main hall was the core of the Church of Desire, a place blessed by the Divine Mother of Desire. Even if attacked by a group of demigods, it should have been able to withstand them for a short time.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother of Desire was unquestionably powerful, even among other demigods.</p><p></p><p>But now, in just an instant, sixty percent of the pink divine force had evaporated - it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"All the church's followers are dead?"</p><p></p><p>The priestess in a black veil seemed to sense something, her expression changing again.</p><p></p><p>As the church's priestess, she could feel the life force fluctuations of all members, even perceiving the faith power they produced.</p><p></p><p>So when everyone in the luxurious palace died at Lin Yuan's mere thought, she immediately sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>The priestess looked utterly baffled. There were over a hundred thousand followers in the luxurious palace, including many fourth and fifth-level knights. Even if surrounded by the Order Church, they should have died one by one, not all instantly at the same time like this.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the door to the main hall suddenly blasted open. A short, fat man slowly walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The bishops glared at Lin Yuan in shock and anger, but in the next instant, their heads exploded without the slightest forewarning. Even legendary sixth-level experts had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>"Respected demigod, may I ask what brings you here?" The priestess in the black veil steadied herself and respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>To be able to so easily kill his way in and slay sixth-level legendary bishops like chickens, he had to be at least a demigod of the same level as the Divine Mother of Desire.</p><p></p><p>And not just any demigod, but one equally powerful as the Divine Mother herself. The main gods of the Ocean of Light and Abyss of Darkness would need to manifest divine avatars to suppress such a being.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your church's god?" Lin Yuan glanced around and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>He had taken action this time to eliminate the hidden threat of the Church of Desire. To make the church completely perish, he had to kill the Divine Mother of Desire behind it.</p><p></p><p>If the Divine Mother didn't die, the Church could always be rebuilt.</p><p></p><p>"I do not know my god's whereabouts," the priestess in the black veil hesitated slightly before continuing, "But if you wish to meet her, I can contact her for you."</p><p></p><p>"No need." Lin Yuan looked at the priestess, his mind stirring, and her head exploded as well.</p><p></p><p>"Causality."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly as he locked onto the Divine Mother's approximate location by tracing the profound threads of causality.</p><p></p><p>By annihilating the Church of Desire and killing so many of the Divine Mother's faithful followers, even though he had never directly dealt with her, a causal connection had formed between them.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this thread of causality, Lin Yuan could vaguely sense the Divine Mother's location.</p><p></p><p>Billions of miles away from the Realm of Million Nations, a woman in a pink dress was hurrying towards it when she suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>This woman was the Divine Mother of Desire. As a demigod-level expert, unless surrounded by a main god's divine avatar, she could act without fear.</p><p></p><p>"My painstakingly accumulated faithful followers..." The Divine Mother's heart bled at the loss of those incredibly devout followers, which were not easy to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>She could feel that the church's base in Anpu City had essentially been wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see who dared to do this."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother received the final visions of her dying followers by tracing the connection of faith.</p><p></p><p>This was an ability that came with establishing a connection of faith - gods had access to everything of their followers, easily viewing memories and more.</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Mother quickly reviewed the memories of her dying followers over just a few breaths, her brow furrowed. They hadn't even seen their enemy before dying.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother immediately checked the priestess's final memory.</p><p></p><p>To become the Church of Desire's priestess, one had to resonate extremely closely with the Divine Mother, potentially even serving as her avatar incarnation when needed.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother watched the priestess's memory footage. She saw the core hall shaking and her expression turned grave.</p><p></p><p>To be able to shake the core hall she had established required the power of another formidable demigod.</p><p></p><p>Finally, through the priestess's perspective, a short, fat man entered.</p><p></p><p>After he questioned the priestess and killed the sixth-level bishops, the priestess died as well when he turned to her.</p><p></p><p>"This way of attacking..."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother's eyes widened as she saw the fat man's method through the priestess's view, the dead sixth-level bishops, and the priestess's death.</p><p></p><p>"The power of the Divine Realm!"</p><p>"This is the power of the Divine Realm!"</p><p>"This person is not a demigod, but a true god!"</p><p>"No, true gods cannot descend to the mortal realm. He is a main god? One who oversees all living beings and gods?"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mother was scared out of her wits and immediately turned to flee in the opposite direction from the Realm of Million Nations.</p>

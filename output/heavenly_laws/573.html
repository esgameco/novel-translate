        <h1>Chapter 573</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The boundless and endless chaotic energy surged and rolled towards the depths.</p><p></p><p>Under the desperate driving of the black-bearded man at the peak of the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>The silver ship was struggling against the overwhelming current, like a lone boat on the vast ocean, about to capsize amidst the swirling chaos.</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man was sweating profusely, and as time passed, he faintly sensed a terrifying suction force, as if a giant beast was about to swallow them.</p><p></p><p>The fellow disciples beside him finally sensed the gravity of the situation and were trembling in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, hold on."</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man took a deep breath and unhesitatingly began to burn the primal source of the universe within him.</p><p></p><p>For a Twelfth-Realm expert, the universe within them is the foundation of their being. Burning the primal source of the universe is equivalent to burning their own foundation.</p><p></p><p>While this would grant a significant boost in power, the consequences were unimaginable, leading to irreversible hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, the black-bearded man had no choice.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that if they couldn't resist the omnipresent suction force, the outcome would be far worse than burning the primal source of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>The array formations inside the silver ship were operating at full capacity.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, the black-bearded man finally sensed that the suction force around them was gradually diminishing.</p><p></p><p>"Have we broken free?"</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man's breathing was unstable, but his expression was one of ecstatic joy as he frantically increased the driving force of the silver ship.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the silver ship stabilized, escaping the terrifying suction.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long he had been fighting so desperately, but the scene he had just experienced made him feel as if he had returned to the time when he was still a Sixth-Realm being, witnessing a Mastery Realm Ancestor in his sect.</p><p></p><p>No, the emotions he was experiencing now were far more shocking and desperate than back then.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, is it safe now?"</p><p></p><p>The fellow disciples in the Breakthrough Realm cautiously approached and asked.</p><p></p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, it should be safe."</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man pondered for a moment, his tone not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if that terrifying suction force would suddenly reappear and intensify? But based on the current situation, they had more or less escaped the danger.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the black-bearded man's words, the fellow disciples immediately felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what was that suction force?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I felt like my soul and spirit were about to be sucked away."</p><p></p><p>The fellow disciples immediately inquired, still trembling inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man shook his head. "Probably some Chaotic Realm-level extraordinary life form, devouring and exhaling?"</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man had seen Chaotic Realm Ancestors before, as the strongest in his faction were Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>But even Ancestors couldn't possibly suck in all the chaotic energy within millions or billions of light-years of the Chaotic Void, could they? Only those extraordinary life forms born from the Chaotic Void, with innate talents and abilities, could have caused such a scene.</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary life form?"</p><p>"Chaotic Realm level?"</p><p></p><p>The fellow disciples swallowed hard. Extraordinary life forms were already powerful, often able to overwhelm their peers. Those with special bloodlines could even contend with Mastery Realm Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Realm extraordinary life forms? Such existences, ordinary Chaotic Realm Ancestors probably wouldn't dare to provoke.</p><p></p><p>"We're lucky that Chaotic Realm extraordinary life form didn't pay attention to us."</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man's tone carried a sense of relief. From the moment he sensed the suction force to finally breaking free, he hadn't encountered any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>This was the key to their escape.</p><p></p><p>"We're too weak. In the eyes of that Chaotic Realm extraordinary life form, we're probably no different from the drifting chaotic energy around, so it didn't bother with us."</p><p></p><p>The black-bearded man sighed slightly. Sometimes being weak could be a blessing?</p><p></p><p>In the center of the surging chaotic energy, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, completely unleashing his true form.</p><p></p><p>His body size exceeded millions of light-years, and with each inhalation and exhalation, he absorbed massive amounts of chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally entered the Mastery Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Mastery Realm was a transformation and elevation of his fundamental nature, naturally requiring a colossal amount of energy to support it.</p><p></p><p>And in this Chaotic Void, the most abundant resource was chaotic energy. Although the chaotic energy permeating the Chaotic Void was not pure, even Breakthrough Realm and Mastery Realm beings found it difficult to directly absorb.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. He had long since mastered the method of directly absorbing chaotic energy, and with his accumulated foundation, he could forcefully absorb even the most impure chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>Impure or pure, at their core, they were all energy.</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the changes within him.</p><p></p><p>The most significant change after entering the Mastery Realm was, of course, his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"My inner universe has now exceeded a hundred billion light-years in diameter." Lin Yuan felt a sense of joy.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Breakthrough Realm, Lin Yuan's inner universe had reached the ultimate, spanning only about 33 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>Now, it had directly reached a hundred billion light-years? The diameter had increased by over three hundred times.</p><p></p><p>As for the volumetric growth, it was far beyond just three hundred times.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred billion light-year inner universe is only the size when I first entered the Mastery Realm. It will continue to expand rapidly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, his inner universe at the peak of the Mastery Realm would reach the range of several hundred billion light-years.</p><p></p><p>"The inner universe of a normal Chaotic Realm Ancestor is only in the range of several hundred billion light-years in diameter. When my Mastery Realm reaches its limit, my inner universe will be able to rival the Chaotic Realm Ancestors'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>This comparison was based on the size of the inner universe. In reality, after the refinement of the "Infinite Void" legacy, Lin Yuan's inner universe, even when only a few million light-years in diameter, was already comparable to the hundred-billion-light-year inner universe of a Chaotic Realm Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's inner universe expands to the range of hundreds of billions of light-years, even if a Chaotic Realm Ancestor's life realm is higher than his, they would be overwhelmed by the terrifying foundation and potential of his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the inner universe is not determined solely by its size. Diamond and carbon have the same constituent particles, but their hardness differs vastly.</p><p></p><p>"If I enter the Chaotic Realm, won't my inner universe reach the scale of trillions, tens of trillions, or even hundreds of trillions of light-years in diameter?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded. After all, the naturally born universes nurtured in the Chaotic Void are only around a trillion light-years in diameter.</p><p></p><p>And once Lin Yuan enters the Chaotic Realm, his inner universe would surpass the size of the naturally born universes?</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but exclaim, and at the same time, he thought of the "Infinite Void" legacy.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the reason Lin Yuan's inner universe had reached such a high level was due to multiple factors, such as the three infusions of Chaotic Void Primal Source, the suppression of the Chaotic Tree, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But the most crucial factor was still this "Infinite Void" legacy from the Jade Gourd.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was the legacy left behind by the Thirteenth-Realm Time Life, specifically created to enhance the foundation of living beings.</p><p></p><p>"The creator of the Jade Gourd, that Thirteenth-Realm Time Life, left behind not only the 'Infinite Void' legacy for the foundation, but also other legacies for the flesh, soul, and will."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recalled the words of the red-robed girl, and his expression became somewhat pensive.</p><p></p><p>Just the "Infinite Void" legacy alone had brought him such a tremendous boost. If he were to cultivate all the legacies left behind by that Thirteenth-Realm Time Life, what kind of monstrous being would he become?</p><p></p><p>"I'm already lucky enough to obtain the 'Infinite Void'. To think about the other Thirteenth-Realm legacies would be a bit too greedy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It's not like all the good things in the world would fall into his lap.</p><p></p><p>"But now, with my current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to assess himself. Having just entered the Mastery Realm, his fundamental nature had undergone a transformation and metamorphosis. His inner universe, flesh, and soul had all experienced a massive surge.</p><p></p><p>This had directly elevated his strength to near the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if, upon reaching the pinnacle of the Mastery Realm, I can become invincible among the Ancestors, and even rival those Chaotic Realm Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although Ancestors and Great Saints both belong to the Chaotic Realm, their combat prowess differs greatly.</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle between the Demon Great Saint and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint, with just the aftershocks, had already...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One made the decision to move the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen at a glance.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's potential lies here. If he can truly grow to the limit of the Sovereign Realm, and cultivate various techniques to the extreme, the second or even the third layer of the "Infinite Void"? Even if he still cannot directly contend with the Great Saints, the gap will not be too large.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure shrank at an extremely fast speed, then swept his eyes around.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through, he devoured the chaotic qi from all directions, causing quite a stir, which had already attracted the attention of some Chaotic Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>These Chaotic Venerable Ones could not accurately gauge Lin Yuan's strength, so they did not immediately try to probe him, but lingered in the far distance.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure directly disappeared, without the intention of contacting other Chaotic Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Left?"</p><p></p><p>"Who was it exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"A miraculous life form? Or a peak Chaotic Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The wills of the Chaotic Venerable Ones probed from afar, exchanging with each other. The scene of the massive devouring of chaotic qi that had just occurred had shocked the Venerable Ones of the surrounding void domains.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not felt the aura emanating from the other party, the disturbance in the surrounding chaotic qi alone made many Venerable Ones feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he doesn't want to see us."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's all go back."</p><p></p><p>Many Chaotic Venerable Ones felt a bit regretful. Having cultivated to the Chaotic Venerable Realm, they had naturally long passed the stage of fighting and killing.</p><p></p><p>For Chaotic Venerable Ones, befriending a powerful Venerable One is absolutely beneficial without any harm. The existence that had just devoured the vast chaotic qi obviously belonged to the realm of powerful Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable One also projected a consciousness, although the existence that had devoured the endless chaotic qi did not reveal the slightest bit of aura, and even its causality was obscured.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancient Ming Venerable One vaguely felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>The Star Tear 'Shard World'.</p><p></p><p>The Exalted Ones like Xuanyuan the Strongest and Xia Qin the Strongest had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they were chatting well with the Galactic Exalted One, but Lin Yuan's incarnation directly dissipated, leaving only the words "I have something important to do."</p><p></p><p>This made the several Exalted Ones couldn't help but feel a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>Something important?</p><p></p><p>What important matter could human civilization have now? Just then.</p><p></p><p>The Star Tear 'Shard World' trembled slightly, and Lin Yuan's figure appeared in front of the Exalted Ones like Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One Xuan asked concernedly.</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One Xia Qin standing beside him had a slightly changing expression.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Sovereign Realm through the Dao, after all, it was an improvement in realm. Lin Yuan, being cautious, directly dispersed most of his incarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic, why do I feel..."</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One Xuanyuan carefully observed Lin Yuan, becoming increasingly shocked, and finally couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan tried his best to conceal his own aura, Xuanyuan the Exalted One still vaguely sensed the changes in Lin Yuan before and after.</p><p></p><p>That sense of pressure brought about by the leap in the level of life and the qualitative change in strength made Xuanyuan the Exalted One feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"I just went to break through."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hide it and said directly.</p><p></p><p>The nine Exalted Ones of human civilization, Lin Yuan still considered them trustworthy, and would not hide many things from them.</p><p></p><p>"Break through?"</p><p></p><p>"Galactic, you broke through?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin the Exalted One was overjoyed. Lin Yuan is now the pillar of human civilization, and his status is even higher than the nine Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>The stronger Lin Yuan's strength, the stronger human civilization will be.</p><p></p><p>"Break through? Galactic, have you already entered the Sovereign Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Exalted One said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>They had entered the Twelfth Realm much earlier than Lin Yuan, but in such a short time, Lin Yuan had completely surpassed them and entered the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>This superiority is simply in terms of realm.</p><p></p><p>As for combat power? Xuanyuan the Exalted One and the others suspected that even before Lin Yuan entered the Twelfth Realm, his combat power had already surpassed some of the Exalted Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic, how strong are you now?"</p><p></p><p>The Exalted One Feather Butterfly was a little curious, and the other Exalted Ones were also very curious.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, when Lin Yuan first entered the Twelfth Realm of the Dao, the Exalted Ones had also asked this question.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan's answer was that he was comparable to the peak of the Dao Realm within the universe, and comparable to the Sovereign Realm outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has directly entered the Sovereign Realm, what level of strength has he really reached?</p><p></p><p>"It's about the Chaotic Realm, I suppose."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The several Exalted Ones took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Although they had guessed before asking, the Exalted Ones could not help but tremble when they heard Lin Yuan admit it in person.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic Realm? That is the Chaotic Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Chaotic Void, the Chaotic Venerable Ones are high above, like the 'Shard World' they are in now, which is a small corner of the Chaotic Continent opened up by the Ancient Ming Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>"Does our human civilization also have a Venerable One now?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Exalted One's eyes flickered slightly, and the other Exalted Ones were about the same.</p><p></p><p>The implication of Lin Yuan's words was no less than when the human civilization, during its dormant period in the universe, finally gave birth to the first Exalted One.</p><p></p><p>No, the former is far more significant than the latter.</p><p></p><p>This is a Chaotic Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what Xuanyuan the Exalted One and the others didn't know was that when Lin Yuan said "about the Chaotic Realm," he meant about the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary Chaotic Realm and the peak of the Chaotic Realm are two different concepts. Although the gap is not as large as that between Venerable Ones and Great Saints, the peak of the Chaotic Realm is far superior to the ordinary Chaotic Realm in terms of influence and power.</p><p></p><p>This is the strength of Lin Yuan's newly attained Sovereign Realm. In the future, with the passage of time, Lin Yuan's strength will continue to soar.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with the several Exalted Ones for a while, Lin Yuan began a new round of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Having entered the Sovereign Realm, I can now cultivate the second layer of the 'Infinite Void'." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Dao Realm, due to the low essence of his life, even with the suppression of the Chaotic Tree, he was unable to cultivate the second layer of the "Infinite Void". Now there is no such need.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Memories of the second layer of the Thirteenth Realm inheritance of this technique flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>With the current strength of the universe within Lin Yuan's body, once he cultivates the second layer of the "Infinite Void", the universe within him will reach a level close to that of the Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Great Saints of the Chaotic Void have evolved their own unique power path from the Chaos, and their enhancement of the internal universe is extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks emanating from the slightest movements of a Chaotic Great Saint are enough to severely injure ordinary Chaotic Venerable Ones. What they contain is not only the comprehension of the rules, but also the towering magnitude that surpasses the Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Gourd trembled slightly, and the figure of the red-robed girl solidified. She looked around, her expression slightly amazed.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteenth Realm root inheritance "Infinite Void" can indeed greatly enhance the internal universe of a being, but Lin Yuan's level is far beyond the red-robed girl's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's internal universe has reached this level, with the "Infinite Void" being the main reason, but there are many other reasons driving it.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe there is a possibility of reaching the Seventh Layer?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>The "Infinite Void" has a total of seven layers, and the Seventh Layer is merely a theoretical realm. Once cultivated, the internal universe will be transformed into a colossal entity comparable to an entire Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Ancient Ming Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable One's brow furrowed slightly, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Ming, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth walked out from the side, asking with a slight puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>As the companion of the Ancient Ming Venerable One, the black-robed youth rarely saw the Ancient Ming Venerable One in such a state.</p><p></p><p>"Just now..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable One briefly described the recent events.</p><p></p><p>A certain existence, suspected to be at the peak of the Chaotic Realm or a Chaotic Realm miraculous life form, had carried out a scene of devouring that affected tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of light-years in the surrounding void domains.</p><p></p><p>"To devour such a large range of chaotic qi, it must either be at the peak of the Chaotic Realm, or a Chaotic Realm miraculous life form."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth also made the same judgment.</p><p></p><p>"But this has nothing to do with us, and I haven't 'foreseen' any danger recently."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed youth was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that the existence who devoured the vast chaotic qi..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Venerable One took a deep breath and said solemnly, "is that 'Galactic'."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

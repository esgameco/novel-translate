            <p>Chapter 309: The Hope of the Longshan Family (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The old man's name was Longshan Zhu, who had already been a fourth-level knight for many years and was part of the foundation of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>How many fourth-level knights were there in the entire Longshan Ridge?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the personal request of Viscount Longshan this time, given Longshan Zhu's status, it would be impossible for him to give special treatment to a junior member of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>However, Longshan Zhu never expected that the matter he originally planned to casually deal with would turn out to be so dreamy and unbelievable, to the point that he still felt a bit dazed and needed to constantly check if he was dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan noticed Longshan Zhu's silence and vaguely sensed that something was wrong. "Could it be that Ayuan is really a piece of rotten wood?"</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan's tone was a bit disappointed. The Longshan family had an extraordinary bloodline and practiced the orthodox Longshan Cultivation Method. </p><p></p><p>With the guidance of a senior like Longshan Zhu, even if Longshan Yuan was incompetent, it shouldn't be too difficult for him to sense the Qihai within a month.</p><p></p><p>"Rotten wood?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Viscount Longshan say this, Longshan Zhu was slightly stunned and quickly explained, "Patriarch, Young Master Yuan is not a rotten wood. He, he has already sensed the Qihai."</p><p></p><p>"Not a rotten wood."</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan had just breathed a sigh of relief, but immediately widened his eyes. "What did you say? He has already sensed the Qihai?"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Longshan Cultivation Method or other knight cultivation methods, the first step was to sense the Qihai.</p><p></p><p>This was also the prerequisite for becoming a first-level knight. Any creature that sensed the Qihai could use its power to transform themselves and then choose a suitable knight cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>But sensing the Qihai was very difficult, and it was also a test of a knight's aptitude.</p><p></p><p>The time the Longshan family prepared for its members to sense the Qihai was one month. </p><p></p><p>As long as one sensed the Qihai within this month, they would have the hope of becoming a formal knight and receive the nurturing of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>How long had it been since Longshan Zhu went to guide Longshan Yuan?</p><p></p><p>One hour? </p><p></p><p>Or two hours?</p><p></p><p>"You mean, Ayuan sensed the Qihai within two hours?" Viscount Longshan's voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Longshan family, since the first generation viscount took over Longshan Ridge, only three people were able to sense the Qihai within two hours.</p><p></p><p>Among these three, two eventually became fifth-level great knights, leaving a deep mark in the history of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>The remaining one unfortunately fell midway.</p><p></p><p>The Longshan family did not have a fifth-level great knight presiding over every generation. For example, the strongest in the current generation of Longshan Ridge was only at the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Even the empire would bestow rewards again to congratulate the Longshan family for giving birth to another great knight.</p><p></p><p>So many honors and benefits were all due to a fifth-level great knight.</p><p></p><p>"Sensing the Qihai within two hours." Longshan Zhu fell into silence again.</p><p></p><p>If it were really like this, he would undoubtedly be overjoyed at this moment, instead of being at a loss for words and feeling a hint of trepidation like he was now.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, the time it took for Young Master Yuan to sense the Qihai... was two breaths." Longshan Zhu composed himself and said with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Longshan Zhu wasn't sure if it was exactly two breaths. He only remembered that Longshan Yuan took a glance at the Longshan Cultivation Method and then said he sensed the Qihai.</p><p></p><p>If Longshan Zhu hadn't truly and honestly sensed the Qihai fluctuations in Longshan Yuan's body, he probably would have planned to reprimand him.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say... two breaths?" Viscount Longshan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>If it was said that sensing the Qihai within two hours, he could still barely understand it, but two breaths?</p><p></p><p>Two breaths weren't even enough time to calm down, yet he sensed the Qihai?</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan took a deep breath and stood up, asking in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Although based on his understanding of Longshan Zhu, he knew that this old man of the Longshan family never liked to joke around, especially when it came to important family matters, and would never conceal or deceive.</p><p></p><p>But sensing the Qihai in two breaths was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure."</p><p></p><p>Longshan Zhu said with utmost certainty.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that Longshan Yuan's Qihai was sensed after seeing him and reading that Longshan Cultivation Method book.</p><p></p><p>"Sensing the Qihai in two breaths... is my Longshan family really going to soar?" After the shock, Viscount Longshan was ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Qihai in two hours meant the hope of becoming a fifth-level great knight.</p><p></p><p>Then what about sensing it in two breaths? A sixth-level legendary knight? Or a seventh-level demigod?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that on the Wanguo Plateau, as long as a seventh-level demigod didn't secretly spread their faith, they could join any empire and be endlessly glorified. Even the deities residing in the Sea of Light would cast approving gazes.</p><p></p><p>A seventh-level demigod, as long as they were willing, could make a deal with the deities of the Sea of Light and completely open up another empire.</p><p></p><p>"Who else knows about this?"</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan's eyes suddenly became deep.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Zhu also understood the seriousness of the matter and said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding viscounty territories and even more distant forces would allow the Longshan family to give birth to a future quasi-great knight who sensed the Qihai in two hours.</p><p></p><p>But sensing it within two breaths? Once this matter was leaked, it would not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Viscount Longshan could be certain that the empire would definitely intervene. By then, Longshan Yuan might be forcibly conscripted to the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the speed at which Ayuan sensed the Qihai is not two breaths, but five hours."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Viscount Longshan solemnly said to Longshan Zhu.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Qihai in two hours, this was the aptitude of a future quasi-great knight. Viscount Longshan still felt it was a bit too eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>Five hours, just right. It meant having the aptitude to become a fourth-level knight and wouldn't attract too much attention from other forces.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Longshan Zhu immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>He understood that this was an unprecedented opportunity for the Longshan family. As long as they patiently waited for Longshan Yuan to grow up, it would be the moment for the Longshan family to soar.</p><p></p><p>"Ayuan is the hope of my Longshan family. Absolutely no one is allowed to threaten Ayuan," Viscount Longshan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan walked out of the Longshan family's underground cultivation field, he vaguely felt that there were gazes watching him.</p><p></p><p>"They sent people to protect me?" Lin Yuan knew.</p><p></p><p>He displayed part of his talent in order to obtain the Longshan family's unreserved tilt of resources, so as to be more efficient in the upcoming cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was also Lin Yuan's experience from his past eight times crossing</p><p></p><p>The excerpt you provided seems to be incomplete, as it ends abruptly in the middle of a sentence. However, I will translate the available text to the best of my ability.</p><p></p><p>Translation:</p><p></p><p>... the accumulated experience, as for whether it will cause the Dragon Mountain family's jealousy?</p><p></p><p>Long Shan Yuan is a pure-blooded member of the Dragon Mountain clan and is also the third-ranked successor. The stronger his talent, the better for the Dragon Mountain family.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùíîùíâùíñùíô.ùíÑùíêùíé</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan's displayed talent has already been very restrained, merely instantly sensing the Qi sea, which is nothing.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three to four-meter-tall Da Shan strode over.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Not long after sensing the Qi sea, Long Shan Zhu returned again, repeatedly urging him not to expose the true speed of sensing the Qi sea.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally knew the intention behind this urging and agreeably consented.</p><p></p><p>"Sensing the Qi sea in just five hours, Young Master, your knight aptitude must be very high," Da Shan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it took him nearly a day to sense the Qi sea.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Da Shan immediately lowered his body, allowing Lin Yuan to sit on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Da Shan's height exceeded three meters, like a small giant, and Lin Yuan sitting on his shoulders felt not the slightest bit out of place.</p><p></p><p>"The starry sky is truly beautiful," Da Shan said while running and looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was already nighttime, and one after another, vast and profound "stars" appeared. Even across layers of time and space, one could feel the terrifying power emanating from them.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, very beautiful," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a lot of information about the "stars" above the sky appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The lives in this world, after cultivating to the level of a half-god at the seventh rank, need to condense faith, finally raise their divine kingdoms, and enter the Ocean of Light or the Abyss of Darkness.</p><p></p><p>Why is it called "raising the divine kingdom"?</p><p></p><p>It is because the divine kingdoms of the gods will ascend to the sky, transforming into eternal "stars."</p><p></p><p>In other words, each "star" Lin Yuan saw at this moment was the divine kingdom of a certain god. The more powerful the god, the more terrifying the corresponding "star."</p><p></p><p>The "star" represented by the twenty-four main gods was even more vast and mighty, with a terrifying aura shaking more than half of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan at this moment, observing those twenty-four stars from an infinitely far distance made his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Through sensing the star divine kingdoms of the main gods, Lin Yuan vaguely felt the true strength of the main gods.</p><p></p><p>Each main god was no weaker than the special ninth-rank beings like Hun Yi, and even if they were still some distance away from the tenth rank, it was not too far.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation system of this world actually places the inner world outside. However, in this way, the inner world completely relies on the main world, and its growth speed will inevitably be very fast."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The inner world is the foundation of eighth-rank lives. Placing it outside? Too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>But this also makes the inner world produce a sense of isolation from the main world, unable to fully borrow the power of the main universe to grow. That's why the ninth-rank evolutionaries painstakingly open up layers upon layers of space.</p><p></p><p>As much as possible to increase the thickness and depth of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a bad cultivation system," Lin Yuan nodded. Placing the inner world outside has many benefits, such as accelerating the growth of the inner world, reducing the burden on oneself, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the drawbacks are also obvious. If the enemy directly attacks the stars above the sky, wouldn't they be able to directly strike at the gods' weaknesses?</p><p></p><p>Whether it is the divine kingdoms of the gods or the inner worlds of eighth-rank lives, they are the foundation and core. Once they collapse, it will have immeasurable impact.</p><p></p><p>"Da Shan, do you think those stars will fall?" Lin Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Fall?"</p><p></p><p>"Stars?"</p><p></p><p>Da Shan widened his eyes, somewhat unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Each star represents a god. The falling of a star signifies the demise of the corresponding god.</p><p></p><p>But in Da Shan's perception, gods are eternal, residing in the Ocean of Light and looking down upon the living beings of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Gods, how could they fall?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, how could stars fall?" Da Shan said.</p><p></p><p>He had never thought about this matter. Since his birth, he had been watching the numerous stars above the sky, and they had not changed for so many years.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under Da Shan's mad dash, Lin Yuan arrived home.</p><p></p><p>His parents had been waiting for a long time, apparently having received the news in advance.</p><p></p><p>In this world, among the twenty-four main gods of the Ocean of Light, there is a main god named the "Web" goddess. The magic web constructed by her divine power spreads throughout the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Any information can be transmitted through the "Web," which is very convenient.</p><p></p><p>"My son, your knight cultivation aptitude is actually stronger than mine. As expected of my son from the Dragon Mountain Fang, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Qi sea in five hours, definitely the seed of a future fourth-rank knight.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Dragon Mountain Ridge, the number of fourth-rank knights does not exceed twenty. Each fourth-rank knight is the foundation of the Dragon Mountain family and the strongest means used to deter other viscount territories.</p><p></p><p>"You still have the face to say he's stronger than you?" The woman beside him, who looked like a young lady, couldn't help but say, "I remember back then when you sensed the Qi sea, it took you a full half a month."</p><p></p><p>"Just say if he's stronger than me or not," Long Shan Fang said without any concern.</p><p></p><p>A little stronger is stronger.</p><p></p><p>A hundred times stronger is also stronger.</p><p></p><p>If it were other clansmen who sensed the Qi sea in five hours, Long Shan Fang would probably make a few sarcastic remarks, but this was his own son.</p><p></p><p>Long Shan Fang's heart was filled with only pride.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few words with his parents, Lin Yuan returned to the cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>"So many Dragon Mountain Fruits?" Lin Yuan looked at the dozens of fruits that had been placed there long ago.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Fruit is a kind of spiritual fruit produced in the Dragon Mountain Ridge. It contains a large amount of energy and can assist knights in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was sensing the Qi sea earlier, Long Shan Zhu had also brought a spiritual fruit, intending to let him swallow it when he sensed the Qi sea fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the vast energy contained in the Dragon Mountain Fruit, one can better lock onto the Qi sea fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>The energy contained in the Dragon Mountain Fruit is not only vast but also very gentle. Even if it cannot be absorbed, it can remain dormant in the flesh and blood, slowly absorbing it when it can be absorbed in the future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore‚Äî</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Fruits are very precious. Ordinary clansmen can only get one per month, and that's based on having the talent for knight cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yet, there were dozens of Dragon Mountain Fruits placed in Lin Yuan's cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the Dragon Mountain family's clansmen have never seen so many Dragon Mountain Fruits in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>"I can't cultivate for now," Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, casually picked up a Dragon Mountain Fruit, swallowed it, and felt the gentle power flowing through his body.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan needs to do most at present is to make up for the original Long Shan Yuan's deficiency in essential energy caused by his indulgence in women over the years.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 629</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as the initial fusion and devouring began, Lin Yuan could feel his inner universe starting to sublimate and transform.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In the center of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The power of the golden leaves of the void formed a small tree about half a meter tall.</p><p></p><p>The small tree looked extremely fragile, and compared to the majestic and massive Chaos Tree beside it, it was exceptionally inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>But it was this small tree that made the Chaos Tree tremble and shudder, and the scattered Chaos Qi did not dare to approach this small tree at all.</p><p></p><p>"Void Divine Tree?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the small tree, and it resembled the Void Divine Tree of the mysterious realm by about 60-70%.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference was the size, as the true Void Divine Tree would have a single leaf the size of a vast void domain.</p><p></p><p>More than ten root source objects entered and merged into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes and felt the changes before and after.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred billion light-years in range."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the size of his inner universe, which was the most intuitive change. </p><p></p><p>In addition, the inner universe had also greatly increased in its depth and thickness of foundation.</p><p></p><p>This enhancement was at the fundamental level, and it would evolve in sync with the future transformation of Lin Yuan's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I still can't defeat the Great Saint of Chaos, with the two Peerless Great Saints attacking me, I can now retreat unharmed." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan faced great pressure from the two Peerless Great Saints. Even if he exerted his full power and detonated his outer universe, he could not escape.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>With the nine-layered time-space realm and the transformation of his inner universe, Lin Yuan may not be on par with the true Peerless Great Saints, but he is not far off.</p><p></p><p>The main advantage is the inner universe, which has brought Lin Yuan such a huge boost that even though he is inferior in other aspects compared to the Peerless Great Saints, he has managed to significantly narrow the gap.</p><p></p><p>"With my current foundation, as long as I enter the Chaos Realm, I may directly reach the Invincible Great Saint level?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Before the fusion of the many root source objects, he estimated that after entering the Chaos Realm, his combat power might approach that of the Invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>But the more than ten root source objects have indeed greatly enhanced Lin Yuan's own foundation.</p><p></p><p>According to his current solid strength, once Lin Yuan enters the Chaos Realm, with another round of transformation and leap, possessing the power of the Invincible Great Saint would not be a strange thing.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Realm should not be far away."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, crossing into the Chaos Realm holds no difficulty for him, he just needs to wait for his physical body, spiritual body, and inner universe to grow to the limit.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite conditions for breaking through to the Chaos Realm, Lin Yuan had already completed most of them during the Dao Splitting Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure flashed and appeared in the void filled with Chaos Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint, where do you plan to open the Chaos Continent?" Elder Gu Ming also followed and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Right here." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze around and spoke.</p><p></p><p>There were no other Chaos Continents nearby, making this area suitable for him to open his own Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Good." </p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming nodded, then carefully said, "Great Saint, during the opening of the Chaos Continent, will you allow other Sages to observe?"</p><p></p><p>The opening of the Chaos Continent would not be a short process, and during this time, it would cause a large amount of Chaos Qi to gather and space-time fluctuations, which would inevitably attract the attention of nearby Sages.</p><p></p><p>Especially with Lin Yuan's mastery of space-time, the Chaos Continent he opened would definitely create disturbances far beyond normal Chaos Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone can." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He didn't mind other Chaos Sages watching him open the Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>As long as they don't interfere, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming nodded.</p><p></p><p>The opening of the Chaos Continent would involve many mysteries and essences of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Observing a Chaos Sage opening a Chaos Continent would be of great benefit to many newly promoted Sages.</p><p></p><p>Even in the eyes of some veteran and experienced Sages, watching others open a Chaos Continent can also have a certain inspiring effect.</p><p></p><p>This is the case for normal Chaos Sages, let alone a Chaos Great Saint like Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming didn't need to think about it, there would definitely be a large number of Sages and even Great Saints gathering to observe.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan took a step forward, standing in the center of the boundless Chaos Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the vast Chaos void, and a certain impulse arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Opening the Chaos Continent is a summary of one's own understanding of the rules. The Chaos Continent opened can also serve as one's own stronghold."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Almost all Sages, except for the newly promoted ones, would open a Chaos Continent, because the space-time rules and the Dao in the Chaos Continent opened by the Sage would be influenced by their own.</p><p></p><p>For example, Elder Gu Ming's strength in his own Chaos Continent is much stronger than other Chaos Sages at the same level, and he can instantly borrow the space-time of the entire Chaos Continent for his own use.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming's Chaos Continent is dozens of times larger than a normal natural universe, and even peak Sages are unwilling to venture deep into his Chaos Continent and fight with him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to open the Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sound echoed.</p><p></p><p>The massive spatial-temporal fluctuations began to sweep in all directions.</p><p></p><p>To open up the Chaotic Continent required the consumption of a large amount of resources, but with Lin Yuan's current wealth, he naturally did not lack these.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan continued to open up the Chaotic Continent, the spatial-temporal fluctuations surged like tidal waves.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Chaotic Sovereigns of dozens, hundreds, and thousands of void domains all became aware of this.</p><p></p><p>"This spatial-temporal fluctuation..."</p><p></p><p>"Is it opening up the Chaotic Continent?"</p><p></p><p>"Why is the spatial-temporal fluctuation caused by the opening of the Chaotic Continent so vast?"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereigns were shocked in their hearts. Even though they were Chaotic Sovereigns, in the face of this vast spatial-temporal fluctuation, they felt as insignificant as tiny ants.</p><p></p><p>"It must be a Great Saint, at least a Chaotic Great Saint, who is opening the Chaotic Continent."</p><p></p><p>A Chaotic Sovereign immediately realized that mobilizing such a massive spatial-temporal force was something that even peak Sovereigns could not possibly achieve. </p><p></p><p>It had to be a Chaotic Great Saint, and an exceptionally powerful one at that, to be able to do this.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen a certain powerful Great Saint open the Chaotic Continent before, but I have never felt such a sensation."</p><p></p><p>A Sovereign was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how they thought about it, upon sensing this spatial-temporal fluctuation caused by the opening of the Chaotic Continent, almost all the Sovereigns set out to approach the source.</p><p></p><p>What a joke, the Chaotic Continent that was opened by harnessing such spatial-temporal forces - as ordinary Sovereigns, if they could carefully observe it, it would definitely be a rare and great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It was suitable to approach it as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Saint's mastery of space-time should have reached the Ninth Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>As the first to approach closely, the Ancient Ming Sovereign had the deepest feelings about the spatial-temporal fluctuations caused by Lin Yuan's opening of the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Realm of space-time?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Sovereign trembled in his heart. This was a realm that only peerless Great Saints could reach.</p><p></p><p>Only by advancing their path of Chaotic Evolutionary Power to a certain height and depth could they promote further improvement in their understanding of space-time, reaching the Ninth Realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>As for a Chaotic Great Saint reaching the Ninth Realm of space-time? It was not impossible, but it was too rare and scarce.</p><p></p><p>At least the Ancient Ming Sovereign had never heard of any Chaotic Great Saint whose understanding of space-time had reached the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Sovereign's expression suddenly changed as he sensed several Chaotic Sovereigns cautiously approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Sovereign ignored them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not mind being observed by other Sovereigns during the opening of the Chaotic Continent, and the Ancient Ming Sovereign naturally would not interfere.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Saint is too benevolent."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Ming Sovereign sighed inwardly, as this was essentially equivalent to giving away opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived, the location of the Chaotic Continent's opening is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, the spatial-temporal fluctuation is so massive?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Realm of space-time, it must be a Great Saint whose understanding of space-time has reached the Ninth Realm who is opening the Chaotic Continent."</p><p></p><p>The arriving Chaotic Sovereigns were shocked. They had originally thought it was just an ordinary Chaotic Great Saint opening the Continent, but they never expected this Great Saint's attainment in space-time to have reached the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a certain peerless Great Saint opening the Chaotic Continent?"</p><p></p><p>A Sovereign swallowed hard, this was too rare.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, there were too few peerless Great Saints, and secondly, with the strength of a peerless Great Saint, even if they wanted to open a Continent, it would be a post-Heavenly Universe, not the Chaotic Continent? Unless they had a special purpose, a peerless Great Saint would not specifically open the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galactic Great Saint, the one opening the Chaotic Continent is the Galactic Great Saint!"</p><p></p><p>A Chaotic Sovereign with special methods could faintly see the majestic figure in the center of the spatial-temporal fluctuation, opening the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Great Saint from outside that post-Heavenly Universe?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder this Galactic Great Saint could easily subdue eight Chaotic Great Saints, it's because of his attainment in the Ninth Realm of space-time."</p><p></p><p>Many Chaotic Sovereigns spoke with emotion. Although the Galactic Great Saint was not a peerless Great Saint, for Chaotic Great Saints, there was little difference between him and a peerless Great Saint. Even powerful Great Saints could be easily subdued by him.</p><p></p><p>The main combat bodies of Chaotic Great Saints like the Obsidian Great Saint and the Fierce Barbarian Great Saint were still in the hands of the Galactic Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>These Chaotic Great Saints were now borrowing Chaotic Stones from all over, trying to redeem their main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Great Saint is too strong, the pressure he gives me..."</p><p></p><p>A Chaotic Sovereign's voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>They did not feel this way when watching the images of the Galactic Great Saint's battles outside the Yanhuan Universe, and even offered some comments.</p><p></p><p>But now, when they actually faced the Galactic Great Saint, even though they were watching from a distance, they felt a pressure as if the void was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>It took Lin Yuan several years to initially open the Chaotic Continent, during which his understanding of space-time had been constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>Opening the Chaotic Continent was a process of applying space-time and other rules in an alternative way, different from just fighting, but more inclined towards creation, which gave Lin Yuan deep insights.</p><p></p><p>"It's about done."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Chaotic Continent he had opened and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the vastly distant boundless void. </p><p></p><p>The numerous observing outer devils were almost convinced they were seeing an illusion.</p><p></p><p>From their perspective, the powerful devil lords like the Black Devil Lord were about to attack the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>And thenâ€”</p><p></p><p>They disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This "disappeared without a trace" meant they completely vanished, without even the slightest trace of their aura remaining.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did the Black Devil Lord and the others go?" </p><p></p><p>"How did they just disappear?"</p><p></p><p>At first, some outer devils instinctively raised questions.</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, more and more outer devils realized.</p><p></p><p>The four devil lords like the Black Devil Lord were either completely suppressed or had perished.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not have disappeared so abruptly without any warning.</p><p></p><p>This conjecture made all the outer devils' hairs stand on end.</p><p></p><p>When 'Devil Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' were defeated in the Azure World, they could still make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' had its physical body annihilated and directly suppressed, while 'Devil Eye' managed to escape with half its body before a giant hand stretched out from within the Azure World and dragged it back.</p><p></p><p>But the four powerful devil lords like the Black Devil Lord?</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>None of the outer devils could make sense of what exactly transpired.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, compared to the two devil lords 'Devil Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles',</p><p></p><p>No one knew just how much more powerful the four devil lords like the Black Devil Lord were. Yet the latter disappeared so silently, without even a ripple, sending chills down the other outer devils' spines.</p><p></p><p>Within the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Countless martial cultivators were celebrating the Martial Ancestor saving the world. </p><p></p><p>Under the Martial Palace's propaganda, all living beings in this world knew that the ones who resolved the 'Devil Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' crisis were the Martial Ancestors they had worshipped for tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What the living beings of the Azure World did not know was that just now, four existences far surpassing the previous two devil lords - the Black Devil Lord and the other three - were also casually dealt with by the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The entire process did not cause any commotion.</p><p></p><p>The four powerful devil lords like the Black Devil Lord who dominated this region did not even have the ability to struggle in defiance before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was carefully comprehending every detail of the divine ability 'World' he had just manifested.</p><p></p><p>"In that instant, the divine ability's imprint took my fleshly body as the foundation and communicated with all directions, forcibly transforming the entire boundless void into my world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt somewhat shaken in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unlike secret arts, manifesting divine abilities did not require comprehension. Lin Yuan only needed to activate the imprint symbolizing the 'World' divine ability within his body.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could comprehend the imprint of the 'World' divine ability, it would be equivalent to transforming this divine ability into a secret art form that he could understand, allowing him to bring it to the main universe and use it on his true primordial spirit body.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that every time I manifest the 'World' divine ability, my understanding of this divine ability's imprint deepens, bringing me one step closer to comprehending it thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>Directly observing the 'World' divine ability's imprint to comprehend it was indeed possible with Lin Yuan's heavenly comprehension, but actively manifesting this divine ability and observing the changes it brought to the surrounding heaven and earth would clearly allow him to gain insights faster.</p><p></p><p>"Manifesting the 'World' divine ability once consumes a great deal of my strength. With my current power, I can probably manifest it once every two days without affecting my overall strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the power from self-detonation is too immense, otherwise I could try it out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt some regret.</p><p></p><p>Although his current inner world did not receive the enhancements from the mysterious gourd or the primordial chaos void immersion,</p><p></p><p>Even a self-detonation would release an extremely terrifying force.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves alone could pierce through the Azure World. If Lin Yuan wanted to try manifesting his outer world, he would have to choose an area far away from the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I can expend a strand of void-crossing primal power to summon the mysterious gourd and enhance the strength of this fleshly body's inner world and physique."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what it would feel like to manifest the 'World' divine ability with an inner world spanning over two billion miles in radius, condensing an outer world.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to remember something and sent his consciousness into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The Black Devil Lord and the other three outer devil lords had already been completely suppressed. Their massive bodies shrank to just a few meters in size as they slumbered in a corner.</p><p></p><p>"Four devil lords approaching the tenth rank have great research value."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, most of the Black Devil Lord and the other three outer devil lords' bodies disintegrated into primal power and were devoured and absorbed by his inner world.</p><p></p><p>To study the outer devil lords, he only needed to study their core parts.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>As their bodies disintegrated,</p><p></p><p>The treasures the four devil lords carried on them scattered out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually inspected them. The Black Devil Lord, as the dominant devil lord of this region, did not disappoint - the treasures he carried were all extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>Powerful weapons?</p><p></p><p>Rare metals.  </p><p></p><p>Precious spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>The other three devil lords also had considerable wealth, just slightly less than the Black Devil Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although bringing these treasures back to the main universe would require expending void-crossing primal power, Lin Yuan could easily circumvent that by converting them into primordial power and fusing them into his primal spirit bell to indirectly bring them to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>As for this Martial Ancestor's golden body he currently possessed, unlike the fleshly bodies he had traversed before, Lin Yuan did not plan to convert it into primordial power to fuse into his primal spirit bell.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English, without summarizing:</p><p></p><p>Entering the primordial source realm.</p><p></p><p>The Azure World had already become Lin Yuan's backyard realm. Descending there only required one-third of a strand of realm-crossing origin force, equivalent to Lin Yuan being able to descend anytime he wished.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, Lin Yuan needed a physical body to be prepared at all times, to avoid having to go through the stage of recovering his strength after each descent. </p><p></p><p>For example, this time descending to the Azure World, from descent to recovering to the tenth level of martial dao, Lin Yuan only took less than four days.</p><p></p><p>If this were traversing other worlds? It would at least take decades or hundreds of years to calculate.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>The four extraterrestrial demon gods' accumulation over millions and tens of millions of years, even if most of it was used on themselves, the remaining treasures were still immense.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly took stock. The previous spoils obtained from suppressing the 'Devil's Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles', paled in comparison to what he had now.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this special metal, similar to the 'Solar Gold Crystal' of the main universe. Such a large piece, containing the power of solar true fire, is estimated to be as much as tens of thousands of stars. Even in human civilization, it would be considered an eleventh-rank wonder."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his right hand, and a fist-sized red crystal nucleus appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This crystal nucleus looked small, but it was the result of Lin Yuan using spatial rules to compress it. If not compressed, its size would probably exceed millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"The dimension where the Boundless Void exists and the dimension where the Chaos Void exists do not belong to the same dimension. The treasures between them also differ in value."</p><p></p><p>"This solar gold nucleus, in the main universe its formation conditions are extremely harsh, requiring billions of years of gestation before it can take shape. But in this Boundless Void?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention different dimensions, even in the same dimension but different universes, there would be many differences in the gestation conditions of resources.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of gestation for a certain resource would also differ in different universes.</p><p></p><p>It would be even more so between dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Boundless Void dimension or the Chaos Void dimension, although not in the same dimension, they were overall in the same type of dimension - a three-dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>So the various rules that Lin Yuan comprehended could still be used.</p><p></p><p>If it were in a lower dimension, such as a two-dimensional space, he would fall into the situation of the "white paper" two-dimensional world in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>It might even be more cruel than the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world was a near-perfect product of life exploring lower-dimensional spaces, merely an imitation created of lower dimensions. It must have subtle differences from a true lower dimension.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly took stock of the spoils. Just from killing four demon gods nearing the tenth level, the abundance of spoils gave Lin Yuan the illusion of having killed the true body of an eleventh-level expert.</p><p></p><p>One should know that in the main universe, to completely kill an eleventh-level expert was extremely difficult. Those eleventh-level experts, which one didn't have their true body hiding in an absolutely safe place?</p><p></p><p>As for their avatars? They wouldn't carry overly precious treasures. Even if killed, the gains wouldn't be huge.</p><p></p><p>As for fusing an avatar into an extremely powerful weapon like the Four Divine Kings, that was too rare an occurrence. It was a trump card prepared by the Stellar Grand Union, meant to wreak havoc on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>And who could kill the Four Divine Kings wielding weapons suited to their extreme power, unless the ultimate existences took action themselves?</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish.</p><p></p><p>One treasure after another was categorized by Lin Yuan, whether to absorb and devour them now or later, they were all arranged in their proper places.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards a 'diagram'.</p><p></p><p>This diagram should be a scroll, hovering in mid-air, appearing utterly ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But an object collected by the four demon gods, how could it be an ordinary item? Moreover, this scroll made Lin Yuan unable to see through to its essence.</p><p></p><p>"Even the power of the world cannot penetrate it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was astonished. Lin Yuan usually judged a treasure by having the power of the world penetrate it, then using that power to evaluate its value.</p><p></p><p>This was the simplest method.</p><p></p><p>But now, the power of the world was unable to penetrate into the scroll in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Unable to penetrate, naturally unable to evaluate its value within.</p><p></p><p>"This scroll comes from the Black Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly as he carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the hovering scroll in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind."</p><p></p><p>"I'll just soul search directly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan summoned the Black Demon Lord's soul and began searching it.</p><p></p><p>"This scroll was coincidentally obtained by the Black Demon Lord. It's the 'key' to a void secret realm. Fusing one's consciousness into it, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Demon Lord's memories, there was no scene of fusing his consciousness into the scroll.</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities for this situation.</p><p></p><p>One was that the Black Demon Lord actively erased that memory segment himself.</p><p></p><p>But this possibility was very low. The Black Demon Lord didn't know he would end up in Lin Yuan's hands, so he wouldn't have any prior knowledge to erase his memories.</p><p></p><p>The second was that the scroll could not exist in memories.</p><p></p><p>Only the person themselves would know, and outsiders searching their soul would not be able to see it.</p><p></p><p>Some core secret legacies of human civilization used this method to prevent being known by other races.</p><p></p><p>"I'll fuse my consciousness into it and take a look myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan repeatedly confirmed that although he could not see the scene of the Black Demon Lord fusing his consciousness into the scroll, in the Black Demon Lord's memories there was no rejection towards doing so.</p><p></p><p>There was even some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>This meant there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fused his consciousness into the scroll.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly entering a space within.</p>

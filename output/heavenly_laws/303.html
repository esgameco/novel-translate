            <p>Chapter 303: The Shaking of the Gate of Myriad Realms (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Where is the enemy?" </p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was a bit dazed. The huge figure behind him was stirring up layers upon layers of space with such a massive body size, how could it not be seen?</p><p></p><p>The chase between Xi Lan and the huge figure did not conceal their aura. Even at a great distance and in different spatial layers, it could still be sensed.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Xi Lan was worried about variables appearing.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, the 'Maduo' practitioner chasing me has immense strength, close to the Nine Stages Millions Realm. Even if we join hands, we won't be able to contend against him," Xi Lan said quickly.</p><p></p><p>The only reason Xi Lan had been able to escape from the 'Maduo' practitioner's grasp until now was entirely due to his unique evolutionary path and mastery of a secret escape technique. </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not have that.</p><p></p><p>Once targeted by the 'Maduo' practitioner, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, do not approach us under any circumstances," Xi Lan reminded again.</p><p></p><p>Although news had spread five years ago that Lin Yuan had killed three 'Olifen' alien powerhouses, 'Olifens' were merely Nine Stages Ten Thousand Realm experts who could only open up just over twenty thousand spatial layers. They were not at all on the same level as the 'Maduo' practitioner who had opened up over nine hundred thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, come towards my direction," Lin Yuan transmitted through the black disc.</p><p></p><p>"He's asking me to go over?" Xi Lan immediately reacted. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not failed to see the ferocious 'Maduo' practitioner, but had his own confidence.</p><p></p><p>Although Xi Lan did not know what Lin Yuan had to contend against the 'Maduo' practitioner who was close to the Millions Realm, based on the time he had spent with the Galaxy Star Lord, Xi Lan was clear about the Galaxy Star Lord's character - he was definitely not an arrogant evolver.</p><p></p><p>Since the Galaxy Star Lord told him to come over, he must have the assurance to deal with the 'Maduo' practitioner.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Xi Lan did not hesitate and began changing directions to approach Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, while this 'Maduo' practitioner was not paying attention, I took a treasure he had been guarding for a long time," Xi Lan explained the whole story as he approached Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The 'Maduo' practitioner was the offspring of a tyrannical ancient god from the depths of the cosmic void. That ancient god did not participate in the wars between cosmic races, and the 'Maduo' practitioner also did not have much enmity with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The 'Maduo' practitioner had been chasing Xi Lan for so long purely because Xi Lan had angered him. </p><p></p><p>And that treasure was indeed not simple. Even if it was not on par with a ten-star rare treasure, it was not far off.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xi Lan successfully rendezvoused. </p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the huge 'Maduo' practitioner also caught up.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord!" The 'Maduo' practitioner quickly recognized Lin Yuan. There was no helping it, the Galaxy Star Lord was too dazzling and famous, even supreme experts had heard of him.</p><p></p><p>"Maduo practitioner." Lin Yuan's tone was calm. "The Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm has countless opportunities. With the time you spent chasing, you could probably find the next place of opportunity already."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Galaxy Star Lord showing such favoritism to your clansman?" The 'Maduo' practitioner was furious in his heart. "It's just that if that treasure is not handed over today, even if it's for the Galaxy Star Lord's sake, I won't give face."</p><p></p><p>Normally, the 'Maduo' practitioner would be very happy to give the Galaxy Star Lord face.</p><p></p><p>With the Galaxy Star Lord's potential, reaching the Nine Stages Ten Million Realm in the future was almost a certainty. Offending such a terrifying future powerhouse - the 'Maduo' practitioner was not an idiot.</p><p></p><p>Those insect races and Feather Tribe had irreconcilable differences with human civilization, but he, the 'Maduo' practitioner, did not have much direct enmity with humans or the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic void, the more friends the more paths.</p><p></p><p>But now, the 'Maduo' practitioner really could not swallow this anger.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, make your move." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The two instantly entered deeper spatial layers and began fighting.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Xi Lan carefully sensed the terrifying fluctuations coming from the deep spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord and Maduo practitioner have crossed hands?" Xi Lan muttered to himself, "And the battle fluctuations have not immediately collapsed?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan did not dare to approach the spatial layers where Lin Yuan and the Maduo practitioner were fighting, but he could judge the general state of the battle from the fluctuations caused by their fight.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's eyes were a bit dazed. The Galaxy Star Lord's growth was too fast. He still remembered not long ago, he had brought the Galaxy Star Lord to the mother planet?</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Galaxy Star Lord had just entered the Nine Stages and seemed to know nothing?</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, he had reached the level of contending against the Maduo practitioner?</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed worthy of being the most dazzling peerless genius in the history of our human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan swallowed. Back then on the alien battlefield, he had been thinking about how to keep Lin Yuan safe from being killed by that Nine Stages powerhouse of the Feather Tribe.</p><p></p><p>But now it had become Lin Yuan's turn to protect him?</p><p></p><p>Deep in the layers of space, Lin Yuan and the Maduo practitioner confronted each other across dozens of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, I didn't expect your strength to be so great? You almost heavily injured me?" The Maduo practitioner stared at Lin Yuan, his heart trembling a bit.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he and the Galaxy Star Lord had entered deep into the layers of space and collided in an instant, the Maduo practitioner had felt an unimaginable force penetrating his body.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Maduo practitioner's awakened 'Ancient God' innate ability and timely withdrawal, he might have already been heavily injured.</p><p></p><p>Innate ability? </p><p></p><p>Secret art?</p><p></p><p>Treasure? </p><p></p><p>Or something else?</p><p></p><p>The Maduo practitioner's heart was filled with shock and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought he could still suppress the Galaxy Star Lord. Even if the other party could surpass him in the future, at least for now, the Maduo practitioner was still stronger than the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>But through the earlier exchange, the Maduo practitioner instantly concluded that he could not do anything to the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he not do anything to the Galaxy Star Lord, if he continued to stay, and the Galaxy Star Lord seized an opportunity, he might even risk suffering a setback.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was calm, but he felt some regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In terms of opening up spatial layers, Lin Yuan was not as good as the Maduo practitioner.</p><p></p><p>But the world inside Lin Yuan's body was vast, a full billion li in radius. The force erupting from it was estimated to already exceed the power of a million layered space.</p><p></p><p>However, the Maduo practitioner was very cautious. Although angry, he had not lost his reason and did not completely underestimate Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, based on the earlier contact and collision, Lin Yuan was confident he could make the other party suffer a big loss.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, this matter ends here." The Maduo practitioner immediately admitted defeat. He understood that with the strength Lin Yuan had displayed just now, he had no hope of obtaining that treasure again.</p><p></p><p>"Let me give you a reminder. The Feather Tribe's 'Hun Yi' is searching everywhere for you, wanting to kill this avatar of yours to avenge the grudge from the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"'Hun Yi' is the strongest Nine Stages life of the Feather Tribe in this era, opening up over thirty million layers of space. Although your strength is great, if you encounter 'Hun Yi', you won't even be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>The Maduo practitioner immediately spoke, taking the initiative to inform Lin Yuan of a piece of secret intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>..., easing the relationship with the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Since he confirmed that he had no connection with that treasure, he naturally couldn't offend the Galaxy Star Lord to death.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùñòùñçùñöùñù.ùñàùñîùñí</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in place without chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because he couldn't catch up.</p><p></p><p>The more layers of space one opens up, the more spatial layers one can occupy in an instant, appearing between layers of space in a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's killing power surpassed that of a million-layer space expert, but he was slightly inferior in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with the help of some special secret techniques and treasures, lives with lower spatial layers had the hope of escaping the pursuit of those with higher spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xilan had just escaped with her life from Maduo Practitioner's hands.</p><p></p><p>But for lives with lower spatial layers to chase and kill lives with higher spatial layers, not to mention the difference in strength, it was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>The pursuit between ninth-level experts in the spatial layers had no direct relation to speed.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Hun Yi' of the Tianyu Clan?" Lin Yuan thought of Maduo Practitioner's warning, his expression becoming slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Normal ninth-level experts only needed to open up ten million layers of space to reach the threshold of attacking the tenth level. But 'Hun Yi' had opened up and derived over thirty million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>His strength absolutely surpassed that of ninth-level experts. Among the many ninth-level experts entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm this time, 'Hun Yi' was definitely one of the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"But the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is so vast, it won't be easy for him to find me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He was indeed no match for 'Hun Yi', but this strongest ninth-level expert of the Tianyu Clan also couldn't directly lock onto Lin Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Maduo Practitioner, who had already left, still felt somewhat frightened and uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I got ahead of myself, I got ahead of myself."</p><p></p><p>"If I had known the Galaxy Star Lord was so powerful, I should have decisively given up on that treasure back then." Maduo Practitioner began to reflect on himself.</p><p></p><p>Among the many ancient gods, his ancient god ancestor's strength was not the strongest, but he lived an extremely comfortable life, maintaining good relationships with the major races.</p><p></p><p>It all relied on offending no one.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had offended the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the information I provided should make up for it a little..." Maduo Practitioner felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Not many experts knew about 'Hun Yi' seeking the Galaxy Star Lord. Maduo Practitioner, relying on his ancient god ancestor's connections, was one of those in the know.</p><p></p><p>'Hun Yi' had promised that whoever informed him of the Galaxy Star Lord's whereabouts would be rewarded.</p><p></p><p>After Maduo Practitioner retreated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to Xilan's side.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's safe now." Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Maduo Practitioner retreated?" Xilan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, your strength..." Even though Xilan had predicted it, shock still welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Maduo Practitioner's temperament was far inferior to his ancient god ancestor's, impulsive and easily riled up.</p><p></p><p>To make Maduo Practitioner take the initiative to retreat, there was only one possibility - beat him until it hurt, making him lose the desire to continue entangling.</p><p></p><p>But in that case, for Lin Yuan who accomplished all this, his strength had to be above Maduo Practitioner's.</p><p></p><p>Maduo Practitioner had opened up over 900,000 layers of space, approaching the ninth level million layer realm. If Lin Yuan was even stronger than Maduo Practitioner, wouldn't that mean...</p><p></p><p>Xilan vaguely felt her perceptions being crushed.</p><p></p><p>She had entered the ninth level for nearly a million years, and the spatial layers she opened were just over 600,000, far inferior to Maduo Practitioner.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan who had just entered the ninth level not long ago, was already able to surpass Maduo Practitioner?</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about this."</p><p></p><p>"Let's change locations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought Xilan into the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>The two finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Maduo Practitioner said that 'Hun Yi' of the Tianyu Clan is searching for my whereabouts." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Hun Yi?" Xilan's face changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>She began to dread and even fear this strongest ninth-level expert of the Tianyu Clan.</p><p></p><p>On the large-scale alien battlefield, when Hun Yi made a move, millions of layers of space swept across, suppressing dozens of ninth-level experts in the ten-million layer realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert was actually searching for Lin Yuan's whereabouts?</p><p></p><p>Xilan's face looked unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan did make the Tianyu Clan lose a lot of face on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't to the extent of specially mobilizing such a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>"We must be careful from now on." Xilan composed herself and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Even without Hun Yi, he would be cautious in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about that fortuitous place, how did it make Maduo Practitioner so angry?" Lin Yuan asked with slight curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Maduo Practitioner had always tried to learn from his 'ancient god' ancestor who got along with everyone, and wouldn't easily offend any faction.</p><p></p><p>To be able to chase and kill Xilan so desperately, he was obviously truly enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile appeared on Xilan's face.</p><p></p><p>"That fortuitous place was left behind by a follower of 'His Majesty'." Xilan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>She wouldn't hide anything from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If not for Lin Yuan, she would still be pursued by Maduo Practitioner now, and this avatar might have already died.</p><p></p><p>"'His Majesty'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and listened.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the term 'His Majesty' appeared in many fortuitous places.</p><p></p><p>Most owners of the treasures in the fortuitous places were followers of that great 'His Majesty'.</p><p></p><p>"This follower had a mysterious background. He accidentally entered a dimensional gap and fell into our dimensional plane, and was eventually saved by 'His Majesty'."</p><p></p><p>Xilan's tone held some amazement. The concept of dimensional planes was not some top secret.</p><p></p><p>Dimensional planes were a description that transcended spatial laws. Even twelfth-level lives, the strongest, and ultimate existences on the path could not break dimensional planes.</p><p></p><p>But there was a tiny probability of 'gaps' appearing between different dimensions. Entering a 'gap', if one could survive, there was hope of entering other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>However, the so-called probability was too small. Even the strongest could not capture the existence of dimensional gaps, and once a gap appeared, it would recover in a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"According to the owner of that fortuitous place, this thing I obtained is his most precious treasure."</p><p></p><p>Xilan stretched out her right hand, and a black spherical object appeared in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The black sphere hovered in the air, slowly rotating, vaguely emanating mysterious fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"But after studying it for a long time, I didn't discover anything special about this treasure?" Xilan looked somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan beside her was only slightly curious at first.</p><p></p><p>But the moment this black sphere appeared, his expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his mind, that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms began to tremble slightly.</p>

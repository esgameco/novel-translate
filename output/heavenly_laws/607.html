        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was the second to enter, as if traversing a long temporal-spatial corridor.</p><p></p><p>He finally descended into a vast, desolate starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the interior of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan surveyed his surroundings, his powerful senses rapidly spreading and expanding. "The suppression of the rules is extremely strong, and the attainment of the Eighth Realm of Time and Space is difficult to achieve here, making it hard to freely traverse the void."</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void outside, a Chaotic Sage could easily traverse across one-tenth or even one-hundredth of a void domain through void traversal.</p><p></p><p>But in this Mysterious Yellow Universe, the maximum distance was only tens of millions of light-years, a vast difference.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it was created by an Almighty Sage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was filled with awe. The more he sensed, the more he realized the terrifying nature of this universe. Even with the rules simply operating on their own, they could suppress a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of scale, this Heavenly-Created Universe is countless times larger than the naturally born universes nurtured from the Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he could easily devastate a naturally born universe, causing it to prematurely collapse, but he was still far from being able to shake this Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>This was even after the passage of countless eons, where the time and space within the universe had gradually begun to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine that during its prime, even an Almighty Sage would not dare to casually enter.</p><p></p><p>However, this Mysterious Yellow Universe was painstakingly opened by the Mysterious Emperor, who had invested tremendous effort.</p><p></p><p>As for the naturally born universes? They were merely casually nurtured by the Chaotic Void, and the two were not directly comparable.</p><p></p><p>"My current position is here."</p><p></p><p>After descending, Lin Yuan was observing his surroundings while also comparing them to the regions marked on the beast-skin map. He finally pinpointed his location.</p><p></p><p>"Walking in this direction will yield the greatest benefits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose a pre-planned route, with the ultimate destination being the Mysterious Emperor's mausoleum. Along the way, he would pass through various regions containing numerous precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful beings who had entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, even the Chaotic Sages, could only instinctively approach the center of the universe. As for the rewards along the way, it was a matter of luck.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had planned in advance, ensuring that he could maximize his gains without wasting time. Even if he ultimately obtained nothing from the mausoleum, this trip would not be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure vanished, reappearing tens of millions of light-years away.</p><p></p><p>Before he could continue his next traversalâ€”</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying roar echoed, and a massive, octopus-like lifeform emerged from the depths of the temporal-spatial realm. Hundreds of tentacles surged towards Lin Yuan, with the areas they passed through rapidly disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a Mysterious Yellow Beast?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled, immediately recognizing the creature's identity.</p><p></p><p>During his previous exploration of the Mysterious Yellow Realm, such beings had been ubiquitous.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Mysterious Yellow Beasts were not true lifeforms, but possessed immense power, able to harness the forces of the surrounding heaven and earth. However, their intelligence was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Lineage defined the Mysterious Yellow Beasts as merely vessels for the nurturing of Mysterious Yellow Crystals.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation of the Mysterious Yellow Lineage disciples, the Mysterious Yellow Crystals were an essential resource, like the Mysterious Yellow Body cultivated by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This Mysterious Yellow Beast's strength is formidable, almost reaching the Chaos Realm threshold." Lin Yuan observed the creature, making his assessment.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Beasts in the Mysterious Yellow Realm had a strength limit of just the Nine Realms, but here, they were exponentially more powerful, reaching the Chaos Realm threshold.</p><p></p><p>"It's understandable, as the Mysterious Yellow Beasts can harness the power of the surrounding heaven and earth. The Mysterious Yellow Universe's primal essence is so powerful that even as the time and space are collapsing, its empowerment of their strength is terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>If a dying camel is larger than a horse, then this Mysterious Yellow Universe was far more than just a camel compared to the Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Splash, splash.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched the octopus-like Mysterious Yellow Beast frantically attacking him, and with a slight shift in his mind, the 'World' divine ability silently activated.</p><p></p><p>Invisible cosmic forces crushed the Mysterious Yellow Beast, which had reached the Chaos Realm threshold, causing it to instantly disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Beasts' intelligence was inherently low. While they had reached the Chaos Realm threshold in terms of combat power, they were not true Chaos Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>If it had been a normal Chaos Venerable One, they would have immediately turned and fled upon seeing Lin Yuan, and even if they couldn't escape, they wouldn't have attacked so fearlessly like this Mysterious Yellow Beast.</p><p></p><p>This was just the most direct difference. Compared to Chaos Venerable Ones, the attacks of the Mysterious Yellow Beasts were also overly simplistic, with the same few moves repeated. As long as one grasped the pattern, they were not difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "not difficult" was based on Lin Yuan's absolute crushing strength.</p><p></p><p>If it had been an ordinary Chaos Venerable One, even a peak Chaos Realm Venerable One, they would have been quite troubled when first encountering this suicidal Mysterious Yellow Beast.</p><p></p><p>The octopus-like Mysterious Yellow Beast's physical body disintegrated, revealing a Mysterious Yellow Crystal the size of thousands of meters.</p><p></p><p>"This Mysterious Yellow Crystal?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed. This was the first time he had seen such a massive Mysterious Yellow Crystal. Even if all the Mysterious Yellow Crystals nurtured by the Mysterious Yellow Beasts in the Mysterious Yellow Realm were combined, they would not match this one.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Chaos Realm cultivation of the Mysterious Yellow Body has a foundation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was satisfied. The Mysterious Yellow Body, a cultivation method created by the Mysterious Emperor, required a massive amount of resources in its cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here, the resources were not limited to specific types, as long as they were resources, they could serve as nourishment for the Mysterious Yellow Body.</p><p></p><p>The primary resource was the Mysterious Yellow Crystal.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm was partially fused with the universe's time and space, able to constantly expel and absorb Chaotic Qi, continuously nurturing new Mysterious Yellow Crystals.</p><p></p><p>However, the premature collapse of his home universe had come too early. Normally, over the course of a complete universal cycle, the Mysterious Yellow Realm would have produced enough Mysterious Yellow Crystals for Lin Yuan to cultivate the Mysterious Yellow Body to the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if it couldn't reach Chaos Realm perfection, he could still slowly accumulate them over the next universal cycle, the one after that, and so on. For a Chaos Realm being, waiting for ten, a hundred universal cycles was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>But due to the premature collapse of his home universe, Lin Yuan had lost the stable source of Mysterious Yellow Crystals.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Mysterious Yellow Body to Sovereign Realm perfection, this cultivation method had stagnated, not due to a lack of resources, but a lack of Mysterious Yellow Crystals.</p><p></p><p>"A few tens of thousands of Mysterious Yellow Beasts at this level should be enough to cultivate the Mysterious Yellow Body to the Chaos Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stored the thousands-of-meter-sized Mysterious Yellow Crystal, estimating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His physical foundation was too high, and even just cultivating the Mysterious Yellow Body to Sovereign Realm perfection had already approached the level of a normal Chaos Sage.</p><p></p><p>Once he pushed the Mysterious Yellow Body to the Chaos Realm, his physical might would likely reach the peak of the Chaos Sage realm.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate the Mysterious Yellow Body to Chaos Realm perfection, relying solely on...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The physical body and constitution could suppress the supreme great saint. "A few tens of thousands?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the starry sky in all directions, not feeling that it was much.</p><p></p><p>The vast Xuanhuang universe had nurtured countless Xuanhuang beasts, far exceeding tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>"This time, there are not a few venerable ones who have entered the universe. In the end, they can exchange the Xuanhuang crystals in their hands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since he was able to encounter Xuanhuang beasts, the other Chaos Realm cultivators must have encountered them as well.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang beasts could not leave the world they resided in, and upon death, their physical bodies and souls would be destroyed, leaving only the Xuanhuang crystals.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xuanhuang crystals, they would be of great use only to the powerful cultivators of the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>If they fell into the hands of other beings? At most, they would be equivalent to chaos stones of the same size, and Lin Yuan only needed to slightly overprice them, and those Chaos Realm venerable ones would definitely scramble to queue up.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Lin Yuan finished his traversal, he would pay attention to whether there were any Xuanhuang beasts nearby.</p><p></p><p>If there were, he would casually deal with them and take the Xuanhuang crystals. If there were none, he would not insist, and would continue to traverse along the planned route with full force.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the Xuanhuang crystals were not valuable, as they were related to Lin Yuan's body cultivation. But so far, the Xuanhuang crystals were only effective for him, and the other Chaos Realm venerable ones would not focus their efforts on the Xuanhuang beasts.</p><p></p><p>Killing a Xuanhuang beast that had reached the Chaos Realm threshold was not easy for even the peak Chaos Realm venerable ones, requiring a fierce battle, and the result would only be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of chaos stones? The Xuanhuang crystals were equivalent to the same amount of chaos stones for the powerful cultivators outside the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan descended in front of a faintly green-colored planet and carefully observed it.</p><p></p><p>This faintly green planet had no trace of aura leakage and was no different from the dead planets within the Xuanhuang universe.</p><p></p><p>However, on the beast skin map, this faintly green planet was marked as the Life Source Star, the place where the Life Spirit Stones were nurtured.</p><p></p><p>The Life Spirit Stones were rare treasures in the Chaos Void. A palm-sized Life Spirit Stone contained enough life source power to allow a severely injured Chaos Realm great saint to recover in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Even if they suffered some irreversible injuries, as long as the life source power in the Life Spirit Stone was not exhausted, they would not die.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Life Spirit Stones had always been in high demand but low supply in the Chaos Void, being the top-tier life-saving items that even the Chaos Realm great saints were constantly searching for.</p><p></p><p>"The Life Spirit Stones are rare treasures that have fallen from the Sea of Life, and the Sea of Life is a mysterious place in the Chaos Void, just like the Thunder Pool, which is normally impossible to set foot in."</p><p></p><p>"In theory, only the Sea of Life would produce the Life Spirit Stones, and the quantity is extremely scarce, but that is just a theory."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the faintly green planet in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Why did the supreme great saints go to the trouble of opening up a post-heaven universe? It was because the post-heaven universe they opened could formulate their own rules.</p><p></p><p>For example, this Life Source Star was nurtured by Emperor Xuan based on the mysterious Sea of Life, and could produce the Life Spirit Stones.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Life Source Star nurtured by Emperor Xuan was far inferior to the true Sea of Life, and the efficiency of producing the Life Spirit Stones was also lower.</p><p></p><p>But after countless universe cycles, even if the Life Source Star's efficiency in nurturing the Life Spirit Stones was low, with no one taking them away for so long, it should have accumulated a considerable number of Life Spirit Stones, right?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sent out a clone to enter the Life Source Star.</p><p></p><p>Even though the beast skin map's description of the Life Source Star indicated that it was not dangerous, Lin Yuan was still unwilling to enter it in person.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what changes might have occurred in the Life Source Star after so many universe cycles? The clone of Lin Yuan quickly descended into the core of the Life Source Star.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At the core, the life aura was gathered, permeating the surroundings like a mist. Lin Yuan had a feeling that as long as he was in this environment, even if he suffered severe injuries, he would recover quickly.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the deepest part and saw a green crystal stone about three meters in size, quietly floating in the sea of life aura, with the ubiquitous mist originating from this green crystal stone.</p><p></p><p>"A Life Spirit Stone?"</p><p></p><p>"A three-meter-sized Life Spirit Stone?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a bit dazed. A palm-sized Life Spirit Stone could allow a severely injured Chaos Realm great saint to recover quickly, and now this Life Spirit Stone was about three meters in size? Equivalent to tens of thousands of palm-sized Life Spirit Stones?</p><p></p><p>It could save tens of thousands of severely injured Chaos Realm great saints?</p><p></p><p>"With such a large Life Spirit Stone, even if I'm surrounded by a group of supreme great saints, I won't die in the short term." Lin Yuan's spirit was greatly uplifted.</p><p></p><p>As long as the life source power in the Chaos Spirit Stone was not exhausted, Lin Yuan would be virtually immortal, far more impressive than the physical body technique of "Dripping Blood Resurrection".</p><p></p><p>Unless a Thirteenth-Tier Life cultivator intervened and erased him from the temporal dimension, no one could kill him instantly.</p><p></p><p>"How much chaos stones would this be worth?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed down, and to be precise, no amount of chaos stones could exchange for a Life Spirit Stone, as the latter was the top-tier life-saving item, even for the Chaos Realm great saints.</p><p></p><p>"Collect it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan unhesitatingly began to collect the Life Spirit Stone.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The entire Life Source Star was shaking, and the Lin Yuan standing outside also started to act, assisting his clone in collecting the Life Spirit Stone.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the nearly three-meter-sized Life Spirit Stone slowly fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"I've hit the jackpot."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted in his heart. Even if he had no other gains from this trip to the Xuanhuang Universe, this Life Spirit Stone alone would be enough to recoup his investment.</p><p></p><p>"The Life Spirit Stone not only is the top-tier life-saving item, but the life origin rules contained within it are the core. This will be very helpful for me to comprehend the Dao related to life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully stored the Life Spirit Stone in his internal universe and only observed it briefly, but he already gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush for now."</p><p></p><p>"Go collect the next treasure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan confirmed that there were no other Life Spirit Stones left in the Life Source Star, and after taking the Life Spirit Stone, the permeating life mist in this star was quickly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared, reappearing tens of millions of light-years away.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Lin Yuan followed the predetermined route, passing through one area after another where treasures and rare items were stored, and casually collecting them.</p><p></p><p>Great Saint-level secret weapons and treasures? Rare items that were difficult to produce even after millions of universe cycles? Precious items that could only be nurtured in the specific mysterious places of the Chaos Void?</p><p></p><p>The gains Lin Yuan collected along the way were enough to make the supreme great saints green with envy and go crazy.</p><p></p><p>The resources accumulated over thousands of millions of years in the Xuanhuang Universe were all falling into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

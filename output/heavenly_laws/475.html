            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 475 The Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons' Confusion (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan crossed into the Seventh Realm of Time and Space without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>When a large amount of spiritual enlightenment converged, Lin Yuan comprehended the essence of the Seventh Realm of Time and Space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's accumulation was too formidable, coupled with the special cultivation environment of the Immortal Realm, as well as the scene of the Immortal Source where the Immortal Realm's origin was condensed, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The result of the accumulation of various foundations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing among all the foundations was Lin Yuan's extraordinary perceptive ability.</p><p></p><p>Without the extraordinary perceptive ability to integrate everything, even if the above-mentioned environmental conditions were strengthened tenfold, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, which of the direct disciples of the Ancestors of the Immortal Dao had a cultivation environment and resources not as good as Lin Yuan's? They could even directly enter the origin of the Immortal Realm to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But so far, none of the Ancestor's disciples have crossed into the Seventh Realm of Time and Space in terms of spiritual enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Ancestor's disciples, even the Ancestors themselves have never touched the Seventh Realm in terms of spiritual enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"I see." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was enlightened. After reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, the time and space he felt seemed to have come alive.</p><p></p><p>It was not that time and space had come alive, but that time and space was originally alive and constantly changing, it was just that Lin Yuan could not perceive or observe it before.</p><p></p><p>"This is time and space!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was distant, the time and space of the entire Immortal Realm was transparent to him, and even the time and space of the Abyss of Demons was vividly presented before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that the Immortal Realm and the Abyss of Demons are actually the same world, it's just that due to the difference in the nature of the rules, there is a clear distinction." Lin Yuan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought that the Abyss of Demons was a certain spatial layer of the Immortal Realm, but in fact, the Abyss of Demons also belongs to the main space of the Immortal Realm, and the Immortal Realm may not even occupy a dominant position for the Abyss of Demons.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm and the Abyss of Demons are equal, without any distinction of primary and secondary.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The subordinate worlds of the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, and he looked beyond the boundless and endless power of time and space towards the outside of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The level where the Immortal Realm is located is the supreme, the pinnacle of this dimension.</p><p></p><p>But below the Immortal Realm, there are three thousand three hundred and thirty-three worlds floating.</p><p></p><p>Among these three thousand three hundred and thirty-three worlds, the Spiritual Realm that Lin Yuan had descended upon was among them.</p><p></p><p>And below these three thousand three hundred and thirty-three worlds, each world has more than a million lower-level worlds, and the Middle Earth Divine Continent is among them.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three? This number again?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>With his current mastery of time and space, as long as he wished, he could easily descend to any world at this latitude.</p><p></p><p>But it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>The lower-level worlds are likely to have difficulty even accommodating Lin Yuan, like the Middle Earth Divine Continent before, which was probably not as large as the world within Lin Yuan. Descending there would not achieve anything.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>According to the information left by Emperor Xuanhuang and the Demon Jade Pavilion Master, the Seventh Realm of Time and Space is normally only attainable by Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A few of the top Twelve Tribulation Dao Splitting cultivators may also have the chance to touch it.</p><p></p><p>In other words, now, relying solely on his time and space enlightenment, Lin Yuan has surpassed the vast majority of Twelve Tribulation Dao Splitting cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his time and space enlightenment, in a direct power confrontation, Lin Yuan is not the opponent of the ultimate Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm, but he can completely use his time and space enlightenment to "play" with those Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Mysterious Yellow Forbidden Realm, which is deep within the main universe's time and space, but opens only once every few tens of thousands of years, and all Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm cultivators are unable to lock onto its coordinates.</p><p></p><p>This is the suppression from the level of rules.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Seventh Realm of Time and Space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly.</p><p></p><p>For almost all life forms, the difficulty of awakening the Seventh Realm of Time and Space is greater than breaking through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>After all, the vast majority of Twelve Tribulation Dao Splitting Realm experts have not reached the Seventh Realm of Time and Space in their spiritual enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Now I..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, and after crossing into the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, with a single thought, his true body, spiritual sense, and various incarnations all merged into the depths of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Even Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm cultivators would not be able to detect him at all, unless Lin Yuan actively revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the current Lin Yuan is like a high-latitude observer, and even if it's a Twelve Tribulation Sovereign Realm cultivator, as long as their rule enlightenment has not reached a certain level, they don't even have the ability to sense Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So time and space can be used in this way?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to feel the changes in himself.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Seventh Realm of Time and Space, the boundless time and space seemed to have changed in Lin Yuan's eyes, and many time and space mysteries that he could not understand before were now completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan continued to seclude himself and familiarize himself with the Seventh Realm of Time and Space,</p><p></p><p>Outside the dwelling, the City Lord of the Immortal City and a group of high-level bigwigs gathered.</p><p></p><p>They had an anxious and slightly uneasy expression. After sensing that Lin Yuan's dwelling was out of sync with the surrounding environment, they speculated that Lin Yuan might be related to the powerful existence that attacked the outside.</p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange and communication, the City Lord of the Immortal City and the other high-level bigwigs put down the nearly ruined Cangwu Immortal City, and came to visit Lin Yuan as the first priority.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was indeed related to the powerful existence that had struck, the first thing they needed to do was to find out the powerful existence's intentions and what it wanted, rather than to restore the Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>After all, the powerful existence's attack was definitely not without reason.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't figure out these things, the City Lord of the Immortal City and the other high-level bigwigs wouldn't even be able to sleep soundly, let alone stabilize the situation in the Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the 'housekeeper' of the immortal abode, Yun Zhenzi immediately opened the door and came out.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past, when facing the city lord of the immortal city and other high-level bigwigs gathered here, Yun Zhenzi would be a bit nervous, after all, these were figures that he could not even look up to even tens of millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Even among the jade immortals, the gap would be even greater. The original Yun Zhenzi was considered powerful among ordinary jade immortals, but compared to those top-tier jade immortals, he was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the city lord of the immortal city and the others were not just ordinary jade immortals, their backgrounds were far beyond what Yun Zhenzi could compare to.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how Lin Yuan had just casually grabbed the countless demonic beasts with a flip of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi straightened his back and said in a neither humble nor arrogant tone, "What brings you all here?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the master in?" The city lord of the immortal city and the other jade immortals exchanged glances and took the initiative to speak.</p><p></p><p>"The master is in seclusion," Yun Zhenzi said concisely.</p><p></p><p>This was also what Lin Yuan had instructed him to do before entering seclusion, to refuse any visitors with this reason, unless a truly major event that would affect the entire immortal city occurred.</p><p></p><p>"In seclusion?"</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the immortal city was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The other bigwigs behind him also trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In seclusion?</p><p></p><p>At this time, he was still in seclusion?</p><p></p><p>The Cangwu Immortal City had just experienced a crisis of collapse, and all the immortals, including the city lord and many other top-tier jade immortals, could have been devoured by the endless demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, for the many immortals, it was like escaping from the tiger's mouth, how could they have the mind to go into seclusion?</p><p></p><p>And the situation outside was still unclear, if there were more demonic beasts attacking, the Cangwu Immortal City might still be in danger, making it even more impossible for any immortal to go into seclusion.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that Lin Yuan was in seclusion?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi's response made the city lord and other high-level bigwigs think a lot.</p><p></p><p>If they had only speculated before coming that the master of this top-grade immortal abode was related to the mysterious existence that had acted against the demonic beasts outside, the possibility was around 40-50%.</p><p></p><p>But now, this possibility has reached 70-80%.</p><p></p><p>Because going into seclusion at this time was too unreasonable, unless he simply didn't care about those demonic beasts at all.</p><p></p><p>And this was consistent with the mysterious existence who had acted.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if your master is aware, but who was it that acted against those demonic beasts outside just now?" The city lord of the immortal city took a deep breath and asked carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Who acted against the demonic beasts?" Yun Zhenzi hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew it was Lin Yuan, who had casually grabbed the endless demonic beasts with a flip of his hand.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had not told him to speak about this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had not told him not to speak about it either.</p><p></p><p>So Yun Zhenzi hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go ask the master." After thinking it over, Yun Zhenzi decided to confirm with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Go ask the master!" The city lord and other high-level bigwigs trembled in their hearts again.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi did not answer that he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>But said he would go ask the master.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>It meant that not only the master of the abode, even this servant housekeeper knew who the mysterious existence that acted was.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to ask the master if he could reveal it or not.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go ask him. We'll wait here."</p><p></p><p>The city lord of the immortal city immediately forced out a smile, and the other bigwigs did the same.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they had an even more terrifying guess in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the master of this abode was not only related to the mysterious powerful expert who acted, but might even be the mysterious powerful expert himself?</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely dark and abysmal here, filled with black demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>Endless demonic beasts were born, fighting, and dying here.</p><p></p><p>This was the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The source of all demonic beasts, and the resting place of the Demon Abyss Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Demon Abyss, a massive consciousness was slowly awakening.</p><p></p><p>The demonic qi it casually released condensed a large number of demonic beasts, the endless demonic beasts fighting and devouring each other, eventually giving birth to one demonic beast emperor after another.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Has a child died?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, this massive consciousness sensed something.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of demonic qi condensed, forming a supreme throne, and a figure appeared, sitting on that supreme throne.</p><p></p><p>He was the Demon Abyss Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>For the Demon Abyss Ancestor, the life and death of ordinary demonic beasts did not matter to him. Not to mention invading the immortal world, even in the Demon Abyss, there were large numbers of ordinary demonic beasts dying every moment.</p><p></p><p>But the demonic beast emperors?</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast emperors could already be considered the incarnations of the Demon Abyss Ancestor, and were also his children.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demon Abyss, the demonic beast emperors were immortal, they would receive the protection and blessing of the entire Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The fall of a demonic beast emperor would alarm the Demon Abyss Ancestor who was currently in slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Who dared to kill my child."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor's eyes were pitch black as he began to retrace the last memory of the deceased demonic beast emperor according to the faint sense.</p><p></p><p>"Is it there?"</p><p></p><p>Illusions flashed in front of the Demon Abyss Ancestor, immediately revealing the last experience of the six deceased demonic beast emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Found it."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor vaguely locked onto a location.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the Demon Abyss Ancestor was about to continue confirming the specific coordinates, he suddenly sensed that the space-time seemed to be like a mist, the coordinates he had locked onto suddenly split into two, then four, then eight.</p><p></p><p>As if it existed in all space-time, yet as if it did not exist in any space-time.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss Ancestor's expression showed confusion.</p>

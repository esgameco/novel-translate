        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 314 Peak (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>After the Desire Church had completely "withdrawn", the Order Church routinely inquired with Anpu City and the surrounding major duchy territories. ◦•●◉✿69รѦЦХ.ⓒ〇Μ✿◉●•◦ </p><p></p><p>This matter was then completely over.</p><p></p><p>Linyuan's life returned to tranquility once more.  </p><p></p><p>Longshan City, Linyuan sat cross-legged in the center of the cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of time. We human civilization scholars of evolution have summarized 2,173 models of the time rules based on their essence."</p><p></p><p>Linyuan pondered, compared to nearly ten thousand models of spatial rules, there were far fewer time rule models, but the latter was far more difficult to comprehend than the former.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if one comprehended all 2,173 models of the time rules, it did not mean fully comprehending the complete time rules.</p><p></p><p>To fully comprehend the complete time rules, one needed to comprehend that final step themselves.</p><p></p><p>The 2,173 models of the time rules merely pointed evolution practitioners in a direction for comprehending the time rules.</p><p></p><p>"I have not yet recovered to the ninth stage, so I cannot open a spatial layer, but I have made ample progress on the time rules."</p><p></p><p>Linyuan felt quite amazed in his heart. Over the past century, he had comprehended over a hundred models of the time rules, nearing a "small accomplishment" in his comprehension of time.</p><p></p><p>This was a depth of comprehension that only a tenth stage evolution practitioner should possess.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Linyuan also had deeper insights into the spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>It was not that once one comprehended the complete spatial rules, they had reached the limit in the spatial rules. The spatial rules were vast and boundless, with different facets.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rules comprehended by the most powerful were completely on a different level than those comprehended by ordinary ninth stage evolution practitioners.  </p><p></p><p>The master of the Demon Jade Pavilion left behind the "Void Interpretation", expounding on the essence of the spatial rules from another angle, greatly benefiting Linyuan. Each time he viewed it, he gained new understandings.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone's here?"</p><p></p><p>Linyuan's gaze swept over and he discovered that a large number of Longshan Clan members had gathered at the edge of the cultivation ground, gazing at him with fanatical passion.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of formless and illusory power began converging towards Linyuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"This world is indeed suitable for walking the path of faith." Linyuan clearly understood that the converging power came from the Longshan Clan members' faith in him.</p><p></p><p>In the main world and main universe, this would be extremely inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization of the main world, there were evolution practitioners who also tried to walk the path of faith, but found it very difficult to condense faith power. However, it was much easier in this world.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that faith power is too reliant on living beings. If the living beings die off, even gods who take faith as their foundation will also lose their source of power."</p><p></p><p>Linyuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the path of faith, he still preferred gathering power within himself. Although spreading the path of evolution would make Linyuan's ultimate leap a bit easier, it did not mean he could not cross into the twelfth stage without spreading it.</p><p></p><p>Linyuan's thoughts wandered as he gazed at the increasing number of Longshan Clan members.</p><p></p><p>In order to better spread the martial path cultivation method, Linyuan would lecture on the key points and essence of the martial path cultivation method within the Longshan Clan periodically.</p><p></p><p>"The Clan Chief is so powerful. Just looking at the Clan Chief makes my heart race."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, our Longshan Clan's Chief is praised as the number one fourth-rank knight in the surrounding duchies, with hopes of becoming a fifth-rank great knight, an ultimate prodigy."</p><p></p><p>The Longshan Clan members excitedly discussed. Many of them did not cultivate the martial path, but came specifically to see Linyuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the past century, Longshan Ridge developed better and better, drawing the attention of several other duchies nearby. Those duchies joined forces, sending over ten fourth-rank peak knights to enter Longshan City, intending to pressure the new Longshan Duke.</p><p></p><p>As a result, those fourth-rank peak knights were beaten by Linyuan with a single punch each, without even a chance to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the major duchies no longer had any thoughts about Longshan Ridge. In their view, the Longshan Duke's strength was infinitely close to a fifth-rank great knight, so it was only a matter of time before he crossed that realm.</p><p></p><p>What those fourth-rank peak knights from the major duchies did not know was that the Longshan Duke they fought against was actually an existence comparable to a true god.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Two hours went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Linyuan's lecture was nearing its end, and the surrounding Longshan Clan members listened as if entranced.</p><p></p><p>With Linyuan's understanding of the essence of power, even though he was not skilled in teaching disciples, his descriptions and explanations of the martial path cultivation method hit the essence with every word.</p><p></p><p>The Longshan Clan members may not have understood immediately, but at the very least they gained some insights. After some reflection and review later, they would be able to gain benefits.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above Longshan City.</p><p></p><p>In a slightly distorted space.</p><p></p><p>Several figures stood there, carefully watching Linyuan lecturing below.</p><p></p><p>The three leading figures had restrained auras, clearly sixth-rank legendary knights - the Empire's final reserves and foundations.</p><p></p><p>On the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations, even the strongest empires may have seventh-rank demigods presiding, but the vast majority did not, with the sixth-rank being their limit.</p><p></p><p>Seventh-rank demigods generally had two choices: either pledge allegiance to a true god, or secretly spread faith in an attempt to become a god themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Fabian, the martial path cultivation method was spread by that Longshan Duke," a young man with golden hair respectfully said in a low voice to the elderly man standing in the lead position.</p><p></p><p>Fabian, a legend of the Empire, was a sixth-rank peak legendary knight, even with the hope of igniting the divine flame to cross into the seventh-rank demigod realm.</p><p></p><p>"In my view, the martial path cultivation method is nothing more than this. Although it can encompass the vast majority of bloodlines, where can it compare to my imperial family's cultivation method when it comes to targeting specific bloodlines."</p><p></p><p>Another young man couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>After the Longshan Clan publicly spread the martial path cultivation method and it rapidly transmitted, it also reached the Imperial Court.  </p><p></p><p>Fabian immediately realized the importance of the martial path cultivation method, as it may trigger a revolution in all knights' cultivation methods. He promptly brought everyone to Longshan City to secretly observe that Longshan Duke.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the others around were stunned with eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>They had never heard Fabian give such high praise to any knight before - having unlimited potential? Very likely to step into the seventh rank?</p><p></p><p>Heavens!</p><p></p><p>These words came from the always arrogant Fabian's mouth?</p><p></p><p>"You don't believe me?" </p><p></p><p>Fabian's tone was calm as he continued carefully listening to Linyuan's lecture below.</p><p></p><p>He could not see through Linyuan's strength and did not detect any abnormalities. But just from the precise descriptions of the essence of power and essence of cultivation in every sentence Linyuan spoke, he vaguely felt that this Longshan Duke's future accomplishments would far surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, when Fabian was this age, he only knew how to activate his power, far from Linyuan's understanding of the essence of power.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Lord Dragon Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The higher he cultivated, the more Fabian realized the importance of understanding the true nature of power.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it's not that we don't believe you, it's just too inconceivable," the others said carefully after glancing at each other.</p><p></p><p>What a joke? Which level 7 demigod didn't have a powerful and profound bloodline? The "Mountain Dragon" bloodline of the Dragon Mountain clan was indeed extraordinary, but its limit was only level 5. Wanting to reach the level 7 demigod stage was as difficult as ascending to heaven.</p><p></p><p>"No matter," Fabian said nonchalantly. "If you don't believe it, just wait another 500 years." </p><p></p><p>Since he dared say that, it meant he was certain Lord Dragon Mountain would break through to level 6 within 500 years. Because only a level 6 legendary knight could live over 500 years.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts cultivation method should be popularized immediately in my imperial court. Otherwise, the surrounding empires will catch up if we keep waiting," Fabian said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, there had been endless debates within the imperial court over how to treat the martial arts cultivation method. Now that Fabian had personally seen Lord Dragon Mountain, he had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>As for blocking the information and keeping the martial arts cultivation method only for the imperial court? That was unrealistic, as too many knights in the empire already knew about it, and many surrounding empires were also aware of it. </p><p></p><p>The only reason there was no movement currently was because everyone was still studying the martial arts cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Within the imperial court, Fabian's authority was second only to the Church of Order, and his words were absolute in internal decision-making.</p><p></p><p>"Also, we should embrace this Lord Dragon Mountain immediately and elevate his title to Earl. The surplus surrounding lands, as well as the lands of those few lords, should all be granted to the Dragon Mountain clan," Fabian pondered and continued.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the others responded after glancing at each other.</p><p></p><p>They clearly heard that Fabian attached unprecedented importance to Lord Dragon Mountain, directly elevating him to Earl Dragon Mountain. This was the first time in the history of the empire that a lord's title had been so greatly elevated, right? Moreover, Lord Dragon Mountain had not yet made any outstanding contributions.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that any earl of the empire could permanently inherit their lands, with land ownership rights even higher than the empire itself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back," Fabian said finally after glancing at Dragon Mountain City below. He then led the group back to the imperial capital.</p><p></p><p>What Fabian, the level 6 peak legendary knight, didn't know was that after he left, Lord Dragon Mountain below glanced furtively at the spot where Fabian had just stood.</p><p></p><p>"At least he's sensible," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Fabian's group could not hide from Lin Yuan's perception. Not only could they not hide, but every word they said was heard by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long expected the martial arts cultivation method's spread to attract the empire's attention. After all, compared to the many knight cultivation methods, the martial arts method itself was too unique and could completely replace most knight methods.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan thought the empire would take some measures, like trying to control him, the Lord Dragon Mountain who disseminated the martial arts method. </p><p></p><p>But clearly, the empire's higher-ups were not short-sighted. After realizing they could not stop the martial arts method, they immediately took the initiative to join in, even trying to embrace and reward Lin Yuan who spread it.</p><p></p><p>With this whole series of moves, even Lin Yuan did not harbor any resentment towards the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>"My two spiritual souls have already infiltrated the Church," Lin Yuan glanced into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Although called the "Myriad Nations" Plateau, there were far more than a thousand empires existing here. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was currently in the "Sran" Empire, the land of faith for the main god of Order.</p><p></p><p>Facing a main god existence, Lin Yuan remained sufficiently cautious and would not easily provoke a main god.</p><p></p><p>In another empire infinitely far from the "Sran" Empire, this was the land of faith for the true god "Starry Sky". The Starry Sky Church was the most exalted place in this empire.</p><p></p><p>At the Starry Sky Church, a large number of believers were worshipping and a wisp of illusory faith power was converging towards the statue of the Starry Sky true god, then transmitted through the statue to the true god's main body residing in the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the church, the Pope smiled happily as he watched the continuously condensing divine crystals before him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my god is very pleased this time to bestow so many divine crystals," the Pope rejoiced inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The divine crystals contained extremely pure energy. Besides being able to supply divine power avatars, they also greatly aided in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The divine crystals the Starry Sky true god bestowed this time were enough for all the church's level 5 and above experts to cultivate for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>"If I could swallow these divine crystals, perhaps I could reach level 7, then raise up the divine nation and enter the Ocean of Light like my god to exist eternally?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope stared greedily at the divine crystals before him. At this moment, a figure appeared silently beside the Pope, its face blurred and shrouded in a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Pope glanced over without reacting, then his expression changed drastically. "You are..."</p><p></p><p>Before the Pope could finish, his consciousness fell into darkness. When he awoke again, he found that the divine crystals the church had accumulated over thousands of years had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Who did this?!" The Pope of the Starry Sky Church had bloodshot eyes as so many divine crystals had simply vanished.</p><p></p><p>Outside the church, Lin Yuan's form re-condensed. </p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan glanced at the amount of newly acquired divine crystals and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Keep going."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood he had to move quickly, to gather enough divine crystals for his breakthrough to the 9th level before the gods reacted.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and ten years went by in a blink.</p><p></p><p>In these ten years, Lin Yuan's two spiritual souls traveled across half of the Myriad Nations Plateau, raiding the churches of countless true gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was only interested in the divine crystals and did not kill any believers, mainly to minimize the situation. Killing believers to eliminate high-ranking church members would be an outright declaration of war against the gods, which would not benefit Lin Yuan's future crystal gathering.</p><p></p><p>At Dragon Mountain Ridge, in an underground cave, Lin Yuan gazed at the massive pile of divine crystals before him.</p><p></p><p>He took a light breath, and the divine crystals shattered and fused into his body. In an instant, his inner world began expanding as space became heavier and vaster.</p><p></p><p>With experience breaking through to the 9th level from a main world and main universe before, Lin Yuan re-entered the 9th level smoothly, without any stagnation. Even the breakthrough movement was suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Exhale ~~</p><p>Inhale ~~~</p><p></p><p>A vague, lingering breath of air.</p><p></p><p>No one knew that in this small place of Dragon Mountain Ridge in the Sran Empire, an existence equivalent to the twenty-four main gods had been born.</p>

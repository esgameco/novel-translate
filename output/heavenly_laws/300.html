        <h1>Chapter 300</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 300: Why Not Try It? (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Southern Star Region of the Human Civilization Domain. üíöüíé6‚ûàs ∞œÖùîµ.c·ªñ–º‚òùüë§</p><p></p><p>In a starry sky emanating spatial fluctuations, Lin Yuan's figure appeared as he carefully observed the area ahead. </p><p></p><p>"Is this one of the 333 entrances to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason why human civilization has not occupied the "Xuanhuang" secret realm is because there are simply too many entrances to this secret realm. </p><p></p><p>As many as over three hundred entrances.</p><p></p><p>And they are scattered throughout the universe.</p><p></p><p>For example, within the human civilization domain alone, there are nineteen entrances to the "Xuanhuang" Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The main universe is vast and boundless. The 'vastness and boundlessness' here not only refers to the vast area, but also the boundless spatial layers it possesses."</p><p></p><p>"Within the countless spatial layers, small worlds attached to the main universe may be born. This is the origin of the cosmic secret realms."  </p><p></p><p>"Generally speaking, if a certain cosmic secret realm is very valuable, the supremely powerful beings will take the initiative to delve deep into the myriad spatial layers and 'pull' that small world into the main space of the main universe."</p><p></p><p>"Or establish a stable passage leading to that secret realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The secret realms may contain resources rarely seen in the main universe, so the more the better.  </p><p></p><p>Even a large cosmic secret realm cannot withstand the 'pull' of the supremely powerful beings. If one supremely powerful being cannot do it, then two or three can.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Secret Realm...</p><p></p><p>Even the supremely powerful beings cannot lock onto the specific spatial layer where this secret realm is located, which is quite unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanhuang Secret Realm has not yet emerged, it is still possible, because even for the supremely powerful beings, they cannot traverse all the spatial layers of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But the Xuanhuang Secret Realm has clearly opened many times before, with passages connecting to the outside world. Yet the supremely powerful beings still cannot pinpoint the accurate spatial layer, which is simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Not only the human supremely powerful beings cannot do it, but the supremely powerful beings of other races also cannot.</p><p></p><p>This is also one of the reasons why human civilization believes that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm originates from other cosmic eras - this secret realm is simply not a normal cosmic secret realm, and some existence has deliberately concealed its coordinate location.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the powerful beings who have occasionally entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to explore have obtained secret arts and treasures that are completely different from the styles of the current universe's myriad races.</p><p></p><p>"The summoning sensation has become extremely strong." Lin Yuan stood under the starry sky, and as he got closer and closer to the entrance of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the summoning sensation he heard became stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could even hear some vague voices now.</p><p></p><p>"This time entering the secret realm, I've specially brought three ninth-grade secret treasures to protect myself," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The three ninth-grade secret treasures were for attack, physical defense, and soul defense respectively.</p><p></p><p>Although battles at the ninth-grade level are similar to the struggles within countless spatial layers, it does not mean that weapons and secret treasures are useless.</p><p></p><p>If you have defensive secret treasures protecting you, even if the enemy finds the spatial layer you are in, they cannot kill you.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these three ninth-grade secret treasures came from the contributions of the strongest eighth-grade talents of the Tian Yu race.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had formulated a basic strategy for his upcoming journey into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>That is, to avoid conflicts with other powerful beings as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan's purpose was different from theirs.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan came so late, instead of entering when the secret realm first opened, was to avoid the "peak period" when the powerful beings of other races entered the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm could only be maintained for a hundred years after opening.</p><p></p><p>So the earlier one enters the secret realm, the greater the potential gains.</p><p></p><p>By entering a few years later, Lin Yuan was less likely to encounter the large batches of powerful beings from other races who entered first.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in." </p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan stepped into the starry sky emanating spatial fluctuations not far away.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan kept walking into this starry region, he sensed the distorted spatial changes.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence, any powerful being entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm will randomly enter the outer region of the secret realm," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he did not team up with the other evolvers from human civilization to enter together.</p><p></p><p>Because no matter how they teamed up, once they entered the secret realm, they would be separated anyway, so there was no point.</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations became more and more distorted.</p><p></p><p>After the space stabilized a bit, Lin Yuan had already left the main spatial layer of the main universe and entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately carefully observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The physical defense secret treasure and soul defense secret treasure were both activated.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem like I've entered any danger zone or the like," Lin Yuan looked at the earth-yellow continent around him and felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, one would randomly appear in the outer region of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>This "randomness" was very crucial - one could end up in some kind of danger zone.</p><p></p><p>Although the outermost region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm posed basically no threat to ninth-grade lifeforms, those few forbidden areas were exceptions.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like my luck is not bad."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. His current location was still quite safe for now, and his initial entry point into the secret realm was decent.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial layers"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed that as a complete world, the Xuanhuang Secret Realm naturally also gave rise to myriad spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"This secret realm possesses far more than forty thousand spatial layers," Lin Yuan opened forty-five thousand spatial layers within his inner world, so he could roughly sense the number of spatial layers outside.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to shift or teleport."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried again and confirmed a piece of intelligence provided by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, there existed an invisible spatial suppression. Ninth-grade lifeforms could fuse into the myriad spatial layers, but could not shift or teleport by relying on spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the only way to travel was by flying.</p><p></p><p>"The source of the summoning is in the core region?" Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The vast Xuanhuang Secret Realm was divided into the outer region, inner region, and core region.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the core region, the more opportunities and treasures there were, but the competition also became fiercer.</p><p></p><p>In addition to competing with other races, there were also the native lifeforms of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. The native lifeforms in the core region were far stronger than those in the inner and outer regions.</p><p></p><p>Some could even suppress ninth-grade trillionaires.</p><p></p><p>"Need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>However, even in the core region, not everywhere was dangerous. Those treasure lands and opportunity lands were indeed dangerous, but if there were no such lands, it was relatively safe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no interest in those treasure lands or opportunity lands. He only needed to successfully enter the core region and figure out the source of the summoning sensation.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately set off, transforming into a stream of light, flying towards the source of the summoning sensation.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fused into a spatial layer and flew rapidly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thousand-meter-long giant snake suddenly opened its eyes on the earth-yellow path below.</p><p></p><p>"Outsider?"</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest of the native lifeforms born in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had keen senses towards the myriad spatial layers within the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The means by which ninth-grade powerful beings from the main universe fused into spatial layers could hardly escape the detection of these natives.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Indigenous life forms. </p><p></p><p>Because this is their home turf.</p><p></p><p>New novel at 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This thousand-meter giant snake opened its huge mouth and unleashed a yellowish-brown pillar of light. </p><p></p><p>The pillar of light instantly sliced through space, blasting towards the space layer where Lin Yuan was located.</p><p></p><p>In the battle between ninth-rank experts, the most important thing is to lock onto the space layer the opponent occupies, because only then can you attack their true body.</p><p></p><p>And this is also the most difficult part.</p><p></p><p>Every ninth-rank expert is extremely careful in concealing their true self. </p><p></p><p>They may even constantly switch the space layer they occupy.</p><p></p><p>But these cannot be hidden from the indigenous life forms within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who was flying on his way, slightly changed his expression.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a bluish-green shield appeared in front of him, blocking the incoming pillar of light attack.</p><p></p><p>"Indigenous life form?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already aware of the abilities of the indigenous life forms in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, his expression slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>"That previous attack was probably equivalent to the strike of a ninth-rank expert who has opened hundreds of space layers," Lin Yuan roughly estimated.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, don't blame me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the thousand-meter giant snake below, killing intent flickering in his eyes.  </p><p></p><p>Currently, the space layers within Lin Yuan's inner world totaled forty-three thousand layers.</p><p></p><p>But this did not mean that Lin Yuan's strength was at the forty-three thousand layer level.</p><p></p><p>After other ninth-rank experts comprehended the complete space rules, the size of their inner worlds reached the limit.</p><p></p><p>So the standard for measuring a ninth-rank life form's strength was mainly based on the number of space layers they had opened.</p><p></p><p>The more space layers opened, the stronger their strength, exhibiting a positive correlation.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different, his inner world spanned a vast area of one to two billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The strength of forty-three thousand space layers, when applied to Lin Yuan, was at least on par with those ninth-rank experts who had opened hundreds of thousands of space layers.</p><p></p><p>After all, the foundation was there.</p><p></p><p>So when facing this indigenous life form whose strength was only at the ninth-rank ten-layer realm, Lin Yuan decided to strike swiftly.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the indigenous life form took the upper hand, even if you tried to flee, it would keep chasing you, which would be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward, actively emerging from the space layer. The power of the world operated as layer upon layer of space power converged.</p><p></p><p>He directly pierced through that thousand-meter giant snake.</p><p></p><p>"Outsider!!" </p><p></p><p>The thousand-meter giant snake let out an enraged roar, then its eyes dimmed, and its massive body fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan approached and began studying the corpse of this indigenous life form.</p><p></p><p>The indigenous life forms of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, whether alive or dead, could not leave the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if forcibly taken out, they would instantly turn to ashes the moment they left the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>So until now, human civilization has not deeply researched these indigenous life forms.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the 'Xuanhuang' crystal." Lin Yuan took out a fist-sized yellow crystal from the area of the thousand-meter giant snake's heart.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang crystal is a specialty of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the core of the indigenous life forms within the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>A Xuanhuang crystal of this fist-size, if taken to the main world, could easily be exchanged for a hundred thousand universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>The special power contained within the Xuanhuang crystal has remarkable effects for certain evolutionary alien experts of certain systems.</p><p></p><p>The indigenous life forms of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm will turn to ashes once they leave the secret realm.  </p><p></p><p>Only the Xuanhuang crystal can be preserved.</p><p></p><p>This is also the only thing Lin Yuan can take out from the indigenous life forms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. The normal worth of a ninth-rank expert is probably between two million to three billion universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>A hundred thousand universe crystals may not be much for a ninth-rank expert, but what he has obtained now was very easy.</p><p></p><p>"Proceed forward."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had formulated a strategy for entering the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely do not contend for opportunity treasures.</p><p></p><p>But the indigenous life forms came to him of their own accord.</p><p></p><p>This did not violate the strategy Lin Yuan had set.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, over a month went by.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had traveled about halfway through the outer region.</p><p></p><p>During these one to two months, Lin Yuan encountered five ambushes by indigenous life forms. Their strengths varied, with the strongest on par with the ten-thousand-layer realm of ninth-rank experts, and the weakest not even reaching the ten-layer realm upon entering the ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>"In less than two months, I have obtained six Xuanhuang crystals, totaling an estimated value close to a million universe crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat amazed in his heart.  </p><p></p><p>A million universe crystals? Even for a ninth-rank expert, earning this many universe crystals was not easy, equivalent to about half the net worth of an ordinary ninth-rank ten-layer-realm expert.</p><p></p><p>And this was the result of Lin Yuan deliberately avoiding those opportunity sites.</p><p></p><p>If he had intentionally searched for opportunities, the gains would probably have skyrocketed several times over.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those alien experts are so interested in this secret realm. Back then, when my teacher was only an eighth-rank invincible, he even risked entering to reap such rewards."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It could be expected that as long as one could leave this secret realm alive, one would definitely profit immensely.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Another indigenous life form has discovered me?"  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced down at the continent below, where a hundred-meter-tall giant bear was glaring at him angrily. Although separated by many space layers, Lin Yuan knew it was looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"One of the weakest indigenous life forms."  </p><p></p><p>"Equivalent to the initial ninth rank level."</p><p></p><p>"Take the initiative."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly emerged from the space layer, activating his ninth-rank attack treasure to blast towards the hundred-meter giant bear.</p><p></p><p>Far away from Lin Yuan's location on the other side, a three-headed alien seemed to sense something the moment Lin Yuan actively emerged from the space layer and looked this way.</p><p></p><p>"That ninth-rank attack treasure is from the Tian Yu race? This human evolutionary expert is the famous Galactic Star Master?"</p><p></p><p>This three-headed alien was also hiding within many space layers, observing from afar as Lin Yuan swiftly killed the hundred-meter giant bear, a strange glint flickering in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that because of other matters, I delayed entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, only to encounter such a surprise?"  </p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>The tribe he belonged to was under the Bug Clan Grand Alliance, which was in complete enmity with humans.</p><p></p><p>Within the Bug Clan Grand Alliance, there had long been bounties placed on the Galactic Star Master. Even just killing one of the Galactic Star Master's avatars could earn a generous reward.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred-meter giant bear killed by the Galactic Star Master was only at the initial ninth rank level of strength. If the Galactic Star Master is at the initial ninth rank but can achieve this level, his true strength is probably not weaker than a ninth-rank expert who has opened thousands of space layers."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien quickly analyzed in his heart. "I have opened twenty-six thousand space layers, at the ninth-rank ten-thousand-layer realm. If I take action against the Galactic Star Master, I should have a ninety percent chance of success."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed alien's heart pounded with excitement, especially with the generous bounty offered by the Bug Clan.  After his analysis, he believed he could handle the Galactic Star Master without much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I give it a try?"</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 448 "The True" Doors to the Myriad Realms (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate the Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yumeng swept a glance at "Qu Li Xiao" and reminded him, "Human civilization actually dares to let such a genius enter the battlefield, they must have made some preparations."</p><p></p><p>After Tian Yumeng said this, a series of battle scenes appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>These were the scenes of Lin Yuan's actions after entering the super-large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan didn't leave any survivors each time he acted, except for the ancient god Tuoba, the other alien powerhouses were just avatars.</p><p></p><p>The main body and the avatars shared memories, so the full battle process could be restored through the main body's memories.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord's main method should be the Xuanhuang domain ability."</p><p></p><p>"The power of this ability is so great that it can suppress ordinary top-tier weapons."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we drag it out slowly, none of the Eleventh Realm experts wielding the ultimate weapons can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yumeng watched the battle footage. As the battlefield commander of the Tian Yue Alliance, she needed to constantly pay attention to the information and intelligence of the powerhouses in other peak force camps, in order to make adjustments to the battle situation and use her own strengths to attack the opponents' weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Lord is most adept at suppression and protracted warfare. Although she didn't know how the Galactic Lord could maintain such a high-level Xuanhuang domain for a long time, the abilities possessed by "Qu Li Xiao" were precisely what could counter such methods.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Tian Yumeng ultimately chose to have "Qu Li Xiao" deal with the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang domain is just one of the methods the Galactic Lord has revealed, it doesn't represent all of the Galactic Lord's abilities, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yumeng looked at "Qu Li Xiao". She knew of his pride, so she gave him a reminder.</p><p></p><p>In fact, experts like Tian Yumeng and Qu Li Xiao, who are at the peak of the Eleventh Realm, are the candidates selected by the major peak force groups to assault the ultimate. Normally, they would not take the field, but would focus on cultivating to break through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was only because the super-large battlefield was of great importance that they could spare the effort to enter the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Qu Li Xiao thought for a while and nodded, saying, "Even if I can't defeat the Galactic Lord, I can hold him back. I don't care about the other human powerhouses, but I can guarantee that the Galactic Lord won't be able to provide support."</p><p></p><p>"Holding him back is enough." Tian Yumeng nodded in satisfaction. She valued the Galactic Lord highly. If Xuanyuan Yu was not the top disciple of the Xuanyuan Supremacy, based on the current information and analysis, the threat posed by the Galactic Lord would be greater than Xuanyuan Yu.</p><p></p><p>She would definitely want to personally try the Galactic Lord and see what this renowned genius of the peak force groups is like.</p><p></p><p>Next, Tian Yumeng analyzed the other evolved humans of the Human Civilization Alliance and arranged for the Tian Yue Alliance's powerhouses to deal with them one by one.</p><p></p><p>"The Human Civilization Alliance is almost done, now it's time for the Calamity Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Yumeng's expression became much more cautious, and the other Tian Yue Alliance powerhouses were the same.</p><p></p><p>Although the Human Civilization was powerful, the Calamity Tribe was even more unfathomable. As a tribe suspected to have originated from the previous cosmic era, the Calamity Tribe had the smallest number of forces among the Twelve Peak Force Groups.</p><p></p><p>The two Twelfth Realm ultimate experts of the Calamity Tribe were the strongest among all the Twelfth Realm experts in the universe, and they had probably already reached the peak of the "Paving the Dao" realm.</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm ultimate experts of the Calamity Tribe were extremely powerful, and the powerhouses below the Twelfth Realm could also sweep away those at the same level.</p><p></p><p>In this super-large battlefield, the number of Eleventh Realm evolved humans in the Human Civilization Alliance was close to two thousand, which was in the upper-middle range. The number of Eleventh Realm powerhouses in the Calamity Tribe was the least, less than a hundred.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Tian Yumeng was as cautious as facing a great enemy, and she arranged for herself, two other strongest Eleventh Realm experts, and dozens of Eleventh Realm perfected ones to join forces to hold back the strongest Eleventh Realm expert of the Calamity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Calamity Tribe is scarce in number, otherwise, even if we join forces with the other nine peak force groups, we might not be able to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Tian Yumeng thought to herself, compared to the special lives nurtured by the universe, the members of the Calamity Tribe were even more difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Each member of the Calamity Tribe had grown up in endless calamities, with their combat and survival experience reaching the extreme, and the inheritance secrets of the Calamity Tribe were also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>This made the Calamity Tribe the most special among the Twelve Peak Force Groups - the smallest in number, but the most formidable in deterrence.</p><p></p><p>Insect Tribe Battlefield Base.</p><p></p><p>Massive mother nests floated in the space, and terrifying Insect Tribe warriors were rapidly being bred.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the will of the Insect Tribe mother nests was constantly interweaving, conducting highly efficient communication.</p><p></p><p>"No. 387 Rong, you are responsible for breeding Insect Tribe warriors with defense reaching Eleventh Realm perfection."</p><p></p><p>"No. 778 Rong, you are responsible for breeding Insect Tribe warriors with attack reaching Eleventh Realm perfection."</p><p></p><p>"No. 1923 Rong, you are responsible for breeding Insect Tribe warriors with soul illusion reaching Eleventh Realm perfection."</p><p></p><p>Massive mental wills were constantly spreading between the various mother nests.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the other peak force groups' combat methods, the Insect Tribe's combat method was only one - the "Insect Sea".</p><p></p><p>By continuously breeding Insect Tribe warriors with different focuses, and then perfectly integrating and coordinating them under the control of the Insect Tribe mother nests, even if an Insect Tribe warrior's defense reached Eleventh Realm perfection, it would be just a sitting target in front of other Eleventh Realm perfected ones, posing no threat.</p><p></p><p>But if you add an attack-focused Eleventh Realm perfected Insect Tribe warrior, and a soul illusion-focused Eleventh Realm perfected Insect Tribe warrior, and so on, all perfectly coordinated under the Insect Tribe mother nests' control, even if they are not as strong as a single Eleventh Realm perfected expert, they would likely not be far off.</p><p></p><p>If this number is multiplied by ten thousand, a hundred thousand, or a million, even Eleventh Realm perfected experts would feel their scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to breed an Insect Tribe warrior reaching Eleventh Realm perfection in a certain aspect, it is a huge consumption for the Insect Tribe mother nests, not only in terms of resources, but also an undeniable burden on their mental power.</p><p></p><p>Calamity Tribe Battlefield Base.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the battlefield bases of other peak force groups, the Calamity Tribe's battlefield base was much smaller. However, the aura of oppression emanating from the entire battlefield base was no less than the others, and even stronger in some aspects.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the battlefield base, about a hundred Calamity Tribe powerhouses stood or sat in groups of three or two.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Tribe was different from other peak force groups - there was no such thing as a "Calamity Tribe Alliance". The entire Calamity Tribe battlefield base had no presence of other tribes.</p><p></p><p>According to the Calamity Tribe's view, only the weak need alliances, the strong have no need for such things.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Calamity Tribe was targeted by the cosmic will, and any life form that gets close to the Calamity Tribe would also be suppressed and attacked by the cosmic will, so no tribe dared to ally with the Calamity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Calamity Tribe, under the targeting of the cosmic will, had only a one-in-a-million or one-in-ten-million chance of growing up. As for other ordinary life forms? Daring to get close to the Calamity Tribe would risk their entire tribe being wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Danger.</p><p></p><p>"This battlefield, the leadership is ours Jie Clan for the first time."</p><p></p><p>The powerful Jie Clan expert sitting at the highest place spoke, his tone filled with a sense of self-evident confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, are there any remarkable experts worth a look in the universe?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that a remarkable genius has emerged in human civilization, who reached the 11th realm in just five to six hundred years, and has also attained the 5th realm of mastery over space-time."</p><p></p><p>"The geniuses in the universe are blessed by the universe, their cultivation progressing smoothly, unlike us Jie Clan, where every step forward requires facing unimaginably great risks, constantly walking on the edge of evolutionary path collapse."</p><p></p><p>The Jie Clan experts exchanged views, though they had some interest in the Galactic Lord, it was only that much, and they did not take this human genius seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>For the Jie Clan, every step forward requires paying a thousandfold, ten-thousandfold more in blood and sweat compared to other clan experts, with a mortality rate ten-thousand, hundred-thousand times higher.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Jie Clan experts who can advance further and survive possess strength far exceeding their peers at the same level.</p><p></p><p>A normal Jie Clan 11th realm cultivator would be on par with the mightiest 11th realm experts of the major powers, but as for the strongest Jie Clan 11th realm? It would take the combined efforts of all the peak clan powers' strongest 11th realm experts to barely hold them back.</p><p></p><p>This is just barely holding them back, if the strongest Jie Clan 11th realm gets bored, they would only need to pay a small price to break free, something the other clans' strongest 11th realm cannot stop.</p><p></p><p>Human Civilization Alliance's war base.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the control room, carefully observing the structure of the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful, so this is how space-time can be utilized?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan became more and more engrossed the more he observed. Although he and the 12th realm ultimate existences both had attained the 6th realm of space-time comprehension, the gap in life realm made it difficult for Lin Yuan to fully grasp the essence of the space-time fusion principles. But now, through this massive battlefield, he was able to glimpse a bit of it.</p><p></p><p>The opening of this massive battlefield was a joint effort of multiple 12th realm ultimate existences, its help to Lin Yuan far exceeding the guidance of a single 12th realm ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly as he contemplated.</p><p></p><p>In every aspect, the massive battlefield surpassed the large-scale battlefields, except for one flaw - the lack of substantial permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>This was because the massive battlefield was newly established, and the peak clan powers had not yet engaged in any high-intensity warfare.</p><p></p><p>But it could be foreseen that as more large-scale, all-out wars took place, with the peak clan powers unleashing their 12th realm trump cards, the appearance of permanent spatial rifts would be an inevitable outcome.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the permanent spatial rifts, Lin Yuan's mind turned to the Breaching Source Force.</p><p></p><p>The total Breaching Source Force Lin Yuan had accumulated had now approached 1,100 strands.</p><p></p><p>After the 10th round of traversal, Lin Yuan's Breaching Source Force had neared a thousand strands.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the avatar he left behind in the large-scale battlefield had been continuously collecting Breaching Source Force at a rate of 90 strands per day.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Myriad Worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness sank deep into his mind, gazing upon the majestic and grand Gate of Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the 11th realm, Lin Yuan could easily sense that the Gate of Myriad Worlds had solidified significantly, almost becoming tangible.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan first saw the Gate of Myriad Worlds, it was extremely illusory, but as his life realm continued to soar, the Gate of Myriad Worlds gradually became more real.</p><p></p><p>It had a similar feeling to the secret art "Illusory Reality" created by the Demon Jade Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>No, the reality of the Gate of Myriad Worlds was even more real than all realities, compared to the Gate of Myriad Worlds, Lin Yuan himself felt like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when I reach the 12th realm and become an ultimate existence, the Gate of Myriad Worlds will solidify into true reality?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently pondered, the current Gate of Myriad Worlds, though nearly real, was still not the true reality, only a projection of the genuine Gate of Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>And based on the gradual transformation of the Gate of Myriad Worlds over the years, from illusory to real, Lin Yuan had formed this conjecture.</p><p></p><p>If no unexpected events occurred, when Lin Yuan became an Almighty, with a significant transformation in his life realm, the Gate of Myriad Worlds would likewise undergo a transition towards true reality.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what changes will occur once the Gate of Myriad Worlds becomes truly real?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious, as his journey to the two-dimensional world had led him to speculate that the Gate of Myriad Worlds might be a treasure belonging to the realm of the Perfect Time Life.</p><p></p><p>The Perfect Time Life? That was the realm and boundary that Emperor Xuan and the Demon Jade Tower Master had pursued their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Perfect Time Life did not exist in the present or the past, but in the future or other timelines.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind suddenly stirred, looking towards the outside of the control room.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Yu and the other 11th realm cultivators of human civilization were waiting there, wanting to seek an audience with him.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the control room entrance and teleported everyone inside.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Yu slightly bowed, without a trace of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>As the direct disciple of the first Almighty of human civilization, Xuan Yu's status in human civilization was absolutely the highest among those below the nine Almighties.</p><p></p><p>But facing the Galactic Lord? Xuan Yu displayed sufficient respect.</p><p></p><p>From the occasional hints dropped by the Almighty Xuan, Xuan Yu knew that the Galactic Lord was the existence with the greatest hope of becoming the mightiest in human civilization's history.</p><p></p><p>What a concept was this?</p><p></p><p>Xuan Yu dared not ponder too deeply.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that he must not offend the Galactic Lord in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Even the Almighties believed the Galactic Lord had the greatest chance of reaching the 12th realm, to offend the Galactic Lord now would be tantamount to offending a future Almighty.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, despite having the protection of the Almighty Xuan, Xuan Yu could not bear the consequences.</p><p></p><p>If Xuan Yu was like this, the other 11th realm cultivators naturally felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>They all bowed and greeted: "Greetings, Galactic Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan glanced at the group and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the plan we have discussed to deal with other alien experts. Please take a look, Galactic Lord." Xuan Yu sent Lin Yuan an email detailing how to deal with various alien experts, especially the specific countermeasures against the mightiest 11th realm experts of the peak powers.</p><p></p><p>These were all arranged by Xuan Yu based on the intelligence gathered by the Human Civilization Alliance, and the capabilities of each of their own 11th realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that they had considered everything comprehensively.</p><p></p><p>The reason they came to seek Lin Yuan's audience was to obtain the consent of the Human Civilization Alliance's war commander.</p><p></p><p>Without Lin Yuan's approval, the plan devised by Xuan Yu and the many 11th realm experts could not be executed.</p><p></p><p>"If the Galactic Lord has any opinions, please feel free to voice them, and I will incorporate them." Xuan Yu added before sending the email.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the email and casually browsed through it.</p>

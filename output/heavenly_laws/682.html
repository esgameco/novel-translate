        <h1>Chapter 682</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is a good thing," the Ancestor of the Great Abyss thought.</p><p></p><p>Although in this timeline, the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy has displayed terrifying methods, transforming into the 'Black Dragon' with strength almost reaching the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy is not the enemy of the Ancestor of the Great Abyss.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, their relationship is quite good, at least with the Ancestor of the Great Abyss's efforts to befriend him, the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy has a fairly good attitude towards him.</p><p></p><p>And in this timeline, the Black Dragon that the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy transformed into should be the result of comprehending the 'Heart of the Abyss Dragon'.</p><p></p><p>And the 'Heart of the Abyss Dragon' was given by the Ancestor of the Great Abyss, which has subtly added to their friendship.</p><p></p><p>"How can the gap between lives be so large?" the Ancestor of Thunder sighed. Originally, he thought that the Thirteenth Realm of time life would already be the pinnacle of all beings.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy, even as a time life, they pale in comparison.</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestors nodded in agreement, the more they observed Lin Yuan's timeline, the more they were overwhelmed by a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's growth rate is really too fast, fast enough to make even time lives feel a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this new birthing ground dispute that made the Ancestor of Blazing Sun and the other five Ancestors aware of the existence of the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy, </p><p></p><p>perhaps by the time the Ancestors noticed Lin Yuan, he would have already crossed into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy becomes, the more beneficial it is to us," the Ancestor of Savage Wilderness spoke. According to the future flashes in the timeline, being an enemy of the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy would certainly be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>But if they could become friends with the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy, as long as the relationship is not too bad, they won't be affected much.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate that the Celestial Sovereign of the Galaxy will touch the Realm of Time Lord in three hundred million years in the future," the Ancestor of Great Spirit said. In the future they currently observed, the three hundred million years were forbidden, that period was sealed, and anyone who dared to watch it would be counterattacked.</p><p></p><p>And the only ones capable of doing this are the Time Lords.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Ancestors speculated that in three hundred million years, Lin Yuan might have a great cause and effect with a certain Time Lord, causing his own time period to be sealed.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems more likely that Lin Yuan himself will become a Time Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Time Lord?" The other Ancestors exchanged glances, their hearts shaken with amazement.</p><p></p><p>The Thirteenth Realm time lives can observe countless past and future timelines, but theoretically the future timelines are infinite, no matter how many timelines they see, they cannot possibly know all the timelines, they can only approach it infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for the Thirteenth Realm to break through to the Fourteenth Realm and become a perfect time life, the first thing they must do is to condense their own timeline, completely dominate a timeline, and become the lord of that timeline, that is, the Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Time Lord is unimaginably great. At the Time Lord realm, they are no longer limited to a certain dimensional space, but roam freely between different outer dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>After all, even for the Thirteenth Realm time lives, other dimensional spaces are still unfamiliar, and they will encounter dangers if they are not careful.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestors observed Lin Yuan's future timeline, which Lin Yuan himself was also aware of.</p><p></p><p>When the five Ancestors visited him, they also mentioned whether they could continue to observe his timeline.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan agreed, he also wanted to know how definite his future really was.</p><p></p><p>And the Ancestors also promised that if they discovered a particularly special future timeline, they would tell him in time.</p><p></p><p>Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, refining one precious black jade after another.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual will intensity should have broken through three hundred million points by now, right?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes. The first-class blessed land of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, the Black Jade Nest, produces precious black jades that have a great effect on tempering and enhancing spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's spiritual will now reaching three hundred million points is not solely relying on the precious black jades.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the use of black jades in this is not that great.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of spiritual will has two main aspects.</p><p></p><p>One aspect is internal.</p><p></p><p>The other aspect is external.</p><p></p><p>The internal is the improvement of the life's own strength and realm, which can naturally give birth to stronger spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>And in this period, Lin Yuan's own strength has undergone several transformations, such as evolving the Chaos Yin-Yang Grand Dao, practicing the 'Infinite Void' to the fourth layer, and crossing into the Chaos Realm, etc.</p><p></p><p>The rapid rise of life realm and strength has naturally also brought about a great enhancement of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Especially the evolution of the Chaos Yin-Yang Grand Dao, this power has brought Lin Yuan an all-round metamorphosis, including the enhancement of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>As for the external reason?</p><p></p><p>The 'black jades' produced by the Black Jade Nest can also be considered an external reason.</p><p></p><p>But the six ancient kingdoms do not only have black jades that can enhance and temper spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Other precious rarities can also have a similar effect.</p><p></p><p>For example, the 'Dragon Abyss Blood' produced by the Dragon Abyss Valley.</p><p></p><p>Refining the 'Dragon Abyss Blood' can not only enhance spiritual will, but also comprehensively improve the physical body and soul, etc.</p><p></p><p>And after experiencing the blessed land dispute, Lin Yuan has made transactions with the various ancient kingdoms, and the Dragon Abyss Blood alone...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The 100 jin of Dragon Abyss blood, even if half of it was left for comprehension and research, the remaining half was enough to greatly enhance Lin Yuan's spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in addition to the black jade and Dragon Abyss blood, there were other rare treasures that Lin Yuan had obtained through trading with the ancient countries, all of which he had used on himself during this period.</p><p></p><p>With the combination of external and internal factors, Lin Yuan's spiritual will, which was less than a hundred million before he took control of the Black Jade's nest, had now directly crossed the threshold of three hundred million.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the improvement of spiritual will becomes increasingly difficult as it advances. Yet, Lin Yuan had experienced a four to five-fold surge in a short period of time. Even if the main reason was the breakthrough in his realm and strength, one could imagine how much benefit he had absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred million spiritual will, it is estimated to have reached the limit of the Twelfth Realm. If I continue, even if there is an increase, it will not be too much," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that his spiritual will had already approached a certain limit, and that to achieve another exponential surge, he would probably have to wait until he crossed into the Thirteenth Realm and experienced a leap in his fundamental essence of life.</p><p></p><p>"However, three hundred million spiritual will is already enough for me to divert a portion of my mental power to try and explore the next source world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan never forgot the coordinates of the thirty-three source worlds deep within the Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the Twelfth Realm, the way Lin Yuan traveled and descended had changed. The traversal after the Twelfth Realm would not affect his true body, but in return, the burden on his spiritual will had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>To the extent that Lin Yuan's spiritual will at the time could only bear the exploration of one source world. If he wanted to explore the second source world, he would have to abandon the first one.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the substantial increase in his spiritual will, Lin Yuan was confident that he could try to explore the second source world while maintaining the true body in the Chaotic Void and the first source world.</p><p></p><p>"The second source world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had not explored the second source world was not only due to the pressure on his spiritual will, but also because of the warning reminder from the Multiverse Gate:</p><p></p><p>The second source world contained unknown dangers, and reckless exploration and descent would encounter irreversible consequences! Lin Yuan believed the judgment of the Multiverse Gate, so he had not taken any action.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The substantial increase Lin Yuan had gained was not only in his spiritual will, but also in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, the improvement in his spiritual will stemmed from the enhancement of his strength.</p><p></p><p>And the danger depends on the strength. With low strength, the danger is naturally greater; with high strength, the danger becomes lower.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind immediately sank into the depths of his consciousness, looking towards the majestic and grand Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Multiverse Gate."</p><p></p><p>Each time Lin Yuan observed the Multiverse Gate, he had a different feeling, and this time was no exception. The Multiverse Gate gave Lin Yuan a sense that it was superior to the very source of the source worlds.</p><p></p><p>"It seems more real than before."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed that the Multiverse Gate deep in his consciousness was a true projection of the real Multiverse Gate, because with his current essence of life, even though he had been recognized by the Multiverse Gate, he still could not bear the descent of the true Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>It was like a small kettle that could not hold the vast oceans.</p><p></p><p>"If I cross into the Thirteenth Realm, even if I still cannot bear the descent of the true Multiverse Gate, I will at least be able to slightly touch the Multiverse Gate's main body, and then explore more of its uses."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful. At this moment, he had already confirmed that the existence of the Multiverse Gate was definitely beyond the Thirteenth Realm, at least superior to the six ancestors of the six ancient countries, as his current feeling was still not as strong as the Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>And this was just a projection of the true Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and tried to enter the depths of the Multiverse Gate, searching for the spatial coordinates of the second source world.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan's consciousness followed the Multiverse Gate, traversing countless spatial dimensions, and vaguely arrived in a gray and hazy world.</p><p></p><p>"This time, there was no warning reminder from the Multiverse Gate?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart was certain that without a specific warning, it meant that this source world posed no real threat to him.</p><p></p><p>The so-called real threat would be one that affected and was linked to the true body in other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, as long as it did not involve the true body in other dimensions, even if the true body in this dimension perished, it would not be a big deal, at most he would just start over.</p><p></p><p>"This world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to briefly observe the details of the second source world from the perspective of the Multiverse Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly. He could feel that the second source world was filled with a sense of death, but at the same time, it also possessed a strange vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>After merely observing for a while, Lin Yuan's consciousness quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Since there is no real danger, I'll just descend directly."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his mind, Lin Yuan looked at the majestic and grand Multiverse Gate, and after just a moment of contemplation, he immediately began to traverse.</p><p></p><p>The destination was the second source world.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!</p><p></p><p>The Multiverse Gate trembled slightly, and a small portion of Lin Yuan's spiritual will was immediately drawn into it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

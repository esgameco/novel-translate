(Happy New Year)</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Black Fog Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang and Liao An were feeling nervous. </p><p></p><p>Their only hope now was that Lin Yuan would be wary of the Tianqing Alliance and not dare to completely turn the tables on them, thus sparing the two of them.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan only sized up the two for a few glances before releasing the demon tree seeds and beginning the parasitic process.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang and Liao An were elders of the Tianqing Alliance and sixth-stage powerhouses, barely meeting Lin Yuan's mental standard for "parasitism".</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the fact that they were high-level cultivators of the Tianqing Alliance made them even more valuable for "parasitism".</p><p></p><p>Buzz!!!</p><p></p><p>Two grayish seeds descended.</p><p></p><p>After perfecting the parasitic effect, the demon tree seeds appeared even darker in color on the surface, with a hint of inexplicable spiritual power circulating.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"He wants to parasitize us."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated old man "Qu Zhuang" immediately deduced what Lin Yuan wanted to do upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>As an elder of the Tianqing Alliance who had fought in the Demon God Battlefield for many years, he was aware of the several methods commonly used by that Demon God from outside the domain.</p><p></p><p>One of them was the parasitic ability. Although the parasitized human cultivators had dull eyes and stiff movements, they inherited most of their combat power from when they were alive and became fearless of death.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, it had a psychological impact on the cultivators on the Tianqing World's side.</p><p></p><p>Former comrades-in-arms who were parasitized today turned to attack them with distorted faces.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you parasitize me, you won't be able to hide it for long. If we disappear for too long, the powerhouses of the Alliance will definitely come looking."</p><p></p><p>Liao An struggled while growling in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were arduously resisting the parasitic ability of the demon seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Won't be able to hide it for long?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly without much explanation.</p><p></p><p>Liao An, Qu Zhuang and other Tianqing Alliance elders' understanding of the parasitic ability of the demon seeds was still limited to the Primordial Demon Tree, the Demon God from outside the domain.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was not the Primordial Demon Tree. The parasitic power of the demon seeds had been constantly perfected by Lin Yuan over decades with his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The parasitic effect was incomparably stronger than the Primordial Demon Tree's.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, one only needed to look at the seven Demon Beast Kings beside them.</p><p></p><p>Liao An and Qu Zhuang never realized from beginning to end that the Demon Beast Kings had already been parasitized, still thinking that they had only submitted to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The demon seeds quickly merged into Liao An and Qu Zhuang's brows.</p><p></p><p>They immediately stood up and bowed respectfully to Lin Yuan, "Master."</p><p></p><p>"Success?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>He confirmed that the demon seeds deep in the minds of the two had been completely integrated.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what exactly brings you to the Black Fog Mountains, and what is the situation on the Demon God Battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>The Ape King had long reported to him that these two Alliance elders had come on the orders of the Tianqing Alliance Leader to recruit their Demon Beast Kings to launch a counterattack on the Demon God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan wanted to ask a few more questions about the specifics.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Tianqing Alliance Leader has determined that the Demon God from outside the domain is in an extremely weakened state, so he plans to launch a counterattack to completely destroy the Demon God Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"To this end, the Tianqing Alliance Leader has decided to mobilize many of the Tianqing World's foundations, such as the Demon Beast Kings of the Ten Great Mountains and certain war machines."</p><p></p><p>"Many of these foundations can only be mobilized by the Deputy Alliance Leaders, so this time, the Alliance Leader has dispatched the twelve Deputy Alliance Leaders, as well as the Guardian Elders, into the Tianqing World."</p><p></p><p>"The aim is to gather the various foundational weapons as soon as possible to launch the counterattack."</p><p></p><p>Liao An said respectfully in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>After being parasitized by the demon seeds, the original body had not essentially died, but was "replaced", so many of the memories were unaffected.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. He naturally knew the reason why the Primordial Demon Tree had fallen into an extremely weakened state.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying that now the twelve Deputy Alliance Leaders of the Tianqing Alliance, as well as the Guardian Elders, are all inside the Tianqing World?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>Liao An and Qu Zhuang looked at each other and nodded affirmatively.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin, looking pensive.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, after you two go out, bring one or two more elders back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Fog Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Liao An and Qu Zhuang turned into streaks of light and flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Which elder should we bring back as per the Master's orders?"</p><p></p><p>Liao An pondered inwardly and glanced at Qu Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Although both of them were Tianqing Alliance elders, in terms of influence and connections, Qu Zhuang definitely far surpassed him.</p><p></p><p>"I do have a candidate in mind."</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang nodded and immediately flew towards another of the Ten Great Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Beast Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Also one of the Ten Great Mountains of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Beast Mountain Range stood a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"These Demon Beast Kings, dilly-dallying, I've already brought the Alliance Leader's decree, yet they still say they need to prepare."</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man, named "Bian Bo", was also one of the Tianqing Alliance elders.</p><p></p><p>This time, he came to the Beast Mountain Range to convey the Alliance Leader's decree, commanding the Demon Beast Kings of the Beast Mountain Range to go to the Demon God Battlefield to launch a counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Just as "Bian Bo" was waiting somewhat impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Two streaks of light suddenly appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Fellow Daoists Qu Zhuang and Liao An."</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo glanced over and immediately smiled and went up to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Bian Bo."</p><p></p><p>The emaciated old man Qu Zhuang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"How is it going? Are these Demon Beast Kings cooperating?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Cooperating?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Alliance Leader's decree, do they dare not cooperate?"</p><p></p><p>"Just these?"</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qu Zhuang, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo sensed something more to his words and asked.</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang and Liao An exchanged glances and said in a low voice, "Brother Bian Bo, you know that the two of us are responsible for the Black Fog Mountains."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo nodded.</p><p></p><p>"When we went to command the Demon Beast Kings of the Black Fog Mountains, those few Demon Beast Kings were quite perceptive. They took the initiative to present treasures, saying that we should take good care of them on the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"There's such a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo was full of envy. The Demon Beast Kings of the Beast Mountain Range didn't have such foresight. Let alone presenting benefits, they didn't even say a few nice words.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qu Zhuang laughed proudly.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what treasures the Demon Beast Kings of the Black Fog Mountains offered?"</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qu Zhuang's expression so good, the treasures must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Milk."</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Earth Milk?" Bian Bo repeated, slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Million-year Earth Milk."</p><p></p><p>Qu Zhuang added two more words.</p><p></p><p>"Million-year Earth Milk?"</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo widened his eyes. This was a great treasure, especially for sixth-stage cultivators like them. It could have the effect of changing tendons and washing marrow.</p><p></p><p>"Million-year Earth Milk cannot be preserved..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It was impossible to take it with us. Liao An and I absorbed it for most of the day until we couldn't continue anymore before coming out," Qu Zhuang said, shaking his head. </p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"The million-year ground milk is a true treasure from heaven and earth. Once it leaves its birthplace, it quickly dissipates," Bian Bo nodded in agreement. </p><p></p><p>This was common knowledge in the cultivation world. But the next moment, Bian Bo reacted. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Qu Zhuang, are you saying there is still some of that million-year ground milk left?" Bian Bo asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"More than just some," Qu Zhuang shook his head and said, "By the way, Brother Qu Zhuang, do you want to go absorb it? It's a rare opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Brother Qu Zhuang," Bian Bo was overjoyed. "It's just that I need to wait here for the Demon Beast King of Wanshou Mountain Range."</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo was a little hesitant. </p><p></p><p>"What's so difficult about that? Liao An, you lead Brother Bian Bo to the deepest part of Black Mist Mountain Range. I'll wait here, how's that?" Qu Zhuang patted his chest and said.</p><p></p><p>"Then..." </p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Brother Qu Zhuang." </p><p></p><p>Bian Bo was moved. Brother Qu Zhuang was such a good person, not only telling him about this great opportunity with the million-year ground milk, but also waiting here for the Demon Beast King on his behalf.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go." </p><p></p><p>"Our relationship will be even closer in the future," Qu Zhuang waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo nodded in affirmation.</p><p></p><p>In front of an emerald green lake, an old man with a goatee was standing there, quietly observing the lake.</p><p></p><p>"Four hundred years ago, the evil gods from outside the domain appeared outside the world. The various forces in the Qingqing World were shaken. Among them, the Black Tortoise Beast King, known as one of the Four Sacred Beasts, fell into slumber here."</p><p></p><p>"Before the Black Tortoise Beast King fell asleep, it made a pact with the Alliance Leader, saying that one day in the future, if there was a major event related to the evil gods from outside the domain, just ask for its help."</p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee was filled with emotions.</p><p></p><p>He was a Guardian of the Qingqing Alliance with peak sixth-stage cultivation. This time, he entered the Qingqing World specifically to awaken the Black Tortoise Beast King.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, the old man with the goatee glanced into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Third Uncle, it's me, Third Uncle." </p><p></p><p>A figure quickly flew over. It was none other than Bian Bo.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bo." </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a high-ranking member of the Qingqing Alliance, the old man with the goatee would occasionally give some help to his descendants and juniors.</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo was the most promising among his descendants and juniors.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee asked directly.</p><p></p><p>He had the task of awakening the Black Tortoise Beast King and couldn't waste too much time.</p><p></p><p>"I have a good friend who went to Black Mist Mountain Range to recruit the Demon Beast King there to go to the Evil God Battlefield," Bian Bo said. </p><p></p><p>"I know about this," the old man with the goatee nodded.</p><p></p><p>The various Vice Alliance Leaders and Guardian Elders who returned from the Evil God Battlefield all had their own tasks to do.</p><p></p><p>"Third Uncle, guess what my good friend discovered in Black Mist Mountain Range."</p><p></p><p>"What did he discover?" </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee asked with some amusement.</p><p></p><p>"A Harmony Flower, a ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower," Bian Bo lowered his voice and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"A ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower?" </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>For a peak sixth-stage cultivator wanting to break through to the seventh stage, besides needing to comprehend the Dao themselves, coming into contact with external objects like a ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower could also shorten or even allow them to skip the process.</p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee, as a peak sixth-stage powerhouse, dreamed of breaking through to the seventh stage. It was just that his innate talent was insufficient. If nothing unexpected happened in the future, he probably wouldn't be able to reach the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>But now, he saw hope.</p><p></p><p>A ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could obtain that ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower, breaking into the seventh stage would definitely be set in stone.</p><p></p><p>At that time, relying on his past merits and his relationship with a few Vice Alliance Leaders, the old man with the goatee would become one of the twelve Vice Alliance Leaders of the Qingqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee stared at Bian Bo. "Also, since it's a ten-thousand-year-old Harmony Flower, why don't you keep it for yourself? Why are you telling me instead?"</p><p></p><p>Although the old man with the goatee had given Bian Bo a lot of help, in the face of such a great opportunity to step into the seventh stage, let alone the two of them being just uncle and nephew, even if they were biological father and son, they might still turn against each other.</p><p></p><p>"Third Uncle." </p><p></p><p>"The eight Demon Beast Kings of Black Mist Mountain Range have joined forces to occupy the Harmony Flower. I simply can't get my hands on it."</p><p></p><p>"That's why I came to tell Third Uncle," Bian Bo said.</p><p></p><p>"Why not report it to the alliance?" the old man with the goatee asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to tell Third Uncle. When Third Uncle steps into the seventh stage and becomes a Vice Alliance Leader, don't forget about Little Bo."</p><p></p><p>Bian Bo's face showed a timely look of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"I see." </p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This made sense now.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Bian Bo didn't want to obtain the Harmony Flower.</p><p></p><p>It was that he simply couldn't get it. If this dragged on any longer, those few Demon Beast Kings would probably swallow it.</p><p></p><p>"These Demon Beast Kings are a bunch of trash. We humans are defending against the invasion of the evil gods on the battlefield, while these beasts are enjoying themselves in the rear."</p><p></p><p>"Treasures like the Harmony Flower should belong to us humans in the first place, yet they still want to monopolize it."</p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee was furious. "Little Bo, take me there. I want to see which Demon Beast Kings dare to occupy the Harmony Flower."</p><p></p><p>The old man with the goatee immediately set off with Bian Bo towards Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of awakening the Black Tortoise Beast King, it wasn't urgent. It wouldn't be too late to do it after obtaining the Harmony Flower.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, on a tall mountain, a tall man stood with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"This place seals one of the greatest foundations of our Qingqing World, an unstoppable war machine."</p><p></p><p>The tall man's expression was slightly sentimental.</p><p></p><p>As the Vice Alliance Leader of the Qingqing Alliance, second only to the Alliance Leader, only he had the "authority" to activate this foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Alliance Leader Gao." </p><p></p><p>"Vice Alliance Leader Gao." </p><p></p><p>"I have a major discovery to report to you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a beam of light quickly flew over.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the old man with the goatee.</p><p></p><p>"What major discovery?" </p><p></p><p>Vice Alliance Leader Gao turned his head and glanced at the old man with the goatee.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingqing Alliance, the old man with the goatee was under his command, and the two had a relatively close relationship.</p><p></p><p>"I have a nephew who discovered traces of a world weapon in Black Mist Mountain Range," the old man with the goatee said in a low voice after using a technique to prevent others from eavesdropping.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later, deep in Black Mist Mountain Range, the twelve Vice Alliance Leaders, thirty-three Guardians, one hundred and fifty-six Elders, four Sacred Beast Kings, and ninety-three Demon Beast Kings of the Qingqing Alliance all stood there respectfully, answering Lin Yuan's various questions about the secrets of the Qingqing World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the sixteen seventh-stage powerhouses, eighty-eight peak sixth-stage powerhouses, and one hundred and ninety-four sixth-stage powerhouses, and couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>You say, how did I, a double agent sent in by the evil gods from outside the domain, end up controlling the entire Qingqing World?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please move your fingers and share this website on Facebook so that we can continue operating]</p>

        <h1>Chapter 525</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in the space-time fluctuations around him. Every thread of space-time fluctuation appeared perfect in Lin Yuan's eyes, completely different from the space-time fluctuations of the chaotic void, yet equally existent.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the seventh level of space-time advanced from the early stage to the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>"This is too exaggerated," Lin Yuan steadied himself, feeling extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary supreme beings, advancing from the early to middle stage of the seventh level of space-time would take at least several cosmic eras or even dozens of cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, who possessed heaven-defying comprehension ability, after breaking through to the twelfth level and experiencing a surge in his ability to comprehend laws, he thought it would take several thousand years to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>This was already considered extremely fast - a thousand years in the universe would only be a few years in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>It only took half a day?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those thirteenth-level time beings all yearn to explore other dimensional worlds," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The rules exhibited in different dimensional worlds may present different aspects, and these different aspects of rules play a crucial role in improving one's comprehension of rules to reach a perfect level.</p><p></p><p>What's the difference between time beings advancing towards perfect time beings? Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Every aspect of perfect time beings is perfect.</p><p></p><p>The rules they comprehend, their physical bodies and souls, are all incomparably perfect, encompassing everything.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's previous dozen or so dimensional jumps, the dimensional worlds he arrived at were all of a lower level than the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Even the immortal realm was barely on the same level as the main universe, but still far inferior to the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Being inferior to the main universe and chaotic void in terms of level, naturally the rules operating there were largely encompassed by the rules of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But this source world? In terms of time flow rate, it was no weaker than the chaotic void, and the aspects of rules it operated on were in a completely different direction from the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The impact of rules operating in different directions on someone with heaven-defying comprehension ability like Lin Yuan was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>"This is marvelous."</p><p></p><p>"So this is how the metal rule works? It doesn't just symbolize sharpness?"</p><p></p><p>"And the water rule? It also has an extremely destructive aspect?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was fascinated. The operation of rules in this source world represented a completely different great path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not just a different cultivation path, but a different great path of cultivation, completely different from that of the main universe and chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>It was like looking at different solution approaches for the same problem, which had an unimaginable effect on understanding the essence of the problem.</p><p></p><p>While devoting most of his attention to comprehending the operation of the source rules of this world, Lin Yuan began to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Yu Yan (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Master of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds]</p><p>[Bound Talent: Heaven-Defying Comprehension]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Blood Rebirth]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Mountain Moving]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Enhancement]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Elemental Body]</p><p>[Divine Ability: World]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Sky Rending]</p><p>[Current Status: Consciousness Descended]</p><p>[Remaining Stay Time: None]</p><p></p><p>"The remaining stay time is 'None'?"</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean there's no limit to how long I can stay in this world? Until I die or voluntarily choose to return?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Also, for this dimensional jump, I split off nearly half of my true spirit consciousness from my true body. Strictly speaking, this body of mine is no longer an avatar, but more like a split body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>With so much true spirit consciousness, even if Lin Yuan's true body in the main universe and chaotic void were to perish, he wouldn't die. Essentially, there was no difference between him now and his true body.</p><p></p><p>"My survival abilities have improved a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. The Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds after the twelfth level truly revealed its terrifying aspects.</p><p></p><p>"What I need to do now is to continue perfecting my martial path based on the rules operating in this source world," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Different dimensional worlds operate on different rules, revealing different aspects, so naturally the martial path also needs to adapt to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>When his martial path reaches the point where he can exert his full strength in any dimensional world, that will be the moment Lin Yuan steps into the realm of perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>The path of perfect time beings is universal across all heavens and worlds, infinite dimensions, requiring no adaptation or perfection, because they themselves are the most perfect.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of divine ability this physical body will awaken?" Lin Yuan was quite expectant.</p><p></p><p>Condensing bloodline power to give birth to physical divine abilities was a unique advantage of the martial cultivation system. After awakening several physical divine abilities before, Lin Yuan had drawn a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>That is, the strength of physical divine abilities was related to two factors: one was the information contained in the bloodline itself, and the other was the level of the world one was in.</p><p></p><p>Everything in the Ancient Blazing Sun Empire originated from that Blazing Sun Ancestor. Even now, the radiance of the Blazing Sun Ancestor still illuminated the entire Ancient Blazing Sun Empire.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the Yu family, Dongyang family, and many other families all had a trace of the Blazing Sun Ancestor's bloodline, but this trace was so weak it was almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial cultivation system could excavate all bloodlines within the body, then select the strongest one to condense into a corresponding physical divine ability.</p><p></p><p>No matter how thin the Blazing Sun Ancestor's bloodline was, as long as it existed, it could be condensed. It was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>And for this jump, Lin Yuan's stay time in this source world...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were no restrictions, with plenty of time to consume.</p><p></p><p>At the Dongyang family home. Dongyang Meng stood there quietly, with stunningly beautiful features.</p><p></p><p>"That Yujia brat truly has great luck, to have withstood even our clan's Black Falling Force," frowned the Dongyang clan leader from his seat above.</p><p></p><p>After Dongyang Meng lured out Yu Yan, the main powerhouses of the Dongyang family mostly did not take action in order to avoid drawing the Yu family's attention. Instead, they used the Black Falling Force refined by the Dongyang family ancestor to strike at Yu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Black Falling Force was an ultimate destructive power. Even with the many trump cards of the Yu family protecting him, Yu Yan shouldn't have been able to resist for long. Yet he actually managed to hold out until reaching his family, and then survived.</p><p></p><p>"But even if he survived, it will take decades to recover. The disciple position under the Azure Burning Marquis can only belong to our Dongyang family now," said the Dongyang clan leader, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>As long as Dongyang Meng could become a disciple under the Azure Burning Marquis, the Dongyang family would ascend to become a top-tier family high above others. At that time, the Yu family, originally their great enemy, would no longer be qualified to contend with the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>"Meng'er, you need not feel guilty about that Yu family brat. You and he are destined to be on different levels," the Dongyang clan leader said to comfort Dongyang Meng.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can become the Azure Burning Marquis's disciple, any sacrifice is worth it," Dongyang Meng said gently.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan summoned the six-armed figure.</p><p></p><p>"Master," the six-armed figure said extremely respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan had advanced to the twelfth level and displayed many terrifying abilities and hidden strengths, the six-armed figure had come to regard Lin Yuan as the next Emperor Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"If this universe undergoes a great destruction, how many lives can the Xuanhuang Secret Realm sustain?" Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>Facing the great destruction of the universe, preparations needed to be made on multiple fronts. The strongest experts of human civilization could bring some of their clan members, and the Xuanhuang Secret Realm could also sustain some of the clan population.</p><p></p><p>"How many lives can it sustain?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"If we're talking about lives below the twelfth level, at most it can sustain ten billion," the six-armed figure said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>After the great destruction of the universe, everything would return to a primordial chaotic state. The Xuanhuang Secret Realm would be the same, its area rapidly shrinking. Accommodating ten billion lives would already be the limit.</p><p></p><p>"What about those at the twelfth level?" Lin Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"For those at the twelfth level, at most ten," the six-armed figure answered truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Every life at the twelfth level received focused attention from the universe's fundamental consciousness. The disappearance of one or two twelfth level lives might be fine, but more than ten? The Xuanhuang Secret Realm might even face targeting from the universe's fundamental consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang's methods were unfathomable, creating 33,333 Xuanhuang Secret Realms with a wave of his hand and integrating them into different universes. </p><p></p><p>But ultimately they were only integrated, not part of the universe itself.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded. The Xuanhuang Secret Realm could completely serve as a backup plan for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>At worst, they would become like the Catastrophe Clan, enduring until the next universal era. As long as the inheritance of human civilization remained, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even after the great destruction of the universe, Lin Yuan would leave behind an avatar of his mental will in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. This was both to control this secret realm and to serve as a trump card for his own survival.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm isolated causality and space-time, and being located within the universe, its level of safety was only lower than that of the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing," Lin Yuan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Master," the six-armed figure immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you recognize this golden box?" An image appeared in front of Lin Yuan, of the golden box he had bought at the Thousand Treasures Meeting.</p><p></p><p>It was inscribed with markings unique to the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" The six-armed figure carefully observed the golden box, its expression constantly changing. "It's a treasure of our Xuanhuang lineage. Boxes like this were all personally refined by His Majesty. The treasures placed inside all relate to the inheritance of the Xuanhuang lineage."</p><p></p><p>"Personally refined by Emperor Xuanhuang?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became solemn. The origins of this golden box were even greater than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Originally he had only thought it was an important treasure of the Xuanhuang lineage, but personally refined by Emperor Xuanhuang? What kind of existence was Emperor Xuanhuang? How could something he personally refined be simple? Even the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was casually created by Emperor Xuanhuang, over 30,000 realms made at once.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be opened?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either," the six-armed figure shook its head. "Master, you only need to infuse your Xuanhuang mark's aura into it. As long as you meet the requirements to open it, the box will naturally open."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had taken control of a Xuanhuang Secret Realm, giving him the status of Emperor Xuanhuang's successor. This status could be confirmed through the Xuanhuang mark's aura within his body.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the answers he wanted from the six-armed figure, Lin Yuan was about to continue cultivating and comprehending the Dao. The rules operating on different aspects of the Origin World had brought Lin Yuan too many insights, with new realizations emerging almost every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The gourd?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand, and a palm-sized gourd appeared.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan had advanced to the twelfth level and his inner world had transformed into an inner universe, this mysterious gourd had begun some kind of transformation, only now nearing completion.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan grasped the gourd.</p><p></p><p>An enormous amount of information surged from the gourd into his mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

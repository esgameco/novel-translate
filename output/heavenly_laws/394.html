        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Black Planet, the guiding space of the cycle of life and death.</p><p></p><p>One of Lin Yuan's incarnations sat here, observing the endless cycle of life and death before him.</p><p></p><p>"Life is death, death is life. Life and death are just different facets of the cycle's rules. So it is, so it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit was radiant, his comprehension of the rules of the life and death cycle breaking through some shackles, reaching a new realm. </p><p></p><p>The fourth boundary.</p><p></p><p>The fourth boundary of the rules of the life and death cycle.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, it had been tens of thousands of years, while in the main universe, it had already been a hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and fifty years ago, Lin Yuan realized the rules of the life and death cycle.</p><p></p><p>One hundred years ago, the rules of the life and death cycle reached the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>Now, after another hundred years, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules of the life and death cycle surpassed the third boundary, reaching the fourth.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of the life and death cycle, although only encompassing the two pillar rules of the rules of life and the rules of death."</p><p></p><p>"But its essence expounds the rules of reincarnation. If I wasn't in this guiding space, I estimate it would take me ten times longer to reach this step."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite moved in his heart. This was still due to his heavenly comprehension ability - no bottleneck or shackle could hinder him for long.</p><p></p><p>For other cultivators, it wasn't just a matter of time - they likely couldn't cross over even until the end of their life span.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other races, just among human civilization alone, there were quite a few eleventh-stage cultivators stuck at the third or fourth boundary of the fusion of pillar-level rules.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate to the eleventh stage, every one of them was an unmatched genius of their era.</p><p></p><p>"This guiding space is now useless to me."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan looked around at the interweaving and fusion of the rules of life and death, his heart unmoved, because he had now reached the same level of this fused rule as this guiding space.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, Lin Yuan had comprehended this guiding space thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of the life and death cycle have reached the fourth boundary, and several other pillar-level fused rules like the rules of great destruction have also peaked at the third boundary, about to enter the fourth at any time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, while simultaneously comprehending multiple fused rules, it would inevitably divide his mental focus and energy. But the simultaneous progress and collision of these various fused rules would often produce an unexpected driving effect for him.</p><p></p><p>Whether the rules of the life and death cycle or the rules of great destruction, they were all part of the primordial rules, stemming from the same source.</p><p></p><p>"I can inform the Xia Qin Supreme to arrange for a human tenth-stage cultivator to take my place." Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Since this guiding space was no longer effective for him, he might as well rent it out. According to the price agreed upon with the Xia Qin Supreme, one guiding space was worth one billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned and left the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>Outside the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form appeared.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, an ancient-looking black-robed man materialized.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come out?" The black-robed man was stunned, frowning at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of the twelve guiding spaces on the Black Planet, each life was only allowed to enter a certain guiding space once.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they could not re-enter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only stayed in the life and death cycle guiding space for a little over a hundred years before leaving on his own accord. According to the rules of the Black Planet, he would not be able to re-enter the life and death cycle guiding space.</p><p></p><p>This made the black-robed man feel some regret. Lin Yuan had only used fifty years to break through from the initial first boundary of the life and death cycle rules to the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to mention his talent and aptitude - he was absolutely the most monstrous, most freak tenth-stage life the black-robed man could recall.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how monstrous or freakish, to leave the guiding space before reaching the fourth boundary of the life and death cycle rules was extremely foolish.</p><p></p><p>"Because this guiding space is now useless to me," Lin Yuan glanced at the black-robed man and said.</p><p></p><p>"Useless?" The black-robed man didn't react at first, then looked at Lin Yuan in disbelief. "You...you reached the fourth boundary?"</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the fourth boundary was one qualified to say the guiding space was useless to them.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, when Lin Yuan's life and death cycle rules reached the second boundary, he inadvertently leaked his aura, disrupting the balance of life and death rules within the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the black-robed man to deduce that Lin Yuan had reached the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when Lin Yuan reached the third and just now the fourth boundary, he did not leak any aura or disrupt the life and death balance within the guiding space, so the black-robed man was unaware of Lin Yuan's specific level.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, raising his right hand, the forces of life and death swirling at his fingertips, vaguely revealing a vast reincarnation grinding wheel.</p><p></p><p>"Really the fourth boundary?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the reincarnation grinding wheel at Lin Yuan's fingertips, the black-robed man no longer had any doubts in his heart, but even so, a sense of incredulity welled up within him.</p><p></p><p>This was the fourth boundary?</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it seemed Lin Yuan spent fifty years to cross from the first to the second boundary, then another hundred years from the second to the third boundary, then another fifty years from the third to the fourth boundary.</p><p></p><p>The time he spent at each level appeared normal.</p><p></p><p>But the breakthrough of boundaries was far from calculated that way.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level, the time required to advance even a minor realm exponentially exceeded the previous.</p><p></p><p>There were many genius cultivators in human civilization who took only hundreds or thousands of years to cultivate from the first to the seventh stage, but were stuck for tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years going from the seventh to the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>These were living examples.</p><p></p><p>It was even more so for the comprehension of fused rules.</p><p></p><p>In the black-robed man's estimation, for Lin Yuan to reach the second boundary in fifty years, he would likely need five hundred to a thousand years to reach the third boundary.</p><p></p><p>To reach the fourth boundary realm would probably require around ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And this was based on the premise of Lin Yuan displaying his shockingly monstrous talent of crossing to the second boundary in just fifty years initially.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did the opposite - fifty years from the first to second boundary, fifty years from second to third, fifty years from third to fourth.</p><p></p><p>This meant Lin Yuan's speed of comprehension was increasing exponentially, exhibiting an exponential explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Can you send me out?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the dazed black-robed man and asked.</p><p></p><p>On the Black Planet, the paths behind the twelve great gates were all one-way.</p><p></p><p>You could go in, but to go out required borrowing the power of the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>"Out?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man quickly reacted, deeply looking at Lin Yuan once more before waving his right hand, sending him to the surface of the Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>For a moment.</p><p></p><p>Outside the guiding space, it was empty, with only the black-robed man's figure remaining.</p><p></p><p>"How could such a monstrous life be born in this universe?" The black-robed man muttered to himself. Most of his memories were fragmented, but he was aware that Lin Yuan's cultivation speed was extremely unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form appeared. </p><p></p><p>"Let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step and left the Black Planet.</p><p></p><p>At present, he was just an incarnation, much weaker in battle strength compared to his primordial spirit clone. Most cultivators treated incarnations as disposable, to be dissipated after use.</p><p></p><p>But in Lin Yuan's view, even a tiny mosquito was flesh. With his incarnation's strength, although far inferior to his true body, by wielding spatial rules he could traverse hundreds of light-years in a step, quickly returning to the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Then merging with his true body, avoiding the minuscule loss from dissipating the incarnation.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield #A101.</p><p></p><p>Beneath a permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin Primordial Spirit opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield #A098 where his Sun Primordial Spirit was previously located had been forcibly reduced in dimensions by the 'white paper' that squeezed into the universe, ceasing to exist.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sun Primordial Spirit fell into it.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, the accumulation rate of Realm-Breaking Origin Force could not decrease.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the Sun Primordial Spirit could not get out in the short term, Lin Yuan had the Yin Primordial Spirit choose another large-scale alien battlefield to accelerate the accumulation of Realm-Breaking Origin Force.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the absolute safety of the guiding spaces, large-scale alien battlefields were fraught with danger, so only spirit clones could go, not incarnations that could easily die at the hands of other aliens.</p><p></p><p>"The intensity of war has decreased quite a bit over these hundred-plus years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the center of the battlefield, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Not just this large-scale alien battlefield, but the intensity of war in other large, medium, and small-scale alien battlefields had also greatly decreased.</p><p></p><p>The reason was related to that 'white paper' hanging in the depths of the universe's starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Over one billion peak experts of the Myriad Races fell into it, which was no small impact for the various peak race alliances.</p><p></p><p>At least their war reserves began to show deficiencies and shortages.</p><p></p><p>Even with many peak experts of the Myriad Races being eliminated from the two-dimensional world of the white paper, facing fundamental losses, they still needed a long time to recover.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He went to try to recover.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since the most powerful beings were all studying that 'blank paper', the influence from top to bottom led to a decrease in the intensity of wars on various battlefields. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally welcomed this, as the safer the environment, the more conducive it was to accumulating dimensional origin power.</p><p></p><p>"The amount of dimensional origin power I have now has reached nine hundred strands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the dimensional origin power stored in the Dimensional Gate, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>In a hundred years' time, based on being in a large alien battlefield's permanent spatial rift, accumulating dimensional origin power at a rate of one strand every ninety days.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had accumulated a total of four hundred and five strands of dimensional origin power.</p><p></p><p>Adding the nearly five hundred strands of dimensional origin power he already possessed a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>The two combined allowed Lin Yuan's dimensional origin power to reach nearly a thousand strands.</p><p></p><p>"So much dimensional origin power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt slightly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With such a vast amount of dimensional origin power to support him, even if the Sun Spirit truly suffered losses in that two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had sufficient confidence.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Sun Spirit was fundamentally erased, with his unconventional comprehension, if he could not recover the Sun Spirit, he could undergo 'customized' dimension travel, letting the Dimensional Gate take him to a world where his Sun Spirit could recover.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad realms, the boundless dimensions, there was bound to be a world environment that could allow his Sun Spirit to recover, it was just a matter of how much dimensional origin power.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength should be comparable to a third-tier eleventh-stage life form."</p><p></p><p>After a hundred years of cultivation, Lin Yuan had reached the fourth realm in the fusion of pillar-level rules, but it should be known that relying on his powerful foundation.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was at the first realm, he could already unleash the might of the second or even third realm of the life and death cycle rules. Now that he had reached the fourth realm, he estimated he could rival the peak of the fifth realm in the fusion of pillar-level rules.</p><p></p><p>And the standard threshold for the third tier of eleventh-stage life forms was to elevate a certain pillar-level fusion of rules to the fifth realm.</p><p></p><p>"Advancing one tier in a hundred years, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. For any eleventh-stage expert, to cross each tier took millions or tens of millions of years of time.</p><p></p><p>And that was without encountering any bottlenecks or shackles, otherwise it would be far more than millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only cultivated for a hundred years, yet he was comparable to the third tier of eleventh-stage life forms. His rate of advancement was simply astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, Lin Yuan was not cultivating as an eleventh-stage life form, but had crossed this gap while still at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension of many fused rules has progressed very smoothly, but the space-time rules have been rather difficult."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, and he sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The space-time rules, fully named the fusion of space-time rules, were the most arduous and abstruse of all the fused rules, second to none.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending the space-time fusion of rules was one of the thresholds for eleventh-stage experts to charge towards becoming an ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine the importance of the space-time fusion of rules.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the space-time fusion of rules meant the world within one's body would become a unity of space and time, making it more stable and perfect. The transformation into an inner universe would also be smoother.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the space-time fusion of rules played a major role in allowing eleventh-stage life forms to break free from the shackles of the river of time, enabling them to stay out of the river of time for longer periods to strive for more time to charge towards the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's unrealistic for me to comprehend the space-time fusion of rules at the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, even though for eleventh-stage life forms, once they comprehended the space-time fusion of rules, they would immediately become a fourth-tier existence, elevating the space-time fusion to the fifth realm and gaining the qualifications to charge towards the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to accomplish at the tenth stage what eleventh-stage life forms of the fourth tier could do, it was not simply a matter of strength foundation, but a pure comprehension of the rules.</p><p></p><p>A tenth-stage life form was ultimately still lower, unable to easily sense the fluctuations of space-time rules like an eleventh-stage life form could.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, even without mastering the space-time fusion of rules, with my comprehension abilities, as soon as I cross into the eleventh stage, I can swiftly comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Main Galaxy Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"The Tenth Stage Chapter of Martial Arts?"</p><p></p><p>As early as decades ago, Lin Yuan had been considering opening the Tenth Stage Chapter.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he comprehended the life and death cycle rules, Lin Yuan could be considered a top-tier tenth stage, a pinnacle tenth stage with the qualifications to open the Tenth Stage Chapter of Martial Arts. Moreover, Lin Yuan's life and death cycle rules had already reached the fourth realm.</p><p></p><p>"My Tenth Stage Chapter of Martial Arts must be unique and unmatched."</p><p></p><p>Over the past decades, Lin Yuan had attempted to open hundreds of introductions to the Tenth Stage Chapter, but was not very satisfied with any of them.</p><p></p><p>In the evolutionary path of human civilization from the first to the eleventh stage, the tenth stage was not the most important nor the strongest, but it played a pivotal role of connecting the past and future.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the martial path of evolution, the Tenth Stage Chapter was of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth stage path I have walked cannot be replicated, so the Tenth Stage Chapter of Martial Arts should face all tenth stage evolutionary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought rapidly in his heart, continuously conceiving the key points of the Tenth Stage Chapter bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Main Galaxy Star.</p><p></p><p>A young-looking man with a somewhat world-weary gaze suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"I spent all my accumulated merit points, and on behalf of my clan, borrowed eight million merit points from human civilization, gathering a total of ten million merit points to exchange for an opportunity to take one step closer."</p><p></p><p>This world-weary young man was named Xuanyuan Fan, an ancient tenth stage cultivator from the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Xuanyuan Fan could be ranked among the top ten of all tenth stage human cultivators, far stronger than the Vice Patriarch Nalan before his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>This was because Xuanyuan Fan had comprehended two pillar-level fusion of rules, with his life and death cycle rules even reaching the peak of the first realm.</p><p></p><p>However, without entering the second realm, Xuanyuan Fan could not charge into the eleventh stage. To elevate his life and death cycle rules to the second realm was no longer a matter of bitter cultivation, but required external forces to trigger it.</p><p></p><p>"According to the ancestral patriarch's words, the Galactic Star Master possesses a place of inheritance that could allow me to make progress with the life and death cycle rules, but it requires paying ten million merit points."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Fan felt a bit of pain.</p><p></p><p>Even for a cultivator of his Xuanyuan Clan, constantly fighting on the battlefields for human civilization, the merit points he had accumulated until now were only two million.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his clan's credibility this time, he could never have gathered enough ten million merit points.</p><p></p><p>And even though he had gathered enough, he still needed to repay human civilization eight million merit points. Even if Xuanyuan Fan luckily crossed into the eleventh stage, he would need millions or tens of millions of years to repay the debt.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what place of inheritance is worth ten million merit points? But the ancestral patriarch wouldn't deceive me." Xuanyuan Fan thought.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely on the advice of his clan's ancestral patriarch, one of the nine most powerful experts of human civilization, that he had made this choice.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master...the most talented genius in human civilization history, crossed into the tenth stage two hundred years ago." Xuanyuan Fan's mind flashed with Lin Yuan's information.</p><p></p><p>"What a lucky kid." Xuanyuan Fan felt extremely envious. To be able to enter a place of inheritance worth ten million merit points just once, its true value was incalculable.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Xuanyuan Fan arrived at the Main Galaxy Star, he contacted Lin Yuan through the virtual network.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>A young man appeared not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Master." Xuanyuan Fan looked towards the young man who had appeared silently, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension of the life and death cycle rules had also reached the peak of the first realm, so he vaguely sensed that Lin Yuan's body contained the vague condensation of a vast cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Before such a vast cycle of reincarnation, Xuanyuan Fan felt like an ant that could be crushed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Star Master only just entered the tenth stage, right? How is his aura so terrifying, his comprehension of the life and death cycle rules so profound?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Fan was shaken in his heart. Although he didn't know what realm Lin Yuan's life and death cycle rules had reached, it was undoubtedly far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying, is this the number one genius of our human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Xuanyuan Fan hadn't paid much attention to Lin Yuan, but now, his mind couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Master, here are the ten million merit points." Xuanyuan Fan said respectfully, transferring the ten million merit points to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and sent him the coordinates of the black planet's location.</p><p></p><p>The star domain where the black planet was located now belonged to Lin Yuan. Without permission, any civilian who privately trespassed on the black planet violated the laws of human civilization, including eleventh stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Ten million merit points received."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched Xuanyuan Fan leave respectfully, his mood quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked towards a certain part of the starry cosmos - the location of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

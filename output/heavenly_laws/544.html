        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Every time a universe undergoes a great collapse, it attracts many plunderers," said another Robber Clan ultimate.</p><p></p><p>No matter where, plundering is one of the fastest ways to obtain resources and wealth. </p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void where the strong prey on the weak, most areas have no order, so plunderers naturally thrive.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of almost all plunderers, the universes nurtured by the chaotic void are equivalent to a delicious meal. They have no interest in the universe itself, but are interested in the 12th level powerhouses who survive the great collapse of the universe.</p><p></p><p>These 12th level powerhouses have always stayed in the cradle of the universe. In terms of combat power and killing power, they are certainly no match for those at the same level in the chaotic void who have experienced countless battles.</p><p></p><p>After the great collapse of the universe, the 12th level powerhouses who survive and enter the chaotic void will inevitably carry a large amount of resources and treasures from within the universe.</p><p></p><p>Weak combat power but carrying many treasures? </p><p></p><p>Naturally they become "sweet treats" in the eyes of all plunderers.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," nodded the Robber Clan ultimate who spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Among the plunderers of the chaotic void, there are powerful beings, even some at the Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>After all, when a universe collapses, as long as a 12th level ultimate can survive the disaster of destruction, the treasures and weapons they carry are worth at least 10,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>With the power of a Sovereign level expert, it's too easy to subdue a Path-breaking realm expert who has just emerged from the universe.</p><p></p><p>Casually obtaining 10,000 or even tens of thousands of chaos stones? Even Sovereign level experts wouldn't refuse such a good deal.</p><p></p><p>"Under normal circumstances, the time of a universe's great collapse cannot be determined, at least not from the outside. So even if plunderers want to plunder, they can't determine the exact time of collapse. They can't just keep watch nearby all the time, can they?" </p><p></p><p>The second Robber Clan ultimate said: "But according to the intelligence obtained by the Milky Way's strongest, our universe will enter the great collapse early under the aftermath of the battle between two Chaos Saints."</p><p></p><p>"With the power of Chaos Saints, the range affected by their mutual slaughter should be far beyond just our universe."</p><p></p><p>"So we two speculate that there will inevitably be a bunch of plunderers following those two Saints, specifically to plunder those universes that are affected and enter the great collapse early."</p><p></p><p>The two Robber Clan ultimates had considered things quite thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the universe entering the great collapse early doesn't have much impact on them. They're not going out anyway, and the Robber Clan's population is already sparse, so their ancestral home can fully accommodate them.</p><p></p><p>But what about the Milky Way's strongest? When the Milky Way's strongest takes away all the citizens of human civilization, the disaster of the universe's great collapse they face will inevitably be unimaginably terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, they may suffer some injuries. Then after entering the chaotic void, encountering those plunderers' sneak attacks would probably give them a headache.</p><p></p><p>The two Robber Clan ultimates wouldn't think the Milky Way's strongest would fall because of this. What a joke! Even if a reincarnated Saint suffers heavy injuries, they can't be surrounded and killed by a group of Sovereign realm experts.</p><p></p><p>They were simply giving a reminder, letting Lin Yuan be more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the reminder," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing wrong with the two Robber Clan ultimates' reminder. Even a true Chaos Venerable wouldn't dare guarantee they could emerge unscathed when facing the universe's final all-out counterattack.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>These two Robber Clan ultimates still didn't understand Lin Yuan's abilities - his physical divine ability 'Blood Drop Rebirth' plus the 'Primordial Yellow Body' and 'Elemental Body'.</p><p></p><p>Even with the heaviest injuries, Lin Yuan could recover in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unless he could be completely erased in an instant, it would be difficult for Lin Yuan to die even if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan successfully entered the Star Tear 'fragment world'.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad," Lin Yuan was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although this fragment world was only one-thousandth the size of the main universe, it could fully accommodate all the citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that in the starry sky of the main universe, the vast majority of areas are not suitable for habitation. Citizens all live on life-bearing planets.</p><p></p><p>But in the Star Tear 'fragment world', there's no such thing as uninhabitable areas. Almost 100% can be lived in and inhabited. Not to mention accommodating all the citizens of human civilization, even if all the races and all life forms in the main universe were migrated here, there would still be plenty of room.</p><p></p><p>If purely comparing habitable area, this fragment world is not much smaller than the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Star Tear aura."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the Star Tear 'fragment world', sensing a gentle force permeating everywhere, very suitable for the nurturing and growth of life.</p><p></p><p>The reason Ten Melody Sovereign dared to price this 'fragment world' at 1.2 million chaos stones was largely due to the inherent quality of the Star Tear ore.</p><p></p><p>"The reproduction and nurturing of life is still best done in the chaotic void and within universes. This way the potential will be greatest, with nearly limitless possibilities," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of nurturing life, no internal universe can compare to the chaotic void and the various universes.</p><p></p><p>From a level perspective, Lin Yuan's internal universe, or the internal universes of Chaos Venerables, are no weaker than the universes nurtured by the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of nurturing life, they fall far short.</p><p></p><p>Even in the internal universes of Chaos Saints, the life nurtured there is almost locked at the 11th level. Those who cross into the 12th level are extremely rare, and there has never been a Sovereign realm life form from an internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"According to the inherited 'Infinite Void', the chaotic void contains a certain life force. It is this life force that gives the nurtured life forms extremely high potential. And internal universes do not have this life force," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>And that life force can only be evolved in an internal universe after practicing 'Infinite Void' to at least the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth level of 'Infinite Void'?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The first level of 'Infinite Void' is comparable to a Chaos Venerable's internal universe. At the second level, the internal universe will approach that of a Chaos Saint. At the third level, the vastness of the internal universe will surpass ordinary Saints. As for the fourth level? When the internal universe reaches that level, Lin Yuan would basically be nearly invincible at the 12th level. It should be noted that this 13th level inheritance 'Infinite Void' only has seven levels, with the seventh level being theoretical.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, this inheritance only has six levels.</p><p></p><p>"Now we just wait for the universe's great collapse to arrive."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly had a thought, "It's a good time to go choose the eighth level reward."</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the 12th level, Lin Yuan had passed the eighth level of the black tower in the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, Lin Yuan couldn't decide on the reward list given by the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, so he left it until now, planning to choose based on his needs after reaching the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Lin Yuan separated out a strand of mental will and descended into the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>In front of the nine-story black tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"You've come," the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji walked out, looking at Lin Yuan with a complex gaze.</p><p></p><p>From the pressure brought by this incarnation of Lin Yuan's mental will, the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji could deduce that compared to the last descent, Lin Yuan's strength had made another breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really no bottleneck in cultivation?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan, unable to suppress this thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before meeting Lin Yuan, he had seen many disciples of the Magic Jade Tower stuck at certain bottlenecks, unable to advance further for millions or billions of years, even entire cosmic eras. </p><p></p><p>That sense of despair and hardship.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Every time the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji saw Lin Yuan, the other's strength had inevitably improved, and by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to choose the eighth floor reward," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji replied, inexplicably relieved that at least Lin Yuan wasn't here to challenge the ninth floor. "Please look."</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji waved his hand, and an illusory light screen appeared in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The reward list on the screen only contained six or seven types of rewards, very few in number.</p><p></p><p>After all, the eighth floor of the Black Tower represented the peak strength of the Sovereign realm. Treasures at this level were already precious, and with Lin Yuan conquering the eighth floor as an eleventh-rank being, the rewards on the list had to be raised several more levels, making them even rarer.</p><p></p><p>"Take a good look. If you have any questions, you can ask me," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji said from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had already pondered the eighth floor reward list many times, and had basically decided on his choice this time.</p><p></p><p>"I choose this one," Lin Yuan looked at the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji.</p><p></p><p>On the reward list, there were weapons at the Great Saint level, as well as rare treasures of the Great Saint realm, but Lin Yuan chose none of those. Instead, he chose a crystal.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was a drop of blood encased in the crystal.</p><p></p><p>"This?" The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji's expression became slightly solemn. "In terms of preciousness, among all the rewards on the list, this drop of 'Time Blood' is the most valuable."</p><p></p><p>"But are you sure you want to choose this?" The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Those Great Saint weapons on the list? Although precious, Lin Yuan still felt this drop of 'Time Blood' was most suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'Time Blood' was literally the blood of a thirteenth-rank time lifeform. Of course, this drop of blood didn't come from a thirteenth-rank being, but from a miraculous lifeform with extremely concentrated time bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Miraculous lifeforms born from the Chaos Void all had time bloodlines flowing through their bodies to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the master and several other Great Saints waited for dozens of cosmic eras, paid a huge price, and finally hunted down that miraculous lifeform. In the end, the master obtained part of the miraculous lifeform's body, continuously refined it, and finally formed this drop of 'Time Blood'," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji explained.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this drop of Time Blood shouldn't have appeared on the eighth floor reward list, or even the ninth floor reward list.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was too monstrous. Conquering the eighth floor of the Black Tower at the eleventh rank?</p><p></p><p>The human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji didn't know what rewards to choose for Lin Yuan, so he simply added this drop of 'Time Blood' to the list.</p><p></p><p>"That miraculous lifeform was so hard to kill?" Lin Yuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The master of the Magic Jade Tower was a peerless Great Saint. Even he had to team up with several other Great Saints of the same level, wait for dozens of cosmic eras, and barely manage to kill that miraculous lifeform?</p><p></p><p>"Miraculous lifeforms have time bloodlines flowing through their bodies. The one killed by the master had an extremely concentrated time bloodline, possessing many time-related talents, such as foreseeing future scenes and so on, naturally making it difficult to kill," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>"Foreseeing future scenes?" Lin Yuan looked at the drop of Time Blood on the reward list.</p><p></p><p>If that was true, it was indeed difficult to kill. After all, foreseeing future scenes was equivalent to being able to see future dangers.</p><p></p><p>The reason danger is called danger is because of the lack of information. If one knew in advance, they could completely avoid or counter it.</p><p></p><p>"Even with such an ability, it still died?" Lin Yuan thought to himself, while also deducing that the so-called foresight of future scenes was not absolutely unbeatable. Even for thirteenth-rank time lifeforms, the future timelines they could see were only partial, not complete.</p><p></p><p>"This drop of 'Time Blood' is yours now. Remember to keep it safe and don't let others know about it," the human-shaped stone statue Shen Ji cautioned.</p><p></p><p>Even the Magic Jade Great Saint, a peerless Great Saint, had paid a huge price to refine this drop of 'Time Blood'. If other Chaos Great Saints knew about it, they would definitely try to snatch it.</p><p></p><p>For powerhouses at the Great Saint level, a drop of Time Blood this concentrated would be of great help in approaching the thirteenth rank.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe.</p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mental consciousness returned.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, that drop of Time Blood sealed in the crystal appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"This drop of Time Blood?" Lin Yuan was vaguely fascinated. Even through the crystal seal, as he gazed at the Time Blood, he could faintly see blurry future scenes related to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly comprehend it," Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts and began a new round of closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than three hundred years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, three hundred years were like an instant. It seemed as if one moment he was three hundred years in the past, and the next moment he had arrived three hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Rules," Lin Yuan pondered. Over the past three hundred years, he had comprehended hundreds more pillar-level Great Daos. As various Daos were nurtured, his Chaos Rules had reached the peak of the first level.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other rules, Chaos Rules only had three levels. Normal Chaos Venerables were usually between the first and second levels.</p><p></p><p>"To reach the second level of Chaos Rules, perhaps the Space-Time Fusion Rules need to reach the eighth level?" Lin Yuan thought to himself. At the second level of Chaos Rules, one could begin to evolve the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji, which was the rule path of the Origin World, far ahead of the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that Origin World, the advantage of the Chaos Void was its abundant foundation, supported by internal universes.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow," Lin Yuan wasn't in a hurry. He took out the crystal again, with the 'Time Blood' sealed inside.</p><p></p><p>After more than three hundred years of comprehension, Lin Yuan's progress in understanding this drop of 'Time Blood' was still extremely slow.</p><p></p><p>"It should be because my life level is too low," Lin Yuan thought to himself. His current life level was still at the Path-Opening realm. Even for a miraculous lifeform born from the Chaos Void, it was difficult to have much insight into the Time Blood at merely the Path-Opening realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue observing the Time Blood in the crystal, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and appeared under the starry sky of the universe, looking far off in a certain direction, towards the outside of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's coming," Lin Yuan's expression was solemn. With his current perception, he could faintly sense an extremely terrifying fluctuation, like an ocean wave, covering and enveloping in this direction.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

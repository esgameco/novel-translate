        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 364 Lin Yuan's Strike (Extra Update, Seeking Monthly Votes at Start of Month)</p><p></p><p>Inside the black grand gate was a vast expanse of the heavens and earth. </p><p></p><p>"The Embryonic Space?" Lin Yuan's expression was cautious as he continuously observed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The black planet was not very large, yet the space contained within the grand gate was so vast. Lin Yuan did not find this strange.</p><p></p><p>It was just a profound application of spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>The world within Lin Yuan's body reached a circumference of over 200 million li, yet it was concealed within a qi sea the size of a fist.</p><p></p><p>It was a similar principle.</p><p></p><p>"The suppression force of this space is so powerful." Lin Yuan inwardly startled. </p><p></p><p>The immense suppressive force far exceeded the Xuanhuang Secret Territory. At this moment, Lin Yuan could not even merge into the spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>"Over there..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked ahead. Below his feet was a small path formed from black stones. Everywhere else appeared white.</p><p></p><p>"Only by following the small black stone path is it safe." Lin Yuan's brow twitched as he gazed at the white area, a sense of dread rising in his heart, while the narrow black stone path brought a feeling of safety.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't go back?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>The grand gate had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Now there was only one path for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>To continue forward.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"At most I'll just lose this Yuanshen body."</p><p></p><p>"It's not unacceptable."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan directly followed the small black stone path.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already informed the Goddess of Wisdom about this black planet. The three goddesses must have known about it long ago.</p><p></p><p>With the three goddesses aware, the ultimate existences like Xia Qin Zhizhe must also know.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, since Xia Qin Zhizhe did not specifically inform Lin Yuan, it meant this black planet should not pose too great a danger.</p><p></p><p>The black planet was related to that ancient incident when countless treasures fell into the cosmos, and human civilization obtained the key inheritance from that event. So Xia Qin Zhizhe should have a good understanding of the black planet.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin Zhizhe did not take the initiative to tell Lin Yuan, indicating there was no insurmountable danger.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The rules of life and death? Does this realm relate to the cycle of life and death?"</p><p></p><p>Many speculations arose in Lin Yuan's mind, but they were just speculations. To figure it out, he had to keep walking.</p><p></p><p>At the Xia You Evolution Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin Zhizhe seemed to sense something and slightly raised his head, looking towards a certain area.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was present, he would realize that the area Xia Qin Zhizhe was looking at was the star domain where the black planet was located.</p><p></p><p>"That little fellow has entered." A smile appeared on Xia Qin Zhizhe's face.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A figure rapidly coalesced beside him - it was the Butterfly Zhizhe.</p><p></p><p>"That Inheritance Star should originate from the oversight back then. For so many years, we never discovered it. Didn't expect that little fellow to randomly find it. That's luck."</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Zhizhe smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>The black planet's aura was completely concealed. Even for a Zhizhe, unless within a certain distance, it could not be detected.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with a Zhizhe's perception, they could scan the entire cosmos with a glance, covering millions of light years. It wouldn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>Divine treasures conceal themselves. Some treasures, if not approached, cannot be sensed at all.</p><p></p><p>Some treasures, even if approached, if not meeting the criteria, no anomaly can be detected.</p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yuan's mysterious gourd - if not for Lin Yuan coincidentally mastering the Fleshly Deity Art "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", he probably still wouldn't understand the use of that gourd even now.</p><p></p><p>"Within the Inheritance Star are the fusion paths of the various Pillar-level rules. Only a Tenth Stage life can enter. If that little fellow can pass through three or four of them, he should be able to cross into the Eleventh Stage."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin Zhizhe spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Pass three or four?" The Butterfly Zhizhe pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>For a normal Tenth Stage evolver, they only needed to pass one path to enter the Eleventh Stage. But considering that little fellow Lin Yuan's impressive past accomplishments, passing three or four was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>"It's just unknown how many levels of fusion paths this Inheritance Star contains."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin Zhizhe murmured.</p><p></p><p>According to the highest confidential information possessed by human civilization, these Inheritance Stars from outside the cosmos also had higher and lower levels.</p><p></p><p>The higher the limit of fusion path levels contained, the more precious it was. But passing through would also be more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to know the limit, one had to walk through one of the fusion paths.</p><p></p><p>The Zhizhes had methods to destroy the black planet, but such Inheritance Stars, upon sensing an insurmountable threat, would self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Inside the black grand gate.</p><p></p><p>On the small path of black stones in the vast expanse, Lin Yuan walked step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived before a black altar.</p><p></p><p>"Here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped, carefully sensing it.</p><p></p><p>At this place, he could no longer perceive any other rule fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Only the rules of life and death became exceptionally clear.</p><p></p><p>Unable to sense rule fluctuations meant being unable to draw upon the power of rules.</p><p></p><p>For example, the "Spatial Dissolution" fusion rule Lin Yuan comprehended was formed by fusing the spatial rules and the rules of metal.</p><p></p><p>But in this realm, the might of such a fusion rule...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"My ability to sense spatial rules and gold rules would be greatly weakened, because I fundamentally cannot perceive those rules. I can only rely on mastering the 'spatial dissolution' fusion rule that I grasp."</p><p></p><p>"But where should I go now?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined the altar in front of him. After cautiously waiting for a moment and seeing no changes, he stepped onto the altar. </p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan set foot on the altar, the entire altar began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of black light rapidly converged, coalescing into a black-robed man with an ancient expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the black-robed man, his expression slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>"I am the spirit of the altar, and next I need to subject you to some tests."</p><p></p><p>"If you can pass them, you will be able to obtain the ultimate reward on this path of the fusion rule."</p><p></p><p>"The spirit of the altar?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly understood the "position" of the black-robed man. Similar to the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji in the Magic Jade Space, or the six-armed figure in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, senior, what is the ultimate reward?" Lin Yuan immediately inquired.</p><p></p><p>"You'll know when you go in," the black-robed man shook his head. "Only those who pass the tests will know what the ultimate reward is, but I can give you a hint - the ultimate reward is related to the rule of life and death reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned to realization, but he felt quite speechless inwardly. He could naturally deduce that the ultimate reward was related to the rule of great destruction, since this path that could only be entered by comprehending the rule of life and death reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"What are the tests?" Lin Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Testing your grasp of the rule of life and death reincarnation," the black-robed man spoke succinctly. </p><p></p><p>"You should have felt it - in this realm, only the undulations of the rules of life and death can be sensed, other rules cannot be perceived."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the strongest rule Lin Yuan could currently wield was the rule of life and death reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Now."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man waved his hand, and dozens of black stone walls descended and stood not far away, arrayed from front to back in a row.</p><p></p><p>"The rule of life and death reincarnation is a rule of killing, so testing this rule is based on the level of destructive power caused."</p><p></p><p>"Now, fully activate the rule of life and death reincarnation and attack the black stone walls. The more walls you can penetrate through, the greater your chance of passing the test."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man spoke directly without wasting words.</p><p></p><p>"Fully activate?" Lin Yuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Fully activate," the black-robed man affirmed. "Let me see the limit of your destructive power."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Lin Yuan again, as if wondering why he would ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, from the aura of your life and death reincarnation rule, it seems you've only just grasped it."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, even if you fully activate the life and death reincarnation rule, the power unleashed will be enough to seep through the first black stone wall, let alone penetrate it."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already predicted the general range of destructive power Lin Yuan would unleash by activating the life and death reincarnation rule, the specifics, like how much area of the first black stone wall would be permeated, still needed to be verified by Lin Yuan's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since comprehending the rule of life and death reincarnation, he had never used it at full power. Even in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he only used it sparingly, immediately stopping once he noticed the impact this fusion rule had on the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Begin," the black-robed man said, no longer speaking further.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had opened the outer door with a sliver of the power of the life and death reincarnation rule and walked in. From that, the black-robed man had already made a rough judgment about the level of the life and death reincarnation rule Lin Yuan had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>"Life and death reincarnation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, extended his index finger, and solemnly pointed it at the row of black stone walls in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Originally the black-robed man had been expressionless, but immediately after, his expression changed drastically, looking at Lin Yuan's casual pointing gesture with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's pupils contracted sharply.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The power of life and death reincarnation instantly penetrated tens of billions of spatial layers, tearing open a cavity. The black stone walls were crushed without any suspense. After crushing all the walls, this cavity still rapidly spread outwards, instantly piercing through the entire realm and continuing to penetrate even deeper.</p><p></p><p>Until a faint, indistinct tremor was vaguely transmitted, everything finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Even so, in the hazy area the cavity had penetrated through, the force of life and death reincarnation still operated unceasingly, everything twisting and being annihilated.</p><p></p><p>At the Xia You Evolution Highrise.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin the Powerhouse and Butterfly idly chatted while observing that black planet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xia Qin the Powerhouse's expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>He then carefully looked towards that black planet countless light years away.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xia Qin the Powerhouse narrowed his eyes and said:</p><p></p><p>"Butterfly."</p><p></p><p>"Did you notice that the Heritage Star seemed to tremble just now?"</p><p></p><p>PS: This chapter is a bonus update. </p><p></p><p>Seeking some monthly tickets to meet the baseline for May.</p><p>It's conveniently double ticket time at the start of the month, so buying one ticket is like buying two.</p><p></p><p>(These last three lines are not part of the paid translation)</p>

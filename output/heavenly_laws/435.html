river of time flows vastly and boundlessly. </p><p></p><p>From the ancient past towards the distant future.</p><p></p><p>It seems eternal and unchanging.</p><p></p><p>Even for the most shockingly talented and dazzling life, as long as it has not made the ultimate leap,</p><p></p><p>At most it can only stir up a small wave on the long river, and will eventually wither and die along with the long river.</p><p></p><p>On the shore.</p><p></p><p>Towering figures appeared one by one, carefully observing every detail around the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>During the ultimate period of the shock of eleventh realm life, outside forces cannot stop it.</p><p></p><p>However, once the shock is completed and they successfully cross into the twelfth realm,</p><p></p><p>They must undergo "landing".</p><p></p><p>This is also the opportunity for the strongest of the Insect Race, Feather Race and others.</p><p></p><p>A newly entered twelfth realm ultimate existence is undoubtedly at its weakest moment.</p><p></p><p>Even with the protection of the nine strongest of human civilization, if they suddenly launch a sneak attack, it could cause no small impact.</p><p></p><p>The strongest of the Insect Race, Feather Race and others do not hope to kill that strongest of human civilization, but at least they could injure the other party.</p><p></p><p>This way, the pressure on them later would also be much lighter.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the "landing" period of a twelfth realm life to launch a sneak attack is considered an unforgivable enmity that must be pursued to the end.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, none of the strongest standing on the shore would easily do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that even a newly crossed twelfth realm ultimate is not so easy to kill, as its life essence has gone through the ultimate leap and is difficult to truly die.</p><p></p><p>And if they fail, they will establish an irreconcilable great enemy for themselves and the forces behind them.</p><p></p><p>The hidden danger is so great that it even relates to when the universe epoch ends and numerous twelfth realm lives must "cross the river" to resist the force of the great destruction.</p><p></p><p>But for the Insect Race and Feather Race, this kind of impact is meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization and they are already in an unforgivable enmity.</p><p></p><p>Even if they do not take action, the enmity between the two will not disappear.</p><p></p><p>If the Insect Race or Feather Race has a perfected eleventh realm life that successfully crosses into the twelfth realm and undergoes "landing", the nine strongest of human civilization would probably also unhesitatingly take the opportunity to attack.</p><p></p><p>In the struggle between races, there has never been a matter of the strong bullying the weak.</p><p></p><p>The key reason why the strongest of the myriad races in the current universe rarely take the field is that if everyone takes the field, it is the same as no one taking the field.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the intensity of war is too high, it will also affect the development of the various peak racial forces.</p><p></p><p>That is why the current balance is maintained.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait."</p><p></p><p>"We will watch from the shore."</p><p></p><p>"When that eleventh realm evolver of the humans undergoes 'landing', you must not hold back."</p><p></p><p>The strongest of the Insect Race, Feather Race and others exchanged glances, while also being vigilant for the traces of the nine strongest of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If they could think of "sniping" from the shore of the long river of time, the strongest of human civilization must also have made preparations.</p><p></p><p>What the two sides are now competing with is the depth of their respective strengths.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of space layers in the Milky Way domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was guiding the boundless primordial chaos into his body as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The world within his physical body and soul was like taking a great tonic, beginning to soar in advancement.</p><p></p><p>Especially the world within his body, after enduring the infusion of the primordial chaos for the twentieth second, it appeared to have a "full stomach feeling".</p><p></p><p>At the same time as the "full stomach feeling", a sense of breaking through the shackles of the limit also welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That was why Lin Yuan did not stop absorbing the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>The thirtieth second.</p><p></p><p>The "full stomach feeling" further intensified.</p><p></p><p>The fortieth second. </p><p></p><p>The "full stomach feeling" reached a certain limit.</p><p></p><p>The fiftieth second.</p><p></p><p>The "full stomach feeling" suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The world within his body, originally 2.33 billion miles in diameter, was like tearing through a thin layer of paper, and its area began to soar again.</p><p></p><p>23 billion miles.</p><p></p><p>33 billion miles.</p><p></p><p>43 billion miles.</p><p></p><p>When the infusion of the primordial chaos reached the three hundredth second, </p><p></p><p>The world within Lin Yuan had reached a diameter of 6 trillion miles.</p><p></p><p>The vast power of the world was fed back into his physical body and soul, coupled with the continuous absorption of the primordial chaos. Lin Yuan's strength, compared to before his breakthrough, had increased by an unimaginable amount.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>After 333 seconds.</p><p></p><p>The rift in the sky spanning over a hundred light-years rapidly began to heal.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the primordial chaos also quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>"According to normal circumstances, when a perfected eleventh realm life shocks the ultimate, they would undergo the ultimate leap at this moment, taking advantage of the descent of the primordial chaos and the universe's grand dao rules giving way, to cross that critical step."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The primal chaos of the void descended, and the myriad rules and restrictions within the universe would naturally disappear and yield temporarily. This was also the optimal period for breaking through to the ultimate at the eleventh level of perfection. </p><p></p><p>If this opportunity was missed, it would be almost impossible to attempt breaking through to the ultimate again.</p><p></p><p>For any life form to break through to the ultimate means completely shaking off the restrictions of the universe. Under such circumstances, the universe would naturally do everything to prevent it.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the most powerful, free from the shackles of the river of time, means possibly being able to bring out everything absorbed from within the universe.</p><p></p><p>"However, I don't really need to go that far," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He still had one more chance to trigger the infusion of the primal chaos of the void.</p><p></p><p>Although with Lin Yuan's foundation, he could completely transcend the eleventh level and attempt to break through to the ultimate right now, the risk was still too great.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had great room for improvement. Not to mention comprehending the legendary chaos rules, the deeper the foundation he accumulated at the eleventh level, the greater his advantage would be in breaking through to the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>"The inner world within my body has now reached eight billion square miles in circumference."  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world. Compared to the mere two billion plus square miles before his breakthrough, his current inner world had been strengthened by who knows how many times.</p><p></p><p>"I have not fully absorbed ninety-nine percent of the primal power of the chaotic void, but have accumulated it deep within my inner world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative. Ripping open a rift spanning over a hundred light years to welcome the descent of the primal chaos of the void, the movement of Lin Yuan breaking through the tenth level was by no means smaller than breaking through to the ultimate at the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the primal power of the chaotic void he endured was no less than that faced by eleventh level beings breaking through to the ultimate.</p><p></p><p>And for eleventh level beings breaking through to the ultimate, once successful, their inner world would evolve into an inner universe, their life essence undergoing an ultimate metamorphosis. In the end, the size of their inner universe would reach tens of thousands to a hundred thousand light years.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan did not undergo a life metamorphosis by breaking through to the ultimate at the eleventh level, he would rapidly absorb the accumulated primal power of the chaotic void if he completed the life metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not undergo the ultimate metamorphosis, so that primal power of the chaotic void still remained deep within his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"This is good too. It has all become part of my foundation. When I truly attempt to break through to the ultimate, the final size of my inner world will likely exceed the range of tens of thousands to a hundred thousand light years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Moreover, because this time Lin Yuan accumulated a great amount of the primal power of the chaotic void, leading to a huge increase in his foundation, when he truly attempts to break through to the ultimate, the chaotic void's evaluation of Lin Yuan will rise. The rift torn open will be even vaster, and the infused primal power of the chaotic void will reach an unimaginable degree.</p><p></p><p>"Can my current inner world still be called a world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at his six billion square mile inner world. The boundless infusion of the primal chaotic void was constantly causing his inner world to undergo metamorphosis, opening up more layers of space and so on.</p><p></p><p>"It lies between an inner world and an inner universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself. His current inner world far exceeded the conventional meaning of an inner world, yet fell short of the inner universe of the most powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>"My strength after the breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began carefully sensing it. His physical body and soul had increased by no less than a hundredfold compared to before the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But the most crucial part was his inner world, the vast expanse of six billion square miles. One should know that for other eleventh level lifeforms, depending on the nobility of their racial bloodline, their inner worlds were only in the range of tens of millions to a few billion square miles.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's?</p><p></p><p>A direct six billion square miles?</p><p></p><p>Ordinary eleventh level lifeforms would be as insignificant as ants before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's previous categorization, if the battle power of a perfected eleventh level being was represented as ten,</p><p></p><p>then before his breakthrough, Lin Yuan's battle power was probably around a hundred.</p><p></p><p>But now, having crossed into the eleventh level, Lin Yuan's battle power had already surpassed ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand versus a hundred - it seemed like only a hundredfold increase, but it wasn't calculated that way. A hundred beings with a battle power of a hundred joining forces would still be crushed by an existence with a battle power of ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a hundred, even a thousand or ten thousand beings with a battle power of a hundred each would have no ability to resist an existence with a battle power of ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, with Lin Yuan's current battle power, he could be considered an exceptional existence between the eleventh and twelfth levels.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the eleventh and twelfth levels was like a vast chasm.</p><p></p><p>Even eleventh level perfected legendary lifeforms wielding supreme weapons would at most be able to barely preserve their lives before Lin Yuan by relying on the supreme weapon itself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if that supreme weapon was not defensive but offensive in nature, they might not even be able to preserve their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The only ones who could truly pose a threat to me would be those at the twelfth level, right?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, while raising his head to gaze towards a certain area.</p><p></p><p>"The nine Supremes have all arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed nine vast auras.  </p><p></p><p>Before breaking through, Lin Yuan was completely unable to detect whether Supremes had descended. It was only after being notified by the Supreme Xia Qin that he began the breakthrough process.</p><p></p><p>But now, with his realm elevated and his mastery over space-time, Lin Yuan could vaguely lock onto the auras of the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was because the nine human Supremes were manifested forms without deliberately concealing their auras.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go meet the Supremes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up and walked out from the depths of the spatial realm, heading towards the nine human Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Without the nine Supremes, Lin Yuan's breakthrough this time would have been known to all the races of the universe long ago, and those alien Supremes would definitely have intervened.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the birth of the universe, any eleventh level perfected being attempting to break through to the ultimate before would seek out a Supreme as a backer.</p><p></p><p>The first human Supreme came about this way, seeking out an ultimate existence and paying a tremendous price to gain its protection before finally succeeding in crossing into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>The river of time flowed vastly onwards.</p><p></p><p>Supreme beings like the Insect Race and Feather Race patiently waited. </p><p></p><p>In the far distance, the majestic forms of other Supremes flickered in and out of perception.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth level experts of the Insect and Feather Races planned to ambush the newly ascended human Supreme, while the other ultimate beings were happy to watch the commotion.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been so long, but there's not even a ripple in the river of time?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect and Feather Race Supremes frowned slightly, as there was only one possible reason for this situation.</p><p></p><p>It meant that the human evolver attempting to break through to the ultimate had ultimately failed.</p><p></p><p>Failing to breach the ultimate would erase one's entire existence, naturally preventing them from "landing."</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>"We were too anxious."</p><p></p><p>The Insect and Feather Race ultimate beings exchanged glances and let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If possible, they didn't want to ambush either, as it would inevitably lead to an all-out battle with the nine human Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Battles between Supremes and ultimate beings often resulted in destroying the enemy while suffering heavy losses themselves. There was little meaning, especially with those few insane human Supremes who might resort to mutually destructive methods if pushed too far.</p><p></p><p>So the current outcome was the best scenario.</p><p></p><p>The human evolver attempting the ultimate breakthrough had failed.</p><p></p><p>This spared the Insect and Feather Races from gaining a new enemy, while also avoiding a clash with the human Supremes - simply perfect.</p><p></p><p>The only thing puzzling the Insect and Feather Race Supremes was how "easily" the human evolver had failed.</p><p></p><p>With the foundations of human civilization, if they dared to let him attempt the ultimate breakthrough, they must have made extensive preparations. Even in failure, it should have caused ripples, if not waves, in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Yet from start to finish, not a single Supreme detected any disturbance in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>This implied that the human evolver failed very shortly after beginning his attempt at the ultimate breakthrough, resulting in the undisturbed calmness of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>While puzzled, the Insect, Feather and other Supremes didn't dwell on it too much. After all, triggering a primal infusion of that magnitude from the chaos void was bound to be an ultimate leap attempt.</p><p></p><p>And a successful ultimate leap would lead to "landing."</p><p></p><p>Since there was no "landing," it meant failure.</p><p></p><p>The Insect and Feather Race Supremes grasped the fundamental logic: the human evolver failed to cross into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would have been a "landing."</p><p></p><p>Without crossing into the twelfth level, the outcome was complete obliteration.</p><p></p><p>In the galactic star domains, the nine human Supremes' hearts remained unsettled for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They watched the rift in the chaos void rapidly heal, momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow is too frightening," the ancient Supreme Gu Li shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>There were few things that could frighten a Supreme, but the nine human Supremes were clearly shaken to no small degree.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the other alien Supremes knew that the commotion was caused merely by a tenth level breaking into the eleventh, they would likely be dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>"Our human civilization has birthed an extraordinary existence," the remaining Supremes suddenly thought.</p>

            <p>Chapter 235: The Bestowal of the Supreme Being (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme Being wants to see me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was stirred. The Supreme Beings were the towering pillars of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>With the current human civilization being able to sweep across the myriad races of the starry sky, besides the three Goddesses coordinating everything, it relied on the nine Supreme Beings and their top-level combat strength.</p><p></p><p>Without the Supreme Beings, human civilization would not be able to contend against the "Insect Sea Army" of the Insectoid Race.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Supreme Being who wants to see you is named 'Xia Qin'," the Goddess of Wisdom replied.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Xia Qin..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered. Supreme Being Xia Qin was the third Supreme Being of human civilization. The Evolution Tower he presided over was located in the northeastern region of human civilization's territory, single-handedly facing two peak races.</p><p></p><p>"How will the meeting take place?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"The meeting can be held in the virtual world," the Goddess of Wisdom's voice was solemn and cold.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was within Lin Yuan's expectations that a Supreme Being would want to see him.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's strength continuously improved, it was bound to attract the attention of the Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>Below the Eighth Stage, the Sixth and Seventh Stages were not taken seriously by the Supreme Beings. However, reaching the Eighth Stage was already considered high-level combat strength in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan had entered the Eighth Stage at too young an age, less than a hundred years old, to be precise, in his thirties.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Supreme Beings had not paid attention to Lin Yuan now, once he became invincible at the Eighth Stage and stepped into the Ninth Stage, he would still have to meet the Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious virtual world, Lin Yuan's figure appeared, looking around.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a majestic man was standing. Although he was only three meters tall, the feeling he gave Lin Yuan was incomparably majestic, far surpassing tens of thousands of stars combined.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being..." Lin Yuan carefully observed the majestic man, feeling his soul trembling. On this majestic man, it seemed as if he could see the vast universe and starry sky, with endless rules and origins operating.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial rules? Time rules? No, it's the space-time rules after the fusion of spatial and time rules? There are also life rules, causality rules... too many, too many..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stubbornly used his heaven-defying comprehension to perceive, but found little effect.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the two was too great. The reason why Lin Yuan was able to comprehend the numerous evolutionary paths contained within that severed body was because the other party had already completely fallen.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Supreme Being had paid a price to forcefully externalize the profundities contained within that severed body.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the virtual world provided isolation.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the Sixth and Seventh Stage human evolutionaries to comprehend. If it weren't for the above preparations and the severed body was directly taken for comprehension, it was estimated that all the Sixth and Seventh Stage evolutionaries would go mad the moment they saw the severed body.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's attempt to comprehend Supreme Being Xia Qin was equivalent to directly comprehending the origins of the universe and starry sky. It was difficult to gain any insights in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin glanced at Lin Yuan and said with a smile, "Greetings, Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said respectfully, "It's too terrifying. So different rules can be fused?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely saw the path to the Ninth Stage or even the Tenth Stage from the Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>For an Eighth Stage evolutionary to step into the Ninth Stage, besides having a sufficiently complete inner world, it was even more necessary to fuse rules.</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord was stuck at this point. The fusion of spatial rules and fire rules had yet to reach perfect integration.</p><p></p><p>However, on Supreme Being Xia Qin, Lin Yuan felt that numerous rules were integrated as one. Even the two pillar rules of time and space were perfectly fused into space-time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Your aptitude is quite good. Knowing the second method to comprehend that severed body, you should also be aware of the existence of the Magic Jade Tower? You should possess an out-of-realm opportunity?" Supreme Being Xia Qin said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>But his heart was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Magic Jade Tower? Supreme Being Xia Qin also knew about the Magic Jade Tower?</p><p></p><p>All along, Lin Yuan thought that only he knew about the Magic Jade Tower, but now it seemed that the Supreme Beings of human civilization had known about it long ago?</p><p></p><p>As for the "out-of-realm opportunity" mentioned by Supreme Being Xia Qin... although it was not very accurate, the Gate of Myriad Realms should also be considered an "out-of-realm opportunity", right?</p><p></p><p>"Those old fellows from the Insectoid Race, I don't know from where, learned that a corpse of a Supreme Being from the Magic Jade Tower is about to drift in..."</p><p></p><p>"The Magic Jade Tower is a very ancient force. Their Tower Master has been missing for who knows how many years, and most of the members have also gone into hiding..."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin said with a hint of emotion.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan obediently listened below.</p><p></p><p>The pressure the Supreme Being gave him was too great. Moreover, judging from Supreme Being Xia Qin's tone, the so-called "out-of-realm opportunity" was not taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was certain that the Supreme Being should not have discovered the existence of the "Gate of Myriad Realms".</p><p></p><p>Up until now, among all the existences Lin Yuan had seen, only the majestic Gate of Myriad Realms deep in his mind could be comparable to Supreme Being Xia Qin before him.</p><p></p><p>But the Gate of Myriad Realms in his mind was merely an insignificant projection of the true Gate of Myriad Realms. In terms of level, the Gate of Myriad Realms was even above the Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Also, your mental will..."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the years experienced by your mental will should be different from your physical body and soul, right?" Supreme Being Xia Qin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>As an existence that completely mastered the rules of time, Supreme Being Xia Qin only needed to observe Lin Yuan for a moment to discover the difference in the flow of time on his body.</p><p></p><p>"The years experienced by the mental will?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had undergone seven traversals, and the actual years he experienced should be over a thousand years. However, he had never told anyone about this matter, not even Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, little fellow, don't be nervous. The mental will experiencing more years than the physical body and soul is not a rare occurrence. Many techniques and innate abilities can achieve this, such as Dreaming of Myriad Ancients, Time Room, and so on," Supreme Being Xia Qin said with a laugh, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>As a Supreme Being, one could go against the river of time and naturally slow down the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>In an instant outside, one could experience millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Or, millions of years could pass outside, while only an instant passed for oneself.</p><p></p><p>In addition, many innate abilities and techniques could also achieve this, basically related to time.</p><p></p><p>"Dreaming of Myriad Ancients... Time Room..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan secretly breathed a sigh of relief. Although he didn't know the specifics, since the Supreme Being had said so, it must be related to the speed of time flow.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>For Supreme Beings, manipulating time was not a difficult matter. They could even revive lives that had died in the past, so what was speeding up or slowing down the flow of time?</p><p></p><p>Of course, when it came to the speed of time flow, only Supreme Beings or those who mastered the complete rules of time could do it. It belonged to the highest level of abilities and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the flow of years in your mental will, your age should be around two thousand years old," Supreme Being Xia Qin said, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Strongest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan heard the words but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, are you thinking now that your title of genius is going to be lost?" Xia Qin, the Strongest, said jokingly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for such thoughts," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said. "If you live long enough, you can enter the Eighth Stage. How could there be only a few Eighth Stage experts in our Human Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Goddess of Wisdom said that you are the founder of an evolutionary path with great potential."</p><p></p><p>"Under the condition of constantly pioneering evolutionary paths, with just a mental age of two thousand years old, you can achieve such accomplishments. In the history of human civilization, your talent is enough to rank in the top twenty or top ten," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's mental age was the same as his physical and primordial spirit age, only in his thirties, he would still doubt whether Lin Yuan had some other background.</p><p></p><p>In his thirties, entering the Eighth Stage and pioneering an evolutionary path with great potential was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>Even the Strongest found it absurd.</p><p></p><p>"In the history of human civilization, talent ranked in the top twenty or top ten."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan blinked his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This kind of evaluation was frighteningly high. This was the history of human civilization, spanning over two million years in the Star Sea Era. How many monsters and demons had appeared in human civilization?</p><p></p><p>It even included the nine Strongest. If Lin Yuan could rank in the top twenty or top ten, wouldn't he be the first in line below the Strongest?</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xia Qin, the Strongest's evaluation of himself, Lin Yuan couldn't help feeling a little complacent, but he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong one's talent was, if it couldn't be transformed into strength, it was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>In the more than two million years of the Star Sea Era, there were many evolvers who had the potential to become the Strongest, but in the end, human civilization only had nine Strongest.</p><p></p><p>"Mastering talent techniques similar to Dreaming of Myriad Ancients can indeed give you a huge advantage in the early stages of cultivation, but that's all. At the Seventh and Eighth Stages, this kind of ability is no longer so crucial," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Dreaming of Myriad Ancients meant experiencing countless years in a dream, which was an easy feat for the Strongest.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan relied on abilities similar to Dreaming of Myriad Ancients, using only about two thousand years to reach his current level still couldn't conceal his heaven-defying aptitude.</p><p></p><p>That's why Xia Qin, the Strongest, evaluated Lin Yuan as being in the top twenty or top ten in the entire history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the traversing function of the Myriad Realms Gate was far more than just Dreaming of Myriad Ancients.</p><p></p><p>Traversing to a world, absorbing the essence of that world's cultivation system, and comprehending the fluctuations of various rules under different latitudes and dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Strongest, only saw that the flow of time in Lin Yuan's mental will was abnormal, but he didn't discover the existence of the Myriad Realms Gate.</p><p></p><p>"With your talent and aptitude, you won't encounter too many shackles in cultivating at the Eighth Stage, but you must think carefully about the final fusion of rules," Xia Qin, the Strongest, reminded.</p><p></p><p>"The rule fusion here doesn't refer to the fusion between ordinary rules, but the fusion between pillar rules and other rules."</p><p></p><p>"You must carefully consider which rules to fuse with the pillar rules."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, Strongest," Lin Yuan nodded. The so-called pillar rules were spatial rules, time rules, life rules, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have already entered the Eighth Stage, I suppose you are about to go to the frontier star domains to guard for five hundred years?" Xia Qin, the Strongest, looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But I haven't chosen which star domain yet," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The frontier star domains are full of dangers. I'll give you a treasure," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't refuse. Do you think your strength is very powerful? That you have clone techniques? Or that we will resurrect you? You think you won't die?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Strongest, looked at Lin Yuan and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Clone techniques are not infallible, and resurrection methods can't resurrect everything," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said. "For example, memory pollution. No matter how many clones you have, you'll still die. As long as the memory remains after resurrection, you'll still die."</p><p></p><p>"Memory pollution." Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn. The conditions for using this technique were even more restrictive than the Curse Killing Technique. With Lin Yuan's current strength, it would be very difficult even for a Tenth Stage expert to perform memory pollution on him.</p><p></p><p>"I will bestow upon you a treasure called the 'Mind-Stabilizing Pearl'. Even if a Strongest performs memory pollution or other techniques on you, you can persist for an instant," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, directly self-destruct and wait for me to resurrect you."</p><p></p><p>"It can block the instant of a Strongest?" Lin Yuan was shocked in his heart. What kind of existence were the Strongest? Their attack techniques were unpredictable and strange. For example, before meeting Xia Qin, the Strongest, if a certain powerful alien wanted to kill Lin Yuan, it wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>But the Strongest all had their reputations. Lin Yuan's current outward appearance was only an Eighth Stage expert under a hundred years old, not worth the Strongest taking action.</p><p></p><p>If it was revealed that Lin Yuan was not only an Eighth Stage expert under a hundred years old but also the founder of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, it would be hard to say.</p><p></p><p>"Remember," Xia Qin, the Strongest, said with a solemn expression. "Once the 'Mind-Stabilizing Pearl' is passively triggered, you must choose to self-destruct without hesitation. Absolutely do not delay."</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan didn't suffer from memory pollution and other techniques, he could take action to resurrect him without harming his foundation.</p><p></p><p>But once he was memory polluted, it would be like a heart demon tribulation. Even the Strongest couldn't remove everything. Even if he was resurrected, he would still die.</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember," Lin Yuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>What Xia Qin, the Strongest, was considering were the extreme situations Lin Yuan would face. The Strongest taking action? Under normal circumstances, the Strongest wouldn't take action.</p><p></p><p>If an alien Strongest took action to eliminate a human genius, then the Strongest of human civilization would also take action to eliminate alien geniuses.</p><p></p><p>In that case, everyone might as well not go out.</p><p></p><p>Unless the alien Strongest saw the hope of becoming a Strongest in Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they wouldn't bother paying attention.</p><p></p><p>There were still some Eighth Stage evolvers under a hundred years old in the history of human civilization, but in the end, not many of them could touch the realm of the Strongest.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Strongest, knew that Lin Yuan was the founder of the Martial Dao evolutionary path. As the founder, being able to reach this point without a precedent indeed gave him the possibility of becoming a Strongest.</p><p></p><p>But Xia Qin, the Strongest, knew, while the alien Strongest didn't know.</p><p></p><p>In the entire human civilization, only the three Goddesses and the nine Strongest knew that Lin Yuan was the founder of the Martial Dao evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"The Mind-Stabilizing Pearl, I will have someone send it to you as soon as possible," Xia Qin, the Strongest, waved his hand and sent Lin Yuan out of this virtual world.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan disappeared, Xia Qin, the Strongest's smile began to fade.</p><p></p><p>"I hope... you can grow up smoothly," Xia Qin, the Strongest, looked at the spot where Lin Yuan last stood, his eyes flashing with a hint of expectation.</p>

            <p>Chapter 295 Multi-Dimensional Life (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>After the Goddess of Wisdom's reminder, the alert at the Observation Branch was gradually lifted.</p><p></p><p>The staff, now relaxed, couldn't help but discuss in low voices. </p><p></p><p>"The Goddess of Wisdom said the energy fluctuations in that star region were caused by an Evolver breaking through to the 9th stage?"</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to the 9th stage caused such a huge disturbance?"</p><p></p><p>Many staff members were curious, as they had never witnessed an Evolver breaking through to the 9th stage.</p><p></p><p>But they vaguely felt something was off. Even for peak 8th stage Evolvers, after fully integrating with the Rules, their inner worlds at most spanned a few million miles in diameter. </p><p></p><p>Adding on their physical bodies, souls, mental wills and so on.</p><p></p><p>Even if they broke through and underwent "qualitative changes" in all aspects, with energy fluctuations increasing dozens or hundreds of times, that would still only be equivalent to seven or eight stars.</p><p></p><p>But the energy fluctuations they just observed affected a range of over ten light years. Even if a hundred or a thousand 8th stage Evolvers broke through to the 9th stage together, it shouldn't cause fluctuations over such a huge area, right?</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through from 8th to 9th stage definitely wouldn't cause such a huge disturbance."</p><p></p><p>"But since the Goddess of Wisdom said so, she must have her reasons."</p><p></p><p>Although the many staff members didn't understand, they didn't question the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Which 8th stage Evolver do you think broke through to the 9th stage?"</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to guess. There are so many peak 8th stage Evolvers in our human civilization. Many peak 8th stagers travel the universe seeking breakthroughs, so they could break through anywhere."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, our human civilization has gained another 9th stage Evolver. Judging from the breakthrough disturbance, they're definitely not an ordinary 9th stager. Humanity will forever prosper!"</p><p></p><p>The staff members had excited expressions. Although they weren't the ones breaking through to the 9th stage, they were all part of human civilization. The more powerful human civilization became, the better lives they would lead.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, competition between races was brutal. If a race wasn't strong enough, its people would often meet extremely tragic fates.</p><p></p><p>For example, many of those scarce special lifeforms were captured to extract their bloodline essences to refine bloodline elixirs. </p><p></p><p>Was it because those special lifeforms were willing to sacrifice themselves?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>It was because they were too weak.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the weakness here was relative to human civilization as a whole.</p><p></p><p>Special lifeforms as individuals were often very powerful, comparable to geniuses among human Evolvers from the start.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the discussions of the staff, the team leader Wang Xin was much calmer.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Region..."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, team leader Wang Xin's first thought was of that Galaxy Star Lord who had created countless miracles.</p><p></p><p>Although it was publicly acknowledged that the Galaxy Star Lord was almost certain to step into the 9th stage, he should have needed at least a hundred more years to do so.</p><p></p><p>The later stages of Rule integration were not easy to get through. Since the Galaxy Star Lord had comprehended the complete Space Rules, the difficulty of integrating the Rules should be even higher.</p><p></p><p>After all, controlling the integration of partial Space Rules was definitely less difficult than manipulating the integration of complete Space Rules.</p><p></p><p>Because the Galaxy Star Lord had created too many miracles, if he now broke the assumption of needing a hundred years to reach the 9th stage, it seemed quite normal too.</p><p></p><p>"Every Evolver of our human civilization who steps into the 9th stage will issue a public announcement to intimidate the myriad races. This is an elevation of our foundation, there's no need to hide it."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Galaxy Star Lord or not, we'll know in a while by checking the announcements."</p><p></p><p>Team Leader Wang Xin thought silently, a hint of anticipation flashing across his face.</p><p></p><p>In the desolate starry space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still sensing the changes in himself. </p><p></p><p>Going from 8th to 9th stage was a major leap. His inner world had become thick and substantial, deriving layers upon layers of space, and his life essence had also been elevated.</p><p></p><p>"I can now vaguely sense the passage of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes slightly. The essence of 9th stage life was powerful enough to perceive subtle fluctuations in time.</p><p></p><p>Time, one of the pillar Rules of the universe, was even more abstruse and subtle compared to the equally fundamental Space Rules.</p><p></p><p>Lifeforms below the 9th stage couldn't even sense the Time Rules, let alone comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan possessed a heaven-defying comprehension ability. If he forcefully tried to comprehend some time-related evolution paths, he could also comprehend the Time Rules, but that would be too strenuous.</p><p></p><p>"If one's comprehension of the Time Rules reaches a certain level, controlling the flow rate of time on one's body, so that ten thousand years pass outside while only a year or a decade passes for oneself, wouldn't that be another form of life extension?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why those beings who had comprehended the Time Rules, although not the most supreme, could attain a different kind of "eternity".</p><p></p><p>Of course, this so-called different kind of "eternity" was ultimately just that - different. No matter how much one controlled the flow rate of time, one's lifespan would still be exhausted one day.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation at the 9th stage is mainly divided into two aspects."</p><p></p><p>"The first is to open up layers upon layers of space within one's inner world. This is also the foundation of a 9th stage powerhouse's battle strength. The various cultivation stages within the 9th stage are also named based on this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>There were five stages in the 9th stage.</p><p></p><p>Ten Layered Realm.  </p><p>Myriad Layered Realm.</p><p>Hundred Thousand Layered Realm.</p><p>Million Layered Realm.</p><p>Ten Million Layered Realm.</p><p></p><p>The ten layers, myriad layers, hundred thousand layers, million layers, ten million layers here referred to the number of space layers in one's inner world.</p><p></p><p>Ten Layered meant ten layers of space.  </p><p>Myriad Layered meant ten thousand layers of space.</p><p></p><p>And so on, with Ten Million Layered meaning ten million layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Space layers were the depth of foundation of one's inner world, and one's inner world was an Evolver's foundation.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's inner world, the stronger the world force, and the stronger the nourishing effect on an Evolver's physical body, soul, and mental will.</p><p></p><p>"The space layers in my inner world now are roughly at thirty-nine thousand layers, which means I'm at the Myriad Layered stage of the 9th stage? And among those in the Myriad Layered stage, I'm not considered weak?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Those Evolvers who had just entered the 9th stage often only opened up single digit space layers, not even reaching the Ten Layered Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they say those invincible 8th stagers, after entering the 9th stage, all have very fast cultivation speeds. The universal force has a great promoting effect on opening up space layers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan comprehended dozens of types of ordinary universal forces, more than ten types of higher universal forces, and one type of origin-level universal force.</p><p></p><p>Just by initially stepping into the 9th stage, he had opened up nearly forty thousand space layers.</p><p></p><p>This alone put him tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years of bitter cultivation ahead of those newly entered 9th stage Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"The key point is that the promoting effect of universal force on opening up space layers is not a one-time thing, but a continuous one."</p><p></p><p>After sensing carefully for a while more, Lin Yuan came to a conclusion. </p><p></p><p>In other words, as Lin Yuan continued to open up space layers in the future, it would also be much easier compared to other 9th stage Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"As for the second aspect of cultivation at the 9th stage, it is comprehending the Time Rules."</p><p></p><p>"But this doesn't make much of a difference, at least not a significant one before advancing to the Ten Million Layered Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even if 9th stage Evolvers could comprehend the Time Rules, it was a strained comprehension. They couldn't even enter the door of</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's hard to do.</p><p></p><p>"Almost there."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly sensed the changes in himself, and his figure suddenly disappeared as he returned to the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Even the Central Star Domain, far away in the central star area, observed an A-level energy fluctuation occurring in the Galactic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>As the core of the Galactic Star Domain, the main star of the galaxy naturally also monitored it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, compared with the observation branch of the Central Star Domain, the many evolved beings on the main star of the galaxy felt it more concretely and delicately.</p><p></p><p>And more heart-trembling.</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a huge energy fluctuation, even the powerful eighth-stage evolved beings were as fragile as dust.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"How could there be such a powerful energy fluctuation?"</p><p></p><p>The red-skinned and green-eyed eighth-stage aliens frowned. They had experience managing the main star of Chi Kun before, and in recent years, they had been managing the main star of the galaxy for Lin Yuan diligently.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, discovering that such a thing had appeared within the Galactic Star Domain, they immediately took it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Not sure."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the energy fluctuation erupted in the desolate area of the star domain, and there is no loss for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Chun Bo and Jia Li shook their heads, feeling a little frightened and uneasy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They also predicted many possibilities, including alien invasion.</p><p></p><p>If it was really like this, according to the level of that energy fluctuation, it would take at least ninth-stage aliens, no, at least dozens of ninth-stage aliens joining hands to descend to be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>Oh my god.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of ninth-stage aliens?</p><p></p><p>The many eighth-stage evolved beings present had never seen so many ninth-stage powerhouses in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>"Has this matter been reported to the Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Chun Bo calmed himself and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was an alien invasion or not, this matter should first be reported to Lin Yuan, who was the pillar supporting the heavens of the main star of the galaxy and even the Galactic Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>"I contacted him."</p><p></p><p>"The Star Lord did not reply to me."</p><p></p><p>The red-skinned one said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Jia Li was slightly stunned and immediately said in a serious tone, "Contact him again."</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at everyone and said in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the ninth stage put Lin Yuan in a good mood, and his tone also became much better.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord, you're here."</p><p></p><p>The anxious minds of all the evolved beings in the hall actually quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li and Wu Lan also looked at Lin Yuan with excitement.</p><p></p><p>They had been on the main star of the galaxy for some time, but they had never seen Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord." After a moment, Chun Bo tentatively asked, "You said not to worry..."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>The others immediately pricked up their ears.</p><p></p><p>That energy fluctuation was too great and appeared in the Galactic Star Domain, how could they not worry?</p><p></p><p>"The energy fluctuation was caused by my breakthrough to the ninth stage, and it only affected the desolate areas, and will not have any impact on the life planets and resource planets."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The star domain where the breakthrough took place was carefully selected by Lin Yuan, with the purpose of minimizing the impact of his breakthrough as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"So it was the Star Lord's doing."</p><p></p><p>Chun Bo nodded, and then immediately noticed something was wrong, his voice trembling, "Star Lord, what did you just say? Breakthrough to the ninth stage?"</p><p></p><p>The others were also stunned, looking at Lin Yuan in shock.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough to the ninth stage?</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>His breakthrough to the ninth stage would be made public by human civilization after a period of time to deter the myriad races of the starry sky, so there was no need to keep it secret.</p><p></p><p>As for why not hide it and use it as a trump card?</p><p></p><p>Human civilization did secretly cultivate evolved beings, but these evolved beings were unknown from the first stage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who was regarded as the strongest genius of human civilization in this generation, had no need to hide at all.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization was not some weak race that needed to conceal its strength and bide its time. As the strongest and most powerful race at the pinnacle of the universe and starry sky, other races were afraid to offend them.</p><p></p><p>The more abnormal and monstrous the geniuses of human civilization were, the greater the deterrence to other races.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord, you have become a ninth-stage?"</p><p></p><p>The two eighth-stage aliens, Green-Eyes and Red-Skin, were in a daze for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, the two of them were given to Lin Yuan by the Chi Kun Star Lord to serve as powerful subordinates for entering the star domain.</p><p></p><p>From the prosperous Chi Kun Star Domain to the barren Galactic Star Domain, from the invincible eighth-stage Chi Kun Star Lord to the newly entered eighth-stage Galactic Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although the two eighth-stage aliens, Green-Eyes and Red-Skin, did not dare to have other thoughts, there was still a gap in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had entered the ninth stage?</p><p></p><p>Completely surpassing their former master, the Chi Kun Star Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li's mind was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>Back then, as a Chi Wen examiner, he was overjoyed when he was selected by the Thirteenth Peak Lord to join the Thirteen Mountain Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the analysis of the family behind him, the Thirteenth Peak Lord of the Chi Kun lineage had great potential.</p><p></p><p>His joining the Thirteen Mountain Peaks was equivalent to holding onto a big thick leg and a big backer for the future.</p><p></p><p>But looking at it now?</p><p></p><p>This future had come too quickly, right?</p><p></p><p>And this leg was too thick, right?</p><p></p><p>Ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>How long had it been?</p><p></p><p>Mo Li swallowed and suddenly became apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Could he really grasp this surprise that fell from the sky?</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Star Lord for entering the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan was the first to react, mainly because she did not fully understand the significance and impact of Lin Yuan entering the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Ignorance is bliss, and it's not without reason.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Star Lord for entering the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others also immediately came to their senses and congratulated in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, rise."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand and said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord." Jia Li said cautiously, "I heard that ninth-stage evolved beings can merge with the great universe. I wonder if it's true?"</p><p></p><p>One may not have eaten pork, but one has seen a pig run.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world of human civilization, there were many video introductions about ninth-stage evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"Merge with the great universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly, "It's just a means of integrating into the deeper spatial layers."</p><p></p><p>The inner world of ninth-stage evolved beings gave rise to layers upon layers of spatial layers, thereby exploring the spatial layers of the main universe more deeply and farther.</p><p></p><p>Using the spatial layers of the inner world to resonate with the spatial layers of the main universe and thus integrate into it, this was the outside world's understanding of ninth-stage evolved beings merging with the great universe.</p><p></p><p>As for ninth-stage evolved beings in this state... unless the spatial layer they were in was locked, they could ignore any attacks from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Physical attacks.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual attacks.</p><p></p><p>Even more mysterious attacks.</p><p></p><p>They were not in the same spatial layer, and could not even touch each other, let alone attack.</p><p></p><p>This method of merging with the great universe was also a common method used by ninth-stage evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>If the battle between evolved beings at the eighth stage and below was simply a contest of attack power.</p><p></p><p>Then the battle between ninth-stage and stronger evolved beings was about whether you could find the spatial layer where the other party was located.</p>

            <p>Chapter 250: The Eighth Crossing (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Guiding Ruan Wei was just a casual gesture for Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>Over the past decade, Ruan Wei had been running around for the sake of the Milky Way Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had seen it all, and now that he sensed the other party had taken the wrong path, he didn't mind pulling him back.</p><p></p><p>After all, for Lin Yuan, it was just a matter of a few words, and he didn't have to pay any price.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that he was tired from cultivation, so it was just a simple favor.</p><p></p><p>After wandering outside for a while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the palace again.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness connected to the virtual world, arriving at the top of a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Under the vast sky, that truncated body still existed, as if it had never changed for eternity.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around, and quite a few evolvers began to try not to cultivate, but instead to realize more evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But these evolvers only accounted for a very small number, and they had to endure the huge pressure on their mind and will, and also had to realize one evolutionary path after another.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan possessed a heaven-defying comprehension ability, it took him quite a while to accomplish this back then. For other genius evolvers to walk through this path, it was not impossible to say.</p><p></p><p>It would also be a matter of a long time to come.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan informed the Goddess of Wisdom about this comprehension method, and ultimately only obtained 1.5 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>It was too difficult, just like in a feudal dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Given the emperor a set of blueprints for building a nuclear plant?</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Lin Yuan still felt that choosing to cultivate a certain evolutionary path and perfecting it to the final stage in order to become an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower was more reliable.</p><p></p><p>"This aspect of the life rules of this evolutionary path is also wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to comprehend, and after realizing a evolutionary path, he would analyze it and gain insights into the parts that were helpful to him.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten years, Lin Yuan had comprehended more than 20,000 evolutionary paths from this truncated body, and each evolutionary path could benefit him greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Just a partial body contains nearly countless evolutionary paths and ways. Is this what an ultimate expert is like?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when I, Lin Yuan, can become such an existence?"</p><p></p><p>In the process of constant comprehension, Lin Yuan vaguely felt the height at which the ultimate experts existed.</p><p></p><p>It was too remarkable.</p><p></p><p>That kind of ultimate mastery of a path, eternal existence, even time could not erode it. What kind of scenery would that be?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had also seen the ultimate expert Xia Qin, but the other party did not release any useful aura.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not gain any insights from it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought while comprehending.</p><p></p><p>"How many evolutionary paths do I need to realize to become a member of the next stage of the Magic Jade Tower? I have already comprehended more than 20,000 kinds, and it hasn't been triggered yet. Could it be that I need to realize 33,333 kinds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Realizing 3,333 evolutionary paths would automatically make one an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>At present, Lin Yuan had already comprehended more than 20,000 evolutionary paths, so there was reason to speculate that the next stage members of the Magic Jade Tower needed to realize 33,333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>More than 30,000 evolutionary paths. Although it was ten times 3,333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But the difficulty would definitely increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even suspected that being an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower was already the limit, and there was no next stage member level at all.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's 30,000 or 300,000."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it can be helpful to me, I will continue to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he fell into a state of deep comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Star Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, and his parents and sister were already sitting there.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan."</p><p></p><p>Mother Lu Qiong greeted with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Brother." Sister Lin Yi was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>After ten years, Lin Yi had grown up, and with the help of her relationship with Lin Yuan, she had come into contact with many things in the upper circles of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Lin Yi realized what kind of existence her brother was.</p><p></p><p>He was a super absolute genius who was dazzling in the entire human civilization alliance and competed with the descendants of ultimate experts.</p><p></p><p>Because of Lin Yuan, Canglan Star, an inconspicuous medium-sized living planet, had become a popular planet in the Chi Kun Star Domain and even the Annan Star Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Many major forces and families from various star domains specially sent their clan members to Canglan Star to reproduce offspring.</p><p></p><p>Since Canglan Star was able to give birth to a super absolute genius like Lin Yuan, it indicated that it had special features. Otherwise, why didn't those high-level living planets give birth to super absolute geniuses like Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>It was precisely due to this consideration that the hottest industry on Canglan Star turned out to be the fertility industry?</p><p></p><p>"How has your cultivation been recently?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually chatted with his parents.</p><p></p><p>After entering the eighth stage, Lin Yuan began to pay attention to the cultivation of his parents and relatives.</p><p></p><p>He even occasionally gave guidance.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of doing this.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he hoped that his parents and sister would live a little longer.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization was technologically advanced, and even if one did not become an evolver, there were many life-prolonging means.</p><p></p><p>But among all the life-prolonging methods, the most perfect and risk-free one was still the path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>That is, to become an evolver.</p><p></p><p>"Our talent shouldn't be very good. The analysis videos you gave us, we need a long time to gain some insight."</p><p></p><p>Father Lin Shoucheng shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>At first, he had ambitions for the path of evolution, thinking that he could give birth to a super genius like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the genes of the old Lin family should be pretty good, right?</p><p></p><p>But when he truly stepped into the path of evolution, he was dealt a fatal blow without suspense.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Qiong was also struggling in cultivation, Lin Shoucheng didn't know why, but he actually felt a slight sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>"You still have to work hard."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Lin Yuan would not let his parents undergo those life-prolonging modification technologies.</p><p></p><p>"Work hard, work hard."</p><p></p><p>"The two of us will definitely work hard."</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng nodded and said, who wouldn't want to become a powerful evolver who could traverse the starry sky?</p><p></p><p>Now that his son had become a star lord, the cultivation conditions for the two of them were envied by countless evolvers, so they would naturally work hard in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan, you should also rest more."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too tired, the frontier star domains are also dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Xiao Yuan, do you have to go to the frontier star domains?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng muttered.</p><p></p><p>He still hoped that his son would stay in the Chi Kun Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>How dangerous were the frontier star domains? Those violent alien races...</p><p></p><p>"Of course I have to go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's current identity, especially his identity as the founder of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He was qualified to apply for exemption from being stationed in the frontier star domains.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not an evolution scholar, but he was better than an evolution scholar.</p><p></p><p>If he really applied to the Goddess of Wisdom, it would definitely be approved.</p><p></p><p>But that would be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan obediently went to the frontier star domain to take charge. Even if he was assassinated by alien races, at most he would be invincible at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan did not go to the frontier star domain to take charge, who knows what would happen. Those top-level alien divination masters would most likely obtain some information from the clues.</p><p></p><p>At that time, what awaited Lin Yuan was probably an even more dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>Even the Chikunxing Lord might not be able to protect him.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with his parents as usual.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind once again sank into the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, after entering the eighth level, the Gate of Myriad Realms is not without changes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Gate of Myriad Realms. At the eighth level, his mental will was greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Gate of Myriad Realms, he could also establish a connection with the main world and perceive everything that happened around his physical body in the main world in real time.</p><p></p><p>This was essentially the same as Lin Yuan being able to receive information transmitted from the Ancestral Demon Tree through the coordinates of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>If it were up to Lin Yuan himself, it would be impossible to perceive the other side across dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest might not be able to do it.</p><p></p><p>But with the help of the Gate of Myriad Realms, using this object as a "medium", it was possible to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>"This is also good."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>During the crossing, being able to feel the bits and pieces around the physical body in the main world was definitely a good thing for him.</p><p></p><p>When crossing to a lower-level world, the time flow was huge. Decades might pass there, while only a few minutes might pass in the main world.</p><p></p><p>But as the number of crossings increased, the level of the worlds Lin Yuan descended to became higher and higher, and the time flow rate with the main world was gradually shrinking.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the duration of the crossing was getting longer and longer. If a crisis appeared in the main world during Lin Yuan's crossing.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't he be powerless to resist?</p><p></p><p>But being able to sense the information around the physical body in the main world gave Lin Yuan a chance to choose.</p><p></p><p>If a huge crisis really appeared in the main world that could cause damage to his physical body, Lin Yuan would definitely forcibly end the crossing and return his mental will to the main body.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the loss of a single crossing, Lin Yuan valued his physical body more.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention how much Lin Yuan had paid for this physical body.</p><p></p><p>Just based on the fact that the physical body was the "way marker" for the mental will to return, Lin Yuan would not allow any problems with the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I can bring the gourd with me when I cross."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved and he began to communicate with the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Myriad Realms could cross the physical body, so naturally it could bring items to cross.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of how much breaking realm power was required.</p><p></p><p>During the seventh crossing, Lin Yuan had brought the origin essence gold to the Tianqing World and placed it in the world origin to nurture it, saving him hundreds of years of time.</p><p></p><p>The gourd was also an external object, so it should be possible to bring it into the crossing world.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it can, also a strand of breaking realm power?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a strand of breaking realm power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly. Now his breaking realm power reserves were close to forty strands, which was considered rich and generous.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is pretty much taken care of."</p><p></p><p>"It's time for the eighth crossing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged and he made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Each crossing could greatly increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>And being in the frontier star domain, Lin Yuan inevitably lacked a sense of security and was eager to increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Which crossing method should I choose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>First of all, the random crossing method was a bit unstable for the current Lin Yuan, so it was better not to choose it if possible.</p><p></p><p>Excluding random crossing, there was only targeted crossing.</p><p></p><p>There were two types of targeted crossing. The first type consumed one hundred strands of breaking realm power and formulated the world crossing according to one's own requirements.</p><p></p><p>The one hundred strands of breaking realm power here was just a starting point. If the selected world level was too high, the consumed breaking realm power would only be more.</p><p></p><p>The second type consumed ten strands of breaking realm power and descended to the world where the world coordinates were obtained.</p><p></p><p>Among the world coordinates currently possessed by Lin Yuan, there were only two worth visiting again.</p><p></p><p>One was the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>The other was the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing World was the world of his seventh crossing, and the boundless void there was still not fully explored by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spirit Realm, it was the "upper realm" of the Zhongtu Shenzhou World.</p><p></p><p>"This time, let's cross to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart. The immortal cultivation system had a significant help to the martial arts evolution path, while the boundless void was full of foreign gods, which was relatively less helpful than the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan divided a strand of his mind and merged it into the Gate of Myriad Realms along the bottom of the gate, where the Spirit Realm world coordinates were.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived outside an incomparably vast great world.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to looking up at that time, it was much clearer now. The vast world power operation was simply going to crush everything.</p><p></p><p>"Are those the millions of small worlds below the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down and discovered countless spots of light, which were probably the lower realms similar to Zhongtu Shenzhou.</p><p></p><p>It was said that there were more than a million such lower realms.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Above?"</p><p></p><p>After observing the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan subconsciously looked up.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he discovered a corner of an even more vast world.</p><p></p><p>"There are more worlds?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the legendary Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled in his heart. In the many secret manuals of the Daode Immortal Sect in Zhongtu Shenzhou, Lin Yuan had seen mentions of the Immortal Realm above the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just go to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>This strand of Lin Yuan's mind shattered.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps that is the place where the ultimate immortal cultivation system resides?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. He did not know much about the Immortal Realm, or to be precise, the Daode Immortal Sect did not have many records about the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the immortals of the Daode Immortal Sect descending to communicate from time to time, there might not even be any records of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The duration of my stay in the Spirit Realm this time will probably be around nine hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"In terms of time flow ratio, it will probably be several hundred to one. After staying for the full duration, the main world will probably pass one or two years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan communicated with the Gate of Myriad Realms without hesitation, activating the Spirit Realm world coordinates, and his mental will suddenly surged into the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>From the distant past, flowing towards the endless future. </p><p></p><p>The lives within the river of time, the tenth level beings could barely be considered small fish and shrimp.</p><p></p><p>Just a bit stronger than 'particles'.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh level beings could be considered big fish.</p><p></p><p>Some extreme special existences within the eleventh level, the forms they revealed within the river of time, could be called massive creatures, covering half the riverbed.</p><p></p><p>"Can I be considered a big fish now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself, although he was only a tenth level being. </p><p></p><p>But his foundation was too profound, when projected into the river of time, he was no less impressive than those eleventh level beings.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what size I'll be in the river of time when I reach the eleventh level, or even the peak of the eleventh level?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>The forms all beings projected into the river were only related to the essence of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Unaffected by external forces.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan felt the thick fluctuations of the time rules while examining himself,</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lord Xia Qin had already fished out all the evolvers on the resurrection list.</p><p></p><p>These evolvers, upon returning to the current space-time, their memories immediately began 'synchronizing', until stopping right before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>The vast river of time was boundless, even just a branch contained countless lives.</p><p></p><p>So for a Supreme Lord to resurrect a powerful being, they had to lock onto that life's imprint to use as a 'guide'.</p><p></p><p>Without a life imprint as a 'guide', even a Supreme Lord could not accurately find the life they wanted to resurrect in the vast river of time.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Lords could leave the river of time, but they did not control the river itself.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I've been resurrected?"  </p><p></p><p>"I remember battling the War Tribe evolvers in sector A076, then I suddenly died."</p><p></p><p>Countless fished out evolvers first showed confusion in their eyes, then quickly became clearheaded.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, the Supreme Lords having resurrection abilities was no secret, moreover the resurrected evolvers basically all knew they could potentially be resurrected by a Supreme Lord.</p><p></p><p>After Supreme Lord Xia Qin completed resurrecting those on the list, he glanced at the many resurrected evolvers, and his form disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, evolvers from the Xia You Evolution Towers came to guide these newly resurrected evolvers.</p><p></p><p>A large portion of the evolvers had died tens of thousands of years ago, they were very unfamiliar with the current era and needed time to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"I was resurrected too?"</p><p></p><p>Among the many resurrected evolvers, they were divided into different circles based on their power levels.</p><p></p><p>Sixth stage evolvers in one circle, seventh stage in another, eighth stage in another, ninth stage in another.</p><p></p><p>As someone who had just entered the sixth stage, Fang Qing naturally was in the sixth stage evolvers' circle.</p><p></p><p>Around him were other sixth stage evolvers who had also been resurrected.  </p><p></p><p>"But I walked the Ancient God evolution path, I shouldn't have been eligible for resurrection?" Fang Qing wondered.</p><p></p><p>Around him, he recognized many of the other sixth stage resurrected evolvers, they were all peerless talents in their respective star domains.</p><p></p><p>As for himself?</p><p></p><p>Although he had only taken a few hundred years to reach the sixth stage,</p><p></p><p>He had taken the Ancient God evolution path, which was essentially a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other normal evolution paths, the Ancient God path had no requirements for aptitude or comprehension ability, as long as you were similar enough to the corresponding Ancient God.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization did not allocate many resources to Ancient God evolution path evolvers, much less resurrection quotas.</p><p></p><p>So Fang Qing was very puzzled how he also got resurrected.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord." </p><p></p><p>Fang Qing saw him and immediately stood up straight, respectfully greeting him.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>"How does it feel to be resurrected?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards Fang Qing and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, I just feel like I had a very long dream," Fang Qing answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord, was I able to be resurrected because..." Fang Qing couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"I requested to the Supreme Lord to add you to the resurrection list," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>"The resurrection list can be changed?" Fang Qing inwardly startled. As far as he knew, every single life on the resurrection list was repeatedly judged by the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>Only after that was it passed to the Supreme Lord for resurrection. </p><p></p><p>This was an ironclad rule of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was actually able to forcibly add him to the list?</p><p></p><p>Fang Qing had no idea that when Lin Yuan added him to the resurrection list, he didn't go through the three Goddesses at all.</p><p></p><p>He went directly to Supreme Lord Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>As the ultimate existence overseeing resurrection, for Xia Qin to resurrect one extra sixth stage evolver was just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Star Lord," Fang Qing took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what methods Lin Yuan used to get him on the resurrection list,</p><p></p><p>It must have cost an immense price - his life was essentially given by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't thank me yet."</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will personally cleanse the traces of your original evolution path from your fleshly body," Lin Yuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Qing was resurrected, he was still cultivating the Ancient God evolution path.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Ancient God Tuo Ba was willing, he could still...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was possible to remove Fang Qing's spiritual will at any time. </p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan wanted to do was to completely erase all traces of Fang Qing's cultivation of the ancient divine evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way could the connection with the ancient divine Tuoba be completely severed. </p><p></p><p>"Please take action, Star Lord," Fang Qing said without any rejection upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>In his last memory, his own cultivation evolutionary path had suddenly gone into rebellion, dragging his spiritual will into an unknown area.</p><p></p><p>Recalling it now, it must have been the influence of the ancient divine evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's actions,</p><p></p><p>The traces of Fang Qing's cultivation of the ancient divine evolutionary path were quickly wiped clean.</p><p></p><p>This was also possible because Fang Qing had just entered the sixth stage, coupled with Lin Yuan's formidable strength, on par with ordinary eleventh stage evolutionaries, allowing him to easily dispel the influence of the ancient divine evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba's thoughts stirred slightly as he looked towards the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"That good friend of the Milky Way Star Lord has been revived?" The ancient divine Tuoba thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, the ancient divine Tuoba had sensed the aura of the Milky Way Star Lord's good friend.</p><p></p><p>However, this aura disappeared immediately after, probably because the other party's cultivation of the ancient divine evolutionary path had been erased.</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>And he had no intention of taking any action.</p><p></p><p>First, it was because there was not enough time to take action in such a short period.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strongest beings of the human civilization had just revived the Milky Way Star Lord's good friend, and were probably nearby. Even if he took action, he would not be able to escape the notice of those strongest beings.</p><p></p><p>Second, there was no point.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the Milky Way Star Lord directly cursing and killing his good friend's spiritual will,</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba realized that the Milky Way Star Lord would not be threatened. Even if he took Fang Qing's spiritual will again, what could he do?</p><p></p><p>It would only lead the Milky Way Star Lord to curse and kill him again.</p><p></p><p>If the curse failed, the Milky Way Star Lord would not back down either, and would only make the human civilization more hostile towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Insect Race is inviting me to the No. A098 battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba frowned slightly. As an eleventh stage peak special life form like himself, he was often invited by peak race alliances to assist at major alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>But generally, the ancient divine Tuoba would refuse.</p><p></p><p>He was too lazy to get involved in the messes between those peak races.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>After confirming that he had offended the Milky Way Star Lord to death,</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba began to value his relations with other peak races.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Insect Race, which was already a mortal enemy of the human civilization. Since he was an enemy of the human civilization, if he did not give face to the Insect Race, his future retreat would become very narrow.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go this time."</p><p></p><p>The ancient divine Tuoba made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>On the Milky Way Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Death rules. Destruction rules."</p><p></p><p>"Great Destruction rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fused the death rules and destruction rules, two pillar rules, to form the Great Destruction rules.</p><p></p><p>The Great Destruction rules were purely offensive rules, even purer than the rules of life and death cycle.</p><p></p><p>It was also one of the few fusion pillar rules that could surpass the life and death cycle rules in terms of killing power.</p><p></p><p>In the years since breaking through to the tenth stage, besides comprehending the life and death cycle rules, Lin Yuan had also been comprehending the fusion of other pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>The Great Destruction rules were now the result.</p><p></p><p>"The twelve great gates of the black planet correspond to the Great Destruction rules."</p><p></p><p>A thought arose in Lin Yuan's mind, and his Yin spirit immediately descended upon the black planet.</p><p></p><p>"Great Destruction"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the gate representing the Great Destruction rules, and operated the aura of the Great Destruction rules to push open the gate, walking inside.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived before an altar similar to the path of the life and death cycle rules.</p><p></p><p>"You again?"</p><p></p><p>Black gaseous flows emerged, condensing into a black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Lin Yuan and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately greeted the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>"When will the test take place?" Lin Yuan went straight to the point, not wanting to waste time.</p><p></p><p>"Test?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that Lin Yuan had probably only just comprehended the Great Destruction rules recently.</p><p></p><p>But with the previous test of the life and death cycle rules, the black-robed man was clear that the tests set by the black planet were basically non-existent in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Just go in quickly."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man did not want to waste time either, waving his right hand to create a black gate about five meters in size.</p><p></p><p>Rather than letting Lin Yuan exert full effort again, shaking the interior of the black planet, it was better to let him go in and comprehend quickly.</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to see or bother with it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." Seeing this, Lin Yuan did not decline either.</p><p></p><p>He immediately condensed an avatar and entered the black gate.</p><p></p><p>Especially in an area with only a few miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>However, this place was filled with the infinite aura of the Great Destruction rules.</p><p></p><p>"Great Destruction"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the changes in the aura of the Great Destruction rules. With the blessing of his divine comprehension, terrifying insights and enlightenment constantly surged forth.</p><p></p><p>And so,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two avatars rapidly comprehended the life and death cycle rules and the Great Destruction rules.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, his main body, sun spirit, and moon spirit cultivated other rules, secrets, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, fifty years passed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The physical divine abilities originate from the depths of one's bloodline. </p><p></p><p>It was when Lingyuan descended to the earthly realm of the Central Plains that he integrated the essence of the Body Cultivation lineage into the martial path.</p><p></p><p>Thus possessing a certain ability. </p><p></p><p>Normally, the more profound one's physical foundation, the higher the level of physical divine abilities born from it.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the Divine Realm, Lingyuan's physical body possessed the Dragon Race bloodline. </p><p></p><p>The physical divine ability ultimately manifested was the 'Elemental Body', granting immunity to ninety percent of same-level rule-based attacks.</p><p></p><p>And in terms of profound foundation, none of Lingyuan's previous nine crossings could compare to the present.</p><p></p><p>The boundless primordial essence of the Azure Youthful World took over ten million years to gestate and form, and was then nurtured for another ten million years into the Martial Ancestor's Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of foundation, Lingyuan felt he was not much inferior to those unique, singular existences in the main universe.  </p><p></p><p>With such a physical body, what level of physical divine ability would be condensed through the path of martial evolution?</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan examined his own body. For the convenience of descending, this Martial Ancestor's Golden Body was also made of flesh and blood, meeting all the prerequisites for condensing a physical divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Begin cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan gathered his thoughts and immersed his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the past nine crossings, whenever Lingyuan wanted to cultivate and recover his strength, he had to rely on vast external resources.</p><p></p><p>There were no boundaries to his realm, but the accumulation of energy was still necessary.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Within this Martial Ancestor's Golden Body was contained energy equivalent to an entire realm - otherwise Lingyuan could not have easily suppressed those two outer-domain demonic gods.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the 'Heavenly Dao' of the Azure Youthful World, Lingyuan could command all of its resources with a thought.</p><p></p><p>Thus,</p><p></p><p>The Lingyuan who had now immersed himself in cultivation had no delays at all.</p><p></p><p>Just one breath, and he entered the first level of the martial path.  </p><p></p><p>Ten breaths, the second level.</p><p></p><p>Fifty breaths, the third level. </p><p></p><p>Half a stick of incense, the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>One full stick of incense, the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Half a period of time, the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>And at the sixth level of the martial path, he began to tap into the power deep within his bloodline - the stage where physical divine abilities were born through the path of martial evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan carefully sensed his own body, vaguely feeling a force deep within his flesh beginning to condense and sublimate.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the physical divine ability this body will condense will definitely surpass the previous four."</p><p></p><p>A sense of anticipation arose in Lingyuan's heart.  </p><p></p><p>So far, Lingyuan had mastered four physical divine abilities:</p><p></p><p>Blood Rebirth</p><p>Mountainmover  </p><p>Reinforcement</p><p>Elemental Body</p><p></p><p>Based on his past experiences condensing physical divine abilities, Lingyuan felt that the one currently condensing within his body was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was no absolute higher or lower among physical divine abilities - their effects varied in different situations.</p><p></p><p>But the aura of the imprint condensing deep within Lingyuan's flesh carried a sense of transcending the previous four abilities.</p><p></p><p>"At this current speed, for that imprint of divine ability deep in my flesh to fully form, it will likely take decades or even hundreds of years."</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan pondered, then shook his head.  </p><p></p><p>This was the normal case - the time an ordinary martial evolution cultivator at the sixth level would require.</p><p></p><p>But Lingyuan was not an ordinary cultivator - he was the Martial Ancestor, and had experienced nine crossings of re-cultivation, plus the main universe's fine control over his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan could easily accelerate the condensation of the divine imprint without any risk, allowing the physical divine ability to manifest sooner.</p><p></p><p>"Around three to four days should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Lingyuan estimated. In other words, in three to four days, the divine imprint deep within his flesh would fully condense.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>While paying attention to the rapid condensation of the divine imprint within, Lingyuan also continued cultivating, as he was only at the sixth level of the martial path, still some distance from recovering his strength at its peak.</p><p></p><p>As for not cultivating during the condensation of a physical divine ability to avoid interference with its formation? If this was his first time condensing one, Lingyuan might have had such concerns.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lingyuan naturally did not need to worry about that.  </p><p></p><p>There was no way around it - Lingyuan's realm was too high, and his control over the microscopic domains of his own body too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Many taboos of cultivation simply did not exist in Lingyuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Outside the martial hall,</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess Qingrao stood before the powerful experts of the Azure Youthful World.</p><p></p><p>"High Priestess, you're saying those two invading demonic gods were suppressed by the descent of the Martial Ancestor?" An old man with white hair asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They had also witnessed that battle, seeing the two outer-domain demonic gods vanish like insects.</p><p></p><p>But they did not discover who the actor was.</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing the High Priestess's explanation, the shock in their hearts could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor of legend had actually descended?</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise what?" </p><p></p><p>"Besides the Martial Ancestor, who else could possess such power? Who else would shelter us living beings?"</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess Qingrao said slowly. In fact, even until this moment, she had not fully recovered from the shock of the Martial Ancestor taking action.</p><p></p><p>First, the Martial Ancestor worshipped by the living beings of the Azure Youthful World for tens of millions of years had truly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Second, the Martial Ancestor was simply too powerful - powerful enough to defeat those two beings that could almost destroy the world.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Demonic gods from other realms, it seemed like a joke.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is benevolent and merciful."</p><p></p><p>The old man with white hair immediately believed it. </p><p></p><p>He gazed towards the grand gate of the Martial Palace, his eyes brimming with deep reverence.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, the other martial cultivators present felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Because all the martial cultivators vaguely sensed that the martial path they cultivated, when looking towards the depths of the Martial Palace, subtly induced a feeling of trembling worship.</p><p></p><p>As if they had seen the source of all martial paths in the world.</p><p></p><p>This feeling had never appeared before, even when facing the golden body of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>So the High Priest only gave a brief explanation, and no one in the audience raised any doubts.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor needs to seclude himself for a while."</p><p></p><p>"During this period, unless it's a major event, do not disturb the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The jade-like High Priest Qingyao immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The many martial cultivators respectfully responded, standing guard outside the Martial Palace with utmost reverence, ensuring the Martial Ancestor's secluded meditation was undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>In front of a vast empty realm.</p><p></p><p>A majestic figure sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>This majestic figure had eighteen arms and was a monstrous existence, with a frenzied, bizarre aura pervading and spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This majestic figure was the Black Demon Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>A formidable presence that shook the demonic gods of other realms.</p><p></p><p>"I have been comprehending this treasure for hundreds of thousands of years, but I still feel far from fully understanding it," the Black Demon Palace Master frowned, gazing at a 'diagram' before him.</p><p></p><p>Nearly two million years ago, he obtained this treasure from the empty realm before him, and had been comprehending it ever since.</p><p></p><p>It was by comprehending this 'diagram' that the Black Demon Palace Master's strength greatly transcended, eventually becoming one of the strongest demonic gods in this region, establishing the Black Demon Palace and commanding numerous demonic gods from other realms.</p><p></p><p>But even with his current strength and status, the Black Demon Palace Master still felt unsatisfied, as he sensed that the 'diagram' before him still held great secrets.</p><p></p><p>Yet no matter what, he could not fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this treasure is related to the legendary ninth stage of demonic gods?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Palace Master pondered.</p><p></p><p>The growth of demonic gods from other realms was divided into nine stages.</p><p></p><p>The ninth stage was legendary - demonic gods who reached this stage could be considered the sovereigns of all demonic gods, with strength capable of dominating the vast boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Black Demon Palace Master was only an eighth stage demonic god.</p><p></p><p>Although he was just one stage away from the ninth, the more he cultivated, the more the Black Demon Palace Master realized how immensely far he was from the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Palace Master vaguely sensed that the gap from the eighth to the ninth stage was even greater than from the first to the eighth stage, and by a huge margin.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Black Demon Palace Master continued comprehending the 'diagram' before him, suddenly -</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Palace Master's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' I sent out have been suppressed?"</p><p></p><p>As the Black Demon Palace Master commanded numerous subordinates, he naturally knew immediately about everything happening outside the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"I knew that world held great secrets - in just a few million years, its world origin surged tenfold. It seems it's true."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Palace Master's eyes flickered with a red glow.</p><p></p><p>He devoted most of his effort and time to comprehending the 'diagram' before him, which was why he had the 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' try to take over the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to go there myself."</p><p></p><p>The Black Demon Palace Master carefully put away the 'diagram' and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Since that world can easily deal with the 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles', it must not be simple. With my strength alone, I don't have full confidence to completely take it over."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the Black Demon Palace Master immediately began contacting his friends.</p><p></p><p>Although demonic gods from other realms did not have true friendship, for the sake of common interests, they would occasionally cooperate.</p><p></p><p>The few friends the Black Demon Palace Master called were also among the strongest demonic gods in this region, with strength on par with his own level.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Demon Palace Master's view, with his own strength, he lacked the assurance to deal with the existence in the Azure World that suppressed the 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles'.</p><p></p><p>But by joining forces with these friends, it would be a sure victory.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Three to four days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And in these three to four days, Lin Yuan had smoothly recovered to the Martial Dao tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way - in the Azure World, Lin Yuan's advantage was too great. Recovering his strength was simply a matter of accumulating energy, extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just the boundless world origin contained within the Martial Ancestor's golden body alone was enough for Lin Yuan to swiftly cultivate from the first stage to the ninth stage peak.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining step from the ninth stage peak to the tenth stage, it merely cost Lin Yuan half a day's time.</p><p></p><p>Recovering to the Martial Dao tenth stage strength was not unexpected for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For him, returning to the Martial Dao tenth stage was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Even if it wasn't the Azure World, but descending to another world, recovering to the Martial Dao tenth stage was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan truly anticipated was that after these three to four days of cultivation, the divine ability imprint deep within his flesh had completely taken form.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fifth physical divine ability was about to be born.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what aspect this newly condensed physical divine ability will be in?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped cultivating and carefully paid attention to the subtle changes deep within his flesh.</p><p></p><p>Two chapters completed.</p><p></p><p>Please support with spirit stones/votes!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

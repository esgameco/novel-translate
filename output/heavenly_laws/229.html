            <p>Chapter 229: Guidance and Plans (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"What does Senior Moli mean?" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yu felt a sense of unease in his heart when he saw Moli leave without hesitation. üçßüíã‚ûÖ‚ûàÔΩìÂçÑ‚ìäùîÅ.·∂ú‚ìûÔº≠üê†üêØ</p><p></p><p>In terms of background, he was far inferior to Moli, who came from a force that had once given birth to a sixth-level Falling Star powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>But to be designated as a "Gold Mark" by the Chihu Star Lord, Feng Yu was naturally not stupid. He knew that the Thirteenth Peak Master had the strongest talent and was most favored by the Chihu Star Lord. </p><p></p><p>After all, he was a junior disciple.</p><p></p><p>But so what?</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong one's talent is, it has no direct connection with whether one will teach disciples.</p><p></p><p>Among the many star alliances of human civilization, there were quite a few invincible eighth-level existences, but the Chihu Star Lord was unique because he was good at guiding disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master's talent was not as good as the Thirteenth Peak Master's, but after all, he had been with the Star Lord for the longest time, and now he had stepped into the eighth level. Soon, he would guard the star domain and become the new Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master he chose might be surpassed by the Thirteenth Peak Master after a long time, but at least before that long time, Feng Yu's choice was absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>However, Feng Yu's thoughts began to waver when he saw Moli's tone when asking him, and the hint of surprise in his expression when he learned that he had chosen the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Moli was a Red Mark and had a mysterious background. He should know a lot of information that he himself had never understood.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had made the wrong choice based on the other party's performance?</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu began to doubt himself.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the number "1" on his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>This number was the mark of the thirteen Peak Masters. Once it appeared, it could not be changed.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps a Red Mark examinee could change it, but as a mere Gold Mark, it was absolutely impossible for him.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved the face of the thirteen Peak Masters.</p><p></p><p>Before entering those thirteen big doors, the examinees could make their own choices.</p><p></p><p>But once they entered, it had already become a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe I would choose wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Thirteenth Peak Master has monstrous talent, it will take a lot of time for him to step into the eighth level, possibly a thousand or ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, my choice is correct."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong a seventh-level is, it's still seventh-level and can't compare to eighth-level."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu calmed himself down, thinking that Moli did this on purpose to shake his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu and many other examinees entered the First Peak together to meet the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of evolvers respectfully saluted the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master was indifferent and casual.</p><p></p><p>Among these examinees, only that Red Mark was worthy of an extra glance from him. As for Gold Marks? Those who could be selected by him to join the First Peak were basically all Gold Marks.</p><p></p><p>Gold Mark examinees were unparalleled geniuses on a planet in the outside world, but here, they were just starting out.</p><p></p><p>"Great Peak Master?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu stole a glance at the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"I gave up the Thirteenth Peak Master and chose the Great Peak Master. Perhaps I will be treated differently?" Feng Yu thought to himself, with a hint of expectation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>To Feng Yu's disappointment, the Great Peak Master never gave him an extra look from beginning to end, just like the other examinees. After listening to the Great Peak Master's instructions, he was led out by someone.</p><p></p><p>"No other treatment?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu felt unpleasant inside.</p><p></p><p>"There's no problem either."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Peak Master is an eighth-level evolver, and there are many days ahead."</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely better than choosing the Thirteenth Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth Peak Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Moli and Wu Lan walked into the hall nervously and respectfully saluted Lin Yuan after seeing him, "Greetings, Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the high seat, looking down at these two young examinees.</p><p></p><p>One was eighty-seven years old, and the other was sixty-nine.</p><p></p><p>The evolvers who could participate in the arena competition were all under a hundred years old. Many were ninety-eight or ninety-nine, trying to seize the last chance.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was younger than these two examinees, his actual age was much older when adding the time he had spent traversing worlds.</p><p></p><p>"There are not many people in the Thirteenth Peak. Since you two have been selected by me, you will be part of the Thirteenth Peak from now on." Lin Yuan looked at the two and began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Moli and Wu Lan were excited and quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wu Lan. She had never thought that as a Silver Mark examinee, she would be directly selected by a Peak Master, and it was the renowned Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Moli and said, "Moli, you have condensed the 'Heart of Battle' and have great talent in fighting and killing. Don't resist."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Moli immediately let go of all defenses.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness immediately began to probe into Moli's body.</p><p></p><p>Although Moli's current body was not his real one, the 100% replication in the virtual world was no different from his real body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed Moli's physical body and soul, while comprehending based on Moli's specialty in "battle".</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary, comprehending unknown physical bodies and souls, and deriving corresponding evolution secret techniques.]</p><p></p><p>In just over ten breaths, Lin Yuan created a complete evolution secret technique perfectly suited for Moli.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique was completely tailored for Moli. Other evolvers might not benefit much from cultivating it, but for Moli, it was a guiding light for his current stage and even future stages.</p><p></p><p>It could correct the path Moli was walking and even allow him to go further in the future.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan withdrew his consciousness and looked at Moli.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master?"</p><p></p><p>Moli opened his eyes and asked with some unease.</p><p></p><p>"I have a secret technique here that is more suitable for you."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, Lin Yuan transmitted the secret technique he had just comprehended to Moli's mind.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending this secret technique did not consume too much of Lin Yuan's energy. After all, there was no need to focus on its universality, only based on Moli's situation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was currently at the peak of the seventh level. Moli was only at the fourth level. From a higher perspective, it could be said to be simple and effortless.</p><p></p><p>"This secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>Moli briefly browsed the evolution secret technique that surged in his mind, and his heart was instantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that this secret technique was extremely compatible with him, as if it was tailor-made for him.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that evolution secret techniques, although far less important than evolution paths in terms of their crucial influence on evolvers,</p><p></p><p>choosing a suitable secret technique to comprehend often yields twice the result with half the effort.</p><p></p><p>Each evolver's situation is different, their experiences are not the same, and their physiques are even more varied. Even for an eighth-level invincible like the Chihu Star Lord,</p><p></p><p>it takes time to observe and select a suitable evolution secret technique for disciples.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the finally selected secret technique is not completely compatible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is difficult to find an evolutionary secret technique that perfectly suits oneself.</p><p></p><p>To find one that is completely compatible with oneself requires even more luck.</p><p></p><p>But now, Mo Li felt that the evolutionary secret technique bestowed upon him by the 13th Peak Master was perfectly compatible with him.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable to him.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, the outside world all thinks that the 13th Peak Master only has monstrous innate talent, but now it seems that the Peak Master's methods of teaching disciples are also..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li was excited in his heart, but didn't know how to describe it. Just by observing him for a while, the Peak Master was able to select a secret technique that was completely compatible with him. Such methods were already beyond common sense.</p><p></p><p>What Mo Li didn't know was that this secret technique was not selected by Lin Yuan at all, but was comprehended on the spot according to his physical body and soul state.</p><p></p><p>"This secret technique is a secret transmission of my 13th Mountain Peak, do not spread it." Seeing Mo Li in a daze, Lin Yuan reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Peak Master for your great kindness."</p><p></p><p>Mo Li immediately reacted and directly knelt on the ground to kowtow.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing for a teacher in guiding disciples is to lead them. Lin Yuan selecting a secret evolutionary technique that perfectly matched his own was simply a kindness of recreation.</p><p></p><p>How could Mo Li not know the depth of gratitude bestowed by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, his gaze turning to Wu Lan beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Master." Wu Lan immediately called out nervously.</p><p></p><p>Mo Li's performance made her feel uneasy. As the most ordinary silver pattern examinee, facing a crimson pattern like Mo Li already put a lot of pressure on her.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the other party's excited expression, as if having "achieved the Great Dao", Wu Lan was even more at a loss for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"You cultivate the martial dao evolutionary path?" Lin Yuan looked at Wu Lan and asked.</p><p></p><p>By watching the video of Wu Lan's test in the Seven Star Cave World, Lin Yuan knew the path she was taking.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the rule direction Wu Lan ultimately chose was not Taiyin Taiyang, but the water rule among the basic five elements.</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao evolutionary path was quite popular in the Chi Kun Star Domain, but of course there weren't many powerhouses, after all it had only emerged not long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Water nourishes all things silently. Your future path should be based on the water rule, comprehending the other metal, wood, fire, earth and other four forms..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment. As the founder of martial arts, there was probably no other evolutionary in the world who understood martial arts better than him. With one glance, he formulated Wu Lan's subsequent cultivation plan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>With a point of his right hand, Lin Yuan transmitted a secret evolutionary technique to guide Wu Lan's cultivation into her mind.</p><p></p><p>If Wu Lan could comprehend the five element rules of metal, wood, water, fire and earth to a certain depth at the 6th stage, and enter the spatial rule to understand the basic spatial model,</p><p></p><p>She would have the hope of opening up a small five-element world at the peak of the 6th stage, but Lin Yuan felt that with the innate talent Wu Lan displayed at the moment, it would be difficult to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>If not at the 6th stage, then at the 7th stage. With the five element rules plus the spatial rule, the method of "opening a realm" was basically determined. Wu Lan's future path would basically not encounter any problems.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan's eyes widened. The secret evolutionary technique Lin Yuan transmitted into her mind was brilliant, like the principle of evolution itself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wu Lan finally knew why Mo Li, as a crimson pattern examinee, would reveal such an expression.</p><p></p><p>It was from seeing one's future path, that kind of excitement of hearing the Dao in the morning and being able to die content in the evening.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Peak Master for your guidance."</p><p></p><p>Wu Lan also knelt on the ground to kowtow without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"You two cultivate well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand, letting the two withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Only after Mo Li and Wu Lan left did Lin Yuan retract his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you two won't disappoint me." Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the main hall of the 13th Mountain Peak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his mind observing the "Devil Jade Imprint" branded in his soul.</p><p></p><p>"This mysterious space connected by the Devil Jade Imprint..."</p><p></p><p>This mysterious space was completely closed off. Even if one could sense the existence of this space, they could not enter. Even the strongest experts were no exception. Only the Devil Jade Imprint could serve as the key to explore it.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the current approach of the many evolutionary experts of human civilization comprehending the evolutionary paths contained in that torso is not wrong."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>To condense the Devil Jade Imprint required two methods.</p><p></p><p>One was like Lin Yuan, comprehending 3333 evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>The second was to choose an evolutionary path to cultivate, constantly perfecting and supplementing it along the way. Walking it to the end could also condense the Devil Jade Imprint.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary experts of the current human civilization basically all took the second approach.</p><p></p><p>It's just that so far, no evolutionary expert had succeeded. The vast majority of evolutionary experts had even completely failed.</p><p></p><p>As for the first method... Lin Yuan possessed a heaven-defying comprehension ability to achieve it. It was difficult for the evolutionary experts of the Human Alliance to replicate.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to tell the Goddess of Wisdom, at least giving them one more path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it and made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules set by the three Goddesses, as long as one could help the Human Civilization Alliance, they would receive merit points as a reward.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Alliance would not mistreat any evolutionary expert who made contributions.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly connected to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, the Goddess of Wisdom is pleased to serve you."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came.</p><p></p><p>"I have intelligence regarding the torso from the large-scale alien battlefield." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out,</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom was obviously silent for an instant.</p><p></p><p>Clearly not expecting Lin Yuan to bring this up, and most crucially, intelligence involving the torso of the strongest expert from outside the world?</p><p></p><p>"Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, please speak."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom responded.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense the seriousness in the Goddess of Wisdom's tone. He even had a feeling that the Goddess of Wisdom's main consciousness had descended at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the specifics either."</p><p></p><p>"I only know that to comprehend the secrets within that torso, there are two methods. One is to cultivate and comprehend the evolutionary path, and walk it to the end."</p><p></p><p>"The second is to not cultivate any single evolutionary path, but to comprehend 3333 evolutionary paths from that torso."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan concealed the part about the Devil Jade Imprint and Devil Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Before determining what forces the Devil Jade Tower belonged to, Lin Yuan felt it was better not to reveal information in this regard.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Lin Yuan had already stated the methods, doing justice to his human identity.</p><p></p><p>"Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>After the Goddess of Wisdom finished speaking, she fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood that the Goddess of Wisdom was verifying the authenticity of the intelligence he provided.</p><p></p><p>The three Goddesses were not fools. They definitely wouldn't just believe whatever Lin Yuan said without verifying it first.</p>

(Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>After repeated negotiations,</p><p></p><p>the ten peak clan groups finally decided to gather a hundred Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts, using one-tenth of their life essence as a balancing fulcrum to exchange for the corresponding life essence of the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>As for the 'Balancing Scale' treasure of the Cosmos Clan, there was naturally no need to pay the life essence of their own Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Cosmos Clan, the Calamity Clan also did not bear much of the burden of the Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan had a small population, and any of their Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts was far more important than those of other clans.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity Clan did not contribute much of the life essence of their Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts, but their strongest Eleven-Realms expert promised that when the time came to encircle and attack the Galactic Overlord, they would use more hidden trump cards to make up for the losses of the other peak clan groups.</p><p></p><p>Although the Skyfeather Clan and the Insect Clan had some objections to this, they had no other choice, as the Calamity Clan was too powerful, and the facts were laid out.</p><p></p><p>It was also not very realistic to have the Calamity Clan share the Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Ten years went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In a certain region of the starry sky,</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo was suspending a golden scale.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a hundred Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts from the various peak clan groups gathered on the left side of the golden scale, their expressions slightly weakened, their figures faintly emanating a void aura.</p><p></p><p>The void aura had a certain weight, causing the golden scale to tilt to the left.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately enter the super-large battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo retracted the golden scale.</p><p></p><p>The void aura condensed from the life essence sacrificed by the hundred Eleven-Realms Perfected Experts could not be sustained on the left side of the Balancing Scale for too long.</p><p></p><p>He must enter the super-large battlefield as soon as possible, lock onto the Galactic Overlord's aura, and forcibly exchange.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Driven by the strongest members of the Cosmos Clan, he arrived near the super-large battlefield and descended to the edge of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"This distance should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo did not pass through the spatial-temporal path to enter the core battlefield area, as that would be too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Balancing Scale, even at the edge of the battlefield, he could still lock onto the Galactic Overlord's aura.</p><p></p><p>"They should all be ready."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo looked towards the core battlefield area.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ten years, the various peak clan groups had secretly and continuously sent their strongest experts to re-enter the super-large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they could only linger at the edge, daring not to venture too deep, to avoid being detected and hunted down by the Galactic Overlord again.</p><p></p><p>Through this continuous effort, the strongest Eleven-Realms experts of the peak clan groups had gained tremendous support, waiting for Fan Gaomo to greatly weaken the Galactic Overlord's life essence.</p><p></p><p>Then they would join forces to counterattack the Human Civilization Alliance, to pay back the humiliation they had suffered over the past ten years.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo immediately activated the Balancing Scale, and his perception began to expand infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Aided by the life essence gathered on the left side of the scale, Fan Gaomo could easily sense the life essence of all living beings within thousands of light-years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could only sense the life essence, not the specific strength or quantity of each.</p><p></p><p>The Balancing Scale did not have that capability; it only cared about exchanging the corresponding items.</p><p></p><p>Whether the item existed and how much of it there was, it did not really care.</p><p></p><p>In a hazy moment, Fan Gaomo vaguely sensed a familiar yet terrifying life essence aura in the center of the core battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Galactic Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo immediately confirmed it. Although he had only met the Galactic Overlord once before, the impact of that encounter was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of Eleven-Realms experts were reduced to ashes, and hundreds of supreme weapons were lost, leaving a deep psychological shadow in Fan Gaomo's mind.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Balancing Scale, Fan Gaomo might not even have the courage to confront the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>So, Fan Gaomo could never forget the Galactic Overlord's life essence aura.</p><p></p><p>"Lock on."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's heart raced as he immediately used the Balancing Scale to lock onto the Galactic Overlord's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Establish connection."</p><p></p><p>"In no more than two hours, the exchange can be carried out."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo thought to himself, the Balancing Scale's ability was indeed extraordinary, but it also required time to take effect.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly carry out the exchange, he needed time to establish a connection between the two sides of the scale.</p><p></p><p>However, the time here was not long, only about two hours, and Fan Gaomo was willing to wait.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Victory Altar,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>After ten years of arduous cultivation, Lin Yuan had successively gained insights into twelve Pillar-level Fusion Rules, reaching the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that reaching the Seventh Realm of Pillar-level Fusion Rules was a realm that only Twelfth-Realm Ultimates could attain.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in just ten short years, Lin Yuan had entered this level, and it was ten Pillar-level Fusion Rules.</p><p></p><p>This was vastly more efficient than when he had struggled for hundreds of years to painstakingly raise his Spatial-Temporal Fusion Rule to the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the Seventh Realm of Pillar-level Fusion Rules was much easier to achieve than the Sixth Realm of Spatial-Temporal Fusion Rule.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Lin Yuan had already entered this domain, and with the Spatial-Temporal Fusion Rule leading the way, the other Pillar-level Fusion Rules became much easier to cultivate as well.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial-Temporal..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep, with the faint rippling of the Spatial-Temporal 'River of Heaven'.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ten years, a considerable portion of Lin Yuan's energy had been devoted to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding the rules of space-time fusion,</p><p></p><p>Although I have constantly felt progress in my understanding of space-time fusion, I have not yet reached the peak of the sixth realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years is still too short," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If it were a hundred years or a thousand years, perhaps he could reach the peak of the sixth realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue his contemplation of the rules of space-time fusion,</p><p></p><p>A mysterious sense of being watched and targeted, invisible and intangible, began to establish a connection with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled, immediately realizing that this was most likely a precursor to the counterattack of the eleven peak clan forces.</p><p></p><p>"I have no idea where this sense of being watched and targeted is coming from."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was grave. He could feel the sense of being watched and targeted, relying on his powerful spiritual will, but could not confirm the specific direction it was coming from.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>"The eleven peak clan forces are not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face was solemn as he tried to study the sense of being watched that was swirling around him, but found no clues.</p><p></p><p>"However, I have already sent all my strongest weapons and treasures to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Even if my Yang Primal Spirit is destroyed, the loss will not be great."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan had made preparations for an extreme situation, already having the powerful Xia Qin bring his Yin Primal Spirit to the vicinity of the super-large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>If the Yang Primal Spirit were to perish, while the true body was reforming the Yang Primal Spirit, the Yin Primal Spirit would directly descend to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating two great primal spirits is much easier than cultivating a clone. The Yang and Yin can take turns, I'm confident I can maintain the altar."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, already prepared for the possibility of his two great primal spirits perishing multiple times.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>In the edge area, Fan Gaomo had been sitting there, waiting for the Balance Celestial Scale to establish a stable connection with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment,</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo's eyes flashed, and he controlled the Balance Celestial Scale, having already sensed a stable connection with the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Following this stable connection, the Balance Celestial Scale could perform a forced exchange.</p><p></p><p>"Exchange."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo was impatient, activating the Balance Celestial Scale, exchanging the void aura-formed life essence on the left side of the scale for the life essence of the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum~</p><p></p><p>In front of Fan Gaomo, the golden scale, originally with the left side heavier due to the void aura, causing an imbalance, began to descend.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, as the exchange began, strands of void aura began to appear on the right side, constantly increasing, causing the right side to become heavier and also begin to descend, until the two ends of the scale finally reached a balance, with equal weight.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>"The life essence of the Galactic Overlord has been exchanged away."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Fan Gaomo's face, the void aura condensed on the right side of the scale was the life essence of the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>As for the amount of the life essence, it was equivalent to the left side. Excluding the "consumption" in the middle, it was probably around four to five times that of a normal Eleventh Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>"The counterattack has begun."</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo straightened his back, vaguely guessing that at this moment, the Galactic Overlord must be terrified, discovering that his life essence had plummeted drastically.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Fan Gaomo immediately began to contact the strongest Eleventh Realm cultivators of the other ten peak clans.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten years, these strongest Eleventh Realm cultivators had been waiting for this opportunity, waiting for the Galactic Overlord to fall into unprecedented weakness, and then seizing the chance to reclaim everything they had lost ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the altar,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still trying to investigate the source of the sense of being watched and targeted, although his spiritual will had completely crossed into the Twelfth Realm, and was quite strong even in the Twelfth Realm, his realm had not caught up.</p><p></p><p>So he could only sense the sense of being watched and targeted, but had no way to detect the specific source.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for a normal Eleventh Realm Perfection cultivator, they would not even be able to sense this kind of sense of being watched and targeted.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of method is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was on high alert, knowing that the counterattack from the eleven peak clans had begun.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, it seemed that he was at a disadvantage, not even knowing what kind of method the other side was using.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was waiting,</p><p></p><p>He suddenly discovered that his life essence was slowly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>"The life essence is decreasing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became grave. The life essence is the most fundamental aspect of life, and a decrease in life essence is fatal to any life.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan could feel that the decrease in his life essence was extremely slow, and almost negligible compared to his vast life essence, the fact that it was decreasing at all was concerning.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the methods of the eleven peak clans, this might just be the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>After just over ten breaths,</p><p></p><p>The decrease in Lin Yuan's life essence abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"That's it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat surprised. He had expected the decrease in life essence to accelerate, but it stopped so quickly?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself, comparing to just over ten breaths ago.</p><p></p><p>His life essence had probably only decreased by one-ten-millionth.</p>

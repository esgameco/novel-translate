            <p>Chapter 243 Comprehending the Rules of the Sun (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The news of the Galaxy Star Lord's large-scale hunting of special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races continued to ferment.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was speculated that the targets hunted by the Galaxy Star Lord were all those who caused serious damage to the environment within the star domain or liked to feed on the souls and bodies of living beings, it still caused panic among the remaining special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is too domineering."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord was also like this, showing no mercy to us special lifeforms."</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is establishing his prestige. Without these ruthless methods, how can he thoroughly control this star domain in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Flower God Tribe, various special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races discussed.</p><p></p><p>Although these special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races did not have the "virtual world" of human civilization to achieve real-time communication without delay, they had their own means of communication. As long as they were within a star domain, basic communication could be achieved.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do then?"</p><p></p><p>"What else can we do? We can only submit. Don't tell me you want to go against human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, everyone. The Galaxy Star Lord's method of cleansing is to thoroughly control this star domain. We, the different races, can only choose to submit, but Lord Northwind will not submit so easily."</p><p></p><p>A powerful special lifeform spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Northwind."</p><p></p><p>The rest of the many special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races all quieted down.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Domain, as the territory once ruled by the Shadow Race, had many special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races residing there.</p><p></p><p>Among these special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races, there was no lack of Eighth Stage powerhouses, and Lord Northwind was undoubtedly the strongest one.</p><p></p><p>He was an undisputed peak Eighth Stage powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Lord Northwind came from the "Golden Lion" race, a powerful race in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Lord Northwind traveled the universe and came to this star domain to prepare for his breakthrough to the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>An Eighth Stage powerhouse did not necessarily have to master a certain cosmic power and become invincible at the Eighth Stage in order to break through to the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>As long as one reached the peak of the Eighth Stage, there was hope of fusing with the rules and then challenging the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Lord Northwind was at the peak of the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>However, at Lord Northwind's level, external forces could hardly help him take that step.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lord Northwind spent most of his time in seclusion, indifferent to what was happening in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>He belonged to the second category of special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races classified by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Northwind is very powerful. That Galaxy Star Lord shouldn't dare to force his way, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, this is a matter between the Galaxy Star Lord and Lord Northwind. We can only go with the flow."</p><p></p><p>Many special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races discussed a lot, but in the end, they still dispersed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the Galaxy Star Lord and Lord Northwind "negotiated" in the end, it had nothing to do with them. This star domain was destined to be ruled by the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that even hiding here, I still can't cultivate in peace and quiet." A burly old man with golden hair sat cross-legged in the void. His aura merged with the starry sky, vast and boundless, extending to a radius of millions and hundreds of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"A human peerless genius, entering the Eighth Stage before a hundred years old, and now even possessing the combat strength of the peak Eighth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>This golden-haired burly old man was none other than Lord Northwind, at the peak of the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"I can't afford to provoke him. It's better to find another place."</p><p></p><p>The golden-haired burly old man sighed, stood up and took a step. Space rippled and his figure appeared millions of miles away.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lion race, although not part of the Human Civilization Alliance, did not have much enmity with human civilization either. Northwind had no need to have any dealings with that Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The strongest one in this star domain, Lord Northwind, took the initiative to leave, which truly shocked the special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought that with Lord Northwind's strength, even if he didn't dare to make a move against the Galaxy Star Lord, he would at least negotiate and gain some benefits before leaving.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he left this star domain without even thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"Northwind of the Golden Lion race?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also learned the news of a peak Eighth Stage powerhouse of a different race taking the initiative to leave at the first opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Quite cautious."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly. Although that Northwind was powerful, he was basically in seclusion most of the time and had little influence on the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan originally had no intention of making a move against him, but the other party's cooperation made him feel quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Now the entire Galaxy Star Domain has basically been cleared. I don't need to manage the rest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the lord of the Galaxy Star Domain, Lin Yuan's greatest role was to deter, sit in the main star, and shock the eight directions.</p><p></p><p>As for managing the development of the main star and the star domain, it was naturally not the job of the Star Lord, but handed over to his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord spent most of his time either in seclusion or sleeping, and wasn't the Scarlet Roc Star Domain doing well? With the three goddesses overseeing it, there would basically be no major problems.</p><p></p><p>The two Eighth Stage aliens given to Lin Yuan by the Scarlet Roc Star Lord were used to manage the main star and the star domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes. Whether on the Scarlet Roc Main Star or now on the Galaxy Main Star, there was no significant difference. Most of his time was spent on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Another palace.</p><p></p><p>Red Skin, Cyan Eyes, as well as Chun Bo and Jia Li, the four of them gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"Those aliens are really too obedient. When we ask them to come over, they obediently come without any conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Li looked at the replies from those aliens, and his tone was inevitably surprised.</p><p></p><p>In order for the Galaxy Star Domain to develop, it was necessary to establish stable trade channels, especially on the main star, where various "merchants" had to be stationed.</p><p></p><p>The first choice for these "merchants" was naturally the native aliens within the star domain. These aliens basically had their own skills and means, such as the "Flower God Wine" of the Flower God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>It was quite famous in the dozens of nearby star domains.</p><p></p><p>Originally, in order to invite these aliens to station, they had to make some promises first, such as "rent-free"?</p><p></p><p>But before they could propose these, those aliens took the initiative to cooperate, not daring to put forward any conditions.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, after the Star Lord's cleansing, how dare those aliens not listen?" Red Skin and Cyan Eyes didn't find it surprising.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord did even more domineering things than Lin Yuan now. Those native aliens naturally had to obediently listen in order to survive.</p><p></p><p>However, Red Skin and Cyan Eyes, the two Eighth Stage aliens, looked at each other, and shock still flashed in the depths of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>What shocked them was not those extremely obedient aliens, but Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>In order to assist Lin Yuan in controlling the Galaxy Star Domain as much as possible, they had already made dozens of plans before coming.</p><p></p><p>What about lobbying one by one, what...</p><p></p><p>The following is the English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Despite their use of heavy profits and other means to quickly gain control of the Milky Way Star Domain, none of the plans they had formulated were of any use now. Lin Yuan's absolute strength had killed those alien races, leaving them terrified.</p><p></p><p>Although the two eighth-level alien races had long known that Lin Yuan possessed a 700,000-square-mile inner world and a combat strength that had almost reached the peak of the eighth level, having a combat strength at the peak of the eighth level did not mean that one could wantonly slaughter those eighth-level alien races.</p><p></p><p>The eighth-level alien races were not fools. Knowing that they couldn't win, would they still obediently stay there to be killed?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan easily left those eighth-level alien races behind, relying not only on his combat strength but also on his well-rounded strength with almost no shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and in the blink of an eye, two months had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, on the main star of the Milky Way, everyone felt a scorching wave of heat, like a blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Chun Bo and Jia Li's expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>They both looked towards the source of the fluctuation, which was the palace where the Milky Way Star Lord cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In the void, light and heat began to fill the space, as if the sun had fallen to the ground, and the palace seemed to have turned into a miniature star.</p><p></p><p>"It's the fluctuation of rules, the manifestation of fire-type rules!" The red-skinned and green-eyed beings were excited, as they knew exactly what this scene meant.</p><p></p><p>"The manifestation of fire-type rules, could it be that the Star Lord has comprehended some kind of fire rule?" Chun Bo and Jia Li's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending a certain rule, even an ordinary one, was a realm that only peak eighth-level experts could touch upon.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had entered the eighth level not long ago and his combat strength was not inferior to peak eighth-level experts, combat strength and realm were two different matters.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan possessed the combat strength of a peak eighth-level expert, perhaps due to the abnormal cultivation path he practiced, or perhaps he had mastered some kind of killing technique or had other opportunities.</p><p></p><p>But comprehending a certain rule could only be done by oneself. The Milky Way Star Lord's comprehension of a certain fire rule meant that he had completely mastered this aspect of power.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord..." The red-skinned and green-eyed beings remained silent. They had stayed in Lin Yuan's inner world for a long time and were clear that the Milky Way Star Lord had reached an extremely deep level in his comprehension of spatial rules. But now, Lin Yuan had quietly comprehended a certain fire rule?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this universe truly had life, and one could use it for a day or even a thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Deep within the palace, Lin Yuan opened his eyes, revealing a satisfied expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Rule..." Lin Yuan slightly raised his head as endless light and heat from all directions converged towards him, forming a "sun" mark the size of a thumb, which finally merged into Lin Yuan's glabella and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that I would comprehend the Sun Rule unknowingly," Lin Yuan thought to himself with a delighted mind.</p><p></p><p>He had never deliberately tried to comprehend the Sun Rule.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts evolution path that Lin Yuan followed used the Yin-Yang Taiji as its framework. In perfecting the martial arts evolution path, it had driven the advancement of the Sun and Moon Rules.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the Sun Rule early is also related to the Red Kun Lineage's collection of many fire-type evolution paths," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As one of the thirteen peak masters of the Red Kun Lineage, Lin Yuan had naturally comprehended the evolution paths collected by his own lineage long ago.</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Lineage was most adept at the two rules of fire and space, after all, the Star Lord Red Kun followed these two paths.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, among the many collected evolution paths, fire and space were the main focus.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Sun Rule was superior to that of the Moon Rule, and he had now taken the lead in comprehending the Sun Rule.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Rule was an upgraded rule of the fire-type rules, symbolizing endless light and heat.</p><p></p><p>The eighth-level invincible Wan Yang Star Lord of the Human Civilization Alliance had used the Sun Rule as his foundation to walk the path of eighth-level invincibility.</p><p></p><p>His signature killing move, "Wan Yang Tong Tian," was still remembered by Lin Yuan to this day, and he had used it as a basis for creating a series of Sun Rule-type killing moves.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the Sun Rule has brought me much closer to perfecting my combat strength and martial arts evolution path," Lin Yuan thought with a satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, my path integrates the Sun Rule and the Moon Rule. Now that I have comprehended the Sun Rule, I am not far from comprehending the Moon Rule..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Taiji Dao was originally about the complementarity of yin and yang. When the sun was strong, it would make up for the moon, and when the moon was strong, it would make up for the sun.</p><p></p><p>The compensation here was not just in terms of strength, but also in terms of the comprehension of rules.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, even if I comprehend both the Sun Rule and the Moon Rule, I am still far from comprehending the complete Spatial Rule..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned to comprehend the Spatial Rule. At present, he had comprehended just over two thousand core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>According to the human civilization's interpretation of the Spatial Rule, comprehending 7,782 core spatial models would allow one to comprehend the Spatial Rule.</p><p></p><p>But comprehending 7,782 core spatial models was extremely difficult, as it almost represented the essence of the universe as a pillar rule.</p><p></p><p>Even the powerful Red Kun Star Lord had not yet comprehended the complete core spatial models and mastered the Spatial Rule.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the Red Kun Star Lord was a star-sea-roaming kun, a "favorite child" of the universe's spatial origin. If even he had not comprehended it, one could imagine the difficulty involved.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"I am still very young and have plenty of time to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Even if the Spatial Rule was as vast as the universe, as long as he was given time, he would definitely comprehend it one day.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his current low realm, Lin Yuan would even want to try comprehending the Time Rule.</p><p></p><p>"But if I comprehend the Moon Rule and then integrate it with the Sun Rule, what will it form?" Lin Yuan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Pillar rules, such as space, time, and life, when integrated with a certain ordinary rule, were one of the prerequisites for advancing from the eighth level to the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>But both the Moon Rule and the Sun Rule were not pillar rules. If they were integrated, would they form the Taiji... the Taiji Rule?</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had never heard of the Taiji Rule.</p><p></p><p>Taiji was just Lin Yuan's definition of the integration of the moon and the sun.</p><p></p><p>The sun and the moon had to be integrated in a fixed proportion, and this proportion could not be increased or decreased by even a little, in order to finally form the Taiji.</p><p></p><p>Before comprehending the complete Moon and Sun Rules, the integration of the two was not thorough, and the contact between the rules was not comprehensive, so it seemed that there was no change.</p><p></p><p>"There's no point in thinking about these things now. It's better to wait until I comprehend the Moon Rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>With the compensation of the complete Sun Rule, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Moon Rule had accelerated a lot.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was immersed in cultivation and the Milky Way Star Domain was rapidly developing, outside the main star of the Milky Way, in the cosmic starry sky, two figures appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"The main star of the Milky Way Star Domain."</p><p></p><p>The two figures appeared side by side, a man and a woman, looking at the huge planet below from afar.</p>

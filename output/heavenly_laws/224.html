            <p>Chapter 224: The Silent Chikun Star Lord (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat surprised to find that his Mental Willpower Index had reached over 9,200. </p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that two or three years ago, when Lin Yuan first measured his Mental Willpower Index, it was only 7,848.</p><p></p><p>This 7,848 Mental Willpower Index was the strength of mental willpower that Lin Yuan had accumulated over the course of six crossings and more than a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now, in just two or three years, it had increased by more than 1,000 Mental Willpower Index points, which was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, the higher the Mental Willpower Index, the harder it is to increase. Originally, Lin Yuan's worst plan was to experience a few more crossings.</p><p></p><p>He would use the long time of crossing worlds to forcibly increase his Mental Willpower Index.</p><p></p><p>However, doing so would basically waste the opportunity to cross, after all, below the 8th stage, comprehending the rules would only become more and more difficult.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was already an unimaginable thing for Lin Yuan to be able to comprehend more than 1,300 kinds of core spatial rule models at his current 7th stage level.</p><p></p><p>Normally, only when they reach the 8th stage will evolvers begin to comprehend the core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the core spatial models that Lin Yuan had comprehended already exceeded what many peak 8th stage evolvers could reach.</p><p></p><p>"At the current rate, in at most a year or two, my Mental Willpower Index can reach 10,000. At that time, I can randomly select a crossing world and try to overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation." Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Once the Heart Demon Tribulation was overcome, there would be no obstacles for Lin Yuan to enter the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>For an evolver to enter the 8th stage, three prerequisites need to be met.</p><p></p><p>First, the Mental Willpower Index must be high enough, preferably reaching 10,000 points.</p><p></p><p>Second, they must open up an inner world. Only when the inner world is formed can they have the foundation to enter the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>The third is to refine the physical body and soul to the ultimate perfection of the 7th stage.</p><p></p><p>The third prerequisite is similar to the first one, requiring the evolver to spend a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>After all, even a peak 7th stage king is not considered perfect at the 7th stage, and there are still subtle aspects that need to be slowly refined.</p><p></p><p>This is very time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>However, for Lin Yuan, the third prerequisite was as good as non-existent.</p><p></p><p>Once the inner world was formed, the power of the world would permeate the entire body, nourishing the physical body, soul, and even mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>As early as a year ago, Lin Yuan's physical body and soul had already reached the absolute perfection of the 7th stage, without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the continuous nourishment of the world's power, Lin Yuan's physical body and soul were still slowly improving, slowly advancing while suppressing the shackles of the great realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the world, the exclusive power of 8th stage evolvers. Especially Lin Yuan's inner world, which had reached a size of over 100,000 square miles and had been perfected by three universal treasures.</p><p></p><p>The world power derived from it benefited Lin Yuan endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that even if he didn't go to overcome the Heart Demon Tribulation, just relying on the nourishment of the world's power, he would one day be able to reach the peak of the 8th stage and the ultimate 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>"Many people have been replaced." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over the tops of the other peaks. In these two or three years, many evolvers had their bodies collapse and withdrew from this opportunity to comprehend due to cultivating the evolutionary paths realized from that corpse fragment.</p><p></p><p>In turn, many new genius evolvers joined in.</p><p></p><p>"Many of the evolutionary paths contained in that corpse fragment are dead ends. The supreme ones have long established a rule that once cultivation fails, one will not be able to continue comprehending for a hundred years." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also for the good of the many evolvers. Even if they were only cultivating in a virtual world, the evolutionary paths in that corpse fragment were not completely unable to have an impact.</p><p></p><p>This was a partial body of a supreme being after all.</p><p></p><p>If one tried too many times and it affected the real body, it would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"Our human civilization is already considered extremely good. For other races without the isolation of a virtual world, those powerful aliens have to risk their lives to comprehend." </p><p></p><p>"I don't know how many will die."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>At present, the virtual world was unique to human civilization. It was said to come from the means of a certain supreme being, a product of the special supreme evolutionary path where this person was located.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue cultivating and tempering himself.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wufeng is looking for me?" Lin Yuan received a message.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng was the most valued disciple of the Nine Swords Star Lord. When he first entered this virtual world, he took the initiative to talk with Lin Yuan, and the two had a good relationship.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Gao Wufeng, there was also Zuo Qiu Guang, who had the bloodline of light elves.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wufeng..." Lin Yuan felt a little sentimental in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the past two or three years, countless evolvers had dejectedly withdrawn from the opportunity to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, there were also a small number of evolvers who performed exceptionally well and continued to walk on the path of the evolutionary ways they had realized. </p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary path that Gao Wufeng realized from that corpse fragment was extremely special. It could actually summon the descent of heart demons.</p><p></p><p>The descent of heart demons was no small matter. It was currently one of the few true dead ends that could directly affect the real body in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Under the threat of the Heart Demon Tribulation, without sufficient preparation, facing the heart demon and dying in the Heart Demon Tribulation, even the intervention of a supreme being to "resurrect" couldn't save them.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the threat of the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The most correct choice for Gao Wufeng should have been to decisively give up this opportunity to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After all, this concerned his own life.</p><p></p><p>The supreme evolutionary path was certainly good, but if one lost their life, what was the point of having more supreme evolutionary paths?</p><p></p><p>But Gao Wufeng did not choose to give up.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he continued to cultivate, welcoming the descent of the heart demon with an almost manic attitude.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Gao Wufeng successfully passed the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his cultivation on that evolutionary path he realized became smooth sailing, and his progress was already at the forefront of all current evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Without reaching a Mental Willpower Index of 10,000, he took the initiative to face the Heart Demon Tribulation. His courage is commendable. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that he resonates with the evolutionary path he cultivates, and everything goes smoothly afterwards?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inwardly sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>This was something he couldn't do. Gao Wufeng completely used his own life as a wager. Now he had passed and was in the limelight, but what if he hadn't passed?</p><p></p><p>Who would still remember "Gao Wufeng"?</p><p></p><p>Personal space.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng and Zuo Qiu Guang sat there.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few other evolvers.</p><p></p><p>They were basically all geniuses who were still walking on the path of the evolutionary ways they had realized so far.</p><p></p><p>"The 13th Peak Master is here."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan, Gao Wufeng immediately greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master." </p><p></p><p>The other evolvers did the same.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's reputation as a genius was truly a bit frightening, and no evolver dared to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat down, and the few of them continued to chat.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao, you should not be far from the 8th stage now, right?" Zuo Qiu Guang looked at Gao Wufeng with emotion, "Forcibly passing the Heart Demon Tribulation, I admire Brother Gao's boldness."</p><p></p><p>"This time I faced the Heart Demon Tribulation, next time I don't know what I will face."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng said humbly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gao Wufeng was still very pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>Because he bet correctly, his cultivation path is now extremely smooth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gao Wufeng even had a wild ambition. He believed that the evolution path he was cultivating was the supreme evolution path left behind by that almighty being.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could his cultivation be going so smoothly now?</p><p></p><p>"I must have passed the test. Only by overcoming the heart demon tribulation and possessing an indomitable attitude can one pass the test."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's heart surged with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Right." Gao Wufeng's gaze shifted and looked towards Lin Yuan, "13th Peak Master, how is your cultivation going now? Have you not chosen which evolution path to cultivate yet?"</p><p></p><p>It was no secret that Lin Yuan had not enlightened and figured out an evolution path to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm timid and afraid of problems arising." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Timid?" Gao Wufeng frowned slightly. As a human evolver, one should be indomitable and break through all obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he faced the threat of the heart demon tribulation, he directly confronted it.</p><p></p><p>Now, hasn't he passed through it and gained great benefits?</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master, I have to say, sometimes, being timid is not a virtue at all. With the barrier of the virtual world, even if problems truly arise, there is a chance to start over. Why be so hesitant? Sometimes if you don't seize the opportunity, it will be difficult to grasp it later."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng couldn't help but advise Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm also tempering my mind and will." Lin Yuan said again.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering your mind and will?"</p><p></p><p>The other few evolvers looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They all felt Lin Yuan was a bit foolish. Tempering one's mind and will can be slowly improved through many methods.</p><p></p><p>Using the precious opportunity to comprehend a portion of the almighty's body to temper the mind and will? This was a bit like selling the tree to buy the shade.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about this anymore."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng didn't plan to continue advising Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, a genius with innate talent above his own, gave up cultivating an evolution path and the chance to become an almighty being due to timidity. He should be happy about that.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I invited you all over this time is that I want to discuss some doubts encountered during cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng said truthfully. It was very normal for multiple evolvers to exchange insights with each other, after all, they were all cultivating evolution paths comprehended from that severed body.</p><p></p><p>The few of them chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan just listened on the side.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the 13th Peak Master has any insights?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng still valued Lin Yuan greatly. Even if Lin Yuan had never cultivated, as a top genius and prodigy, what he knew and thought must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gao, I feel that the evolution path you are cultivating now will likely impact your mind and will later on." Lin Yuan was silent for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Impact my mind and will?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng pondered for a moment and said, "Thank you 13th Peak Master for the reminder, I understand."</p><p></p><p>So what if it impacts the mind and will? As long as one can become an almighty being, it's worth paying any price.</p><p></p><p>Red Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Gao Wufeng is probably in trouble." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Based on Gao Wufeng's description, the evolution path he was cultivating was also one Lin Yuan had comprehended before. After analyzing it, he discovered it was a complete trap later on.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan wanted to warn him.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Gao Wufeng's dismissive expression, he didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>The current Gao Wufeng was immersed in his dream of becoming an almighty being. No matter who spoke, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Is becoming an almighty being that easy?</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head and looked in a direction. </p><p></p><p>There were spatial power fluctuations there.</p><p></p><p>"Opening an inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the palace, speculating in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Two to three years ago, the eldest senior brother returned from the alien battlefield, having faced the killing intent of an 8th stage alien and experienced life and death.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the eldest senior brother had deep insights. After returning, he began secluded cultivation and didn't even participate in comprehending the almighty's partial body this time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flew to the front of the first peak.</p><p></p><p>The other eleven senior brothers also rushed over.</p><p></p><p>They all waited outside for the eldest senior brother to complete his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The spatial power fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, they were extremely stable.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a while and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had not broken through to the 8th stage, with his experience in opening an inner world, he knew that the eldest senior brother's process of opening an inner world was going very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The most difficult point for a 7th stage evolver breaking through to the 8th stage was opening an inner world.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Lin Yuan, whose inner world had already reached over a hundred thousand miles in radius, was still stuck at the hurdle of mind and will. This was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>It was mainly because Lin Yuan was too young and his cultivation speed was too fast.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The spatial fluctuations stabilized.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother's figure also quickly flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations eldest senior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations eldest senior brother for breaking through to the 8th stage."</p><p></p><p>The various peak masters offered their congratulations one after another. The eldest senior brother also had a face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, come over."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice of their teacher, the Red Kun Star Lord, rang in Lin Yuan and the others' ears.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hurry over."</p><p></p><p>"It should be to praise the eldest senior brother's breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"So envious, when can I break through to the 8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the other peak masters flew towards the central main peak.</p><p></p><p>Red palace hall.</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord sat high above.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother and the other senior brothers stood on either side.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord looked at the eldest senior brother and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you teacher."</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the 8th stage made him happy too. This was the most critical stage for human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>An 8th stage evolver could preside over a star domain, become a star lord, and deter all directions.</p><p></p><p>They could be considered a powerful governor.</p><p></p><p>"How big is your inner world?" The Red Kun Star Lord thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>When an evolver opened their inner world, as long as it was within a thousand mile radius, they could actively suppress it and not trigger a world phantom.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, my inner world has a radius of two hundred and twenty miles."</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother said in an excited tone.</p><p></p><p>Generally, newly entered 8th stage evolvers only had inner worlds with a hundred mile radius.</p><p></p><p>The eldest senior brother being able to reach a radius of two hundred and twenty miles was clearly much stronger than ordinary newly entered 8th stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Just after reaching the 8th stage, the eldest senior brother already has an inner world with a radius of two hundred and twenty miles. His potential is limitless."</p><p></p><p>"Eldest senior brother, in the future you have to guide me and give me some pointers."</p><p></p><p>"An inner world this big, how powerful must the derived world power be?"</p><p></p><p>The various peak masters discussed spiritedly, their tones amazed and full of envy.</p><p></p><p>Especially the second and third senior brothers. They were also at the 7th stage.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not reached the peak of the king level, they could also envision the 8th stage realm.</p><p></p><p>They were clear on how rare it was for the eldest senior brother to open an inner world with a radius of two hundred and twenty miles.</p><p></p><p>"An inner world with a radius of two hundred and twenty miles?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord glanced at the energetic eldest peak master.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Lin Yuan who was sitting there quietly with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything.</p>

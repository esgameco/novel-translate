        <h1>Chapter 661</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Just push it aside? What does this mean? Push aside?</p><p></p><p>Push who? Even the supreme Immortal Saint Fuxi? Lin Yuan's strength is indeed shockingly powerful, reaching the level of the strongest Immortal Saints of the Six Ancient Kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But Immortal Saint Fuxi is also the mightiest Immortal Saint. Even if there is a gap between them, it is not that large. What can be used to push him aside? Aside from Immortal Saint Fuxi, the peak Immortal Saints of the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, the Daling Ancient Kingdom, the Leiting Ancient Kingdom, and others, wielding the heritage weapons of their Ancient Kingdoms, can also unleash combat power not much weaker than the mightiest Immortal Saint.</p><p></p><p>With so many obstacles, how can the Immortal Saint of the Milky Way push them aside?</p><p></p><p>Immortal Saint Chiyan could not comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>In his view, the mightiest Immortal Saints are already the strongest beneath the Progenitor. To push aside such powerful beings, perhaps only the lofty Progenitor above could do it.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan clearly has not entered the Progenitor realm.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Saint Chiyan looked at Lin Yuan, his expression filled with doubt and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>If these words did not come from Lin Yuan's mouth, he would not have pondered so much, because he would not have believed it at all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not explain further, but simply waved his hand, and a 'map' of a precious land appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>This newly born precious land was vast and expansive, with an extremely deep spatial and temporal breadth.</p><p></p><p>But after being explored by the numerous peak Immortal Saints of the Six Ancient Kingdoms for one or two thousand years, a precise 'map' had basically been drawn.</p><p></p><p>The map was dotted with countless light spots, totaling just over three hundred.</p><p></p><p>Among them, three light spots were slightly larger than the others.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary light spots were the core celestial pillars within the precious land.</p><p></p><p>The slightly larger light spots were the giant core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Saint Chiyan also saw the 'map' of the precious land that Lin Yuan had conjured.</p><p></p><p>Although the precise spatial-temporal coordinates of each core celestial pillar were marked.</p><p></p><p>But due to the special nature of the core celestial pillars - the Immortal Saints who had refined them could instantly descend beside them.</p><p></p><p>This made sneak attacks meaningless, as any disturbance would instantly summon the peak Immortal Saints occupying that core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>And the peak Immortal Saints of certain Ancient Kingdoms usually possessed heritage weapons of their Ancient Kingdoms, which could unleash combat power approaching that of the mightiest Immortal Saints when necessary.</p><p></p><p>The Mancun Immortal Saint of the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom had refined the second giant core celestial pillar, and although Immortal Saint Fuxi was furious, he could only retreat.</p><p></p><p>This was partly due to the threat posed by Lin Yuan, and partly because Immortal Saint Fuxi was not confident in breaking through Mancun Immortal Saint's defenses in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The heritage weapons of the various Ancient Kingdoms were terrifyingly powerful, originating from the Progenitor, and when the peak Immortal Saints exerted their full power, their strength would surge, causing even the mightiest Immortal Saints to be wary.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start from here."</p><p></p><p>After studying the 'map' of the precious land, Lin Yuan finally chose a core celestial pillar in a corner.</p><p></p><p>Starting from this point to push forward would allow him to radiate across the entire precious land in the shortest time.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Immortal Saint Chiyan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Immortal Saint Chiyan's expression was puzzled. He vaguely sensed what Lin Yuan wanted to do, and his heart was filled with disbelief, but he still nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The space-time was distorted.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought Immortal Saint Chiyan to the core celestial pillar in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"This speed of spatial-temporal traversal..."</p><p></p><p>Immortal Saint Chiyan was startled. From the giant core celestial pillar to here, although it was not as exaggerated as half the precious land, it was still at least one-tenth of the distance.</p><p></p><p>Even for the mightiest Immortal Saint Fuxi, to teleport such a distance would require at least one-tenth of a breath.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had only used an instant? And brought him along? "Immortal Saint of the Milky Way?"</p><p></p><p>In front of the core celestial pillar, a figure coalesced and descended, looking at Lin Yuan with great vigilance.</p><p></p><p>This core celestial pillar was occupied by the Leiting Ancient Kingdom, and the one who had descended was the peak Immortal Saint of the Leiting Ancient Kingdom, named Leisa Immortal Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Saint of the Milky Way, the Leiting Ancient Kingdom has already completed a transaction with Immortal Saint Fuxi. You're too late."</p><p></p><p>Leisa Immortal Saint stared at Lin Yuan and immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He thought Lin Yuan had come to negotiate for the core celestial pillar they had refined.</p><p></p><p>"No matter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Leisa Immortal Saint and casually took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Majestic spatial-temporal forces swept away.</p><p></p><p>The second giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>The twelve peak Immortal Saints of the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom has reached agreements with the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom and the Daling Ancient Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Mancun Immortal Saint, the peak Immortal Saint of the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom, immediately felt troubled.</p><p></p><p>These three Ancient Kingdoms standing together, plus the Leiting Ancient Kingdom which had always looked up to the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom, now the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom occupied more than two-thirds of all the core celestial pillars in the precious land.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Saint of the Milky Way, have you not reached an agreement with the Daling Ancient Kingdom and the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>Another peak Immortal Saint of the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom said.</p><p></p><p>As for the Leiting Ancient Kingdom, they could be considered to have tacitly sided with the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But the Daling Ancient Kingdom and the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, if the price was high enough, they could definitely be persuaded to join in, giving the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom a chance to compete with the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the demands of these two Ancient Kingdoms were too excessive?"</p><p></p><p>The third peak Immortal Saint spoke. Even without knowing the specifics of the negotiations between the Milky Way Immortal Saint and the two Ancient Kingdoms, he could guess that they must have made exorbitant requests.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that these two Ancient Kingdoms didn't even have the idea of negotiating with our Manhuang Ancient Kingdom," said the second peak Immortal Saint with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>No matter the Daling Ancient Kingdom or the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, they had been considering only the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom and the Liehuo Ancient Kingdom from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>As for the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>They didn't even consider it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the risk of dealing with the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom was too high. Even if the two Ancient Kingdoms handed over all the core celestial pillars they had refined to the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom, it was still uncertain whether the latter could seize this precious land. If in the end they were still taken by the Great Fuxi or the Liehuo faction, then the investment of the Daling Ancient Kingdom and the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom would have been in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, there's no need to say more about this."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mancun Immortal Saint spoke, sweeping his gaze across the peak Immortal Saints. "At this point, our Manhuang Ancient Kingdom can only stand on the side of the Liehuo Ancient Kingdom. Even if we can't seize the precious land ourselves, we'll do our best to help the Liehuo Ancient Kingdom take it."</p><p></p><p>The Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom, backed by the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, the Daling Ancient Kingdom, and the Leiting Ancient Kingdom, had formed a crushing advantage. At this time, the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom going over to the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom would be simply gilding the lily. The Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom wouldn't even have to pay much.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom only had one choice.</p><p></p><p>That was to stand with the Liehuo Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom currently occupied an absolute advantage, the true decisive battle had not yet arrived. The Liehuo Ancient Kingdom and the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom might still have a chance.</p><p></p><p>The remaining eleven peak Immortal Saints heard this and their expressions became solemn, nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Manhuang Ancient Kingdom now only had the path of standing with the Liehuo Ancient Kingdom to choose from.</p><p></p><p>In front of the third giant core celestial pillar, the manifestations of the numerous peak Immortal Saints of the Great Fuxi Ancient Kingdom, the Xuanyin Ancient Kingdom, the Daling Ancient Kingdom, and the Leiting Ancient Kingdom had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, my friends, although we now occupy the refined core celestial pillars, far surpassing the Liehuo..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Nation could not be careless. Venerable Fuxu smiled slightly, looking down at the Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones below.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the battle for a newly born sacred land would erupt in a great final battle in the last hundred years.</p><p></p><p>This so-called great final battle is when the strongest from each ancient nation would go all out, without any reservations.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even in this final battle, Venerable Fuxu had full confidence that he would be one step ahead, and then another step ahead.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Ancient Nation of Fuxu was more than just one step ahead now. Venerable Fuxu only needed to hold back the Venerable One of the Silver River, and the Ancient Nation of Raging Sun would not be able to stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me congratulate Brother Fuxu in advance," the Venerable One of the Yin of the Dark said, about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, among the Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones of the Thunder Ancient Nation, Venerable Leisa's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa immediately spoke, "That Venerable One of the Silver River has suddenly appeared near the core celestial pillar I was refining."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu's expression became slightly grave upon hearing this. "Go ask the Venerable One of the Silver River what he wants to do first."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu easily associated the Venerable One of the Silver River's actions with the great final battle. However, Venerable Fuxu still had doubts. In a normal battle for a sacred land, the great final battle would revolve around the giant core celestial pillars. Even if there were no giant core celestial pillars, they would still target the central core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could they maneuver freely.</p><p></p><p>But according to Venerable Leisa's words, the Venerable One of the Silver River appeared at the edge of the sacred land? "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa nodded, but his expression immediately became dazed.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu noticed this and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely sensed something was off from Venerable Leisa's expression.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Fuxu, the main combat body I was guarding over that core celestial pillar has perished."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa said after steadying himself.</p><p></p><p>"Perished?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu was also a bit dazed. This quickly? After all, Venerable Leisa was the top Peerless Supreme Venerable One of the Thunder Ancient Nation, a life born from the endless thunders.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful being, with an extraordinary ability to survive, even Venerable Fuxu would need to grind slowly to kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the heritage killing treasures of your Thunder Ancient Nation?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't have time to use them."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa swallowed, unable to help but continue, "That Venerable One of the Silver River..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of fear could be heard in Venerable Leisa's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't have time to use them?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu fell silent at this.</p><p></p><p>With the mental will of a Peerless Supreme Venerable One, they could activate the heritage killing treasures of their ancient nation with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>As for not having time? It meant they never even had a chance to react from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>A top Peerless Supreme Venerable One, without even a chance to react, just died?</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu's mind was shaken, unable to calm down.</p><p></p><p>Even the mightiest Venerable Ones wielding the heritage killing treasures of their ancient nations, the Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones should have enough reaction time.</p><p></p><p>But for it to be like this, where they didn't even have a chance to react, Venerable Fuxu was deeply shocked, and the other Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones on the scene were also far from calm.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa's fate was too unbelievable. How could a top Peerless Supreme Venerable One possibly not even have a chance to react? This was too absurd. Could it be that the Venerable One of the Silver River had already reached the Progenitor realm?</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Fuxu."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Venerable One of Spiritual Sense from the Great Spirit Ancient Nation suddenly spoke, "That Venerable One of the Silver River has appeared near the core celestial pillar I was guarding."</p><p></p><p>"You must be very careful."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu's mind shook, and he immediately warned.</p><p></p><p>Although the time it took for the Venerable One of the Silver River to cross the distance between the two core celestial pillars was too short, Venerable Fuxu had no time to ponder over it.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One of Spiritual Sense nodded, but his expression turned pale the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu sensed something was amiss and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's perished, the main combat body has perished."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One of Spiritual Sense's voice trembled a bit. With the previous example of Venerable Leisa, he had already been very careful.</p><p></p><p>He had his ancient nation's heritage killing treasure ready to be activated at any moment, just waiting to see if the Venerable One of the Silver River had anything to say.</p><p></p><p>But the result was still death in complete silence. It was almost as if he had died the moment the Venerable One of the Silver River looked at him, without any ability to react at all.</p><p></p><p>"Leisa, the Venerable One of the Silver River, he..."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One of Spiritual Sense immediately looked at Venerable Leisa.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me, I also died suddenly."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Leisa shook his head, still a bit dazed, not having fully reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Fuxu, the Venerable One of the Silver River, he's come to my place now."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One of the Yin of the Dark immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't hesitate, directly activate the heritage killing treasure bestowed upon you by the Yin Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu immediately said, the deaths of Venerable Leisa and the Venerable One of Spiritual Sense making him somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>A faint ripple was felt, but it was immediately suppressed, like a small flame that had just ignited, directly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu stared at the Venerable One of the Yin of the Dark.</p><p></p><p>"Dead." </p><p></p><p>The Venerable One of the Yin of the Dark shook his head, and then said, "I had already activated the heritage killing treasure, but that Venerable One of the Silver River is too strong. The heritage killing treasure couldn't withstand it and was shattered."</p><p></p><p>"The heritage killing treasure couldn't withstand it?" </p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>The heritage killing treasures of the various ancient nations, while far inferior to the weapons and armaments of the Progenitor realm, were still casually forged by the Progenitors themselves. Even the mightiest Venerable Ones would have to rack their brains to break through the defenses of a certain heritage killing treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Fuxu, I..."</p><p>"Venerable Fuxu, that Venerable One of the Silver River has come to..."</p><p>"Venerable Fuxu..."</p><p></p><p>As Venerable Fuxu's mind was in turmoil, one by one, the top Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones from the various ancient nations below spoke in a panicked tone, all having died at the hands of the Venerable One of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even have a chance to react.</p><p></p><p>Even with the warning from the Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones who had already died, there was still no change.</p><p></p><p>In the span of just three or four breaths, 103 core celestial pillars had been seized and refined by the Venerable One of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>103 core celestial pillars, scattered across half the sacred land, yet they had all fallen in just three or four breaths.</p><p></p><p>"These 103 core celestial pillars..."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu's mind was shaken, vaguely realizing something, and a detailed 'map' of the sacred land immediately appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>There were more than 300 light points scattered across the map, and in a certain corner, a large cluster of light points had turned red, indicating they had been seized and refined by the Venerable One of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable One of the Silver River is pushing horizontally, starting from the corner and horizontally seizing all the celestial pillars in the sacred land."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Fuxu suddenly realized, murmuring in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Venerable Fuxu's mind shook, as if a great calamity was approaching, and he looked up.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, a young man with his hands behind his back had appeared up there, looking down at Venerable Fuxu and the Peerless Supreme Venerable Ones, squinting and smiling:</p><p></p><p>"Now it's your turn."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

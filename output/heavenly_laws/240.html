            <p>Chapter 240: Lin Yuan's Arrival (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord!!"</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Galaxy Star Lord!!!"</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan stepped out of the spaceship, he saw countless Evolved Ones respectfully bowing, kneeling and prostrating before him. ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà ‚ùªÔºôÔΩì—í‡∏¢‚ìß.ùî†ùìûÔΩç ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë</p><p></p><p>His mindset began to change slightly. </p><p></p><p>On the Chiyan main star, although Lin Yuan had supreme power and status, with countless Evolved Ones treating him with utmost respect, that all stemmed from being the Chiyan Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>But now, these Evolved Ones were all bowing to him as the Galaxy Star Lord, to him, Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Rise." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The two leading Evolved Ones, one wearing a purple robe and the other with a head of golden hair, respectfully straightened their waists.</p><p></p><p>"You two must be Chunbo and Jiali, right?" Lin Yuan looked at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>After confirming his position as the new Galaxy Star Lord, Lin Yuan had received a lot of information, including details about Chunbo and Jiali. </p><p></p><p>These two were specially left behind by the human civilization to help him fully take over the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Although they could not compare to the two 8th-stage alien races gifted to him by his teacher, they were both 7th-stage Evolved Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"I am honored that the Star Lord remembers our names."</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali immediately replied respectfully. </p><p></p><p>"Alright, let them disperse." Lin Yuan looked at the densely packed army of Evolved Ones behind.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Chunbo nodded, turned around to face the army behind and said, "The Star Lord commands, you may all disperse."</p><p></p><p>His voice quickly reached the ears of every Evolved One.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"We obey the Star Lord's order."</p><p></p><p>The large army of Evolved Ones immediately dispersed in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord, allow me to show you around the main star." Chunbo immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy main star was very large. Although Lin Yuan had already obtained relevant information, for such a huge star, it was impossible for everything to be recorded in the data.</p><p></p><p>After roughly touring the main star, Chunbo and Jiali brought Lin Yuan to a magnificent palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of the Galaxy main star had begun when Lin Yuan paid 100,000 cubic universe crystals. Relevant Evolved Ones from nearby star alliances rushed over to carry out the transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"The star transformation is now in its final stages and is about to be completed."</p><p></p><p>Chunbo immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the planetary defense system on the main star, the safer it would be. This gave him a sense of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Quite fast." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Excluding travel time, the star transformation took at most three to four years.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, transforming this planet into a "forbidden land" that could easily suppress most 8th-stage Evolved Ones was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares not work hard when serving the Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Jiali, who was beside them, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Lord was no ordinary Star Lord. Not only was he the disciple of the Chiyan Star Lord, he was also a top human genius with unlimited potential.</p><p></p><p>Those working on transforming his main star must have given their all, not daring to show any negligence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason was that Lin Yuan had paid generously. Some of the 100,000 cubic universe crystals could be distributed to the workers.</p><p></p><p>"I have two subordinates who will manage the main star together with you." Lin Yuan looked at Jiali and Chunbo.</p><p></p><p>The two 8th-stage alien races gifted to him by the Chiyan Star Lord, Red Skin and Blue Eyes, not only had strength reaching the 8th-stage, but also had rich experience in star management.</p><p></p><p>To properly manage a star, especially a main star that served as the economic and political center of a star domain, required a high level of leadership ability.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali had no objections.</p><p></p><p>When taking over an unfamiliar star domain for the first time, it was only natural for Lin Yuan to assign his trusted subordinates.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan didn't make such arrangements and completely trusted them instead, Chunbo and Jiali would actually feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Inside the inner world.</p><p></p><p>The two 8th-stage alien races, Red Skin and Blue Eyes, had already fallen into a state of numbness.</p><p></p><p>Five years.</p><p></p><p>For 8th-stage alien races like them, it wasn't even enough time for a nap.</p><p></p><p>But under the watchful eyes of the two 8th-stage alien races, Lin Yuan's inner world had exploded from nearly 300,000 li in diameter before departure to 700,000 li now.</p><p></p><p>It had expanded by a whopping 400,000 li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Is this guy even human?</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Blue Eyes composed themselves and managed to recover.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they speculated that when Lin Yuan first entered the 8th-stage, his inner world had reached nearly 300,000 li. Perhaps he had used some supreme treasure or rare item related to space?</p><p></p><p>Some rare items found in the depths of the cosmic starry sky were very useful for opening up inner worlds, although there were many thresholds to using them.</p><p></p><p>But at least it could barely explain why Lin Yuan's inner world could reach a diameter of nearly 300,000 li upon first entering the 8th-stage.</p><p></p><p>However, what happened over the past five years undoubtedly shattered the perceptions of the two 8th-stage alien races.</p><p></p><p>They watched bit by bit as Lin Yuan's inner world expanded every day, every month, every year, until it reached 700,000 li in diameter now.</p><p></p><p>When first opening up an inner world, some supreme space treasures or rare items could be used to increase its size.</p><p></p><p>But after that, if one wanted to continue expanding their inner world, they could only rely on their level of comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>In other words, over the past five years, Lin Yuan's expansion of his inner world was entirely due to his own understanding of spatial laws.</p><p></p><p>An inner world with a diameter of 700,000 li...</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Blue Eyes tried their best to calm themselves.</p><p></p><p>They had seen inner worlds with diameters of 700,000 li before. The Chiyan Star Lord's inner world far exceeded 700,000 li.</p><p></p><p>But in just five short years, expanding from nearly 300,000 li to nearly 700,000 li...</p><p></p><p>The two of them had never heard of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Even for Star Roaming Kun, a "favored child" with a peak bloodline and innate inner world related to the origin of space, it shouldn't be possible to have such monstrous comprehension of the core spatial model, right?</p><p></p><p>What the two 8th-stage alien races didn't know was that Lin Yuan had already dispersed most of his time and energy on perfecting the 8th-stage martial dao and comprehending the path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>If he had focused all his efforts on comprehending the core model of spatial laws, the explosive growth of his inner world would have increased by an even greater margin.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Peak Lord going to let us out?"</p><p></p><p>"We've already arrived at the Galaxy main star."</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The two of them disappeared from the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy main star, central palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat on the throne and looked at Chunbo and Jiali below.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Blue Eyes appeared in the great hall.</p><p></p><p>"Are they the Star Lord's subordinates?"</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali's hearts surged with shock upon seeing Red Skin and Blue Eyes.</p><p></p><p>8th-stage.</p><p></p><p>These two were both at the 8th-stage.</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali's eyelids twitched.</p><p></p><p>Having two 8th-stage subordinates right after entering the 8th-stage himself, what an impressive feat...</p><p></p><p>Do you really think 8th-stage powerhouses are like cabbages by the roadside? Available in any quantity you want?</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali once again realized how terrifying Lin Yuan's background was. Just how much did the Chiyan Star Lord dote on him?</p><p></p><p>"You four will be responsible for various matters within the Galaxy Star Domain from now on." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Red Skin and Blue Eyes also responded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I need detailed information on the special lifeforms and lone alien races in the current star domain, as well as their movements in recent years..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The more detailed, the better," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>As the star lord of a star domain, Lin Yuan naturally would not allow anything within the domain to exist beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>Those special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races were within Lin Yuan's key focus.</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali immediately bowed.</p><p></p><p>After the four left, only Lin Yuan remained in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength, in terms of combat power, has already reached the pinnacle of the eighth stage, right? I'm even considered a powerhouse below the invincible eighth stage?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just based on the 700,000-square-li inner world, Lin Yuan's combat power could rank among the pinnacle of the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial dao evolutionary path that Lin Yuan cultivated was even more adept at fighting and defeating the strong despite being weak.</p><p></p><p>Why could the martial dao evolutionary path suppress the two great eighth-stage evolutionary paths of the Vermilion Roc Evolution Rankings at the seventh stage?</p><p></p><p>Potential might be one aspect, but in terms of combat power, the martial dao evolutionary path displayed an overwhelming advantage.</p><p></p><p>From the first stage chapter to the seventh stage chapter, and then to the eighth stage chapter that Lin Yuan had currently created, every step taken by the martial dao evolutionary path was comprehended by Lin Yuan with his heaven-defying perception, already making each point as perfect as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Below the invincible eighth stage, I have few opponents. Even if I encounter an invincible eighth stage, as long as I don't foolishly clash head-on and turn to escape, there shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan assessed himself.</p><p></p><p>The invincible eighth stage masters grasped a kind of cosmic power, and their combat power surpassed the eighth stage. But with Lin Yuan's current life-saving means, at least he wouldn't be like Ou Yin, unable to resist even a single move.</p><p></p><p>In terms of spiritual defense, Lin Yuan had an eighth-stage spiritual defense treasure guarding him, the "Demon Jade Imprint" protecting him, and a mental strength that had nearly reached 14,000 points.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was an invincible eighth-stage soul-type evolutionary, Lin Yuan believed he could withstand dozens of moves without dying.</p><p></p><p>In terms of physical defense, Lin Yuan had that eighth-stage armor protecting his body and the physical divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood."</p><p></p><p>Especially the latter, as long as Lin Yuan's body wasn't instantly crushed into nothingness, it was equivalent to an immortal body that could quickly "revive."</p><p></p><p>With the above two aspects of life-saving means, although Lin Yuan was naturally not a match for an invincible eighth stage, it wasn't easy for an invincible eighth stage to kill Lin Yuan either.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Galaxy Star Domain had already been incorporated into the territory of human civilization, as long as Lin Yuan was willing, he could completely summon a large number of human eighth-stage evolutionaries in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Chunbo and Jiali sent the intelligence information about those special lifeforms and lone wanderers of different races currently in the Galaxy Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully browsed through it.</p><p></p><p>"These special lifeforms are really too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>For special lifeforms born from the universe, they instinctively regarded everything in the universe as their own.</p><p></p><p>Especially that special lifeform named "Aodu," who needed to devour planets every once in a while. Resource planets? Life planets?</p><p></p><p>They were all dishes on Aodu's plate.</p><p></p><p>Its actions were the most arrogant after the Shadow Race retreated and human civilization was about to take over. It even continuously devoured dozens of life planets.</p><p></p><p>Life planets, suitable for life to inhabit, held extremely high strategic significance for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Only with a large population base could human civilization give birth to all kinds of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>As for those resource planets, most of their value couldn't compare to life planets of the same level.</p><p></p><p>But a few resource planets contained precious ores and treasures. For example, the dead resource star that Moon Star Domain and Gold Dragon Star Domain fought over.</p><p></p><p>The precious ore it contained, if fully mined, would be worth 10,000 cubic universes of crystals.</p><p></p><p>With such a large sum of universe crystals, even Gold Dragon Star Domain got greedy and started fighting with Moon Star Domain over it.</p><p></p><p>"Mine."</p><p></p><p>"Those resource planets and life planets are all mine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned. As the star lord, although all the resource planets within the star domain belonged to human civilization, he could still get a small portion.</p><p></p><p>As for those life planets, human civilization would soon begin large-scale immigration to the Galaxy Star Domain. At that time, the more life planets there were, the greater the benefits.</p><p></p><p>"This Aodu can't be kept."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Race was wary of Aodu's strength and background, but Lin Yuan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization had never been afraid of anyone while conquering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"I'll personally deal with it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and walked out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>Aodu was an eighth-stage special lifeform with strength approaching the pinnacle of the eighth stage. In addition, Aodu had a deep friendship with another eighth-stage special lifeform, and the two lived on a planet together.</p><p></p><p>In the current Galaxy Star Domain, only Lin Yuan had the strength to deal with Aodu.</p><p></p><p>On a huge planet.</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh watched as the blood-colored octopus slowly returned from outside the planet again, and its brows immediately furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"If you go out at this time, what if you anger that Galaxy Star Lord? What will you do then?" the massive mound of flesh said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't afraid of that Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>But it was afraid of the Vermilion Roc Star Lord behind the Galaxy Star Lord!</p><p></p><p>Even more afraid of the Human Civilization Alliance behind the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a dignified special lifeform, what's wrong with devouring a few planets?" Aodu said carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Recently, it had indeed kept a much lower profile and stopped devouring life planets.</p><p></p><p>But resource planets still had to be devoured after all. Without the vast energy contained in resource planets, the time for Aodu to enter the fourth stage of the eighth stage would be indefinitely extended.</p><p></p><p>"But what if the Galaxy Star Lord finds out? What will you do then?"</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh asked.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"An evolutionary who hasn't even reached a hundred years old, even if he has entered the eighth stage, how much strength can he have?"</p><p></p><p>"What can he do to us?"</p><p></p><p>Aodu said without any concern.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is easy to deal with, what about the Vermilion Roc Star Lord then?"</p><p></p><p>"And the Human Civilization Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh glanced at Aodu. "From beginning to end, I told you to keep a low profile and be careful, not because of the Galaxy Star Lord, but because of the Human Civilization Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"The Human Civilization Alliance has already incorporated this star domain into its own territory. If we want to live comfortably, we have to watch the Human Civilization Alliance's attitude."</p><p></p><p>"As for that Galaxy Star Lord, he doesn't count for shit!"</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh's voice was deafeningly loud.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I only devoured a few resource planets. If that Galaxy Star Lord dares to come..."</p><p></p><p>Aodu fell silent for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before it could finish.</p><p></p><p>Its gaze suddenly changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The massive mound of flesh lifeform seemed to sense something and also changed its expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Only to see outside the planet, a man in green armor with calm eyes, hands behind his back, looking down from above, quietly observing Aodu and the massive mound of flesh, smiling:</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, if the Galaxy Star Lord dares to come, what do you plan to do?"</p><p></p><p>Before the words fell.</p><p></p><p>That man stretched out his right hand, and space fluctuations began to ripple. The originally huge planet suddenly distorted and shrank, finally turning into the size of a palm, grasped in the man's hand.</p><p></p><p>Aodu and the massive mound of flesh lifeform had now turned into two ants, looking at the giant standing between heaven and earth outside with fear.</p>

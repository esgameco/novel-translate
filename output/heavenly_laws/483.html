        <h1>Chapter 483</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 483: Lingering Through the Ages (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm consciousness is in a state of fury?"</p><p></p><p>The tremors in the Source Realm were immediately sensed by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Ancestor of the Dao of Martial Arts approaching the Immortal Realm consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao looked towards the central position of the Source Realm but did not sense any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already warned Lin Yuan that the Immortal Realm consciousness was extremely terrifying and could easily mobilize the power of the entire Immortal Realm, the temptation of the place where the Immortal Realm consciousness resided, which contained all the rules of the Immortal Realm, was too great. This was the reason he had approached the Immortal Realm consciousness in the past, only to suffer a significant loss.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan was approaching the Immortal Realm consciousness, he must have also made this discovery.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how long the Ancestor of the Dao of Martial Arts can withstand the Immortal Realm consciousness," the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao mused with slight curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Even for an Ancestor Immortal, it was impossible to directly confront the entire Immortal Realm; it was merely a matter of how long one could resist.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had already prepared himself. If Lin Yuan showed signs of being unable to resist, he would intervene to assist him. With his experience in battling the Immortal Realm consciousness, he was confident in helping Lin Yuan escape unharmed, which would then earn him the gratitude of the Ancestor of the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"For now, the Immortal Realm consciousness is merely mobilizing the power of the Source Realm, which is still within normal limits. If it were to mobilize the power of the entire Immortal Realm, that would be truly terrifying," the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao carefully sensed and quickly contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power surged forth, enveloping Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not make the slightest attempt to resist. In terms of power level, he was not even a match for the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, let alone the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's boldness in approaching the Immortal Realm consciousness was due to his own understanding of the rules, or more precisely, his comprehension of the laws of space and time.</p><p></p><p>His Comprehension of the Seven Realms of Space-Time allowed Lin Yuan to transcend the Immortal Realm on the spatial-temporal level, which was also the reason why the Ancestor of the Demonic Abyss had been unable to affect him when he broke through all the spatial-temporal layers in a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The violent power from the Source Realm swept through Lin Yuan in an instant before blasting off into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"It didn't touch me?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Immortal Realm consciousness was unable to reach him, everything would be manageable.</p><p></p><p>If the Immortal Realm consciousness could lock onto his true body's location, Lin Yuan would not continue to approach it.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Without having touched Lin Yuan, the Immortal Realm consciousness did not stop, but continued to gather the power of the entire Source Realm to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not attempt to obstruct it, and simply continued to slowly approach the location of the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Several days passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps realizing that it could not reach Lin Yuan, after a brief pause, a wave of consciousness rippled out, indicating that the Immortal Realm consciousness wanted to communicate with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Since the Immortal Realm consciousness was a consciousness, it could naturally communicate. However, when it had faced the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, there had been no need for any communication.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's existence had made the Immortal Realm consciousness feel "troublesome," at least in the sense that it could not harm him, so it initiated the communication.</p><p></p><p>"Let me enter and experience the rules themselves," Lin Yuan also transmitted his intention.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible," the Immortal Realm consciousness responded with great fury, directly rejecting the request.</p><p></p><p>The place it resided in was the core of the Source Realm, which was also the origin of the Immortal Realm consciousness itself.</p><p></p><p>Not only was it the source of the myriad rules of the Immortal Realm, but it was also the source of the Immortal Realm consciousness itself.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan were to enter, he would not only be able to comprehend the rules themselves, but he could also directly attack the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Outside the core, the Immortal Realm consciousness could easily mobilize the power of the entire Immortal Realm, being omnipotent. But within the core, the power of the Immortal Realm could not permeate. Even the power of the Source Realm could not affect it. Within the core, the Immortal Realm consciousness was like a toothless old tiger.</p><p></p><p>"I promise I won't attack you," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He had once replaced the world consciousness of the Azure World, so he knew what this kind of world consciousness feared the most, and promptly made the guarantee.</p><p></p><p>However, the Immortal Realm consciousness did not respond to him, and even the boiling Source Realm quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Not communicating with me anymore?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and continued to approach the core where the Immortal Realm consciousness resided.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>"A spatial-temporal barrier?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the distorted space-time before him.</p><p></p><p>Even with his Comprehension of the Seven Realms of Space-Time, he was unable to proceed any further at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"So this is your reliance, huh?" Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>To enter the core where the Immortal Realm consciousness resided, in addition to facing the Immortal Realm consciousness's frenzied counterattack, he would also have to overcome the spatial-temporal barrier in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability: Rend the Heavens."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and an invisible force gathered, gently tearing at the spatial-temporal barrier before him.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was a purely, or rather, extremely offensive divine ability that had awakened during his current journey.</p><p></p><p>Rip.</p><p></p><p>With a single tear from Lin Yuan, the spatial-temporal barrier in front of him began to ripple slightly, but it quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Does it work?" Lin Yuan did not continue to attack.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, two more figures appeared in the distance.</p><p></p><p>They were Lin Yuan's Yin Spirit and Yang Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Divine Ability: Rend the Heavens depended on the overall foundation of the user.</p><p></p><p>Although the incarnations summoned by Lin Yuan also possessed an extremely high level of combat power, they were clearly far inferior to the two great spirits.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the gap between the incarnations and the true body was also significant.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability that the incarnations had unleashed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The 'Rip the Sky' divine ability he possessed could only stir up a few ripples on the spatial barrier.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>But the two great primordial spirits</p><p></p><p>Tore.</p><p></p><p>The two great primordial spirits stretched out their right hands and gently tore at the distant spatial barrier.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spatial barrier began to tremble slightly, but soon recovered.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't let me in, I will bring the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao here." Lin Yuanmaster actively communicated with the Immortal Realm consciousness, "With the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao's offensive capabilities, even if it cannot break through the spatial barrier in the short term, over time, one hundred million years, one billion years, one hundred billion years, can you still block it?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao's methods would not even reach the spatial barrier, as they would be suppressed by the vast world forces mobilized by the Immortal Realm consciousness before even getting close.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan lent a hand, the situation would be different.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the seven layers of the spatial realm was such that even the Immortal Realm consciousness could not lock onto his specific coordinates.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan really wanted to bring the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao over, what he had just said could very well come true.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was just threatening, in reality he couldn't wait for one billion or one hundred billion years.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Realm consciousness didn't know that.</p><p></p><p>"By then, I can't guarantee that I won't attack you." Lin Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm consciousness still did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll go bring the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao over, and while I'm at it, I'll bring the Ancestor of the Demonic Abyss as well." Lin Yuan's avatar dissipated silently.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The previously quiescent Immortal Realm consciousness began to fluctuate again, sending a message to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The gist of it was:</p><p></p><p>How could Lin Yuan guarantee that he would not attack the Immortal Realm consciousness after entering the core?</p><p></p><p>"You have no right to negotiate with me." Lin Yuan shook his head, "Either agree and let me in now, or in one hundred billion years, I and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao will force our way in."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lin Yuan quietly waited for the Immortal Realm consciousness's response.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm consciousness ultimately sent another message.</p><p></p><p>Agreeing to Lin Yuan's request.</p><p></p><p>One billion years, one hundred billion years, was an eternity to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But to the Immortal Realm consciousness, it was no different from tomorrow or the day after.</p><p></p><p>So the problem the Immortal Realm consciousness was facing was simple.</p><p></p><p>Either let Lin Yuan in today,</p><p></p><p>Or be killed by Lin Yuan in the future.</p><p></p><p>The two outcomes were completely different.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it." Lin Yuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The two great primordial spirits disappeared, leaving only one avatar standing there.</p><p></p><p>The distant spatial barrier began to distort, forming a temporary passage to the core.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped into it.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even before the tremors in the source realm were detected, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had been observing Lin Yuan's confrontation with the Immortal Realm consciousness through some means.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's attainment in the spatial realm was extremely close to the core, but he was ultimately blocked by the spatial barrier, which the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had also witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when Lin Yuan's two great primordial spirits appeared and unleashed the Rip the Sky strike, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao also knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was not clear about the content of Lin Yuan's communication with the Immortal Realm consciousness, the fact that the Immortal Realm consciousness had actively opened a passage to let Lin Yuan enter was very clear to the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao has entered?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was slightly dazed. In countless billions of years, he had also ardently desired to enter the core where the Immortal Realm consciousness resided, but it was just a desire, unless he could achieve another qualitative leap in strength.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he was no match for the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>In just over two hundred years of arriving at the source realm, he had entered the core that even the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had longed for but could not obtain?</p><p></p><p>In the core of the source realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared here.</p><p></p><p>All around was pitch black, with countless luminous points slowly drifting.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze across, and to his surprise, these luminous points corresponded to certain fundamental rules themselves.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black space, countless luminous points were drifting, some as small as a fist, and some as vast as a star.</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed each luminous point, and even the smallest one contained countless information. These were the embodiments of certain rules. Even though Lin Yuan had already comprehended these rules, re-observing them was still greatly beneficial.</p><p></p><p>"As the Immortal Realm enters its final stage, these core luminous points will gradually collapse, and the corresponding external world will be the collapse of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"All the rules contained in these luminous points will vaguely fuse together after their collapse, awaiting the long-awaited rebirth after the destruction?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, and in the first moment of entering the core, he had already fallen into a state of sudden enlightenment, with each moment revealing and comprehending new rules.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"That must be the main body of the Immortal Realm consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the distance and saw a luminous sphere floating there. This luminous sphere was completely different from the other surrounding luminous points - it was the Immortal Realm consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this luminous sphere was watching Lin Yuan with great vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally knew the Immortal Realm consciousness's concerns, but he was not in the mood to comfort it, as his entire mind was immersed in the contemplation of the countless luminous points all around.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, a thousand years had already gone by.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Chapter 222: A Trap? Let's Figure It Out First (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan's inner world has been completed, his physical body and soul have both reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>The only thing holding Lin Yuan back from stepping into the 8th stage is his mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>But mental willpower is very difficult to cultivate directly. </p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan's worst plan was to experience one or two more crossings.</p><p></p><p>By taking advantage of the different time flow speeds between the crossing world and the main world, he could experience a large amount of time to temper his mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the enormous mental willpower pressure emanating from that torso.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not shocked, but delighted instead.</p><p></p><p>This is a natural place to forge mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>"While tempering mental willpower, I'll also comprehend that torso."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the torso. It was a piece of flesh like black jade, with light black skin. Some muscles and deep purple blood could be seen.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan continued to observe deeply, in his vision, the torso began to enlarge, and countless runes began to appear on the skin surface. The body of an extremely powerful being is imprinted with the essence of the path they have walked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw the vast flow of runes.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious torso, you have begun to comprehend the first evolutionary path.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious torso, you have begun to comprehend the fifth evolutionary path.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious torso, you have begun to comprehend the twentieth evolutionary path.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the mysterious torso, you have begun to comprehend the fiftieth evolutionary path.]</p><p></p><p>"So many evolutionary paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a bit surprised. In less than an hour of looking at less than one millionth of the torso, he saw more than a thousand evolutionary paths from it.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Just how many evolutionary paths does this torso contain?</p><p></p><p>And this is just a remnant torso. What about a complete body?</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stopped comprehending.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng and Zuo Qiuguang came over.</p><p></p><p>"It's too incredible." Gao Wufeng shook his head and said, "I have already figured out the beginning of an evolutionary path from this torso."</p><p></p><p>"I feel that this evolutionary path is at least 8th stage, or even 9th or 10th stage, and it's extremely suitable for me. Comprehending the beginning was not difficult at all, without any obstacles."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng's eyes were burning.</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>"I feel that some of the evolutionary paths in the torso are very compatible with me, as if those paths were just waiting for me."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang also said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the two of them, the other evolvers on top of this mountain peak all looked excited, apparently gaining a lot, obtaining what they wanted.</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master, what about you?" Gao Wufeng looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I also gained some insights." Lin Yuan's tone was calm, but his eyes revealed a hint of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Easy.</p><p></p><p>Too easy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept around and found that not only the evolvers on their mountain peak, but also those on many other peaks, all looked like they had gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this torso has no threshold for comprehension at all?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the evolvers who could appear here all had great backgrounds and high insights. The evolutionary paths that excited them so much were at least 8th stage, or even 9th or 10th stage.</p><p></p><p>Is the quality of the evolutionary paths contained in this torso really that high? </p><p></p><p>You should know that although the evolutionary paths recorded by human civilization are vast, those that can reach the 8th to 10th stage are still very rare.</p><p></p><p>Yet they were casually comprehended from the torso?</p><p></p><p>A day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, Gao Wufeng, and Zuo Qiuguang gathered together again.</p><p></p><p>"I have already started cultivating." </p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng said directly, "The more I cultivate, the more the willpower pressure I bear decreases, it seems the direction I chose is correct."</p><p></p><p>When observing and comprehending that torso, one would bear the mental willpower pressure emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Not only Lin Yuan could feel this, other evolvers could feel it too.</p><p></p><p>But from what Gao Wufeng said, it could be concluded that the mental willpower pressure is not constant, it will decrease as one cultivates the comprehended evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang frowned imperceptibly. She originally thought this was unique to her.</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master, which evolutionary path did you choose to cultivate?" Gao Wufeng looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As he said this.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang also looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In terms of innate talent, Lin Yuan definitely surpassed them.</p><p></p><p>Since even the two of them comprehended the beginning of some evolutionary path, there's no way Lin Yuan gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take another look."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other evolvers comprehended evolutionary paths too easily, making Lin Yuan feel something was off.</p><p></p><p>"Take another look?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang and Gao Wufeng exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>Both were a bit shocked.</p><p></p><p>There was only one spot leading to the throne of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, instead of hurrying to cultivate, he wants to take another look?</p><p></p><p>You should know that competing with them for that spot are not just fellow humans, but also those of other races. </p><p></p><p>Every minute and second is extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng couldn't help but advise, "13th Peak Master, if you don't choose to cultivate an evolutionary path, you'll have to endure the suppression from the mental willpower all the time. Under such suppression, even normal cultivation efficiency will be greatly discounted. There's no need for that at all."</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master, were you scared by those few warning sentences at the beginning and don't dare to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiuguang said from the side:</p><p></p><p>"My teacher told me, when encountering opportunities, you must seize them. I'm very certain that the evolutionary paths we comprehended now probably have issues, but if we don't move forward when there are issues, human civilization would likely still be on the mother planet."</p><p></p><p>"Zuo Qiu, what you said makes a lot of sense, but I still want to take another look." Lin Yuan looked at the two, knowing they were also considering for him, and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful evolutionary path?</p><p></p><p>It indeed had appeal to Lin Yuan, but not as much as imagined. </p><p></p><p>Compared to cultivating the most powerful evolutionary paths walked by other supreme beings, Lin Yuan hoped more to push the martial dao evolutionary path to the supreme level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were simply too many evolutionary paths contained in that torso, so many that Lin Yuan was a bit panicked and didn't dare to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also didn't want to lose the tempering of the mental willpower pressure.</p><p></p><p>Once he chose to cultivate a certain evolutionary path, the mental willpower pressure he bore would decrease or even stop.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the harm of this outweighed the benefits.</p><p></p><p>In any case, first increasing his mental willpower index to over 10,000 points before stepping into the 8th stage was Lin Yuan's main goal for now.</p><p></p><p>As for giving up the martial dao evolutionary path to cultivate an unknown one, Lin Yuan didn't have such thoughts for now.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't plan to cultivate the evolutionary paths from that torso, I can completely comprehend them, then analyze them, perceive the profound wonders of the rules inside, and strip them out to gain insights myself."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Absorb and integrate it into the martial dao evolution path," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Doing so had two benefits. </p><p></p><p>First, it maintained the spiritual will pressure, allowing his spiritual will to be constantly tempered.</p><p></p><p>Second, it deepened his understanding of the rules and continued to improve the martial dao evolution system.</p><p></p><p>The evolution path within that torso was most likely problematic, but there must also be some merits, otherwise it wouldn't have captivated evolutionists like Gao Wufeng and Zuo Qiu Guang.</p><p></p><p>As for that supreme evolution path, Lin Yuan didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Time passed. </p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month went by.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, constantly observing the illusory torso beneath the sky.</p><p></p><p>Waves of intangible pressure descended, and whispers echoed in Lin Yuan's ears, entering his spiritual will and reverberating in his soul.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn, as his spiritual will was under extreme pressure at every moment.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that his body and soul in this virtual world were at the standard first-stage evolutionist level. Withstanding the spiritual will pressure relied entirely on his own spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting more and more uncomfortable," Lin Yuan sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The intangible spiritual will pressure was like countless hammers, pounding on his own spiritual will and soul from all directions.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't give up. Places that could directly target spiritual will were too rare, and this was a shortcut to entering the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>In addition to tempering his spiritual will, Lin Yuan never stopped analyzing the evolution path he had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Analyzing the mysterious evolution path, your gains in understanding have increased.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Analyzing the mysterious evolution path, your gains in understanding have increased.]</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the torso's owner, a supreme being from outside the main world, had cultivated an evolution path fundamentally different from those of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Although they both comprehended the fundamental rules, human civilization evolutionists comprehended from one direction, while the torso's owner comprehended from another direction.</p><p></p><p>However, the essence was the same, often giving Lin Yuan great insights.</p><p></p><p>"So this is another explanation for the rules of space?"</p><p></p><p>"How wonderful, the explanation of the rules of life is so easy to understand?"</p><p></p><p>"The rules of the five elements..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was like a sponge, frantically absorbing everything he had analyzed.</p><p></p><p>On another mountain peak, an evolutionist was also observing the torso under the sky.</p><p></p><p>His aura gradually changed, becoming more and more profound, apparently cultivating the evolution path he had comprehended, and had already cultivated to a profound level.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the subsequent path is smooth, but why do I always have a feeling..." This evolutionist was also a genius from a certain star domain. He had entered the seventh stage at over nine hundred years old and had a bright future.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the evolution path from the torso, he eagerly began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The more he cultivated, the more he felt he had made the right choice. The torso seemed to be prepared specifically for him.</p><p></p><p>But now, this evolutionist had a feeling of dread.</p><p></p><p>"The evolution path I'm cultivating has a problem. It looks perfect on the surface, but once I start cultivating, there's no turning back," the evolutionist thought silently.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop cultivating?" He frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"This is an opportunity to become a supreme being. Even if there are problems, I have to solve them. I absolutely can't give up."</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak where Lin Yuan was located, Gao Wufeng suddenly opened his eyes. At this moment, his aura had become deep and hidden, vaguely similar to the torso under the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng opened his mouth. His cultivation was very smooth, but recently, he had become a bit restless.</p><p></p><p>Restless?</p><p></p><p>This emotion that usually only appeared in ordinary people actually appeared in him? It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Heart demon..."</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought surfaced in Gao Wufeng's mind.</p><p></p><p>As a peak seventh-stage king-level evolutionist, he was too clear about the terror of heart demons. It was a tribulation that required at least ten thousand spiritual will points to resist.</p><p></p><p>Now, after only cultivating the evolution method within the torso for a month or two, he had already attracted a heart demon?</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng swallowed. If he continued cultivating, he would likely directly face the heart demon tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Although as a peak seventh-stage evolutionist, he would eventually have to face the heart demon tribulation, his current spiritual will points were not up to standard. Encountering the heart demon tribulation, the chances of survival were very low.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, on a high platform, several figures stood, overlooking the evolutionists on the mountain peaks below.</p><p></p><p>"It's been over a month. It seems some people should have discovered the problem," the man who had initially appeared with a huge figure and warned the many evolutionists said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"The vast majority of the evolution paths contained within this torso are wrong, dead ends, and absolute paths," the second figure said calmly.</p><p></p><p>This was something the supreme beings had discovered long ago, so before comprehending, they had specifically made a warning, prohibiting the outside true bodies from cultivating the comprehended evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if they ultimately walked a dead end or absolute path, only the body in this virtual world would collapse and be destroyed, while their true bodies in the outside world would still be fine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some dead ends and absolute paths that targeted spiritual will, that is, the heart demon tribulation. This would depend on the evolutionists' own choices.</p><p></p><p>If they continued cultivating and attracted the heart demon tribulation but couldn't pass it, it would affect their true bodies in the outside world. But if they passed it, they might be able to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Although most of the evolution paths are wrong, there are a few viable paths, and even the supreme evolution path is hidden among them. It depends on whether they can choose it," the third figure said.</p><p></p><p>In order to greatly ensure the survival rate of these human genius evolutionists, the supreme beings had made many preparations and even promised to "resurrect" them.</p><p></p><p>"I really envy them. Unlike us, whose foundations are already set, even if we want to take a chance, we don't have the opportunity," the fourth figure said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Not every evolutionist had the courage to comprehend the torso, especially the ninth-stage evolutionists. They had spent countless resources to finally reach the ninth stage, and their foundations were already set, making it difficult to start over.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the sixth stage, evolutionists' souls would match the evolution paths they cultivated. At this level, it was still possible to change one's evolution path, but it would require paying a certain price, and the changed evolution path had to be of the same type.</p><p></p><p>But at the ninth stage, it was different.</p><p></p><p>Even if they changed their evolution paths, they could only change to certain specific paths.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see how many people are still cultivating smoothly..."</p><p></p><p>The man who had spoken first began observing each evolutionist below.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>As the man's gaze swept over the top of a mountain peak, he showed a surprised expression.</p>

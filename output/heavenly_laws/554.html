        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the outer city area, most of the pale and thin people are now hiding in their rooms, shivering in fear, daring not to go out.</p><p></p><p>"Was that rumbling sound just now the rebels breaking in?"</p><p></p><p>"The rebels are that powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"So it's the rebels, they are human just like us, I hope they can win."</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of them winning!"</p><p></p><p>"Could they possibly drive out the aristocratic lords?</p><p></p><p>Even if they win the battle and gain fame, who's going to clean up this mess!</p><p></p><p>The aristocratic lords will get angry, and they'll just vent their anger on us innocent common people. Ah, I bet many people will die tragically again today."</p><p></p><p>"But... they are still our own kind, the ones oppressing us are the aristocrats..."</p><p></p><p>A group of people whispered and exchanged thoughts, their minds complex, each having their own views.</p><p></p><p>On the street, a man in black clothes walked quickly, his expression hurried.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a special bird call sounded.</p><p></p><p>The man in black's expression changed slightly, and he immediately walked towards the direction of the bird call.</p><p></p><p>About a dozen breaths later, his figure appeared in an abandoned courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, there were two people - one was the familiar Wu Xiang, the other was a fat man dressed in brocade and silk.</p><p></p><p>"Executive Li, this is a big deal!" the fat man spoke, his fleshy cheeks quivering.</p><p></p><p>This fat man was a rebel, who had been hiding in Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>His business was quite successful, gaining the favor of the aristocrats, and he also had some connections in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>So when something happened in the inner city, he could get the news immediately.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?" asked the black-clothed Executive Li.</p><p></p><p>First there was the rumbling, then the military strategist of the Blood Tiger Gang said someone was massacring in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>"They're dead, all dead!" the fat man said anxiously, his mind in chaos, unable to speak clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down." Executive Li's voice was crisp, subduing the fat man's mind.</p><p></p><p>The fat man finally settled down and organized his words: "A powerful expert entered the inner city and killed... the Devilish God's daughter, a princess!"</p><p></p><p>"What... killed the princess?" Executive Li's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>This so-called princess was the offspring of the Devilish God! That was the Devilish God, a god-level expert, the existence that suppressed the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was actually killed by someone! This was like tearing the heavens apart!</p><p></p><p>"Is the Thorn Blood chasing him?" Executive Li asked.</p><p></p><p>Now he felt a bit uneasy, not knowing whether he should receive this person to join the rebels.</p><p></p><p>After all, this might bring them disaster.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the fat man shook his head, "He's the one killing those aristocrats!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Executive Li was confused.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Devilish God's princess, instead of fleeing, he continued to kill those unnatural aristocrats in the city, seeking death instead.</p><p></p><p>There were dozens of heaven-level experts guarding the city.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious expert was so formidable.</p><p></p><p>"If he had left immediately, he might have had a chance to survive. But now, after slaying the aristocrats, he's probably... already surrounded by the Thorn Blood elders!" Executive Li speculated, inwardly anxious.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the fat man said, "He has already killed all the Thorn Blood elders!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" Executive Li was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe the fat man's words.</p><p></p><p>Although Cloud Blood City was not a big city, there were still dozens of heaven-level experts. </p><p></p><p>All of them killed? What kind of ruthless person was this, so powerful? After all, their rebel army was already considered one of the strongest in the vicinity, with only three heaven-level experts.</p><p></p><p>And now, a ruthless person had massacred all the Thorn Blood elders in Cloud Blood City? "Is this true?" Executive Li still found it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"It's absolutely true, I've already passed this news to the leader!" the fat man said seriously.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't sure the information was correct, he wouldn't dare to pass such news to the leader. The leader was a thorn in the side of the Thorn Blood, if the leader came to Cloud Blood City because of this and was ambushed by the Thorn Blood, he would die without a burial.</p><p></p><p>Executive Li scrutinized the fat man with a deep gaze. The fat man's scalp tingled.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang then said, "I believe Brother Chu."</p><p></p><p>Executive Li's gaze kept changing, and finally he slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"He has slain the Thorn Blood elders and is rampaging in the city, he will definitely draw the Devilish God's attention. </p><p></p><p>We must hurry to the inner city and warn him to leave!</p><p></p><p>After all, that is the Devilish God. No matter how powerful a mortal is, how can they contend with a god? In this Kuijin Realm, there are ninety-nine Devilish Gods stationed!</p><p></p><p>Mortals rashly offending the divine might will surely die without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>As for helping Wu Xiang receive Qi Yuan, it had already been pushed to the back of his mind.</p><p></p><p>That Qi Yuan, although he had some strength, having slain dozens of inner hall disciples of the Blood Tiger Gang, how could he compare to the terrifying expert currently rampaging in the inner city?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Executive Li said.</p><p></p><p>The fat man gritted his teeth: "I'll go too!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang did not speak, his silence indicating he did not object.</p><p></p><p>The group of a few people hurried towards the inner city, their minds filled with many thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the outer city area, silence and clamor coexisted. Some humans hid in their rooms, daring not to come out, while others dragged their families and fled the city.</p><p></p><p>To these, Executive Li was already accustomed and unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Devilish God has not yet acted, otherwise... that senior is in grave danger!"</p><p></p><p>The concept of the Devilish God being undefeatable was imprinted in their minds since birth. After all, those terrifying Devilish Gods, not to mention their divine powers, their mere towering hundreds of zhang tall bodies were not something the heaven-level Armament Masters wielding weak natural forces could contend with.</p><p></p><p>"Executive Li, don't worry, the Devilish Gods generally stay in seclusion cultivating, rarely descending," the fat man said.</p><p></p><p>The Devilish Gods were high and mighty, even heaven-level experts might never see one in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>"If the Devilish God has descended, I'm afraid... he has already begun suppressing that senior.</p><p></p><p>That senior was able to slay the Thorn Blood elders, facing the Devilish God he might be able to hold out for a dozen breaths.</p><p> </p><p>In those dozen breaths, the battle shockwaves will definitely be transmitted here," Wu Xiang made a reasonable inference.</p><p></p><p>If the Devilish God had descended, the battle shockwaves from slaying that senior would be enough to be heard here.</p><p></p><p>This inference was quite reasonable, the only loophole being that the Devilish God was stronger than imagined, instantly killing that senior without even transmitting any battle sounds.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another possibility that Wu Xiang didn't even consider.</p><p></p><p>The three hurried towards the inner city, when suddenly, Executive Li widened his eyes, gazing ahead, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He looked utterly horrified.</p><p></p><p>Wu Xiang and the fat man also widened their eyes, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The fat man's fleshy cheeks trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>For in front of them, at the entrance to the inner city, stood a towering colossus! A massive giant hundreds of zhang tall, dwarfing the imposing city walls like toys.</p><p></p><p>Dark gray scales, a powerful physique, blood-red demonic horns raised - all these displayed the terrifying existence's immense strength.</p><p></p><p>"Devilish God!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Devilish God's Dark Eyes!"</p><p></p><p>The glowing crimson eyes, like suspended lanterns, were cold and merciless.</p><p></p><p>Executive Li's gaze met those hundred-zhang tall, horrifying eyes, and his body trembled involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>This was the instinct of living beings! The Devilish God had truly descended! What were they to do? His mind was in turmoil, but suddenly, his spirit focused.</p><p></p><p>"No, this Devilish God is somehow different..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't move!" </p><p></p><p>The steward Li discovered something unusual.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people also just woke up and began to carefully examine the terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>"Its eyes are bleeding!"</p><p>"Its shoulder is missing a piece, and there's a lot of blood!"</p><p>"No, quick, look, there seems to be words on its body!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked over and saw that on the tall figure, large words were carved on the upper body. </p><p></p><p>The fresh blood gushed out, as if filling the words like paint, and the dripping blood was like the golden edge of the words.</p><p></p><p>"I am in the process of becoming a divine being, those who disturb me will be like this prey!"</p><p></p><p>Steward Li trembled as he read out these words, his heart surging with shock waves.</p><p></p><p>These twelve short words did not have much literary grace, but Steward Li could sense the majestic aura in them.</p><p></p><p>Slaying the divine being, erecting the divine being's corpse, and leaving words on its body - this was how mighty and awe-inspiring it was!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master... you're back?" Zhao Yan was anxious, but when he saw Qi Yuan return, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw that Qi Yuan's robe was dyed red with blood, he became a little worried.</p><p></p><p>"Master, did you destroy the Blood Tiger Gang?" Zhao Yan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Blood Tiger Gang? I forgot about them." Qi Yuan had indeed forgotten.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had killed a powerful divine being in the inner city, and the knife was even bent.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he not only had innate divine strength, but also ran as fast as the classmate that netizens talked about.</p><p></p><p>After being busy for a while, he had indeed forgotten about the Blood Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Tiger Gang is still around? Master, the blood on you?" Zhao Yan was a bit confused, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just casually killed a divine being." Qi Yuan said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you shouldn't say such things casually!" Zhao Yan hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting dark, I need to sleep." Qi Yuan said, and walked towards his room.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan looked at his master's back, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit worried that the Blood Tiger Gang would come to cause trouble for his master.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Zhao Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, a knocking sound came.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan was anxious, and walked to the courtyard: "Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" A crisp voice came.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan heard the familiar voice and his face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Red Plum, is that you!"</p><p></p><p>The door was opened wide, and the tightly dressed Red Plum walked in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the familiar figure, Zhao Yan's face showed a happy expression.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, he had rescued a seriously injured and unconscious girl in Yunxue City. That girl was Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>Red Plum was different from ordinary girls, as she had always wanted to find the legendary "Academy".</p><p></p><p>As for the "Academy", Zhao Yan only knew about it from Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>The master of the "Academy" was a mysterious existence. He traveled between realms, recruited disciples, and compiled ancient books.</p><p></p><p>Now, the master of the "Academy" was in the Kuijin Realm.</p><p></p><p>If they could meet the master of the Academy and join the Academy to serve the master, then they might be able to... obtain the master's protection, and even leave this realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's been three years, Zhao Yan, you're still the same!" Red Plum looked at Zhao Yan, her face full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>"Red Plum, why did you come back?" Zhao Yan couldn't hide his joy.</p><p></p><p>He had once been attracted to Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>"I have good news to tell you..."</p><p></p><p>"You found the Academy?" Zhao Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Red Plum nodded, "Two years ago, I traced the whereabouts of the Academy, and finally met the disciples of the Academy. After some setbacks and tribulations, I passed the test and joined the Academy."</p><p></p><p>Red Plum said it lightly, but Zhao Yan knew that the process must not have been that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations!" Zhao Yan was truly happy for Red Plum.</p><p></p><p>Joining the mysterious Academy also meant that they could escape this cage.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the master of the Academy has come to the Anmo Realm to collect news from the world and compile ancient books, so I and some senior sisters and brothers have also come here." Red Plum said, "Since it's not far from Yunxue City, I wanted to come back and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Red Plum looked at Zhao Yan, her gaze a bit complex, with a touch of affection.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, last time you didn't want to leave with me. Now that I've found the Academy, do you want to join the Academy with me... Oh, and if you're worried about your master, you can bring him along too!" Red Plum looked at Zhao Yan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Back then, she had invited Zhao Yan to go with her to find the Academy, but he had refused.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Zhao Yan's expression was conflicted, "My master's temperament, he won't go to the Academy.</p><p></p><p>Master raised me, it was not easy, and I want to take care of him in his old age!"</p><p></p><p>He always remembered the grace of his master.</p><p></p><p>And now, since his master had offended the Blood Tiger Gang, how could he abandon his master.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Red Plum was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely Zhao Yan's temperament that she valued, right? If Zhao Yan was cold-hearted, she wouldn't have fallen for him.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I'll be staying here for a while, is it okay if I stay here?" Red Plum did not bring up the invitation to join the Academy again.</p><p></p><p>After all, she wasn't sure if Zhao Yan could definitely join the Academy.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Zhao Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have there been any major events happening recently in Yunxue City? You know, the master of the Academy wants to record the great events of the world and compile them into books."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so." Zhao Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Offending the Blood Tiger Gang was a big deal for them, but in the grand scheme of history, it was just an insignificant little thing.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, we'll talk slowly." Red Plum didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Reuniting with an old friend was like a long-awaited sweet rain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>A young girl followed behind the long-robed elder, her face showing a naive expression.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, did something big happen? I rarely see you smile like this."</p><p></p><p>The long-robed elder had a weathered face, his back hunched, like an old man who had been tormented by the years.</p><p></p><p>But he was the famous master of the Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I am in the process of becoming a divine being, those who disturb me will be like this prey!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! This trip to the Kuijin Realm, just this one scene alone, is worth it!"</p><p></p><p>The Academy master laughed heartily, as he had not felt this joyful in a long time.</p><p></p><p>The young girl heard this, and immediately processed the just-received information, and after a moment, her face showed a moved expression.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect there to be such a heroic figure in the enemy-occupied area." the young girl sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the enemy-occupied area, to slay a divine being.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? It meant that the enemies would come endlessly.</p><p></p><p>It meant that they would be enemies of the world!</p><p></p><p>The divine beings of the Kuijin Realm would gather and unite to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he escaped this calamity, the divine beings from other worlds would also come, and he would have nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>"Such a heroic figure, I really want to meet him, the old man also doesn't want... After the destruction of the Shenmu Universe, no one knows the brilliant civilization of the Shenmu Universe, and those predecessors who sacrificed themselves and are worthy of respect!"</p><p></p><p>The book the Academy master wanted to write was called "Outline of the History of the Realms".</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that after the destruction of the Shenmu Universe, no one would remember this great and brilliant universe.</p><p></p><p>The civilization of the universe would wither away and be forgotten by all.</p><p></p><p>So he traveled the worlds, measured with his feet, recorded with his pen, and wrote the "Outline of the History of the Realms".</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The seeds of the blazing sun are mutually attracting each other, forming a nascent cyclic pattern.</p><p></p><p>Repeating endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Infinite and boundless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's physical body is undergoing a sudden and rapid transformation towards the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Strands of scorching aura are constantly surging in from the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the time for my physical body to transform into the true Blazing Sun Divine Body has been greatly shortened, from the original three to five thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Now?</p><p></p><p>It will only take three to five years.</p><p></p><p>"Just three ten-thousands of Blazing Sun seeds have already produced such a remarkable phenomenon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is clear about the number of Blazing Sun seeds within him - only thirty thousand.</p><p></p><p>It has not yet reached thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three.</p><p></p><p>So the cyclic pattern formed by the Blazing Sun seeds is only in its nascent stage.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lin Yuan can feel the changes in his physical body and soul, as if he is soaking in a hot spring.</p><p></p><p>Extremely comfortable, and the depth of his insights has also increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>No longer as slow as before.</p><p></p><p>"These Blazing Sun seeds seem to have formed an incomplete imprint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and he diverted a thread of his consciousness to explore it.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Lin Yuan's consciousness began to rise infinitely, arriving at a place filled with boundless Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>Everything here is scarlet red, as if it is the only thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up and saw a figure standing silently in the infinite heights.</p><p></p><p>This figure emanates boundless light and heat, and it has no definite form, appearing in countless ways to countless people.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw that figure, Lin Yuan's consciousness began to fall.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>In the thirteenth floor of the Fengshan Pavilion, Lin Yuan exhaled lightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized that even though the thirty thousand Blazing Sun seeds have not yet formed a complete great cycle, they have allowed him to catch a glimpse of some absolutely secret matters.</p><p></p><p>"That figure, is it the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun? The eternal Blazing Sun in the Empyrean?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that he had entered that scarlet red space through the Blazing Sun seeds, and the Blazing Sun seeds are related to the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally connected the two.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan exclaimed inwardly, this is the first time he has directly seen a thirteenth-tier temporal life.</p><p></p><p>The creator of the "Infinite Void" is also a thirteenth-tier temporal life, but what Lin Yuan saw before was only a trace of the other party's imprint, without even a specific thought.</p><p></p><p>While the figure standing above the endless Blazing Sun, even if it is not the true body of the Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, it is at least a manifestation or avatar, and the pressure it exerts on Lin Yuan is too great.</p><p></p><p>"Can I really reach that level in my lifetime?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts scattered, whether it was the Master of the Demon Jade Pavilion, the Mysterious Emperor, or the creator of the "Infinite Void", none of them have left behind a way to break through to the thirteenth tier.</p><p></p><p>For a twelfth-tier life to break through to the thirteenth tier, it is not as dangerous as the eleventh tier breaking through to the twelfth tier - it's either success or death.</p><p></p><p>But for a twelfth-tier life to break through to the thirteenth tier, there is no fixed method or way.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"Let's focus on cultivating to the Chaotic Realm first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts, considering the thirteenth tier is too far away at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Lin Yuan is not even at the Sovereign Realm, he is only at the Dao Splitting Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With the 'Infinite Void' mastered, and my martial dao reaching the peak of the Dao Splitting Realm, my current strength, even if not as strong as the true body of the Chaotic Void, is probably not much weaker, and I can easily crush the Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan assessed his own strength and had a clear judgment.</p><p></p><p>"If the Blazing Sun Divine Body completes its transformation, I might not even be weaker than the true body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Body is the strongest physique in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, it is said that when the Blazing Sun Divine Body is cultivated to the extreme, it can borrow a tiny bit of power from the eternal Blazing Sun in the Empyrean.</p><p></p><p>In this case, even if the true body of the Chaotic Void has mastered and replicated the Blazing Sun Divine Body, in terms of unleashing its power, it would certainly not be as good as himself.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Blue Burning City.</p><p></p><p>Several figures stood there out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>These figures are led by a purple-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, is our Master really going to make a move against the Blue Burning Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Behind the purple-haired woman, a man asked.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the majestic Blue Burning City in the distance and inquired.</p><p></p><p>"This is an order from the Imperial Capital, our Master cannot disobey it."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman said.</p><p></p><p>Even a great master has to listen to the orders of the ancient country, this is an iron rule.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some carefree great masters and celestial masters who do not want to accept the enfeoffment of the ancient countries can enjoy many benefits and privileges without being constrained.</p><p></p><p>But for great masters and celestial masters who have even a little ambition, they basically ally themselves with the various ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>There's no other way, the ancient countries have the deepest heritage, the most correct guidance, and the strongest protection.</p><p></p><p>Without aligning with an ancient country, great masters and celestial masters cannot see a clear path forward and naturally find it difficult to advance.</p><p></p><p>"An order from the Imperial Capital?"</p><p></p><p>The man who asked the question did not say much.</p><p></p><p>If it was just the idea of their Master, there might still be a chance to change it, but the Imperial Capital?</p><p></p><p>"What do we need to do?"</p><p></p><p>An old hunched woman directly asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's simple."</p><p></p><p>"Our Master will personally take action to lure away the Blue Burning Marquis."</p><p></p><p>"As for us, we will infiltrate the Blue Burning City in advance. With the means left behind by our Master, even if the Blue Burning Marquis is not directly engaged, he won't be able to detect us at all."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman continued: "When the Blue Burning Marquis is lured away, we will go all out to cause chaos in the Blue Burning City, and then use the Myriad Array Crystal to replicate the array formations of the Blue Burning City, so that we can analyze its weaknesses when we return."</p><p></p><p>"Causing chaos in the Blue Burning Domain is just a means."</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate goal is to replicate the array formations of the Blue Burning City using the Myriad Array Crystal."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman spoke.</p><p></p><p>Only by deciphering the array formations of the Blue Burning City in advance can they wait for the various great domains like the Purple Dream Domain to launch a full-scale attack on the Blue Burning City. Otherwise, with the Blue Burning City's array formations operating at full power, along with the Blue Burning Marquis' personal array, it would be more than enough to withstand the assault of seven to ten or even more peak great masters of the same level.</p><p></p><p>The core of this plan is the Myriad Array Crystal. This treasure, bestowed by the Imperial Capital, can theoretically replicate any array formation in the world, and is extremely precious. The Purple Dream Marquis will have to return it after using it.</p><p></p><p>Once the array formations of the Blue Burning City are replicated, the Purple Dream Marquis will immediately request the ancient country's array formation masters to decipher them, and then launch a joint attack with the other great domains.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Blue Burning Marquis realizes something is amiss, he won't have time to do anything, like changing the Blue Burning Array. It's something he can't do in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>But they can only do this once. After breaking through the Blue Burning City, the powerhouses of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country will definitely conduct a review, and easily discover the problem.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they will specifically strengthen the defenses in this regard.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The figures behind the purple-haired woman nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This task is not particularly dangerous, as the Blue Burning Marquis will be lured away by the Purple Dream Marquis, effectively losing his greatest threat.</p><p></p><p>As for the disciples of the Blue Burning Marquis? Although the Blue Burning Marquis is powerful, he is not very attentive in cultivating his disciples, so their strength is not that impressive.</p><p></p><p>Even the Blue Burning Marquis' senior disciple Feng Wanxing's strength is far inferior to the purple-haired woman.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman's strength has already stepped into the great master realm, and among the Sovereign Realm experts of the Purple Dream Domain, there are at least ten whose strength is not inferior to Feng Wanxing.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Blue Burning Marquis recently took in a new disciple, and in order to accept this disciple, the Blue Burning Marquis personally left the Blue Burning City."</p><p></p><p>The old hunched woman spoke.</p><p></p><p>This is not a secret, after the Blue Burning Marquis accepted Lin Yuan as a disciple, he introduced him to the other disciples, and the news has been widely circulated in the Blue Burning Domain, considered a meteoric rise.</p><p></p><p>The originally second-tier Vu Family has now soared, becoming the hottest family in the Blue Burning Domain.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard about it, given the Blue Burning Marquis' personality, he wouldn't rashly leave the Blue Burning City just for a disciple."</p><p></p><p>The man next to her was also curious.</p><p></p><p>The enfeoffed marquises of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country are meant to guard their respective great domains. </p><p></p><p>The core of a great domain is the domain city, and for the Blue Burning Domain, that is the Blue Burning City.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Burning Marquis rashly leaving the Blue Burning City carries certain risks.</p><p></p><p>If the enemy great domains attack at this time, without the peak great master suppressing it, the Blue Burning City would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>But the possibility of this is not high.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Burning Marquis left without telling anyone in advance, the enemy great domains don't know, and naturally think the Blue Burning Marquis is still in the city, so they are unlikely to make a move.</p><p></p><p>And since the Blue Burning Marquis dares to go out, he must be confident in being able to rush back immediately.</p><p></p><p>The hidden danger is even smaller.</p><p></p><p>Their current plan is to have the Purple Dream Marquis delay the Blue Burning Marquis, and delaying him is the key.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was someone to detain the Marquis of Azure Blaze, so there was time to use the crystals of ten thousand formations to recast the formation law of the Azure Blaze City.</p><p></p><p>"The Marquis of Azure Blaze has a cold and indifferent personality. Under the orders of the Ancient Country of Scorching Sun, he took in some disciples, but those disciples did not dare to address the Marquis of Azure Blaze as 'Master'."</p><p></p><p>"But for the sake of this newly recruited junior disciple, he not only risked leaving the Azure Blaze City, but also spared no resources in cultivating him."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman shook her head slightly, "This disciple named 'Yu Yan' has terrifying natural talent, at least far surpassing the current Feng Wanxing."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>The other few people nodded slightly, agreeing in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary disciple, the Marquis of Azure Blaze would not be worth doing this for.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, this person should be a great trouble for my Purple Dream Domain."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman made an assessment, then shook her head and said, "But there is no future."</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken,</p><p></p><p>the other few people immediately laughed.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>There is no future.</p><p></p><p>If this plan succeeds, the Azure Blaze Domain will be completely conquered, and even if the Marquis of Azure Blaze survives, he can only flee in panic, not knowing where to hide and lick his wounds.</p><p></p><p>As for the disciple he has poured his heart and soul into cultivating? Of course, there is no need to worry.</p><p></p><p>Even if the natural talent is extraordinary, without a long time to grow, even the royal families of the great ancient countries will not pose any threat.</p><p></p><p>And even if that 'Yu Yan' can eventually grow up, it will be a matter of countless ages later.</p><p></p><p>At least for the current planning of the Purple Dream Domain, it will not have any impact.</p><p></p><p>"If we can successfully recast the formation law of the Azure Blaze City, the imperial capital will bestow a precious treasure."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman said finally.</p><p></p><p>This is also to boost morale.</p><p></p><p>To be called a 'precious treasure' by the Ancient Country, even the Sovereign-level powerhouses will crave it.</p><p></p><p>As for their group of Dominator-realm experts? Once they obtain it, even if they can't use it themselves, they can trade it with the Sovereigns to obtain the resources they want.</p><p></p><p>The precious treasure bestowed by the Ancient Country, no one dares to snatch it, they can rest assured.</p><p></p><p>"Precious treasure?"</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked old woman and the others looked at each other, their eyes flashing with a hint of heat.</p><p></p><p>From what they've heard, their task is not difficult to accomplish,</p><p></p><p>The only hidden danger is whether the Marquis of Azure Blaze will return in advance?</p><p></p><p>But with the bestowal of the Ancient Country's precious treasure, there is no risk of hidden danger, they are even uneasy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Blaze City,</p><p></p><p>the Marquis of Azure Blaze looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>In the recent period, he clearly sensed the abnormal movements of the Purple Dream Domain, but the Azure Blaze Domain and the Purple Dream Domain are opposing major domains, so it's normal for the other side to have abnormal movements.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly does the Purple Dream want to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze vaguely felt that something was wrong, but he couldn't put his finger on it.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to make more preparations."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze thought for a while, and immediately summoned many disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Lordship."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing and other Dominator-realm experts bowed to the Marquis of Azure Blaze.</p><p></p><p>Although the Marquis of Azure Blaze did not allow them to address him as 'Master', he did not skimp on their treatment.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, if I am not in the Azure Blaze City, and the Purple Dream Domain or other major domains attack, you do not need to pay attention to other places, just guard these key locations of the Azure Blaze City's formations."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze immediately listed the core locations of the Azure Blaze City's formations.</p><p></p><p>In the Marquis of Azure Blaze's worst-case scenario, it is that he will be detained.</p><p></p><p>Then the Purple Dream Domain will take the opportunity to cause chaos and destroy the formations within the city.</p><p></p><p>If he is still in the city? The Purple Dream Domain won't have any chance at all.</p><p></p><p>As for launching a full-scale attack on the Azure Blaze City? Even if the Marquis of Azure Blaze is not guarding the city, once the city is attacked, the formations of the Azure Blaze City will automatically operate, which is enough to support for a long time.</p><p></p><p>So the Marquis of Azure Blaze speculated that the powerhouses of the Purple Dream Domain might infiltrate the Azure Blaze City in advance.</p><p></p><p>But the number will definitely not be too many, as the Azure Blaze City has a special formation detection, and once the life density of the intruders exceeds a certain limit, it will trigger an alarm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called life density refers to the quality and quantity of the powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>For example, once a Sovereign-level existence enters, the Marquis of Azure Blaze will immediately sense it.</p><p></p><p>Or if a large number of Dominator-realm powerhouses enter, the Marquis of Azure Blaze will also sense it.</p><p></p><p>The external powerhouses can at most conceal their aura and hide their origins through secret techniques, but the life density cannot be changed. If the life density exceeds the critical point, the Marquis of Azure Blaze will immediately know.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing and the many other disciples immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship, will the Purple Dream Domain make a move recently?" Feng Wanxing asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze's arrangements were obviously aimed at the Purple Dream Domain.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just making more preparations, as for whether the Purple Dream Domain will make a move, we'll see when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He even hoped that the Purple Dream Domain would make a move.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Purple Dream is roughly on the same level of strength as the Marquis of Azure Blaze, but if the two were to fight and clash, the Marquis of Azure Blaze would clearly have the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>And in the recent period, the Marquis of Azure Blaze has made some breakthroughs in his secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>If the Purple Dream Marquis dares to come, the Marquis of Azure Blaze is confident of severely injuring the other party.</p><p></p><p>If the Purple Dream Marquis is severely injured, the Azure Blaze Domain can at least be stable for hundreds of millions or even thousands of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"You may all withdraw."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>After all the disciples had withdrawn,</p><p></p><p>the Marquis of Azure Blaze fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple's recent demand for resources is a bit too large."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is the disciple he values the most, and although the Marquis of Azure Blaze does not often contact him openly, he has been secretly observing him all along.</p><p></p><p>"But as long as you can consume it, the resources are yours to take."</p><p></p><p>The Marquis of Azure Blaze smiled slightly, and he even had some expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the Burning Heaven Courtyard, Lin Yuan was observing the changes in his physique and flesh body.</p><p></p><p>After condensing 30,000 Scorching Sun Seeds, the transformation speed of the Scorching Sun Divine Body has soared, and Lin Yuan can sense the changes in his flesh and blood body every moment.</p><p></p><p>"Every drop of my blood, the most microscopic constituent particles, have all turned scarlet red, evolving into more subtle patterns."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a thoughtful expression, these patterns are interconnected, greatly enhancing the strength of Lin Yuan's physique and flesh body, and even resonating with the most fundamental Dao rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is this Source World or the Chaotic Void, when powerhouses comprehend the Dao, the essence is to master the Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>This behavior is active.</p><p></p><p>But the Scorching Sun Divine Body, which has not yet completed its transformation, has given Lin Yuan a sense of spontaneously resonating with the fundamental Dao rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It does not require Lin Yuan to actively seek the Dao, the Dao comes naturally.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The more Lin Yuan observed, the more amazed he was.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation of the body, Lin Yuan also has a deep foundation, mastering the "Mysterious Yellow Body" which is an unparalleled Sage-level secret technique created by great saints with painstaking efforts.</p><p></p><p>As well as part of the "Indestructible Demonic Jade Body".</p><p></p><p>But no matter the "Mysterious Yellow Body" or the "Indestructible Demonic Jade Body", the essence is to refine the flesh body, to forge the flesh body into an indestructible existence.</p><p></p><p>But the Scorching Sun Divine Body? It is evolving the flesh body, fundamentally changing the structure of the flesh body, and Lin Yuan is still not sure if he is still a human race.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the basis for judging a race is not the flesh body, but the true spirit of the soul, this is something Lin Yuan has known since the human civilization era in the Macro Universe.</p><p></p><p>During the human civilization era in the Macro Universe, many evolved beings snatched the lives of special creatures in order to have a higher starting point, and after the snatching, the flesh body was no longer human, but as long as the true spirit of the soul is human, then it is still human.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Divine Body also has differences."</p><p></p><p>"The most basic Scorching Sun Divine Body is formed by 3,333 Scorching Sun Seeds."</p><p></p><p>"And as the number of Scorching Sun Seeds condensed increases, the power of the Scorching Sun Divine Body also becomes stronger."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>These details are what Lin Yuan has deduced through constant observation of himself.</p><p></p><p>The transformation method of the Scorching Sun Divine Body after condensing 20,000 Scorching Sun Seeds is completely different from the transformation of the Scorching Sun Divine Body after condensing 3 Scorching Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>This is not just a difference in the speed of transformation, but also a difference in the microscopic composition.</p><p></p><p>"When the Scorching Sun Divine Body completes its transformation, everything will be known."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, now the Scorching Sun Divine Body has not yet formed, and he cannot feel too much.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Five years have passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's flesh body has finally completed its final transformation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged there, carefully feeling the changes in his physique and flesh body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the most microscopic components of Lin Yuan's flesh body have completely transformed into fire particles, and the profound and mysterious patterns are imprinted on all the fire particles, intertwining and entangling with each other.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a long sigh, after the Scorching Sun Divine Body completed its transformation, a lot of innate information quickly flooded into his mind.</p>

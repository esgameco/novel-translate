        <h1>Chapter 671</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I can't continue watching any longer."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun forcibly maintained his blurred consciousness and quickly stopped observing the future timeline, and the turbulent state of his mind gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>However, the backlash caused by this forceful peeking into the future would take him at least a few years to dispel.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>After the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun had calmed down, he was exceptionally shocked in his heart. Time Beings, while able to glimpse into future timelines, have certain limitations.</p><p></p><p>For example, there are countless future timelines, and even though he is as powerful as a Thirteenth Realm cultivator, he can only observe a portion of the timelines, unable to grasp all the futures.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, once the observed future timeline involves a Time Being of the same realm, it becomes exceptionally difficult, and may even suffer backlash.</p><p></p><p>And the further the observed future, the more variables there are, and the higher the difficulty of the observation.</p><p></p><p>"Did I receive a huge backlash?"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun's expression was solemn. He tried to peek into the distant future of Lin Yuan, but was directly met with such a backlash, which could only be attributed to a few rare situations.</p><p></p><p>One is that in the distant future, Lin Yuan has established a causal relationship with an extremely powerful Time Being, and enjoys the protection of that powerful Time Being, so the Progenitor naturally cannot glimpse more details.</p><p></p><p>The second is that Lin Yuan is in a special environment, where there are some time origin places between dimensions, which can interfere with the future lines that a Thirteenth Realm cultivator can observe.</p><p></p><p>The third is that in the distant future, Lin Yuan has already become an extremely powerful Time Being himself, able to shield against all observation, even from the past.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these three situations, there are some other possibilities, but the probability is not high.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun's expression was solemn, and he was more inclined towards the third situation.</p><p></p><p>Because just from the known timeline, he could judge that Lin Yuan's growth speed was unbelievably fast. Even after entering the Thirteenth Realm, he was still growing at a terrifying pace, at least the Great Progenitor and the Great Progenitor of Submission would have no strength to contend with Lin Yuan in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the future the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun saw was just one possibility, and in the actual future, the Great Progenitor and the Great Progenitor of Submission might not necessarily be in opposition to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I can now glimpse into the futures of the Galaxy because his life realm is still low, at the Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun thought to himself, and for him, whether it was the Pinnacle Sovereign Realm or the Top Pinnacle Sovereign Realm, the Strongest Sovereign, the Invincible Sovereign, they were all at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"When he crosses into the Thirteenth Realm, it will be very difficult for me to glimpse into his future again."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Directly observing the future of a Time Being of the same realm is not only difficult, but also very vague, with much information incomplete.</p><p></p><p>The confrontation and layout between Thirteenth Realm Time Beings is determined by observing a large number of possible timelines, and then judging the plans or layouts of other Time Beings, and then responding accordingly.</p><p></p><p>But whether one can accurately judge the plans and layouts of other Time Beings depends on how many future timelines one has observed.</p><p></p><p>If unable to directly observe the future of a certain Time Being, one can only make indirect inferences and guesses based on observing the futures in one's own countless timelines.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to start observing the timelines again recently, with the existence of the Galaxy, there will probably be a lot of changes in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun thought to himself, apart from cultivation, Time Beings spend their time observing future timelines, but they usually observe the future timelines by following a certain timeline, which leads to them spending a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Before meeting Lin Yuan, the timelines the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun had observed had lasted for hundreds of thousands to millions of years, starting from hundreds of thousands to millions of years ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan had not yet descended to this Source World, so the many timelines the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun had observed were timelines without Lin Yuan's existence, so he had never noticed the monstrous prodigy that had appeared in the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan's existence has been confirmed, the Progenitor of the Scorching Sun naturally decided to abandon the many timelines he had previously observed, and start observing anew from this moment on.</p><p></p><p>With the introduction of Lin Yuan, who is destined to reach the Thirteenth Realm, the future of this Source World will surely take a different direction, and the timelines he sees will be completely different from the ones he saw before.</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable." The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun sighed deeply in his heart, through observing Lin Yuan's future, he had gained new insights, and realized that the infinitely variable future actually has a certain degree of certainty? "It is said that the Time Lords who are about to break through to the Perfect Time Being are beginning to converge their own timelines, making the past, present and future unified, but the Galaxy is not even a Thirteenth Realm cultivator yet, how can he achieve such a definite future?"</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun pondered for a while, and then continued to observe the future timelines again.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver River Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was sitting cross-legged, at this moment most of his mental energy was focused on comprehending the operation of the Source World's origin, and the remaining energy was used to process the guidance of various supreme inheritances, as well as to perfect the path of the Martial Dao Evolution.</p><p></p><p>The path of the Martial Dao Evolution had long been mature, what Lin Yuan needed to do now was to perfectly integrate the path of the Martial Dao Evolution into this Source World.</p><p></p><p>Each dimension has its own unique rules, for example, in the Chaotic Void, life will receive the baptism of the Chaotic Void origin at key nodes, which is why the Cosmos can thrive within the body.</p><p></p><p>If there is no such baptism of the Chaotic Void origin, the Cosmos would be difficult to spread in the Chaotic Void, because most experts cannot afford the consumption of the Cosmos' operation.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World, there is no such origin baptism, but there are the six Progenitors providing nourishment, and almost every life form has the bloodline of the Progenitors flowing within them.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor bloodline is a Thirteenth Realm bloodline, no matter how diluted it is, once excavated, the potential it can unleash is extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>So the entry point of the Martial Dao Evolution path in this Source World is to fully excavate the Progenitor bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at his palm, and was also observing a drop of Dragon Abyss Blood, comprehending the most fundamental power hidden within the bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Dragon Abyss Blood floating in front of Lin Yuan began to boil, and in an instant transformed into a palm-sized black dragon.</p><p></p><p>Every scale on the black dragon's body seemed to be an endless abyss, and the intangible aura it emanated began to silently influence the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the 'Abyss Dragon', the very first living being?" Lin Yuan carefully observed, through the excavation of the fundamental power of the bloodline, he had reconstructed the true form of the 'Abyss Dragon' from a single drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was only the form, and the consciousness and soul had long been erased, but even so, Lin Yuan could still sense the terrifying power of the 'Abyss Dragon'.</p><p></p><p>"Just the form of the Abyss Dragon created from a single drop of blood has such might, the full power of this first living being in its prime was indeed not weaker than my current self." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Progenitor of the Scorching Sun had also mentioned this first living being before.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The primordial being, although treated as a "negative example", has already proven the terrifying nature of this earliest of all beings, as the Progenitor Ancestor himself descended to personally slay the "Abyss Dragon".</p><p></p><p>It must be known that for the beings of time and life, anything below the Thirteenth Realm is hardly worth a glance.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost complete," Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the palm-sized black dragon instantly dissipated, transforming back into a drop of Dragon Abyss Blood, which Lin Yuan then collected.</p><p></p><p>After hundreds and thousands of years of refinement, Lin Yuan has now fully formed the path of the Martial Dao Evolution, completely adapted to this source world and the Six Great Ancient Nations.</p><p></p><p>"I just need to inform the Progenitor Ancestor about spreading the path of the Martial Dao Evolution."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, as all the beings in the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation were descendants of the Progenitor Ancestor, cultivating the cultivation system passed down by the Progenitor.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to spread the path of the Martial Dao Evolution here, even if just as a supplementary cultivation, he would certainly need to inform the Blazing Sun Progenitor Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan murmured the two words "Blazing Sun".</p><p></p><p>Invisible forces gathered, forming the figure of the Blazing Sun Progenitor Ancestor, who smiled and said, "Silver River."</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor Ancestor, may I spread my own path of evolution?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Spread your own path of evolution?" The Blazing Sun Progenitor Ancestor looked at Lin Yuan with a smile and nodded, "Of course you may."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Progenitor Ancestor," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"What is there to thank between us?" The Blazing Sun Progenitor Ancestor shook his head and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancient Nation occupied the most fertile region of this world, and the imperial palace at the center of the capital was now gathering a group of powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>These figures had powerful auras, at least reaching the peak Celestial Lord realm, and there were even close to ten of the strongest Celestial Lords standing tall.</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor Ancestor is about to descend, and according to past customs, he will guide our cultivation," the Great Abyss Ancient Nation's emperor said solemnly, "And he will also learn of the recent events."</p><p></p><p>Among the Progenitor Ancestors of the Six Great Ancient Nations, the Great Abyss Progenitor Ancestor was the most attentive in cultivating his descendants. Every so often, he would descend to guide the peak Celestial Lords and the strongest Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>This would normally be an unparalleled blessing for the Great Abyss experts, as they could receive the Progenitor Ancestor's guidance without any effort.</p><p></p><p>However, the situation was different now.</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Celestial Lords present were under a lot of pressure. The recent events, where the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation had crushed the Great Abyss Ancient Nation and seized that newly born first-grade Treasure Land, could not be hidden from the Progenitor Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Although it was said that the Great Abyss Ancient Nation failed to seize the Golden Mist Treasure Land completely due to the terrifying strength of the Silver River Celestial Lord, and was not their fault, the Great Abyss Progenitor Ancestor would not care about such details, and would only see the incompetence of the Celestial Lords present.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Great Abyss Progenitor Ancestor was the oldest and most powerful among the Six Progenitor Ancestors, and the Great Abyss Ancient Nation was the mightiest of the Six Great Ancient Nations, with everything related to the Great Abyss being the strongest.</p><p></p><p>But now, this had been shattered by the Silver River Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>If the gap was not too large, the Great Abyss Celestial Lords present would still have the confidence to redeem themselves.</p><p></p><p>But given the strength the Silver River Celestial Lord had displayed in the Treasure Land, even the strongest Celestial Lords of the Great Abyss Ancient Nation did not dare to try and get even.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too large.</p><p></p><p>So large that they didn't even have a chance to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Great Abyss Celestial Lords could only hope that the Silver River Celestial Lord would quickly break through to the next level.</p><p></p><p>That way, whether he succeeded or failed, they would not have to bear the pressure brought by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Progenitor Ancestor is about to descend."</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Ancient Nation's emperor glanced at the Celestial Lords present, feeling uneasy in his heart. The Progenitor Ancestors were high and mighty, and were also engaged in hidden power struggles. Now that the Great Abyss Ancient Nation was far inferior to the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, if the Progenitor Ancestor knew about this, how could he be happy? If the Progenitor Ancestor was not happy, then his descendants would suffer.</p><p></p><p>In the Blazing Sun Nation's capital.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Progenitor Ancestor's consent, Lin Yuan immediately approached the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor.</p><p></p><p>Spreading the path of the Martial Dao Evolution was a trivial matter, and Lin Yuan certainly would not do it himself, as it was mainly the responsibility of the Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River," the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor looked at Lin Yuan, his tone gentle, "What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"I have perfected the method to excavate the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>If previously, he had only been anticipating the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline at the Celestial Lord level, after witnessing the Silver River Celestial Lord's overwhelming power in the battle for the Treasure Land, his anticipation had turned into fervor.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor was also aware that many of the methods Lin Yuan had displayed in the Treasure Land were due to the powerful path of the Chaotic Evolution, but he could not ignore the blessings brought by the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Especially that completely new Blazing Sun world formed centered on his own Blazing Sun, it was simply unbelievably powerful.</p><p></p><p>"However, the excavation of the bloodline has a lot of randomness, and not everyone can uncover the powerful talents hidden in the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline," Lin Yuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>After integrating into this source world, the path of the Martial Dao Evolution had gained a great boost in the excavation of the bloodline within one's body. But no matter how great the boost, it still depended on the individual.</p><p></p><p>As the Martial Dao Ancestor, with his extraordinary comprehension, Lin Yuan was able to grasp the fundamental power hidden deep within the bloodline, which allowed him to awaken the "Blazing Sun World Creation" divine ability.</p><p></p><p>But for other cultivators, they did not have Lin Yuan's methods, and the excavation of the bloodline's divine abilities also depended on the fundamental power hidden in the bloodline itself.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, Lin Yuan's methods were a combination of the cosmic power within his body, the "World" divine ability, the inheritance of the "Infinite Void", and the "Blazing Sun World Creation".</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun World Creation divine ability alone, while possessing tremendous power, also had many limitations.</p><p></p><p>"That is natural," the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor nodded, not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even with the same cultivation inheritance, some beings could reach the Celestial Lord realm, while others could not even break through to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the excavation method of the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline that Lin Yuan had perfected, if it could allow every being to uncover the Celestial Lord level power in their bloodline, the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor would find it unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>For the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor, as long as they could excavate a bit more of the Progenitor Ancestor's bloodline power within the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's beings, and achieve a slight overall enhancement, he would be very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>If the lower-level beings could excavate a bit more bloodline power, the number of mid-level experts would increase, and the number of high-level experts would then rise in succession, thus enhancing the overall national strength of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look," Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the improved path of the Martial Dao Evolution quickly appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>From the First Realm to the Eleventh Realm, and the various paths beyond the Twelfth Realm, Lin Yuan had organized them all very thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor carefully examined them.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" The Blazing Sun Ancient Nation's emperor became increasingly astonished as he looked.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

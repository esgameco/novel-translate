            <p>Chapter 209: The "Uncrowned King" of the Tianqing World (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Fog Mountains, the Tianqing Alliance Leader's blood surged, nearly causing him to go berserk on the spot.</p><p></p><p>His trusted subordinates, respected elders and teachers, close friends and brothers, and beloved confidants had all betrayed him at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was no fool. The moment everyone surrounded him, an incredibly unbelievable thought surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>That was, all these people had already betrayed him and pledged allegiance to that Demonic God's Incarnation.</p><p></p><p>But how could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention what price the Demonic God's Incarnation paid to buy off so many of his subordinates that he had cultivated for many years.</p><p></p><p>The key point was, when did this happen?</p><p></p><p>He was completely unaware of it until now?</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader felt a chill in his heart as he looked at the many powerful figures surrounding him not far away.</p><p></p><p>Just moments ago, these people were still respectful towards him, but now they were incredibly cold, without a trace of reluctance on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Do you, do you even know what you're doing?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader asked in a low voice, somewhat unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to ask was, why pledge allegiance to the Demonic God's Incarnation?</p><p></p><p>Following him and enjoying the daily worship of countless living beings in the Tianqing World, wasn't that infinitely better than following a Demonic God?</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's gaze especially fell on A Yan.</p><p></p><p>This was his beloved confidant. After repelling the Demonic God from outside the domain, the Tianqing Alliance Leader reigned supreme over the Tianqing World, and A Yan could also stand above all living beings in the world.</p><p></p><p>While there was a sliver of possibility for the others to betray him, why did A Yan betray him?</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader looked at A Yan with full expectation, but what he received in return was A Yan's cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, really?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader did not make a move to break out.</p><p></p><p>Because according to the current situation, with all his subordinates betraying him, and the mastermind behind all this, Lin Yuan, not making any moves yet.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was clear that relying on his own strength, the possibility of breaking out was slim.</p><p></p><p>Since they dared to confront him, they must have made full preparations.</p><p></p><p>Soâ€”</p><p></p><p>What the Tianqing Alliance Leader needed to do now.</p><p></p><p>Was to stall for time.</p><p></p><p>And then.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, on the battlefield where the Demonic God was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader had left the World Sword outside the world.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any counterattack from the Demonic God outside the domain.</p><p></p><p>Actually, this wasn't a problem.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianqing Alliance Leader racked his brains, he never thought.</p><p></p><p>For him, the biggest threat was not the Ancestral Demon Tree outside the world.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan, who was inside the world.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>No matter what predicament he faced.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader believed.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had the World Sword in hand, he could face any situation without fear.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword was a world weapon nurtured by the Tianqing World for countless tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The closer it was to the Tianqing World, the greater its power.</p><p></p><p>If he activated the World Sword within the world.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was confident that even the Ancestral Demon Tree at its peak.</p><p></p><p>Would not dare to directly confront him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would take back everything that belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>While the Tianqing Alliance Leader was stalling for time, how could Lin Yuan not know?</p><p></p><p>He had waited with great difficulty for the opportunity when the Tianqing Alliance Leader was separated from the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would not hold back.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Tianqing Alliance Leader looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly unleashed the "Demonic God's Gaze".</p><p></p><p>This technique originated from the Ancestral Demon Tree and had considerable power even in the hands of the Incarnation Demon Tree, let alone when used by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The terrifying soul fluctuations swept out and expanded.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader only felt his thoughts shaking, even his own consciousness began to slowly sink.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's expression changed greatly. He barely gathered his mind, bit the tip of his tongue, and used a forbidden technique to make himself sober.</p><p></p><p>Then he flew into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Through the brief confrontation just now.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader realized that staying behind to stall for time was even more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"The power of this move is not much inferior to that Demonic God from outside the domain. What kind of monster is this Demonic God's Incarnation?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's scalp exploded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he began to have self-doubts.</p><p></p><p>Did he really repel that Demonic God from outside the domain who possessed this kind of Incarnation Demon Tree?</p><p></p><p>It made no sense at all.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the strength of the mother body should far exceed that of the incarnation.</p><p></p><p>Now, from the strength of this Demonic God's Incarnation he was facing, it could be seen that its mother body should have the means to easily destroy the entire Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was the exact opposite.</p><p></p><p>That Demonic God mother body did not dare to show up when he destroyed the Demonic God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful Incarnation Demon Tree, why are you being so timid?</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's thoughts surged as he frantically rushed out of the Black Fog Mountains.</p><p></p><p>He had already begun to recall the World Sword. As long as he could hold on for a while longer, then...</p><p></p><p>Before the Tianqing Alliance Leader could finish his thought.</p><p></p><p>He saw the world turned upside down, and the power of space intertwined, forming a cage.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the techniques of the Demon Tree, it's still difficult to completely keep you here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed lightly. The vines swayed as he manipulated the power of space, shifting through the void and pulling the Tianqing Alliance Leader back in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ancestral Demon Tree at its peak wanted to kill the Tianqing Alliance Leader, it would still require some effort, and there was a possibility of him escaping.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to Lin Yuan's sigh, the Tianqing Alliance Leader was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly escaped some distance just now, so how did he come back?</p><p></p><p>"The power of space, the power of space can be used like this?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's mind trembled. At his level, he had naturally begun to comprehend the laws of space long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tianqing World had limited heritage, and the Tianqing Alliance Leader's comprehension of the laws of space had always been like a blind man touching an elephant.</p><p></p><p>For the Tianqing Alliance Leader, in his comprehension of the laws of space, there was no so-called foundation or core spatial model to use as a reference.</p><p></p><p>Everything could only rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>To give a simple example.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional reduction strike brought by Lin Yuan, who came from the extremely prosperous Human Civilization Alliance of the main world, to the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Without paying attention to the Tianqing Alliance Leader's shock, Lin Yuan's gaze shifted and looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>That was the direction where the Demonic God Battlefield used to be, but now, a vast aura was rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the World Sword?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had expected this long ago.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader had wielded the World Sword for four hundred years and definitely had an extraordinary connection with it.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword actively protecting its master when the Tianqing Alliance Leader faced a life-and-death crisis was perfectly normal and within Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"It's just... too late..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the Tianqing Alliance Leader had recalled the World Sword before entering the Black Fog Mountains, he might have been able to contend against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Even for the World Sword, it would take at least half an incense stick's time to fly from outside the Tianqing World to the Black Fog Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, the Alliance Leader of the Tianqing Alliance had already been kneaded and shaped by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also considered that the World Sword could traverse space, similar to a teleportation method, to approach the Black Fog Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had also prepared countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Although the World Sword was very powerful, it still needed its master to activate it.</p><p></p><p>Without an actively wielded World Sword, its power would greatly diminish, otherwise there would be no need for the Tianqing Alliance Leader to wield the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>Couldn't it directly fight against the Ancestral Demon Tree?</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was confident that he could stall the World Sword after its power had greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>"Begin parasitism."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, a gray and dull seed began to fall and enter the space cage.</p><p></p><p>And in the few breaths that passed, under Lin Yuan's casual attacks, the Tianqing Alliance Leader who had fallen into the space cage was already critically injured and on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's idea of parasitism, the Tianqing Alliance Leader would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah ah, this is parasitism? No, the parasitic methods of the foreign evil gods shouldn't be like this."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader let out a painful moan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many scenes flashed through his mind, his subordinate elders, beauties and others inexplicably betrayed him.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>In the end, a look of realization appeared on the face of the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that they did not betray him, but were controlled by this parasitic evil god?</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader's eyes revealed a look of relief, and in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader closed his eyes and stood up to bow to Lin Yuan, saying, "Greetings, Master."</p><p></p><p>The parasitism was successful.</p><p></p><p>For four hundred years, the Tianqing Alliance Leader had fought against the Ancestral Demon Tree, possessing the strength of the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>But most of that relied on the World Sword, as for the Tianqing Alliance Leader himself, he was still at the 7th stage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Lin Yuan, who had also reached the peak of the 7th stage and whose strength was not much weaker than the Ancestral Demon Tree, the Tianqing Alliance Leader naturally had no ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>In order to deal with this Tianqing Alliance Leader, Lin Yuan had made many arrangements and backup plans.</p><p></p><p>For example, he had prepared for the possibility of the Tianqing Alliance Leader breaking out of the space cage.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Tianqing Alliance Leader really did this, there were still more methods waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"Can you continue to control the World Sword?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>When communicating with his parasitic host, he could just ask directly.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader closed his eyes to sense for a moment, then nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared in Lin Yuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he went to such great lengths to control the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the fact that the Tianqing Alliance Leader himself had the strength of the strongest in the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it was the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword was born from the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, it was impossible for it to appear in the world, as it was closely related to the origin of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could obtain the World Sword and comprehend it with his heaven-defying comprehension, he might be able to understand the great secrets of the world's operation and destruction, and then integrate it into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of 8th stage and even 9th stage evolutionaries was basically focused on their inner world.</p><p></p><p>Constantly perfecting the inner world, allowing it to grow and become a true great world.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go and bring back the World Sword."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan ordered the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader got up and left.</p><p></p><p>More than half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader returned.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he had a stone longsword in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This longsword was entirely made of gray-white stone, but it vaguely emitted fluctuations of power that commanded the world.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the World Sword?"</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, the World Sword in the Tianqing Alliance Leader's hand flew in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps sensing something.</p><p></p><p>The World Sword began to struggle violently.</p><p></p><p>"If it were outside, you might have a chance to break free."</p><p></p><p>"But here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>He had been managing the Black Fog Mountain Range for one or two hundred years, and every inch of space was under his control. The World Sword had no chance of resisting.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind and consciousness briefly came into contact with the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Through the World Sword, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the vast origin of the Tianqing World, as well as the world consciousness that had already fallen into slumber.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not feel the slightest surprise. It was only natural for the world consciousness to fall into slumber.</p><p></p><p>Did you really think that using the World Sword did not require any price to be paid?</p><p></p><p>If that were really the case, why wouldn't the Tianqing World let the World Sword appear in the world?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the invasion of the Ancestral Demon Tree, which posed a destructive threat to the Tianqing World, it probably wouldn't have let the World Sword appear in the world either.</p><p></p><p>"The World Sword is the manifestation of the most essential core of the Tianqing World. Every time the World Sword is used, it is a shock to the consciousness of the Tianqing World."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, even if the world consciousness falls into slumber, the Tianqing World still has an almost instinctive defense against the outside world, but for the world within..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the world consciousness of the Tianqing World were in an awakened state, Lin Yuan's growth would definitely not have been so smooth.</p><p></p><p>This was also thanks to the Ancestral Demon Tree. If it weren't for this foreign evil god, the Tianqing Alliance Leader wouldn't have frequently activated the World Sword, eventually reaching a certain limit and causing the world consciousness to completely fall into slumber.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted and looked down at the Tianqing Alliance Leader, Deputy Alliance Leader, Protectors, Elders, Four Sacred Beast Kings, and Demon Beast Kings.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was only the behind-the-scenes controller of the Tianqing World before controlling the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>Then now, Lin Yuan was the true "Uncrowned King" of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than half a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Lin Yuan had the Tianqing Alliance Leader and the others return to Tianqing Mountain, the center of the Tianqing World, to receive the worship of all beings, according to the normal plan.</p><p></p><p>In addition, under Lin Yuan's secret promotion, the martial arts cultivation system officially became the most authoritative cultivation system in the Tianqing World, parallel to the original cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's influence, it could be foreseen that in a few hundred years, the cultivation system of the Tianqing World would be completely replaced by martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Fog Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind gathered at the root area.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the burning black flames.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It was also time to deal with the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was worried that if he waited any longer, it would make the Ancestral Demon Tree have the idea of forcibly "cutting flesh" to leave.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan's thoughts converged and he began to contact the Ancestral Demon Tree through the black flames.</p><p></p><p>The black flames were the hub between the Ancestral Demon Tree and Lin Yuan. The Ancestral Demon Tree could contact Lin Yuan through these flames.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could also contact in reverse.</p><p></p><p>Of course, originally a demon tree offshoot like Lin Yuan did not have the power to actively contact the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>But after the release of talents last time, the Ancestral Demon Tree simply allowed Lin Yuan to contact him at any time.</p><p></p><p>There was no other way.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan was his only seedling, the hope of descending into the Tianqing World to make up for all previous losses.</p>

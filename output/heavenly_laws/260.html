            <p>Chapter 260: Where is the Huai Dragon Palace? Give me a direction (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the Jiujiang Domain.</p><p></p><p>Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>As a Dao Convergence level power, the Huai Dragon Palace is not weaker than the Daode Immortal Sect at all. In fact, because it belongs to the water race dragon descendants, the Huai Dragon Palace's True Immortal level combat power is even slightly stronger than the Daode Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>Huai Dragon Hall.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of figures gathered here.</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace is not a human power, but is controlled by the water race dragon descendants. The entire Jiujiang Domain is basically the territory of the water race.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Palace Master has decided to launch a large-scale war against the Daode Immortal Sect again. That Heavenly Water Essence must belong to our Huai Dragon Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master is a middle-aged woman, whose true form is a True Dragon. Although her bloodline has not reached the True Spirit level, her combat power is so strong that she basically has no opponents within the Dao Convergence stage.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Water Essence is the supreme treasure of our dragon race. It has been occupied by that Daode Immortal Sect. This time we must take it back."</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, I also want to participate in this large-scale decisive battle and must kill several True Immortals of that Daode Immortal Sect."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't rely on the Profound King Hall, how can that Daode Immortal Sect be a match for our Huai Dragon Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The dozens of figures on the scene spoke one after another.</p><p></p><p>The so-called large-scale war means that the Huai Dragon Palace and the Daode Immortal Sect will fight with all their strength. The True Immortals on both sides will take the field, and the two major powers will not hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>Such a large-scale battle often does not happen for hundreds of thousands or even millions of years, because the cost is too great.</p><p></p><p>No matter which side wins, it will be a tragic victory. The Profound King Hall will not stand by and watch the Daode Immortal Sect fall. It will definitely intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Profound King Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Humph!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>In the past several large-scale wars, due to the intervention of the Profound King Hall, she has never been able to defeat the Daode Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The Huai Dragon Palace Master has passed the physical body tribulation, and her combat power has greatly increased. She doesn't take ordinary half-step Immortal Kings seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Before passing the physical body tribulation, she could be on par with half-step Immortal Kings by relying on her True Dragon bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Now that she has become a half-step Immortal King, it is estimated that three or four half-step Immortal Kings are needed to contend with her.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Huai Dragon Palace is determined to obtain that Heavenly Water Essence.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Water Essence has a significant effect on the dragon descendants' transformation into dragons.</p><p></p><p>If the Huai Dragon Palace can obtain that Heavenly Water Essence, their strength will rise to a higher level within ten thousand years at most.</p><p></p><p>It even has a certain beneficial effect for the Huai Dragon Palace Master to pass the mental tribulation.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Dao Convergence True Immortals, the chance of passing the mental tribulation is greater than passing the physical body tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Daode Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal sat on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>"What is this Huai Dragon Palace plotting again?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal frowned. He received intelligence from the battlefield that the True Immortal level forces of the Huai Dragon Palace had begun to gather towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be planning to launch another large-scale decisive battle?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal felt a bit of a headache. Even with the support of the Profound King Hall, facing the Huai Dragon Palace's repeated decisive battles, the Daode Immortal Sect had begun to be unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The Profound King Hall was the most powerful force in the Profound King Domain. The Daode Immortal Sect and another major power were known as the three giants of the Profound King Domain along with the Profound King Hall.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Water Essence..."</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal thought of the culprit that caused the endless war between the two major powers of the Daode Immortal Sect and the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Heavenly Water Essence was not of much use to human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was useless, it absolutely could not be handed over to the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal could imagine that once the Huai Dragon Palace obtained the Heavenly Water Essence, its strength would greatly increase within ten thousand years, directly surpassing the Profound King Domain and becoming the most powerful force in the surrounding dozens of large domains.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Daode Immortal Sect would no longer have the ability to resist the Huai Dragon Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Water Essence is rooted in the earth veins and cannot be moved or destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal sighed lightly. Even if he used treasures to forcibly shatter the Heavenly Water Essence, as long as the earth veins remained, a new Heavenly Water Essence would be born within a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"For the Huai Dragon Palace to dare to launch a large-scale decisive battle this time, it must have a new trump card. Has that Huai Dragon Palace Master passed the physical body tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal speculated.</p><p></p><p>The Daode Immortal Sect and the Huai Dragon Palace had been at war for hundreds of thousands of years and were very familiar with the latter. The last time the Huai Dragon Palace Master fought with Cangqing Immortal, the physical body strength she displayed was not far from passing the physical body tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"A True Dragon that has passed the physical body tribulation... I really can't deal with it. Forget it, I'd better ask the Profound King Hall for their opinion."</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal was not stupid and naturally would not take on the pressure of blocking the Huai Dragon Palace alone.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal, who had contacted the Profound King Hall, frowned again.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound King Hall Master is in seclusion and cannot take action in a short time?"</p><p></p><p>"Then how do I deal with that evil dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"I still need to contact the Dao Convergence level forces of other large domains."</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal's thoughts converged as he looked at another piece of news.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>"That little guy Jun Wuji is back?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting for Jun Wuji for so long. Originally, he thought that Jun Wuji would be able to ascend to the Spirit Realm in a few thousand years at most, but hundreds of thousands of years had passed without much movement.</p><p></p><p>But Cangqing Immortal did not break his promise because of this. After all, he had made a Dao oath.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not impossible to break a Dao oath, it also required paying a huge price. For the sake of such a small promise, making Cangqing Immortal break his Dao oath would definitely be a losing deal.</p><p></p><p>"That little guy is still alive after hundreds of thousands of years. He should at least be at the peak of the Dao Convergence stage? Maybe even a half-step Immortal King?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear about Lin Yuan's talent. Being able to forcibly enter the Dao Convergence stage in a place like the lower realm, he could at least be called an Immortal King seed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even for an Immortal King seed, it was extremely difficult to step into the Immortal King realm. It was just said to be hopeful. No matter how highly Cangqing Immortal regarded Lin Yuan, he did not think that the other party was a Tribulation Transcending Immortal King now.</p><p></p><p>From the Dao Convergence stage to the Tribulation Transcending stage, it was like a heavenly chasm. Cangqing Immortal had a deep understanding of this. Although he had passed the mental tribulation and was ranked as a half-step Immortal King, he basically knew in his heart that he had no possibility of becoming an Immortal King in this life.</p><p></p><p>At most, before his lifespan reached its limit, Cangqing Immortal would try to pass the physical body tribulation. Even if he failed, it was within expectations.</p><p></p><p>"However, if this little guy has already stepped into the half-step Immortal King realm, he can indeed alleviate some of the pressure from the Huai Dragon Palace this time?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he negotiated with Lin Yuan, he agreed that martial arts could be spread in the lower realm, and martial arts cultivators who reached the sixth level could use the ascension platform to ascend to the Spirit Realm and be provided with protection.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan would help the Daode Immortal Sect once in the future to the best of his ability.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan could choose to refuse. Cangqing Immortal was quite lenient in this regard, after all, he had not paid much.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't gone out for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll go see that little guy from back then."</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal slowly stood up, and his figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>As for the large-scale decisive battle that the Huai Dragon Palace wanted to launch, such a level of battlefield required a lot of preparation time, and it would not start for at least ten years.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal's figure appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"Lifting the martial arts restriction?"</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal glanced at what had happened in Xiaoyao City recently and had a general idea.</p><p></p><p>Cangqing Immortal walked step by step towards the depths of the Martial Temple. Around him...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A hazy, illusory field permeated the area, as if it were a half-step Immortal King who had passed the spiritual tribulation.</p><p></p><p>If the Cangqing Immortal was willing, even someone like Li Qing, who was at the peak of the seventh stage of the martial dao, would find it difficult to detect his presence.</p><p></p><p>After passing the spiritual tribulation, the Cangqing Immortal's soul had been greatly elevated, and he could easily conceal and twist others' perceptions.</p><p></p><p>"There doesn't seem to be any change."</p><p></p><p>"Has that little fellow really come back?"</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal arrived at the main hall of the Martial Temple and casually swept his gaze, not discovering anything.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Cangqing Immortal was wondering whether to reveal himself and inquire with Li Qing.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding void became illusory.</p><p></p><p>The scene began to unfold layer by layer, and the Cangqing Immortal reappeared outside Xiaoyao City, as if everything he had just experienced was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"This?!"</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal's pupils constricted, and his heart was stirred up like a raging sea.</p><p></p><p>An illusion?</p><p></p><p>He, a dignified half-step Immortal King who had passed the spiritual tribulation, had actually fallen into an illusion without a sound?</p><p></p><p>Although in terms of combat power, a half-step Immortal King who had passed the spiritual tribulation was not as good as a half-step Immortal King who had passed the physical tribulation.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of mastery of the soul's illusions, a half-step Immortal King who had passed the physical tribulation could not even compare to a half-step Immortal King who had passed the spiritual tribulation.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Cangqing Immortal had actually experienced an illusion without a sound. If it weren't for the other party intentionally dispersing the illusion, the Cangqing Immortal would probably still be immersed in the illusion now.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of illusion is this."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal's mind trembled. To be able to freely manipulate the soul's illusions and toy with a half-step Immortal King like him.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal already had some guesses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Cangqing Immortal did not use any means and just walked on the street like this, finally arriving at the door of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal hesitated for a moment, and then said to the guard, "My name is Cangqing, I'm here to visit Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>The guard seemed to have received orders early on and brought the Cangqing Immortal to stop in front of the main hall of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal paused for a moment, and finally still walked into the main hall of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the main hall of the Martial Temple was no different from the main hall of the Martial Temple that the Cangqing Immortal had experienced before.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that a figure was sitting in the main seat.</p><p></p><p>The figure was a young man. Although he was just sitting there, the Cangqing Immortal had the illusion of directly facing the vast spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>"Long time no see." Lin Yuan looked at the Cangqing Immortal and smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You... are you really Jun Wuji?" The Cangqing Immortal was stunned for a moment. If just now, he only guessed that there was a Tribulation Immortal King in the Martial Temple, and only a lofty Immortal King could make him fall into an illusion without knowing it.</p><p></p><p>Then now, the moment he saw Lin Yuan, the Cangqing Immortal could almost confirm his previous guess, and this Tribulation Immortal King was none other than that little fellow from back then—</p><p></p><p>Jun Wuji.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded with a smile. Although he had changed his physical body, his true spirit and consciousness were the same, which was similar to the reincarnation of a Dao Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Jun Wuji..." The Cangqing Immortal was shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had long believed that Jun Wuji was a genius at the level of an Immortal King seed.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, facing Jun Wuji who had truly become an Immortal King, the Cangqing Immortal's heart was still surging with waves.</p><p></p><p>Immortal King!</p><p></p><p>This was a Tribulation Immortal King!</p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal King seed who had the hope of becoming an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>Was only hopeful of becoming one. Out of a dozen or so Immortal King seeds, perhaps only one could become an Immortal King, right?</p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>"Don't keep standing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Later, when he found that the Cangqing Immortal was planning to sneak into the Martial Temple without a sound, Lin Yuan casually dragged him into an illusion.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered as a greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'll just stand."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal immediately reacted and didn't dare to sit down.</p><p></p><p>What a joke?</p><p></p><p>To sit together with a Tribulation Immortal King?</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal was very clear about his own identity. He was not Lin Yuan's junior, nor did he have any great favors towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The only right thing he had done was to keep his promise all these years, but that was what he should have done.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Cangqing Immortal was extremely grateful that after Jun Dongjin and the others had ascended to the spiritual realm for several thousand years, some people in the immortal sect had put forward opposing voices, hoping to stop the resource tilt towards Jun Dongjin's family.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Cangqing Immortal directly rejected it.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the resource tilt given to Jun Dongjin's family was equivalent to a drop in the bucket for the Moral Immortal Sect back then. Those short-sighted people in the sect cared about these things, but the Cangqing Immortal did not.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Cangqing Immortal was still looking forward to Jun Wuji ascending to the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Later, as time passed and after the Cangqing Immortal's ruthless rejection, the other people in the sect didn't dare to bring up this matter.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well these years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. At least he hadn't mistreated the Jun family and had protected the martial cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"It's what I should do, what I should do."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>Through Lin Yuan's words, he realized that the other party knew about everything he had done over the years.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the Cangqing Immortal became even more fearful in his heart. If he had done something slightly wrong back then, what he would be facing now would probably be the fury of a Tribulation Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>That was something that the entire Xuanwang Domain, and even the Dongyun Continent, could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"What do you want me to help with."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>As part of the negotiation conditions back then, within his power, he needed to help with a favor.</p><p></p><p>"Help with what?"</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal's spirit trembled abruptly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, the Cangqing Immortal wanted to ask Lin Yuan to help him pass the physical tribulation.</p><p></p><p>But this thought had just emerged and was immediately cast aside by the Cangqing Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the spiritual tribulation or the physical tribulation, external forces had almost no effect, and one could only rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why were Tribulation Immortal Kings so rare in the spiritual realm? Not to mention anything else, the descendants and friends of those Tribulation Immortal Kings should have been able to step into the tribulation stage.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be concluded that even Immortal Kings found it very difficult to interfere with the physical tribulation and spiritual tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could intervene, they would pay a terrible price, which did not conform to the "within one's power" that he had promised back then.</p><p></p><p>"I hope..."</p><p></p><p>Countless changes flashed through the Cangqing Immortal's mind. In his life, apart from himself, what he cared about the most was the Moral Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>And currently, the biggest crisis facing the Moral Immortal Sect was that Huailong Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal couldn't think of any way to deal with that Huailong Palace Master who had passed the physical tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that Martial Ancestor can step forward to resolve the Huailong Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal calmed himself and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Huailong Palace..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. Even if the Cangqing Immortal didn't say it, he wouldn't let the Huailong Palace off.</p><p></p><p>According to Li Qing, it was a powerful expert from the Huailong Palace who had heavily injured Jun Dongjin back then, causing him to fail in his breakthrough later on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and walked out of the main hall of the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor, the Huailong Palace belongs to the water clan's dragon descendants, and the Palace Master is of true dragon bloodline. He should have passed the physical tribulation by now."</p><p></p><p>"Also, it's said that the Jiujiang Domain is related to a Tribulation Dragon King."</p><p></p><p>The Cangqing Immortal quickly introduced the strength of the Huailong Palace to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But halfway through.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>He directly said:</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Huailong Palace, give me a direction."</p>

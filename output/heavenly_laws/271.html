        <h1>Chapter 271</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The group of supreme celestial kings fell silent. </p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor...the Martial Ancestor has ascended to the ninth heavenly realm?" After a long while, the Primordial Celestial King's voice trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As supreme celestial kings, even those born in the Three Thousand Realms era who commanded the universe, they had long lost any sense of shock. </p><p></p><p>But in recent centuries, due to the emergence of the Martial Ancestor, he had repeatedly refreshed the understanding of these supreme celestial kings.</p><p></p><p>Now he had even ascended to the ninth heavenly realm, achieving the ultimate goal that every celestial king of every era had strived for.</p><p></p><p>"He should have ascended." The Primordial Celestial King took a deep breath. "After the tenth level, it's the ninth heavenly realm. The Martial Ancestor is now in the ninth heavenly realm."</p><p></p><p>The celestial kings on the scene exchanged glances with each other, lost in thought. </p><p></p><p>Although ascending to the ninth heavenly realm had nothing to do with them, everyone felt a strange sense of participation in witnessing the Martial Ancestor's ascension.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what's in the ninth heavenly realm? Is it filled with wonders and strange sights like the previous eight realms?"</p><p></p><p>"Unclear, but it's said there are 'Celestials' in the ninth realm. I don't know if the Martial Ancestor has encountered them?"  </p><p></p><p>"We've witnessed a historic event in the spiritual realm's history. This life was not in vain."</p><p></p><p>The supreme celestial kings discussed among themselves. In the past, based on the different eras they were from, they were divided into the prehistoric era celestial king camp and the Three Thousand Realms era celestial king camp.</p><p></p><p>But now, all the supreme celestial kings cast aside their factional divisions. In the face of the great event of the Martial Ancestor's ascension to the ninth realm, as long as they were beings of the spiritual realm, there was no difference between them.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth heavenly realm...it seems no successor will be able to ascend there again."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Celestial King gazed towards the entrance to the ninth realm and sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme celestial kings felt moved upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ascending to the ninth heavenly realm was the goal of every powerful being in the spiritual realm. In the immensely distant past eras that none of the celestial kings present knew about, it's possible that some powerful figure had ascended to the ninth realm before.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Dragon Ancestor ranked seventh in the life imprint records had mysteriously vanished, perhaps entering the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Phoenix Ancestor and others too.</p><p></p><p>The more ancient the era, the fewer life imprints were engraved in the spiritual realm's heavens and earth, resulting in the ten most powerful beings whose life imprints guarded the entrance to the ninth realm being relatively weaker in strength.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of passing through was also lower as a result.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just the Chaos Celestial King's speculation.</p><p></p><p>He did not know for certain whether the vanished Dragon Ancestor and Phoenix Ancestor had truly ascended to the ninth heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>But at least there was that possibility, that hope.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Celestial King was certain.</p><p></p><p>Successors would absolutely have no chance, no hope of ascending to the ninth heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>With the Martial Ancestor's existence, with his life imprint guarding the tenth level, the Chaos Celestial King could not imagine the cruel blow it would be to those supreme celestial kings of later eras who took the ninth realm as their goal.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Martial Ancestor's strength and the last nine of the ten most powerful beings guarding the first nine levels was like a complete disjunct.</p><p></p><p>Even if the last nine beings combined their power and increased it tenfold or a hundredfold, they would likely be struck down by the Martial Ancestor in one or a few blows.</p><p></p><p>Imagine a shockingly talented supreme celestial king-level expert from a later era, having comprehended all the higher laws and ordinary laws, invincible for dozens of eras.</p><p></p><p>Then full of confidence, they attempt to break through to the ninth realm. After brutal battles, defeating the opponents level by level, they finally reach the tenth level, only to be slapped to death by the Martial Ancestor's life imprint. How utterly despairing that would be.</p><p></p><p>From the first to the ninth level, the difficulty of defeating the opponents slowly increased, rated one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.</p><p></p><p>Then at the tenth level, the difficulty suddenly spiked to ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>So in the view of the Chaos Celestial King and other supreme celestial kings, the matter of ascending to the ninth realm was estimated to be a case of 'no more successors.'</p><p></p><p>For countless eras to come, the strongest beings of the spiritual realm's many eras would all be overshadowed by the Martial Ancestor's terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>In the ninth heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood atop the solitary mountain peak, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"This ninth realm has no life at all. Could it be that I am the so-called 'Celestial'?" Lin Yuan's expression was somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>The rumors said the 'Celestial' in the ninth realm overlooked the spiritual realm, eternally undying. And if Lin Yuan wanted to, it seemed he could achieve that.</p><p></p><p>Even with a time limit on his stay, with Lin Yuan's current fleshly body strength, he could indeed become eternally undying.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Lin Yuan's fleshly body was not an ordinary martial dao eighth level ultimate body. After being imbued by the mysterious gourd, Lin Yuan's body was enhanced thirteenfold.</p><p></p><p>"However, the mysterious aura here is indeed much denser, highly beneficial for comprehending the laws."</p><p></p><p>After sensing it carefully for a while, Lin Yuan came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The ninth heavenly realm lacked the many wonders and strange sights of the previous eight realms. There was only an endless expanse of roiling clouds and the mysterious aura permeating the void.  </p><p></p><p>This mysterious aura also existed in the eighth realm, but was much thinner compared to the ninth. According to Lin Yuan's 'testing', the aura allowed one to perceive the essence of the various laws more clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Stone..." Lin Yuan looked at the mountain peak under his feet, which was remarkably similar to the precious stone he obtained from the Chaos Celestial King.</p><p></p><p>It contained the aura of the Primordial Force transcending the higher laws.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan called these stones 'Primordial Stones'.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his head, gazing towards the highest point above the ninth heavenly realm.</p><p></p><p>There, at the absolute highest point in every sense, a corner of an immense world far vaster than the countless spiritual realms was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So this is the legendary Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was contemplative. Legends of the Immortal Realm had always existed in the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>That was the true higher plane, the dwelling place of the Dao Ancestors.  </p><p></p><p>The so-called Dao Ancestors were the ancestors of the immortal dao, the source of the immortal cultivation system. To use the terminology of the main world, they would be the ultimate of an evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they were supreme existences.</p><p></p><p>Even back in the Earthly Realm, Lin Yuan had vaguely sensed the terrifying nature of the immortal cultivation system, almost no weaker than the nine supreme evolutionary paths of the main world.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Lin Yuan speculated that perhaps the immortal cultivation system already had an ultimate existence, and the rise of the immortal dao in the Earthly Realm was possibly that ultimate's will.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that Lin Yuan did not spread the immortal cultivation system in the main world.</p><p></p><p>For an ultimate supreme existence, they could clearly sense every life cultivating their cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual realm, and even the space-time the Immortal Realm was in, did not exist in the same dimensional plane as the main world.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful a supreme existence was, they could not transcend different dimensional planes to descend into another space-time.</p><p></p><p>But if there was a 'dao mark', it would be different - equivalent to a compass in the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>And lives cultivating the immortal dao served as that dao mark for the Immortal Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Spreading the immortal cultivation system in the main world would not only increase the chances of that Immortal Dao Ancestor descending there, but also...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The formless profundity of the Ancestral Tao had a chance to lock onto the space-time coordinates of the main world. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally would not do something with such great hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was another downside to doing this - if he could sense the ultimate existence of the immortal cultivation system, the strongest beings of the human civilization in the main world could also sense it.</p><p></p><p>At that time, how would Lin Yuan explain this to the strongest of the human civilization? </p><p></p><p>Spreading the path of martial arts evolution was because the path was established by Lin Yuan himself, and there had never been an ultimate stage.</p><p></p><p>The first world Lin Yuan traversed to was the place where he gained the initial inspiration for the martial arts evolution system. The subsequent continuation of martial arts took its own path.</p><p></p><p>"Since this immortal realm can give birth to an ultimate existence like the Ancestral Tao, it can't be much weaker than the main world. Even if there is a higher or lower level, they are probably on the same tier."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, his gaze still fixed on the corner of the immortal realm at the highest point of space.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time Lin Yuan had seen the 'Immortal Realm'.  </p><p></p><p>The first time was before his traversal, when he probed the Gate of All Realms with a strand of his spiritual sense, observing the Spirit Realm from the perspective of the Gate while also noticing the vast world above the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The second time was now.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few hundred years, Lin Yuan's cultivation had reached a great level, even tearing through the space of the Spirit Realm to enter the chaotic vortex outside the world.  </p><p></p><p>But he had not sensed the aura of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the location of the Immortal Realm was in a different spatial layer from the Spirit Realm, and only by ascending to the Ninth Heaven could one perceive the specific direction of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan could also sense the Immortal Realm from the perspective of the Gate of All Realms, solely because the essence of the Gate was too profound.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of the Gate of All Realms, no matter how many spatial layers separated the Immortal Realm and Spirit Realm, the Immortal Realm could not hide.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the vast world at the highest point of space.</p><p></p><p>At this moment -</p><p></p><p>The majestic and magnificent Gate of All Realms deep in Lin Yuan's consciousness suddenly began to glow.</p><p></p><p>It seemed an invisible ripple instantly spread towards the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>A moment later...</p><p></p><p>A stream of information was transmitted from the Gate of All Realms.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm...the world coordinates of the Immortal Realm." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Heaven of the Spirit Realm was in the same spatial layer as the Immortal Realm. This was precisely why he could see a corner of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, by observing the Immortal Realm from the Ninth Heaven, one could basically deduce the 'coordinates' of where the Immortal Realm was located.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had known long ago in the Divine Land that the Gate of All Realms could replicate a world's coordinates, when he replicated the Spirit Realm's coordinates through the Ascension Platform.</p><p></p><p>Now, being so close to the Immortal Realm, locking onto its coordinates was not a strange thing.</p><p></p><p>"If I fly upwards from the Ninth Heaven, I will eventually be able to approach the Immortal Realm, or even enter it," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he broke through the space of the Spirit Realm to the outside, there was basically no possibility of approaching the Immortal Realm, because the spatial layer the Spirit Realm was in was simply not on the same level as the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the area of the Ninth Heaven was in the same spatial layer as the Immortal Realm. By continuously flying towards the target, he could gradually get closer to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, there's not enough time left."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it and gave up on the idea of entering the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>First, he only had a little over ten years left in his residency time.  </p><p></p><p>Even if he flew upwards along the Ninth Heaven, he would probably have to return to the main world midway.</p><p></p><p>Second, since he now had the world coordinates of the Immortal Realm, whether to descend into the Immortal Realm and when was completely up to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"For the next ten or so years, I'll just cultivate in the Ninth Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the boundless, rolling sea of clouds below, having made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The dense mystical aura of the Ninth Heaven was very conducive to comprehending the Dao of Creation. Although Lin Yuan's comprehension was inversely transcendent, he would not reject this assistance.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, seventeen years went by.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Lin Chang (Lin Yuan)]</p><p>[Identity: Master of the Gate of All Realms] </p><p>[Bound Talent: Inverse Transcendence]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Rebirth from a Drop of Blood]</p><p>[Divine Ability: Strengthening]</p><p>[Current State: Descending Consciousness]</p><p>[Remaining Residency Time: One Day]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and glanced at the illusory text below his vision.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood up and looked down at the boundless sea of clouds below.</p><p></p><p>For most of the last decade or so, Lin Yuan had spent his time comprehending the Dao of Creation. His comprehension of the Tai Chi Force had reached the third level.  </p><p></p><p>Additionally, he had also comprehended seven other higher-level Daos of Creation to the second level.</p><p></p><p>It was said that for the supreme immortal kings of the Spirit Realm, making further progress in the Daos of Creation could take tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to achieve such accomplishments in just a decade or so, apart from his inversely transcendent comprehension being the main reason, the environment of the Ninth Heaven also played no small part.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, there's the matter of how to deal with this fleshly body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative. This fleshly body had been tempered by him for nearly a thousand years - it was fair to say it was the crystallization of his blood and effort.</p><p></p><p>However, once Lin Yuan returned, with his consciousness going back to the main world, he would be unable to directly bring this body back.</p><p></p><p>That would be quite a waste.</p><p></p><p>"Oh well, consider it a gift to you then."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, a bell-shaped treasure about the size of a palm appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>It was a Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>Not long after summoning the mysterious return to the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan had also summoned this Primordial Golden Essence and nurtured it within his body.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Golden Essence had terrifying growth potential, but the prerequisite was that it needed to be continuously nurtured.  </p><p></p><p>In the main world, Lin Yuan's strength improved too quickly, so he simply didn't have time to nurture the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, on his sixth and eighth traversals, Lin Yuan had brought the Primordial Golden Essence to the traversed worlds to nurture it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he only needed to expend a strand of World-Crossing Origin Force, which Lin Yuan could afford.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Golden Essence hovered before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time...</p><p></p><p>The strand of power that transcended the higher Daos of Creation, the Primordial Force, began circulating through Lin Yuan's limbs and body.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Primordial Force was the most original and primordial power, possessing the ability to transform everything into the most original and primordial vital energy.</p><p></p><p>It could return to the source.</p><p></p><p>Currently, as the Primordial Force circulated, it transformed Lin Yuan's physical body and blood essence into the most primordial energy.</p><p></p><p>This energy then poured into the Primordial Golden Essence, continuously enhancing its fundamental profundity.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could not directly bring his fleshly body back to the main world, but he could transform it into nourishment to elevate the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>At that time, by bringing back the greatly enhanced Primordial Golden Essence to the main world, he wouldn't have lost too much.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish...</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's fleshly body was continuously transformed into the most primordial vital energy and merged into the Primordial Golden Essence, the bell-shaped treasure emanated an awe-inspiring fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>After half a day...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fleshly body had completely merged into the Primordial Golden Essence, and the world within his body had also shattered into the most primordial source power, fusing with the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after...</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Golden Essence, the mysterious gourd, and Lin Yuan's consciousness all poured into the Gate of All Realms, returning to the main world.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 584</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the universe within the Taiji Primordial Spirit was too great, making him somewhat unsure.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it definitely surpassed the universe within his true body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wanted to know what level the universe within the Taiji Primordial Spirit was currently at.</p><p></p><p>But to compare with an opponent? With the strength of Lin Yuan's Taiji Primordial Spirit's universe, an ordinary Chaos Sovereign would probably not even be able to withstand a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Since the master wants to try again, then let's try again."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child did not stop him, in the strict sense, Lin Yuan was her master, and she had to obey any decision he made.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please look."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child flipped her hand, and that several-meter-large Eternal Primal Gold appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, begin."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not in this internal universe, let's try in my Primordial Spirit's internal universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit created by a 13th-tier time life, the red-robed girl child also knew that Lin Yuan had cultivated two great Primordial Spirits.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the two great Primordial Spirits were far weaker than Lin Yuan's true body, and the internal universes were the same.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wanted to try the Eternal Primal Gold in the internal universe of his Primordial Spirit, he probably wouldn't even leave a 10-centimeter trace.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Although the red-robed girl child was puzzled, she did not raise any objections, she just muttered to herself in her heart, "Could it be that the master wants to test how weak the internal universe of the Primordial Spirit is?"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought the red-robed girl child and that Eternal Primal Gold to the internal universe of the Taiji Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was originally a bit indifferent, but immediately realized that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Why was the internal universe of the master's Primordial Spirit so stable, giving the red-robed girl child a sense of oppression that was far beyond the internal universe of the true body.</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't cultivated the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' after all."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child immediately observed carefully. If the internal universe had cultivated the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', she could have seen the difference in the basic structure of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"I'll start now." Lin Yuan looked at the Eternal Primal Gold floating in the distance and began to mobilize the primal power of the universe to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Endless primal power of the universe gathered, and in the center of the universe, that constantly burning sun also began to become scorching hot, and a terrifying aura began to permeate and spread.</p><p></p><p>After fusing and devouring the source of the sun, the Taiji Universe, with the source of the sun as the core, was still based on the Yin, Yang, and Taiji.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, under the full operation of the Taiji Universe, it was basically equivalent to the 'Sun Opening the Heavens' divine ability being driven without load, and the power was far beyond that, equivalent to the Taiji Universe combined with the 'Sun Opening the Heavens' version.</p><p></p><p>Humming! All the forces from every part of the Taiji Universe were suppressing that Eternal Primal Gold.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Primal Gold began to visibly deform and twist, and terrifying traces appeared on its surface, spreading to the depths, forming deep pits one after another.</p><p></p><p>Each deep pit was over a meter deep, and the deepest pit was close to two meters.</p><p></p><p>The entire Eternal Primal Gold had become uneven and slightly "miserable" in appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It's too hard."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not sure how strong the Taiji Primordial Spirit's internal universe was now.</p><p></p><p>But under the full force of suppression just now, even dozens or hundreds of peak Chaos Sovereign experts would be annihilated without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>But this Eternal Primal Gold? It only became a little uneven on the surface? "The deepest trace is over a meter, close to two meters."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Eternal Primal Gold, then looked at the red-robed girl child, "How is this universe? What level is it equivalent to?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child fell silent.</p><p></p><p>She had realized something was wrong as soon as she entered this universe, and immediately felt the terrifying power unleashed by Lin Yuan's full operation of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Eternal Primal Gold quickly deformed and twisted.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why is the power of your Primordial Spirit's internal universe so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child took a deep breath, then looked at Lin Yuan with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>If she wasn't sure that this internal universe came from Lin Yuan, and the aura and imprint were connected, the red-robed girl child would even suspect that this was the internal universe of another powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>It was too exaggerated.</p><p>Too abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible? This universe has not cultivated the second layer of the 'Infinite Void', it is still at the first layer, why is it so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was full of confusion, the scene in front of her was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"I made some improvements to the internal universe." Lin Yuan thought for a moment and did not tell the red-robed girl child about the 'Sun Opening the Heavens'.</p><p></p><p>After all, this involved another dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan had already concealed the existence of the scorching sun in the center of the universe before bringing the red-robed girl child over, and when he was fully operating the internal universe, he also deliberately suppressed the power of the sun.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe was Lin Yuan's home field, as long as Lin Yuan was unwilling, even the red-robed girl child could not see through much.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the red-robed girl child was able to perceive whether Lin Yuan was cultivating the second layer of the 'Infinite Void' because Lin Yuan actively showed it to her.</p><p></p><p>"Improved?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child was amazed, the internal universe after cultivating the 'Infinite Void' was already perfect to the limit at the microscopic level, and it could still be improved?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the mighty power of this inner cosmic universe, the girl in red would never have believed in the terrifying enhancement. </p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded. "Now, what level has my inner cosmic universe reached?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the girl in red expectantly.</p><p></p><p>The girl in red had previously mentioned that leaving a half-meter mark on the Eternal Primal Gold would mean that the inner cosmic universe was nearing the completion of the second layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan's inner cosmic universe would be the strongest below the Chaotic Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had left a mark nearly two meters deep.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this inner cosmic universe should be able to rival the Chaotic Sage Realm," the girl in red said.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Sage Realm was the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Lin Yuan's Taiji Primal Spirit's inner cosmic universe had now reached the level of a Chaotic Sage's inner cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>"My Primal Spirit's inner cosmic universe has a weaker foundation and essence compared to my true body's inner cosmic universe. If I were to apply the perfection techniques to my true body's inner cosmic universe, wouldn't it be even stronger than an ordinary Chaotic Sage's?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, having a stronger inner cosmic universe does not necessarily mean having stronger combat power than a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>A Chaotic Sage's strength and combat power depend on many factors, with the inner cosmic universe being just one aspect.</p><p></p><p>But nonetheless, Lin Yuan could now, to a certain extent, contend with a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>Contending does not mean being on par or equal, but being able to exchange a few moves. After all, the gap between a Chaotic Sage and a Chaotic Sovereign is immense, and the aftershock of a Chaotic Sage's casual strike could severely injure a Chaotic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan being able to contend with a Chaotic Sage and exchange a few moves means he could be considered invincible even against a Chaotic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>And this is just the beginning, as Lin Yuan still has many untapped techniques, such as the second layer of the "Infinite Void" that he has yet to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan reaches the pinnacle in all aspects, he could truly confront a Sage.</p><p></p><p>As a Sovereign, to clash head-on with a Chaotic Sage.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Source World, the core imperial clans with the most potent Vermilion Sun Ancestor bloodline could only contend at the Sovereign Realm against Sages.</p><p></p><p>To have a Sovereign directly clash with a Sage would require either a Thirteen Realms Embodiment or the aid of other external forces, otherwise, it would be mere fantasy.</p><p></p><p>The same applies to this Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, even if one were to obtain the "Infinite Void" Thirteen Realms Inheritance, the most they could do is contend with Sovereigns and Sages at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if one were to gather all the Thirteen Realms Inheritances representing the physical body, soul, and so on, they could at most contend with the peak Sovereign Realm, but to reach the Sage Realm would require crossing into the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>There is no essential difference from the core imperial clans of the Source World.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of foundations in all aspects has created this monstrous prodigy.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your future may have the hope of reaching the level of the previous master," the girl in red said with a slightly complex tone.</p><p></p><p>In truth, the creator of the "Infinite Void" had left behind the Thirteen Realms Inheritances representing the foundation, essence, and physical body, but it was merely a casual act, without the intention of cultivating a Thirteen Realms being.</p><p></p><p>A Thirteen Realms lifespan is not something that can be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, a Thirteen Realms life cannot be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lin Yuan has given the girl in red the illusion that he may have the hope of breaking through to the Thirteen Realms in the future.</p><p></p><p>"It's too far away," Lin Yuan shook his head. The deeper he cultivated, the more he could feel the difficulty of crossing into the Thirteen Realms.</p><p></p><p>Even if everything went smoothly, and he reached the Chaotic Sage Realm, how would he then face the time cycle and confirm the level of his Taiji Primal Spirit's inner cosmic universe?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then continued to re-attempt on his two Primal Spirits, as for his true body, he would not rush it until the inner cosmic universes of the two Primal Spirits had solidified the Vermilion Sun Source without a hitch.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, the war between the Cyan Burning Domain and the Purple Dream Domain was still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>On the Tier 13 Defense Line Battlefield, after the routine exchange of blows with the Grand Sage Lin Yuan, they each retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan looked towards the core defense line battlefield, where more than ten peak Sages were engaged in a fierce battle, with various Chaotic evolutionary power paths colliding, causing the space-time to distort and collapse.</p><p></p><p>"These peak Sages are all going all-out," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In a war involving dozens of major domains, if it were ordinary Sages and veteran Sages, there might still be a possibility of holding back.</p><p></p><p>But peak Sages? </p><p></p><p>If peak Sages did not wish to participate in the battle, they could simply refuse. Since they had come, they must have been given an irrefutable promise by the two Imperial Clans.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the peak Sages could potentially fight with their full strength, as each of them desired to win the war.</p><p></p><p>Only by winning could the Imperial Clan's promise be fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>If they failed, even if there was a "safety net" reward, it would be far inferior to winning the war.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

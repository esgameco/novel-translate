        <h1>Chapter 551</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just ten months' time.</p><p></p><p>The "Fragment World" of Star Tears had been completely transformed from top to bottom.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of high-tech buildings rose into the sky, and the virtual world network was fully laid out.</p><p></p><p>Everything went very smoothly during this period.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, internal trade within human civilization was re-established, and even additional trade channels with the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent were opened up.</p><p></p><p>Countless human citizens in the new homeland felt that, except for not being able to see the starry sky, everything else was no different from life in the universe.</p><p></p><p>It was even better and more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"This is the house assigned to me to live in, it's so spacious, and it's all free?"</p><p></p><p>"In the new homeland, the government uniformly allocates housing, jobs, medical care and education. This is too awesome."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I originally thought that migrating to another homeland would involve pioneering and living very hard lives."</p><p></p><p>The citizens who settled in Star Tears' "Fragment World" adapted very quickly, mainly because the welfare benefits not only didn't decrease, but actually improved.</p><p></p><p>More importantly -</p><p></p><p>"My son was born with evolutionary talent. He will become an evolver in the future."</p><p></p><p>"My daughter too."</p><p></p><p>"Are all of yours like that? My grandson tested for quite good evolutionary talent."</p><p></p><p>Star Tears' "Fragment World" was permeated with gentle Star Tears energy, which was extremely beneficial for the nurturing of life,</p><p>including but not limited to enhancing the potential of newborns in various aspects, as well as extending lifespan and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, a large number of citizens were needed to produce one evolver, but here, as long as a newborn was born in this "Fragment World", they basically all had some degree of evolutionary talent.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of a large number of basic evolvers would increase the probability of intermediate and advanced evolvers being born,</p><p>thus forming a virtuous cycle, and the development speed of human civilization would far exceed that within the universe.</p><p></p><p>In the newly established stronghold of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was discussing with nine supreme beings how to deal with those alien races who had thoroughly pledged allegiance to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Under the great destruction of the universe, many alien races who had not been selected by their own Tier 12 beings to be taken into internal universes, chose to completely sell themselves to human civilization, just to be able to survive.</p><p></p><p>"These alien races have fought with our human civilization for many years. What should we do with them now?" </p><p>The Virtual God supreme being spoke.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, why don't we just sell off all these alien races? I remember the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent has demand in this area."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Force supreme being was more direct. He had no good feelings towards these alien races. If it wasn't for Lin Yuan, he wouldn't have lifted a finger to save these alien races at all.</p><p></p><p>"They're all just lifeforms below Tier 12. Even if we sell them to those traffickers, they won't be worth much money."</p><p></p><p>The Butterfly Wing supreme being said: "Why don't we cultivate them instead, to become an aid to our human civilization. Right now in this Chaos Void, our human civilization is still very weak. We need to gather all forces for development."</p><p></p><p>The various peak races in the universe were able to fight with human civilization for so many years, so they must have some merits.</p><p>Moreover, they understand each other well, which makes them quite convenient to use.</p><p></p><p>"That works too, but the resources for cultivation need to be limited. I don't want to see those alien races rise from the ashes in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Rise from the ashes? With the Milky Way here, what could they use to rise from the ashes?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>"But even so, we still need to limit them."</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings quickly came to a decision.</p><p></p><p>That was to provide those alien races with certain resources to help them develop, ultimately promoting the joint development of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The various peak races had different advantages.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Insectoid race, as the alien race that fought most fiercely with human civilization, could have their Insectoid Queens give birth to countless Insectoid warriors, which could be used as cannon fodder for exploring dangerous areas.</p><p></p><p>As for using intelligent machines for exploration? In many dangerous areas of the Chaos Void, intelligent machines would be affected and malfunction.</p><p></p><p>Of course, human civilization's cultivation was only limited to the new generation of those alien races. As for the older generation of alien powerhouses, they were still tightly restricted.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way, how do you plan to deal with those Tier 12 beings?"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being looked at Lin Yuan and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Them?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly, "Restrictions have already been placed on them. We'll talk about it later."</p><p></p><p>Bringing those Tier 12 alien beings out was just a casual act by Lin Yuan. Even if he didn't bring them, the Universe Origin Consciousness would still try its best to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>Keeping these Tier 12 alien beings by his side also had the intention of preventing these aliens from leaking information about himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's growth speed in the universe was unbelievable even by Chaos Void standards.</p><p></p><p>These Tier 12 alien beings knew quite a bit. If they were let go and talked carelessly, it would also be a hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there's one more thing."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being smiled and said: "I heard you mention before, Milky Way, that on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, there's a place that specializes in buying and selling Tier 12 evolutionary paths?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>When he first arrived at the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, he learned about this. At the Myriad Path Pavilion, one could buy the desired Tier 12 evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Path Pavilion would guarantee that this Tier 12 path had no ultimate existence, and there would be no situation of being blocked on the path.</p><p></p><p>The background of the Myriad Path Pavilion was unfathomable. The Myriad Path Pavilion on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent was just one branch pavilion, and its sphere of influence encompassed one Chaos Continent after another.</p><p></p><p>"We plan to buy some Tier 12 evolutionary paths."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being exchanged glances with the other eight supreme beings and stated their intention.</p><p></p><p>"Purchase Tier 12 evolutionary paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed the reason.</p><p></p><p>Countless evolvers of human civilization entered the Chaos Void, successively transferring their life essence to the mainstream of the Chaos Void's river of time.</p><p></p><p>Because the environmental upper limit had been raised, many Tier 11 perfected evolvers planned to make the ultimate leap and attempt to cross into Tier 12.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the difficulty of impacting the ultimate and crossing into Tier 12 in the Chaos Void was lower than crossing into Tier 12 within the universe.</p><p></p><p>The river of time in the Chaos Void did not have much backlash against life forms impacting the ultimate, and the possibility of crossing over was much higher.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings of human civilization had this consideration.</p><p></p><p>So far, human civilization only had one type of Tier 12 evolutionary path in stock. This evolutionary path was quite difficult to cultivate, so they needed to prepare more Tier 12 evolutionary path options.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, taking this matter to heart.</p><p></p><p>"When the time comes, Milky Way, you can help us make the purchase. The expenses will come from the human civilization treasury."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being said.</p><p></p><p>As for why they didn't go to purchase personally?</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme beings were far from having Lin Yuan's discernment and realm, and couldn't distinguish the true advantages and disadvantages of a Tier 12 evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>That's why they entrusted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Rather than choosing wrongly themselves and regretting it later, it was better to let Lin Yuan judge and decide.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is not urgent. Milky Way, you can do it whenever you want."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme being said in a relaxed tone.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Chaos Void, impacting the ultimate was a major matter. Waiting a few thousand or tens of thousands of years longer was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of Star Tears' "Fragment World", Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>This "Fragment World" was first and foremost a cave dwelling bought by Lin Yuan, and secondly the new homeland of human civilization. Naturally, Lin Yuan had the highest authority.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Path evolutionary path..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself, even the paths he had walked in the past.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Martial Path evolutionary approach had been pioneered up to the Tier 12 Path-Opening Chapter. As for the Sovereign Chapter? It was still being perfected and had not yet been pioneered.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan's seclusion this time was not to continue perfecting the Sovereign Chapter, but to plan to expand the 'width' of the Martial Path evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was to pioneer several branch paths for the Martial Path evolutionary approach.</p><p></p><p>These branch paths were each separate Tier 12 paths, yet they were based on the Martial Path and extended in different directions.</p><p></p><p>"There are myriad great paths. Even the same great path is not fixed. Many branch paths can be opened, which can also reach the end point."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, as bits and pieces about the Martial Path continuously emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Pioneering brand new branch paths for the Martial Path was an idea Lin Yuan had since crossing into Tier 12. However, he never had time to implement it.</p><p></p><p>Under the pressure of the universe's great destruction, everything Lin Yuan had done in the past few hundred years was geared towards directly enhancing his own foundation and combat power.</p><p></p><p>As for pioneering Martial Path branch paths? In the short term, it had no impact on the Martial Path, and even less impact on Lin Yuan himself.</p><p></p><p>So it wasn't on Lin Yuan's list of must-do things.</p><p></p><p>Now that a new homeland had been found for human civilization, and everything was proceeding in an orderly manner,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He also took a brief rest to consider this matter.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, pioneering the path of martial arts wouldn't have much impact. But looking at the long-term effects, the influence would be immeasurably profound and impossible to ignore.</p><p></p><p>Even if one took different branches to reach the twelfth level, the foundation would still be the martial arts evolution path. Lin Yuan could equally enjoy the many benefits of having another twelfth-level practitioner standing on the evolutionary path he had established.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through to the ultimate level, countless martial arts evolution practitioners called out to Lin Yuan in the depths of their minds, preventing his spiritual will from falling. This ultimately allowed him to easily pass through the demonic world descended from the main branch of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>And this "anchor" effect was certainly not limited to breaking through to the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day in the future, when Lin Yuan's true self,分身 and 化身 all perished in evolution, even the 分身 in the source world would fall.</p><p></p><p>As his spiritual will fell into boundless darkness, sinking into death, this calling could still reach him.</p><p></p><p>It would help Lin Yuan lock onto an "anchor point" and forcibly return.</p><p></p><p>The more beings cultivating the martial arts evolution path, and the more powerful practitioners on this path, the stronger this calling would become and the harder it would be to resist. It could even transcend time and space.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, the martial arts I pioneered had already laid out many branches"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with many inspirations constantly emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the second level of martial arts, martial arts began to differentiate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan used yin-yang taiji as the core of his martial arts, while other martial arts practitioners could choose other things as their core.</p><p></p><p>For example, martial arts evolvers proficient in metal power could completely use metal power as the foundation of their martial arts. When they reached the fifth level, they could evolve a metal divine spirit from metal power, and finally comprehend metal rules.</p><p></p><p>By the same logic, from the second level of martial arts onward, martial arts began to encompass all things, and many paths could be traversed within the martial arts cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>From the second to eleventh levels of martial arts, martial arts evolvers had long ago chosen their own areas of expertise, then followed the path pioneered by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I used taiji yin-yang as the foundation to pioneer the twelfth level of martial arts. Other martial arts practitioners can completely use their own chosen paths as the foundation to cross into their own twelfth level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the potential of martial arts would become unimaginably vast. Theoretically, it could branch out into countless paths, giving birth to countless twelfth-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"First, open up the simplest five elements branch of martial arts" Lin Yuan began to comprehend step by step.</p><p></p><p>First was the metal of the five elements - metal at its sharpest and keenest, tearing everything apart. This martial arts branch seemed somewhat extreme, but was more than sufficient to cross into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. You have re-comprehended the martial arts evolution path and perfected the metal martial arts]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. You have re-comprehended the martial arts evolution path and perfected the wood martial arts]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. You have re-comprehended the martial arts evolution path and perfected the water martial arts]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused most of his mental energy on this. The perfection and pioneering of many martial arts branches also had a great impact on him. As the ancestor of martial arts, even without walking these branches himself, he could wield them as easily as moving his arm.</p><p></p><p>"If branches are perfected based on the power of the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth, the potential will certainly be great."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>The cycle of the five elements had almost no weaknesses, and also took into account killing power.</p><p></p><p>But to comprehend the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth, and master these five powers at the second level? To condense a five elements divine spirit at the fifth level? The difficulty was too high.</p><p></p><p>If it was in the universe, Lin Yuan even doubted if such a genius existed. But in the chaos void? With various miraculous life bloodlines running rampant, plus many prodigy-level geniuses, there was still hope of traversing this path.</p><p></p><p>The combat power of a martial arts master who crossed into the twelfth level with five elements martial arts would be so terrifying that upon just entering the Path-breaking Realm, they could probably approach the peak of that realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this path was very difficult. It not only required comprehending the five powers of metal, wood, water, fire and earth at the second level, but also cultivating a five elements divine spirit, five elements rules, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seriously perfected the five elements martial arts branch, and did not mind what threats practitioners of this five elements martial arts in later generations might bring to him.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, with Lin Yuan's talent and qualifications, he believed no life could match him if they started cultivating at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Let alone latecomers? For every step latecomers took, Lin Yuan had already taken ten or a hundred steps. How could they compare? Moreover, Lin Yuan's combat strength foundation was not limited to just martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Even if a martial arts practitioner broke the iron laws of rules and similarly walked the path of yin-yang taiji,</p><p></p><p>At the same realm, they would still be crushed and beaten by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if the paths were the same, would the foundation of the internal universe be the same? Lin Yuan's internal universe at the Path-breaking Realm already rivaled Chaos Lords, and he had countless rule comprehensions, secret techniques, and so on.</p><p></p><p>There was simply no comparison.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, as the ancestor of martial arts and the founder of this great path, Lin Yuan naturally had an indescribable and irresistible "overwhelming" power over latecomers who walked the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>It was like how mice instinctively fear cats, being innately suppressed.</p><p></p><p>For example, in terms of potential, the five elements cycle was not much inferior to yin-yang taiji.</p><p></p><p>But under otherwise identical external conditions - with the same realm, strength, internal world, various rule comprehensions, secret techniques and divine abilities, and so on all being equal,</p><p></p><p>A five elements martial arts evolver would still be crushed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The reason for being crushed here was that in front of Lin Yuan, this martial arts practitioner simply could not bring out their full strength, being innately suppressed and constrained.</p><p></p><p>This was the case for equal strength. Even if the opponent was stronger than Lin Yuan, as long as they belonged to one of the infinite branches extended from the foundation of martial arts, they would be suppressed by Lin Yuan with no power to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>"Space martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to pioneer and perfect the corresponding martial arts branch based on space.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the smoothness of pioneering many martial arts branches before, Lin Yuan clearly encountered bottlenecks and difficulties in perfecting space martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"If space is used as the foundation to extend a martial arts branch?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, sinking into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Space is too vast, yet also too thin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. There was one more point he hadn't mentioned - the difficulty was too high.</p><p></p><p>Using space as the foundation meant mastering space power at the second level of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Second-level martial arts evolvers hadn't even fully mastered and developed their physical power. How could they be expected to comprehend and master space power? As for the fifth level, they would need to condense a space divine spirit, which required understanding space power to a certain height. Otherwise, how could they control space power to condense a space divine spirit?</p><p></p><p>"Space martial arts will be put aside for now. There's no need to perfect and pioneer it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The main issue was that the threshold for this martial arts branch was too high.</p><p></p><p>Life forms that could master space power at the second level must have some kind of pure space bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Such beings were too rare and scarce.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, space martial arts had low popularity and were far from being as easy to enter as ordinary metal martial arts or water martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Time martial arts?" Lin Yuan began to try more.</p><p></p><p>Compared to space martial arts, the difficulty of time martial arts increased by another level. Lin Yuan had no intention of perfecting this branch.</p><p></p><p>He was only pondering the deeper essence of martial arts through this martial arts branch.</p><p></p><p>"Space martial arts, time martial arts, then what about spacetime martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan became interested as time and space began to interweave before him.</p><p></p><p>A martial arts branch extended from spacetime as the foundation had great potential, but it was nearly impossible to even enter this martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>"Spacetime."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan pondered the feasibility of spacetime martial arts and the application of spacetime, his thoughts suddenly shifted from martial arts to spacetime itself.</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>Countless accumulated insights on spacetime exploded forth.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years of spacetime insights in the main universe,</p><p></p><p>Clear observations of spacetime fluctuations in the source world,</p><p></p><p>And feeling the vast spacetime of the boundless chaos void after entering it.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. You have achieved mastery through comprehensive study and reached the eighth level of spacetime comprehension]</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the vast spacetime of the chaos void gradually became clear before Lin Yuan. Looking down, he took in the entire expanse of the ancient Ming chaos continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze even faintly looked towards the deepest part of the ancient Ming chaos continent,</p><p></p><p>Where a figure with chaotic aura was in secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Lord Ancient Ming?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful, and he immediately stopped paying attention.</p><p></p><p>With a Chaos Lord's perception, continuing to look would very likely be detected.</p><p></p><p>"What an unexpected surprise."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that this seclusion to perfect and pioneer martial arts branches would end up with comprehending the eighth level of spacetime?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 317: Nine Million Spatial Layers (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years of time passed, allowing Longshan Ridge to be renewed. üçì‚òÆ‚ùª‚ûà·îïƒ§ùì§ùêó.ƒÜ‡πèùê¶üê≤‚úé  </p><p></p><p>The territory of the Longshan Family expanded again and again, even occupying one-fifth of the Silan Empire's domain.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the legendary patriarch of the Longshan Family never explicitly stating his agreement to the Order Church's request to settle in, the current Longshan Family might have already become the Longshan Empire.  </p><p></p><p>On the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations, the establishment of every empire requires permission from the Church of the Gods. This is the iron law set by the Ocean of Light Gods.</p><p></p><p>However, even without establishing an empire, the current Longshan Family's influence is not much weaker than that of an empire.</p><p></p><p>That legendary patriarch of the Longshan Family was even confirmed as a demigod-level expert a hundred years ago. </p><p></p><p>For this, the Longshan Family has gained endless glory.</p><p></p><p>As long as a demigod-level expert does not stand against the church and secretly collect faith, they can live an exceptionally prosperous life. When the Pope of the Order Church first learned that the Longshan patriarch had crossed into the seventh demigod realm, he was worried that the other would gather faith by relying on the Longshan territory.</p><p></p><p>But after observing for a period of time, and even using the church's unique ability to sense faith, confirming there were no fluctuations of faith condensation in Longshan Ridge, he finally put his mind at ease regarding the Longshan patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After all, a demigod who doesn't cause trouble and has no interest in faith would save the church a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>With the Order Church's permission, the Longshan Family's subsequent development was also exceptionally smooth.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the numerous members of the Longshan Family gathered towards the clan's training grounds.</p><p></p><p>"Today should be the day the patriarch lectures on the martial path cultivation method, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Finally able to see the patriarch, a day that only comes once every ten years."</p><p></p><p>"Our Longshan Family's current patriarch is astonishingly talented, reaching the seventh demigod realm before 500 years old. This should break the record of the nearby empires, right?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Longshan Family all had proud expressions, their tones filled with fanatical colors.  </p><p></p><p>This was not strange at all, as one must know that before the current patriarch succeeded the position, the Longshan Family was just a small force huddled in the southeast corner of the empire.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Pope of the Order Church invited the patriarch to join the church many times, and promised to request a subordinate divine position from the Order God."</p><p></p><p>"A subordinate divine, that is a subordinate divine of the main gods, with a status far above those solitary gods residing in their own divine realms."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Longshan patriarch did not immediately agree, saying he needs to consider it."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the patriarch. If a main god invited me to become a subordinate divine, I would wake up smiling even if it was just a regular divine making the invitation in my dreams."</p><p></p><p>The numerous Longshan Family members arrived at the edge of the training grounds. Since it was still early and the patriarch had not appeared yet, they discussed in low voices.</p><p></p><p>On the vast Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations, there were still some demigod-level experts, but it was rare to hear of a demigod-level expert being valued and invited by a divine.  </p><p></p><p>Now, not only was the Longshan patriarch valued by a divine, but this divine was even one of the twelve Light Main Gods. Such an honor made countless demigods green with envy.</p><p></p><p>Although becoming a subordinate divine would mean losing one's freedom, being a subordinate divine to one of the twelve Light Main Gods of the Ocean of Light was different.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, the number of true gods may fluctuate, but the number of main gods has always been fixed at twenty-four, no more and no less.</p><p></p><p>Just as the countless Longshan Family members were discussing endlessly, a figure appeared on a high platform in the center of the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>"The patriarch is here."  </p><p>"The patriarch has appeared."</p><p></p><p>The Longshan Family members all stopped talking, their gazes burning as they looked at the figure on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>In the Longshan Family, the Silan Empire, and even the Order Church, all had to defer to the patriarch - he was the only "heaven".</p><p></p><p>On the high platform in the center, Lin Yuan had his hands behind his back as he swept his gaze over the large number of Longshan Family members at the edge of the training grounds. </p><p></p><p>"It's already been three hundred years." Lin Yuan felt somewhat nostalgic. In these three hundred years, in between his cultivation, he would also guide the clan members in the martial path cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was related to the "transmission of teachings", so Lin Yuan was still willing to put in some effort in this area.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's occasional guidance, the number of people cultivating the martial path cultivation method rapidly increased. Just within the Longshan Family, there were over ten thousand clan members who had cultivated to the third layer of the martial path.</p><p></p><p>Over two thousand had reached the fourth layer of the martial path.  </p><p></p><p>There were even over fifty at the fifth layer of the martial path.</p><p></p><p>There was even one person at the sixth layer of the martial path, equivalent to a legendary knight.</p><p></p><p>This was just within the Longshan Family. The number of experts cultivating the martial path method outside was even greater. Although they lacked Lin Yuan's personal guidance, with the base number, the quantity of martial path cultivators at each layer was only more, not less, than the Longshan Family.</p><p></p><p>In just three hundred years, there were such achievements, mainly due to the "localized" martial path cultivation method focused on excavating the power deep within one's own bloodline.  </p><p></p><p>This method did sacrifice future potential, but in the early stages of cultivation, the speed could indeed be described as terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The spread of the martial path cultivation method was just the most insignificant of Lin Yuan's many gains over these three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>One of Lin Yuan's greatest gains in the past three hundred years was reaching the astonishing nine million layers in his spatial domain.  </p><p></p><p>Even with his heaven-defying comprehension, aided by dozens of universal forces, over ten higher universal forces, and one primordial universal force, Lin Yuan only dared to set his goal at one million spatial layers, the result of spending a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this speed of opening one ten thousand new spatial layers per day was absolutely unattainable in the eyes of other ninth-rank experts.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the appearance of the "Divine Veins", especially those with the spatial attribute that were like "keys" to unlocking the essence of the spatial rules of this world, Lin Yuan's speed in opening derived spatial layers soared again and again, completely unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, for those ninth-rank experts in the main world and main universe who wanted to open more spatial layers, they had to sense and slowly open them one layer at a time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's method of opening spatial layers was different - he only needed to use this world's spatial layers as a template to open them.  </p><p></p><p>The moment he finished opening a spatial layer, he would directly comprehend the spatial origin insights related to that layer.</p><p></p><p>For example, those ninth-rank experts in the main universe need to open spatial layers from nothing, which is like deriving a profound "formula" without knowing any direction or goal.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan opening spatial layers is like...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Having obtained this "formula" in advance, the difficulty of deriving the process from the formula plummeted several times over.</p><p></p><p>New69bookbar.com</p><p></p><p>"Nine billion levels of spatial realms?" Lin Yuan slightly closed his eyes, sensing the "immeasurable" power transmitted from the inner world to his entire body. </p><p></p><p>In the main universe of myriad races, the ninth level was divided into five realms, among which the tens of millions realm was already the pinnacle limit of the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>As for the nine billion realms?</p><p></p><p>Hundun opened up three billion spatial realms, which already made him the strongest ninth-level life form of the Tianyu race. As for nine billion spatial realms, even if you looked across the entire main universe and included those unique "special life forms", there were probably not many that could approach it.</p><p></p><p>This was approaching, not reaching or surpassing.</p><p></p><p>Especially those unique special life forms, in the vast universe there were probably only a few of them, and their innate talents were horrifyingly terrifying to hear about.</p><p></p><p>The foundations of such special life forms were unfathomably profound. For them to open spatial realms was not as simple as eating and drinking, but not far off either.</p><p></p><p>Even so, to open up to the nine billion spatial realms...not to mention opening them up, even just counting through them one by one, it would take a very long time to count to nine billion, right?</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, according to the current trend, the nine billion spatial realms were far from Lin Yuan's limit, with still a long way to go before reaching the time limit for his stay.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had a lot of room for growth.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the demigod form is not of much use to me now," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For three hundred years, he had used his two primordial spirits to search the world for demigod forms with spatial attributes, that is, demigods with spatial abilities.</p><p></p><p>The spatial essence "key" contained in a demigod's form only occupied the lower third region.</p><p></p><p>As for the upper two-thirds region, the level of the demigod form was too low to perceive it.</p><p></p><p>And as Lin Yuan gradually mastered the lower third region of the spatial origin, other demigod forms with spatial attributes overlapped with the spatial essence he had grasped.</p><p></p><p>"A divine form should help me progress further," Lin Yuan looked up at the sky, which was actually looking at the spatial realms where the ocean of light and abyss of darkness resided.</p><p></p><p>"No rush."</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged. Although the current demigod form was no longer as effective for him as before,</p><p></p><p>it was still somewhat useful, so Lin Yuan planned to fully comprehend the demigod form and the one-third region of spatial essence it could glimpse before moving on to divine beings.</p><p></p><p>"The inner world has reached 183 million square miles in circumference."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world. Over the past three hundred years, he had also absorbed most of the sixth blue liquid from the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>In theory, after fully absorbing the first six colored liquids, Lin Yuan's inner world would reach 1.998 billion square miles in circumference.</p><p></p><p>"With an inner world approaching two billion square miles, plus the nine billion spatial realms I've opened, my current strength should be considered invincible at the ninth level?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the eighth level, there was no such concept as invincible at the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Because the confrontation between ninth-level experts was not a confrontation of power and might levels. It wasn't that if your power was stronger, you would definitely win.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was like an ultimate strike that could tear apart countless spatial realms in one blow, no matter which realm you occupied or fled to, you would die - only then could a ninth-level expert decisively defeat another in a single strike. Otherwise, the battles between ninth-level experts required fighting across multiple spatial realms.</p><p></p><p>For example, in certain environments, a ninth-level expert like Xiran who could only open less than a million spatial realms could evade Hundun, a top ninth-level expert who opened over three million realms.</p><p></p><p>But that was before.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the size and profound foundation of Lin Yuan's inner world, he could easily suppress other ninth-level experts at will, including Hundun who opened over three million realms.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't invincible - what was invincible?</p><p></p><p>"Now I just need to end the dimension-hopping, and the predicament of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is nothing at all," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>However, doing so would be a bit of a waste of this dimension-hopping opportunity. Although he had the world coordinates and could continue descending, it would cost ten strands of dimensional crossing origin power.</p><p></p><p>"Time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's will incarnation in the inner world raised his right hand, and time began to fluctuate steadily, either accelerating or pausing.</p><p></p><p>"Time pause?"</p><p></p><p>"Unable to maintain for long?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried it and found that the longer he maintained the "time pause" state, the greater the backlash he received from the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>It was like a dam breach - you could forcibly plug it, which would indeed stop the river water from flowing down, but the more water accumulated upstream, the greater the disaster would be if the dam eventually broke.</p><p></p><p>The time pause was similar.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly pausing time in a certain area would continuously receive backlash from the corrective effects of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current foundation, he could at most pause time in an area for twenty breaths before suffering irreversible damage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time-paused area could not contain any extremely powerful life forms.</p><p></p><p>Pausing time for a rock versus pausing time for a ninth-level life form was naturally not the same difficulty.</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts rose and fell,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the many clansmen of the Longshan family and began lecturing on the method of martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A few hours passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's lecture was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Under the entranced gazes of countless Longshan clansmen, Lin Yuan disappeared from the center of the field.</p><p></p><p>Underground practice room.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"In these three hundred years, I have secretly captured a large number of demigods, including many from the true god churches, which should have had a huge impact," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>In order to better comprehend the spatial essence of this realm and open up layer after layer of spatial realms, Lin Yuan had targeted all the demigods from the true god churches except the main god church.</p><p></p><p>This was far more serious than plundering the "divine crystals" from the true god churches three hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>With the true gods unable to intervene in the mortal realm, demigod-level experts were the church's strongest fighting force.</p><p></p><p>As for descending divine force avatars? That was the ultimate trump card, while most affairs and conflicts with other churches relied on demigod-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only pondered for a moment before not worrying too much about it.</p><p></p><p>If three hundred years ago, Lin Yuan still had some trepidation towards the gods of the ocean of light and abyss of darkness, after all the twenty-four main gods were experts on the same level as him.</p><p></p><p>Then now, after opening nine billion spatial realms and with his inner world approaching two billion square miles, Lin Yuan in this world had truly become -</p><p></p><p>Invincible in all directions.</p>

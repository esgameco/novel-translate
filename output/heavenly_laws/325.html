            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 325 - Opening the Martial Realm (Please Subscribe) </p><p></p><p>Longshan Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longshan Grand Hall.</p><p></p><p>The many clansmen of the Longshan family were also watching the dark and lightless sky.</p><p></p><p>That place used to be where the immortal divine kingdoms of the gods were located, looked up to by all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"How do I feel that the Patriarch is still alive? The bloodline is still there?" A core member of the Longshan family couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the many knight cultivation methods, and even the localized martial cultivation methods of Lin Yuan, all took bloodline as the core.</p><p></p><p>In essence, they were all constantly tapping into the extreme potential of the bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's strength far surpassed the main god, and his life essence was so thick that it was terrifying, he was still at the ninth level and had not stepped into the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I also need to open up my own spatial layer?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's right hand scooped up and a divine power that exuded boundless light appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was no stranger to the world consciousness, which was an almost selfless instinct born of the world itself.</p><p></p><p>If time was regarded as a long river, then pausing time was equivalent to setting up a "net" at a certain point.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan did not think about destroying the world, the world consciousness would not target him too much.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was not opening up, but completing and transforming the existing spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Unless..." A small number of Longshan family elders' faces changed slightly, and they had a terrible guess in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan strolled leisurely, quickly closing the distance between him and the frantically fleeing figure in front of him in the spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he could ignore those pressures, but this space was obviously not the handiwork of the main god. If there really was a supreme god, it might really be his doing.</p><p></p><p>One was that the gods began to fall rapidly, which happened after the Patriarch entered the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Patriarch slaughtering the gods?" The souls of Longshan Ling and others under his confidants were trembling, many of them had watched Lin Yuan grow up.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of countless heavy spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The many hidden secrets in the layers of space were no secret to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They had personally seen the Patriarch enter the Ocean of Light, and now that such a big thing had happened in the gods' residence and the gods were all dead, their Patriarch was still alive?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had infinitely approached the God of Light.</p><p></p><p>So--</p><p></p><p>But without a nod from the Patriarch himself, they still found it a bit hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>As for the supreme god?</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level, he had already seen the upper limit of this world.</p><p></p><p>If it was just this, everyone would not have any doubts, at most they would think that their Patriarch was unlucky.</p><p></p><p>After most of the day.</p><p></p><p>With two major Yuanshen outside, as well as the many essence blood left behind on purpose, even if Lin Yuan unfortunately perished in the mysterious palace, there would be no loss.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, as the patriarch of the Longshan family and the strongest person, although many clansmen could not perceive Lin Yuan's specific bloodline.</p><p></p><p>This guess was extremely incredible, but everything that was happening now seemed to be explained only by this incredible guess?</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ling and the other patriarchs' confidants looked at each other, and the same speculation also surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It actually contains endless light and part of the essence of time?" Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows, a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only Lin Yuan, but also those gods, even if they were only lower gods, would have this kind of feeling.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan had already opened up 120 million layers of space, and the number of spatial layers in this world itself was only about one trillion.</p><p></p><p>"Open up the spatial layer"</p><p></p><p>"But just now when he was running away, the God of Light did not use the essence of time." Lin Yuan only thought for a moment before he thought of the reason.</p><p></p><p>The rules of time, although profound and mysterious, also had to consider the comparison of the strength of the two.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Lin Yuan was willing, relying on the volume of his own spatial layers, it would take some time to completely explore all the spatial layers of this world.</p><p></p><p>Since the era of the gods, the world consciousness of this world had been guiding the general trend in a subtle way.</p><p></p><p>To surpass the ninth level, it was estimated that only the world consciousness of this world could do it.</p><p></p><p>This speculation was supported by two pieces of evidence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's aura began to converge, at his level of life, a little leakage of aura could affect the surroundings and even transform everything into his own "domain".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up, the God of Light could open up the Ocean of Light, the God of Darkness could open up the Dark Abyss, and he naturally could also open up a vast world.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no meaning.</p><p></p><p>But when there was a huge difference in strength and life essence, it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked slowly on the main road of the palace, actually a little vigilant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Lin Yuan was busy chasing and killing the remaining few main gods, so he didn't check immediately, and planned to explore after everything was settled.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he couldn't overturn the gods by himself, right?</p><p></p><p>"When the Patriarch comes back, we'll ask him."</p><p></p><p>"Still need to converge the aura..."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Longshan, you are not the supreme god, you are definitely not the supreme god." The God of Light was desperate in his heart, constantly breaking through layers of space, wanting to enter the deepest part of the space of this world.</p><p></p><p>For example, the most basic time-stopping technique, in a situation where the strength was similar, it was indeed useful, whether it was for fighting or escaping, it was a "divine technique".</p><p></p><p>Before, when traveling through, Lin Yuan had also come into contact with the world consciousness several times.</p><p></p><p>"God of Light."</p><p></p><p>"It has no value to me." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, he had observed the palace for most of the day and had not gained any insight, far less than the divine power.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I am the supreme god or not has no meaning for whether you can survive or not." Lin Yuan's face was calm.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with enemies, Lin Yuan had always been ruthless. As for innocence? As long as they were true gods, they had all stepped on the corpses of countless mortals. In order to gather faith, what had they not done?</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan planned to go in and explore after he had finished everything, but now that he was here, he might as well go in.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>But until now, none of the Longshan family members had this feeling, especially the Patriarch's parents, Longshan Fang and his wife.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the God of Light believed that this palace had something to do with the supreme god. Besides the supreme god, who else could build a palace of this level?</p><p></p><p>"Supreme God?"</p><p></p><p>In the past few hundred years, Lin Yuan had created countless myths, and even the shackles of the bloodline of the first generation Viscount Longshan were easily broken, becoming the first demigod of the seventh level in the history of the Longshan family.</p><p></p><p>"You are too weak."</p><p></p><p>Only by relying on the bloodline potential that originally belonged to oneself could one hope to ignite the divine fire a thousand years ago, rank as a demigod of the seventh level, and then seek to raise the divine kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Longshan Ling took a deep breath, although after excluding all possibilities,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The remaining possibility, no matter how unimaginable, is the truth.</p><p></p><p>He was the first chief god born in the universe, knowing many secrets. It is said that no living being has ever seen the supreme god, but the chief god of light indeed knows a secret related to the supreme god.</p><p></p><p>Under absolute power, any means are just frills.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan basically wandered around this palace.</p><p></p><p>"The patriarch is not dead?" Many members of the Longshan clan widened their eyes, some unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no fear or dread of the world's will, because the world's will is not life and has no specific emotions.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yuan now, without using any means, just by opening up 120 million layers of space in his inner world, is enough to crush all ninth-level lives.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan transferred the many godhoods in his inner world to the inner world of the Sun Primordial Spirit, he stepped in and came to the deepest part of space.</p><p></p><p>Such a thing that has never happened in all ages, it happened as soon as the patriarch went in?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the last remaining chief god.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's strength was not strong enough, and he encountered the siege of the chief god of light at the seventh and eighth levels, he would be the one fleeing in panic now.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Primordial Spirit appeared beside him.</p><p></p><p>And the supreme god is the existence that all gods tacitly acknowledge to surpass the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan regards the gods and chief gods as ants, which is not inappropriate at all.</p><p></p><p>Also known as the "Dao of Heaven".</p><p></p><p>Under the situation of a sharp reduction in the limit of lifespan, comprehending the rules of the outside world? The efficiency is too slow.</p><p></p><p>Also did not feel the death of his own son.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch of the Longshan clan, as long as you can release me, I have the secret of the supreme god to tell." The chief god of light felt Lin Yuan getting closer and closer, and immediately said loudly.</p><p></p><p>But if the life you want to imprison is a huge whale, far beyond the bearing limit of the "net".</p><p></p><p>But such an existence, once fallen, with the bloodline extinct, all members of the Longshan clan will be aware of it and will produce grief from the depths of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses of this world are very sensitive to bloodlines, especially to clansmen who share the same bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It's not that everyone hopes the patriarch will die, but almost all the gods are dead, the chief gods are also dying, and the patriarch is also in the Ocean of Light, how could nothing have happened?</p><p></p><p>"At my level, there can hardly be any secrets in this universe." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly and once again pulled in a large section of space layers.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the space of the human world gives Lin Yuan a vague sense of restraint, as if a whale is stranded.</p><p></p><p>Although it is not comparable to the seven essential rules of the Seven-Colored Dragon God, both endless light and time belong to extremely powerful essential rules.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Lust established the Church of Lust, using the pleasure of lust to tempt those high-ranking officials and nobles, but those beautiful girls who seduced the powerful officials, did they deserve it?</p><p></p><p>The chief god of light probably sensed Lin Yuan's overly powerful life essence. Even in the end until death, he did not display any means or abilities related to time.</p><p></p><p>Then the only consequence is that the net is broken, and the fish has not paused at all.</p><p></p><p>That is, the terrifying scene that caused the twilight of the gods before their eyes, is it related to their patriarch?</p><p></p><p>Or to put it bluntly, it was done by their patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Imprisoning the life that is moving along the river, making it stop.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The fourth time crossing the five-domain world, Lin Yuan became the great demon Xiahou Yuan and was targeted by the world consciousness, but it was just targeting and nothing more.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the gods and chief gods, the living beings are the food that they raise, they are ants, they are dust, as long as they don't kill too many at once and affect the provision of faith, they have no scruples.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious palace is magnificent and vast, with a kind of terrible oppressive aura permeating. Even the chief gods, as powerful as they are, can only resist with difficulty under this oppressive aura.</p><p></p><p>Early on, when quickly occupying many space layers, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that there was another world in the deepest part of this universe's space, which was an ancient palace.</p><p></p><p>But until now, the patriarch's bloodline still has not perished and is living well, which forms a strong contrast with the dark and desolate sky.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, that palace in the deepest part of space?" Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to the human world.</p><p></p><p>The inner worlds of those eighth-level powerhouses in the main world all rely on the main world itself and cannot be considered independent worlds.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, the Dark God has fought against him, basically losing more than winning.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the Ocean of Light and the Abyss of Darkness have no such restrictions. Relying on numerous space layers, even the chief gods can go all out.</p><p></p><p>"Is it just a palace?" Lin Yuan carefully observed and even penetrated deeper space layers, still not finding anything.</p><p></p><p>It is also the first chief god born in this universe, and also the most powerful chief god among the twenty-four chief gods.</p><p></p><p>Now the direction in which the chief god of light is fleeing is precisely that ancient palace in the deepest part of space.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the feeling of death?" The chief god of light suddenly stopped, his divine body and soul completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this palace comes from an even more distant past." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>There was no direct action.</p><p></p><p>"Go back."</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The chief god of light is indeed the first chief god, and his strength is undoubtedly the strongest among the twenty-four chief gods. His godhood contains two essential rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took one last look at the palace and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The era of the gods originated from the chief god of light, but what about before the chief god of light?</p><p></p><p>It's too ancient.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only the time rule, but any other rule ability, talent, or even divine powers, basically have no use when the difference in strength reaches a certain level.</p><p></p><p>Even using them rashly will have a negative effect.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the chief god of light gathered the other twenty-three chief gods and many true gods, wanting to suppress Lin Yuan and seize the so-called supreme god's opportunity, but he did not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>Even a uniquely terrifying and unique special life has no possibility of resistance in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although many members of the Longshan clan have an almost blind faith in their patriarch, they have never arrogantly believed that their patriarch's strength is stronger than all the gods and chief gods combined.</p><p></p><p>"Since we're already here." Lin Yuan put away the Light God's Godhood and looked at the ancient palace in the deepest part of space.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan considers himself invincible in this universe, he will not have any arrogant thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If you want to really create a complete independent world, you need to at least comprehend the complete rules of space and time.</p><p></p><p>"What should I call the world I created?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face was pensive, and he immediately had an answer in his mind, "Let's call it the Martial World."</p>

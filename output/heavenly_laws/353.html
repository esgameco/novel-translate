        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 353: The Mysterious Black Planet (5000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the desolate expanse of the universe, beneath the starry sky, Lin Yuan closely examined the distant black planet. </p><p></p><p>Although he had held back tremendously with that slap earlier, only exerting a minuscule amount of force, it would have been enough to extinguish a higher life planet, or even fling away an entire star.</p><p></p><p>Yet the black planet remained completely unmoved? </p><p></p><p>Not only was it unmoved, it seemed entirely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>This was quite inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan began gradually increasing his strength, continuously probing the black living planet.</p><p></p><p>But it still had no effect whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Even when Lin Yuan raised his power to the billion-fold spatial realm level, there was no impact.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan stopped probing further. He was confident he could perfectly contain the energy fluctuations of the billion-fold spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>If he continued raising his power further, Lin Yuan lacked the confidence to conceal it, as it may alert other passing ninth-stage evolvers, or even be detected by the human civilization's monitoring bureau.</p><p></p><p>"This planet has quite a background," Lin Yuan's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>The power of the billion-fold spatial realm was already the upper limit for ninth-stage experts in the main universe, not to mention the intuitive vastness of Lin Yuan's inner world far exceeded that of his ninth-stage peers.</p><p></p><p>Yet against this black planet, it was rendered useless. </p><p></p><p>This made Lin Yuan realize the preciousness of the black planet exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Should I descend and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the black living planet. In theory, with his current strength, he would hardly encounter any danger within the domain of human civilization. Even a black hole would just be a plaything, posing no threat.</p><p></p><p>But this black planet made Lin Yuan uneasy. To so easily block the strike of his billion-fold spatial realm power already rivaled the might of minor secret realms.</p><p></p><p>"It's just one primordial spirit after all."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan stored all the treasures he carried in a higher spatial realm. That way, even in an extreme scenario where this solar primordial spirit perished on the black planet, he could quickly revive through the shedding of a drop of blood, returning from the Profound Yellow Secret Realm with the many treasures and Profound Yellow Crystals he had taken out.</p><p></p><p>With all preparations made, Lin Yuan began slowly approaching the black planet.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>As he drew closer, he vaguely sensed the warping of space-time.</p><p></p><p>The black planet, only a few hundred thousand miles wide initially, suddenly loomed vastly larger.</p><p></p><p>"It contains such profound applications of spatial rules?" Lin Yuan was startled - such spatial rule techniques were far beyond what even he could accomplish.</p><p></p><p>"Time is also changing?" Lin Yuan also sensed the shift in the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the outside, the difference in time flow was not too pronounced, perhaps because Lin Yuan had yet to enter the planet's core area.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Lin Yuan finally descended onto the black planet's surface.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were covered in black rocks, with occasional clusters of ancient abandoned buildings. But after exploring, Lin Yuan found nothing of value.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Lin Yuan arrived at the planet's center - a black valley shrouded in an aura of profound mystery.</p><p></p><p>Entering the valley, Lin Yuan discovered twelve towering black gates, tightly shut with complex patterns engraved on their surfaces.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the patterns on the first black gate to the left. Soon after, a faint message entered his mind:</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend the rules of life and death reincarnation to enter."</p><p></p><p>The rules of life and death reincarnation were a fusion of the rules of life and death, two of the universe's fundamental rules. Successfully fusing them would grant one the combat prowess of a Tenth Stage Paragon - a Grade A Tenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Tenth Stage Paragon is only the threshold to enter this black gate?" Lin Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the second black gate to the left. Another faint message soon entered his mind:</p><p></p><p>"Comprehend the rules of great destruction to enter."</p><p></p><p>"The rules of great destruction?" Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. This was also a fusion of two destructive fundamental rules. Comprehending it would make one a powerful Grade A Tenth Stage expert.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan surveyed the remaining ten black gates - without exception, the condition to enter was comprehending a certain fusion of rules.</p><p></p><p>"Even for a Grade A Tenth Stage, that's only the threshold to enter the black gates. Whether they can actually enter depends on which fusion of rules they've comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan realized that the twelve black gates corresponded to extremely advanced fusions of rules. Comprehending any of them would elevate one to Grade A Tenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>But not all Grade A experts had necessarily comprehended one of these twelve fusions.</p><p></p><p>"Forcing my way in won't work."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed again - since the gates required comprehending the corresponding fusion to enter, it implied that without comprehension, entry was impossible. This was the requirement for Grade A experts, and Lin Yuan's current strength fell short.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan could defeat a Grade A like Vice-Pavilion Master Nalan, it was only in grasping the time rules.</p><p></p><p>If they went all out, using every means available, Lin Yuan would be no match for Nalan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while Lin Yuan couldn't defeat Nalan, the latter wouldn't find it easy to kill Lin Yuan either. With the 'Spacetime Step', even against an Eleventh Stage expert, Lin Yuan could escape - Nalan could only defeat him at most.</p><p></p><p>With no other discoveries, Lin Yuan left the planet, returning to the starry expanse.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see if I can absorb it into my inner world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the distant black planet. He was well aware that based on his current understanding, the black planet's preciousness was no less than world-tree class tenth-rank universal marvels.</p><p></p><p>The twelve black gates, which only Grade A Tenth Stage experts met the threshold for, undoubtedly contained some fortuitous opportunity within.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum...</p><p></p><p>Spatial ripples slowly propagated as Lin Yuan exerted his full power to try absorbing the black planet into his inner world. Yet he could not budge it at all.</p><p></p><p>The black planet seemed like an "anchor" tightly bound to innumerable spatial realms. For Lin Yuan to absorb it into his inner world would be equivalent to absorbing this entire domain of stars along with those countless realms.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty was too immense. And even if Lin Yuan could do it, he would never attempt such a thing - the commotion caused would be impossible to conceal. Suddenly seizing an entire domain and spatial realms would definitely draw the inquiries of the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to absorb it into my inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt this was quite troublesome, as it meant he could only leave the black planet be for now. </p><p></p><p>While the black planet had avoided detection by other experts over all these years, it did not mean it would never be discovered eventually.</p><p></p><p>"I can 'rent' this surrounding domain."</p><p></p><p>"That way, I would gain usage rights over all the planets in this domain."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan came up with a compromise solution.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was within the domain of human civilization, one had to abide by the constitution and laws - even Eleventh Stage experts could not violate them.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan became the temporary master of this domain, in theory the black planet would belong to him as well. No one could trespass on it, or they would be enemies of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Let me check if this domain has a 'renter'." Lin Yuan immediately connected to the virtual world to look up information on this domain.</p><p></p><p>This desolate, barren domain seemed unlikely to interest anyone - after all, renting an entire domain was not cheap.</p><p></p><p>If so, for Lin Yuan to gain ownership of the black planet would be much more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan entered the coordinates of this domain and waited for the virtual network to query it.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Galactic Lord, this domain currently has no 'renter'. Would you like to 'rent' it?"</p><p></p><p>An electronic mechanical voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Rent it," Lin Yuan said with relief.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"This star domain has a diameter of 12.35 light years. Please select the rental duration?"</p><p></p><p>"10,000 years," Lin Yuan pondered briefly. </p><p></p><p>10,000 years in the main universe would be enough time for him to thoroughly unravel the secrets of the black planet. Even if he couldn't figure it out by then, Lin Yuan could choose to extend the rental period.</p><p></p><p>"The rental fee is 8,000 universal crystals. Pay now?" The electronic mechanical voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Pay," Lin Yuan said quickly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, 8,000 universal crystals were transferred away. </p><p></p><p>And the ownership of this desolate star domain also fell under Lin Yuan's name.</p><p></p><p>Changes in star domain ownership were extremely normal in human civilization, with a vast number of ownership transfers happening every minute and second. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also chose to hide his information, so his name would not appear on the public list at all. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, outsiders had no idea that Lin Yuan had acquired this additional star domain.</p><p></p><p>"Done," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>From now on, for the next 10,000 years, he would be the master of this star domain.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the master of this black planet.</p><p></p><p>"8,000 universal crystals for this black planet, so worth it," Lin Yuan felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>8,000 universal crystals was merely the entire fortune of a normal eighth-stage evolver, while exploring this black planet required at least a tenth-stage Alpha-level evolver.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, discovering this black planet is extremely rare. At minimum it requires a tenth-stage evolver passing through this star domain and happening to appear near the black planet and scanning it to detect the anomaly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not an ordinary ninth-stage evolver; his perception was no different from a tenth-stage evolver's.</p><p></p><p>And tenth-stage evolvers? There were so few in the entire human civilization. Given the vast expanse of human civilization spanning billions of light years, most tenth-stage experts traveled via large-scale translocation over thousands of light years.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely difficult to just happen to pass by this area.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's discovery of the black planet's anomaly was due in no small part to luck.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan felt he had encountered an "accidental opportunity"?</p><p></p><p>As is well known, "accidental opportunities" require a great deal of luck.</p><p></p><p>Without luck, one wouldn't even notice the "accidental opportunity" right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the ownership of this star domain again, Lin Yuan casually left a monitoring method near the black planet.</p><p></p><p>As long as any lifeform approached, Lin Yuan would immediately sense it.</p><p></p><p>Given the black planet's special nature, even Lin Yuan could not forcibly move it an inch, let alone other ninth or tenth stage experts secretly trying to relocate the black planet - that would be a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>The monitoring method Lin Yuan left was mainly for warning purposes.</p><p></p><p>Besides preventing other lifeforms from approaching, the most important thing was to lock onto the black planet's position.</p><p></p><p>The universe as a whole was constantly in motion, including the countless planets. Lin Yuan was worried that if he wasn't careful, the black planet might wander off on its own.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was small. Although planets were always moving, Lin Yuan had already rented the surrounding star domain within a dozen light years or so.</p><p></p><p>At the black planet's slow movement speed, it wouldn't be able to shift even one light year in millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Sun Primordial returned to the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Lord's palace, Lin Yuan's true body and the Sun Primordial sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Numerous golden crystals and secret weapons were all handed over by the Sun Primordial to Lin Yuan's true body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the mysterious gourd also fell into the Sun Primordial's hands.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sun Primordial and the other two Primordials had not yet absorbed the liquid inside the gourd to expand the size of their inner worlds to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Over the past twenty years, the size of Lin Yuan's inner world had expanded to 2.12 billion square miles, and he had absorbed about half of the seventh drop of purple liquid.</p><p></p><p>A month later, the Sun Primordial's inner world reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>It would then go to the alien battlefield and switch with the Moon Primordial to come back and expand.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, besides cultivating and comprehending the Dao, Lin Yuan would occasionally connect to the virtual world to relax.</p><p></p><p>On this day, as Lin Yuan was savoring delicacies in his personal space, the Black Star Lord invited him to another personal space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose to agree.</p><p></p><p>Soon he arrived at an ancient-style manor, where the Black Star Lord, Liuli Star Lord, Skull Elder and a few other Alpha-level tenth stage experts were chatting.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord and the others belonged to a small circle, only open to Alpha-level tenth stage experts. Although Lin Yuan was only at the ninth stage, he would likely become an Alpha-level tenth stage in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord and the others were happy to invite Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Galactic Star Lord is here," the Black Star Lord smiled upon seeing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Lord belonged to the Black Source Evolution Spire, while Liuli Star Lord came from another Evolution Spire. Lin Yuan, strictly speaking, should belong to the Xia You Evolution Spire.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all human evolvers, so there was no real divide between them.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord, I heard Vice Lord Nalan has resigned," Liuli Star Lord looked at Lin Yuan with gentle eyes.</p><p></p><p>Vice Lord Nalan was the vice lord of the Xia You Evolution Spire, and had quite an influence in the tenth stage circle of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because Vice Lord Nalan's strength was formidable, ranking in the top hundred on the alien records' Alpha-level list.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Lord Nalan resigned?" Lin Yuan was somewhat surprised. </p><p></p><p>He had just seen Vice Lord Nalan not long ago, and the two had even exchanged pointers on the comprehension of time laws.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Star Lord, you should know that once one takes the position of vice lord, it's very rare for them to be replaced midway," the Black Star Lord smiled.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>The vice lord positions of the nine major Evolution Spires were all held by tenth stage evolvers. </p><p></p><p>And once a vice lord advanced to the eleventh stage, they would automatically resign, because eleventh stage evolvers had even more important matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>Such as preparing to break through to the ultimate realm, or heading to major alien battlefields to take command.</p><p></p><p>Vice Lord Nalan still had a very long way to go before his life span ended, and he hadn't committed any major mistakes.</p><p></p><p>For him to suddenly resign as vice lord without any reason, and for the elders to agree to it as well?</p><p></p><p>Basically, the only possibility was that he had advanced to the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>"The eleventh stage, ah," the Black Star Lord also sighed.</p><p></p><p>Alpha-level tenth stage experts like them all had hopes of advancing to the eleventh stage, but having that hope was one thing - when they would actually advance was another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Vice Lord Nalan take that step first, the experts present naturally had complex thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Vice Lord Nalan was stuck at the critical fusion law bottleneck for many years. How did he suddenly break through it?" Liuli Star Lord couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows?" Skull Elder shook his head. "Perhaps he was inspired by something."</p><p></p><p>"When you have time, Galactic Star Lord, you should ask Vice Lord Nalan for us what insight allowed him to overcome that bottleneck," Liuli Star Lord said softly to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan belonged to the Xia You Evolution Spire, of which Vice Lord Nalan was the vice lord.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship was much closer than with the others present.</p><p></p><p>"Sure."</p><p></p><p>"When I run into Vice Lord Nalan, I'll definitely ask him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. He also wanted to know how Vice Lord Nalan had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't use it now, it didn't hurt to listen.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Galactic Star Lord will be crossing into the tenth stage soon too, right?" the Black Star Lord suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Given the foundation Lin Yuan had displayed in the Xuan Huang Secret Realm by opening up a two billion layer profound spatial world, crossing into the tenth stage would likely be as simple as eating and drinking for him.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, with Galactic Star Lord's talents, he might even advance to the eleventh stage before us," Skull Elder joked.</p><p></p><p>He was just making an offhand remark. Everyone present was an Alpha-level tenth stage expert - who knows, maybe one day they would suddenly break through to the eleventh stage like Vice Lord Nalan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was only at the ninth stage now. Even if he crossed into the tenth stage, he would still have a long road ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly with the Black Star Lord and his friends for a while, Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world and continued his cultivation and comprehension of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Vice Lord Nalan's breakthrough gave Lin Yuan great motivation.</p><p></p><p>"The two thousandth new time law model, is it a ring? A snake ring?"</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's mind, the image of the entire river of time kept appearing. Overall, the river of time flowed ceaselessly from the ancient past towards the distant future.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, in certain local streams, time manifested in a snake ring shape, with the head and tail connected.</p><p></p><p>"So in other words, time is a closed loop. No matter which point you start from, you'll eventually return to the origin?" Lin Yuan pondered, with flashes of enlightenment surging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by his continuous contemplation, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time laws was rapidly elevating.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the grand palace.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>What had he just heard? The two ancient Celestial Lords, the Extreme Cold Celestial Lord and the Dark Yin Celestial Lord, had been completely left behind in the Black Jade Nest by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was even inquiring whether leaving the Celestial Lords' main physical bodies behind was worth a hundred thousand meritorious deeds? "I was also lucky that the Extreme Cold Celestial Lord and the Dark Yin Celestial Lord were unaware of my true strength, so I dared to venture deep inside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed the truth.</p><p></p><p>If the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord was still guarding the Black Jade Nest, the Extreme Cold Celestial Lord and the Dark Yin Celestial Lord, even if they had designs on the Black Jade Nest, would not have been able to easily infiltrate it, let alone venture deep inside without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's ability to leave behind the two Celestial Lords was due to two reasons: first, his own strength was sufficient to suppress them; second, the opponents had been careless.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was also the factor that the two Celestial Lords did not dare to delay any further, fearing that reinforcements might arrive, so they decisively extinguished their physical bodies and souls.</p><p></p><p>"That's not what I'm asking about." </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom stared at Lin Yuan with astonished eyes: "Were you able to leave behind the Extreme Cold and Dark Yin Celestial Lords through your own power?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor then probed cautiously: "Have you entered the Celestial Lord realm?"</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that the defensive formation of the Black Jade Nest was difficult to leave behind for Celestial Lord-level powerhouses, let alone two Celestial Lords joining forces to infiltrate it.</p><p></p><p>"More or less."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since he had come to discuss this matter, he had obviously prepared to reveal some of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord realm of the imperial clan was different from that of ordinary Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>This was because the path taken by the imperial clan was fundamentally different from that of ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The imperial clan's focus was on excavating the ancestral bloodline within themselves, while cultivators sought to comprehend the great Dao principles of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The so-called "imperial clan Celestial Lord shackle" referred to the fact that the ancestral bloodlines of the six great ancient kingdoms were currently capped at the peak of the Grand Celestial Lord realm, unable to further advance to the Celestial Lord realm by relying on the power of the bloodline alone.</p><p></p><p>Although the Grand Celestial Lords of the imperial clan could cross into the Celestial Lord realm by comprehending the great Dao principles of Heaven and Earth, such Celestial Lords were no different from ordinary Celestial Lords and did not possess the unique Celestial Lord status of the imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the core members of the six great ancient kingdoms all yearned to excavate their ancestral bloodlines to the Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"More or less?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was overwhelmed by a surge of emotions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's "more or less" was the lifelong pursuit of the core members of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Many core members of the imperial clan had paid countless sacrifices in an attempt to break through the shackles of their bloodline limitations.</p><p></p><p>"I recently made some progress." Lin Yuan raised his right hand and slightly activated the power of the divine ability "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens" that originated from the depths of his bloodline and had been tempered through the path of martial dao evolution.</p><p></p><p>This divine ability should have been an innate talent of the Blazing Sun Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>With the help of this divine ability, Lin Yuan could fully explain his excavation of the bloodline.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was indeed the case. Relying on the advantages of the martial dao evolution path, Lin Yuan's development of the Blazing Sun ancestral bloodline was far ahead of the Blazing Sun imperial clan members.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is the aura of the Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at the Blazing Sun Essence conjured by Lin Yuan, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly feel the dense Ancestral aura permeating the Blazing Sun Essence.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, thank you."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan and said sincerely, "You have shown us a glimmer of hope for the future."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor saw in Lin Yuan the possibility of breaking through the shackles of the imperial clan's bloodline, at least not an absolute dead end.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I can publicly reveal the method I used to excavate the Ancestral bloodline." Lin Yuan thought for a moment and expressed his ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>He had awakened the divine ability "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens" through the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the method of excavating the Ancestral bloodline was naturally the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, the dissemination of one's own evolution path can help form a stable "anchor" and "signpost", which is beneficial for breaking through the time cycle.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whenever Lin Yuan descended into a traversed world in the past, he would generally disseminate his own evolution path in the later stage.</p><p></p><p>For this source world, Lin Yuan also planned to try disseminating his martial dao evolution path, and the entry point would be the excavation of his own Ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao evolution path indeed has the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, the dissemination of various martial dao evolution paths was entrusted to the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But for this source world, Lin Yuan also had no intention of abandoning it.</p><p></p><p>The layer of this source world was in no way inferior to the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The vast domain of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, although smaller in area than the void domains of the Chaotic Void, contained no fewer living beings.</p><p></p><p>Once the martial dao evolution path branches were disseminated in this life-rich world, the benefits to Lin Yuan would not be inferior to those in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"The method of excavating the bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, comprehending the great Dao principles of Heaven and Earth already had clues and methods to follow, but excavating one's own Ancestral bloodline? That relied more on one's own innate talent.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really a method to deeply excavate the bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's tone was quite eager.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's breaking of the Celestial Lord shackle only allowed them, the imperial clan, to see that excavating the bloodline was not an absolute dead end and that there was still potential to reach the Celestial Lord realm, then now, if what Lin Yuan said was true, it would have an unprecedented impact on the entire Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>"I can try to summarize it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom and suddenly said, "But I have one request."</p><p></p><p>"What request?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom immediately said, "As long as it does not go against the will of the Ancestor, I can agree to it."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that the method I ultimately summarize for excavating the Ancestral bloodline can be disseminated throughout the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, not just limited to the imperial clan."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The more cultivators who practiced the martial dao evolution path, the more stable Lin Yuan's anchor and signpost would be, so he naturally did not want the dissemination of the dao to be limited to a certain area.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom agreed without even thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>This matter had no downside, and as for the living beings outside the imperial clan benefiting from it? If they could excavate the bloodline to the level of the imperial clan, then they would be part of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, if your method is indeed useful, the merits will certainly not be few."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. Disseminating his own martial dao evolution path branch was already helpful for his own breakthrough of the time cycle, and even if there were no merits, he would still do it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, having merits would be even better.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate it will take some time to prepare."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said. The great Dao principles and rules of operation in this source world were completely different from the Chaotic Void, and Lin Yuan still needed to make many adjustments to fully adapt his martial dao evolution path branch to this world.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Lin Yuan planned to "follow local customs" and increase the excavation of bloodline potential in the martial dao evolution path branch, so that it could better adapt to this world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom seemed to have thought of something. "Regarding the Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign..."</p><p></p><p>"These are their personal weapons and armaments," Lin Yuan immediately took out several weapons and armaments to prove that he had thoroughly left behind the main combat bodies of these two Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Good." The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom glanced over them. "I have already awarded you one million merits."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he was calculating which precious treasures and inheritances he should exchange in the Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>Last time when he browsed the Treasure Vault, he only had a little over ten thousand merits, and could only exchange three sets of Chaotic Rune Diagrams in the end.</p><p></p><p>"As for the matter of the Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign infiltrating the Black Jade's Nest, I will demand an explanation from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom." The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan and smiled, "If there are any benefits, I can also count them as your merits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face lit up with a smile upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign had disregarded the unwritten rules and acted on their own, and the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom was pursuing the matter. The Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom would certainly make concessions to appease them.</p><p></p><p>How would they appease them? Naturally, they would offer benefits and interests.</p><p></p><p>In other words, since the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom was seeking benefits and interests, and Lin Yuan was partly the reason for it, he could naturally be awarded corresponding merits.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the imperial palace, Lin Yuan immediately headed towards the Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>With one million merits credited, he naturally had to quickly convert them into his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Last time when he browsed the Treasure Vault, Lin Yuan had set his sights on many precious treasures and inheritances. But in the end, due to the lack of merits and the urgency of comprehending the Chaotic Principles for himself, he could only choose three sets of Chaotic Rune Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Now with one million merits in hand, the selection was naturally much broader.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom, within a majestic and vast grand hall, the Emperor sat on the throne, with numerous figures standing or sitting below.</p><p></p><p>Those who could appear in this grand hall were either the great kings of the various ancient kingdoms, the core members of the imperial clan, or Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Although the emperors of the ancient kingdoms commanded everything, they still showed sufficient respect towards the powerful Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Cold, Northern Yin," the Emperor of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom spoke, his eyes faintly reflecting the crescent moon as he looked down at the two figures who had stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what happened at the Black Jade's Nest?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom's tone was calm, but the Sovereigns below slightly changed their expressions. It was obvious that the Emperor was somewhat displeased with the Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign, and to display such an attitude in front of so many Sovereigns, these two Sovereigns must have committed a grave mistake.</p><p></p><p>"We..." The Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign glanced at each other. After their negotiations with Lin Yuan had broken down, they had proactively informed the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom had told them to wait and see how the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom would react. Now it seemed that the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom had put a lot of pressure on the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"I and the Extreme Cold Sovereign, we rashly infiltrated the Black Jade's Nest, and ended up having our main combat bodies left behind by the guardian," the Northern Yin Sovereign sighed inwardly, knowing that he could not avoid punishment.</p><p></p><p>"Infiltrated the Black Jade's Nest?" </p><p></p><p>"Had their main combat bodies left behind?"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereigns and core members of the imperial clan present had twitching mouths. Sovereign-level combat prowess, daring to act against a first-class treasure land, and even getting caught on the spot, no wonder the Emperor did not have a good attitude towards these two Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Cold, Northern Yin, you two are too impulsive. The Black Jade's Nest is a first-class treasure land, how dare you casually infiltrate it?" a burly Sovereign spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He did not ask why the Extreme Cold and Northern Yin had infiltrated the Black Jade's Nest. If he had the chance, he would also want to infiltrate it, after all, the precious black jade was a good treasure, even if he couldn't use it himself, he could still exchange it for the treasures he needed with other Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"I remember that the guardian of the Black Jade's Nest was recently replaced, with Blazing Yang Sovereign being transferred away and the Grand Sovereign of the Silver River taking over?" a man with a feminine aura suddenly spoke, looking at the Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign, "The Grand Sovereign of the Silver River is not a Sovereign, how could he have left your main combat bodies behind?"</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom sitting on the high throne spoke, "This is the second matter today. That Grand Sovereign of the Silver River, it seems he has already excavated his ancestral bloodline to the Sovereign realm."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the grand hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Sovereigns changed slightly, and the core members of the imperial clan were even more so.</p><p></p><p>Excavating the bloodline to the Sovereign realm, this was something that had never happened in the Six Ancient Kingdoms before.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Cold, Northern Yin, are you certain about this? That the Silver River was able to leave your main combat bodies behind, he must have Sovereign-level combat prowess. But is this Sovereign-level combat prowess derived from his ancestral bloodline, or from other sources?" another ancient Sovereign spoke.</p><p></p><p>The imperial clans of the various ancient kingdoms actually had Sovereign-level combat prowess as well, but the Sovereigns here referred to those who had attained the second level of the Chaotic Evolutionary Dao. Not those who had excavated their ancestral bloodline to the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The two were fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>"The methods and abilities used by that Silver River did not show any traces of Chaotic Evolutionary Dao," the Northern Yin Sovereign spoke.</p><p></p><p>As a Sovereign, he could still discern this.</p><p></p><p>"Did he perhaps rely on external objects, like the secret treasures and weapons left behind by the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom's ancestor?" another Sovereign asked.</p><p></p><p>"No," the Extreme Cold Sovereign shook his head. "The Black Jade's Nest is located on the border, how could the Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom possibly bestow such a precious treasure there?"</p><p></p><p>Even if it was a treasure weapon at the foundation level that could allow a Grand Sovereign to display Sovereign-level combat prowess, it would be too risky to place it on a division's body at the border.</p><p></p><p>After multiple rounds of questioning and discussion, the Sovereigns present had basically confirmed that the Grand Sovereign of the Silver River had indeed excavated his bloodline to the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Sovereign and the Northern Yin Sovereign felt bitter in their hearts, and could only answer truthfully in the face of the many inquiries, not daring to show any dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>This matter was indeed their own fault. Sovereigns acting in secret was not a secret, as long as they were not caught with incriminating evidence, it would usually be forgotten.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, their main combat bodies had been left behind, and their personal weapons and armaments could be used as evidence, so they could not deny it.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral bloodline excavated to the Sovereign realm, that Silver River is indeed remarkable," the oldest Sovereigns in the grand hall spoke, their tone admiring but not fearful or terrified.</p><p></p><p>Even if one had excavated their ancestral bloodline to the Sovereign realm and cultivated it to the limit, they would at most be slightly stronger than the Pinnacle Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>If a full-scale war were to break out between the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom and the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom, the Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom might need to deploy a few more Pinnacle Sovereigns to hold back that Silver River Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>That was all.</p><p></p><p>It was not an existence that could not be dealt with.</p><p></p><p>The two ancient kingdoms had been engaged in endless wars for countless years, and a few more Pinnacle Sovereigns would not be able to decide the overall outcome of the war.</p><p></p><p>A single Silver River Sovereign could not affect the overall situation of the two ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

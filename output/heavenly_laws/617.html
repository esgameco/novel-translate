        <h1>Chapter 617</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A hidden secret realm of the void.</p><p></p><p>The scorching flames with the power of rebirth burn, coalescing into the figure of the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Milky Way Great Saint only attack me and the Shadow Demon Great Saint?" The Nine Phoenix Great Saint's thoughts were unable to calm down.</p><p></p><p>As a wondrous life form nurtured by the chaotic void, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint naturally possessed two main bodies. The one that usually roams outside is her main combat body.</p><p></p><p>As for the one currently hidden in this secret void realm? That is another main body of the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint has set up life-saving measures in many corners of the chaotic void, so even if her two main bodies are completely destroyed, she can still "revive" through these life-saving measures.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the battles between me and the Shadow Demon Great Saint have caused many universes to collapse prematurely?" The Nine Phoenix Great Saint thought to herself, losing her main combat body was indeed a significant loss for her, but it was not something she could not accept.</p><p></p><p>When she was fighting the Shadow Demon Great Saint with all her might, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint had already prepared for the possibility of her main combat body being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Now that her main combat body has fallen, but the Shadow Demon Great Saint's main combat body has also fallen, it is not the worst result for the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint is quite satisfied with this outcome, managing to destroy one of the Shadow Demon Great Saint's main combat bodies is already considered excellent.</p><p></p><p>The path of chaotic power that the Nine Phoenix Great Saint has evolved, with survival as the priority, can normally only hold back the Shadow Demon Great Saint, and it is difficult for both to be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>What the Nine Phoenix Great Saint wants to figure out now is why the Milky Way Great Saint treats her and the Shadow Demon Great Saint differently from other chaotic great saints.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, since the Milky Way Great Saint has the intention to kill me and the Shadow Demon, in this situation, if I continue to fight the Shadow Demon, I may end up attracting the Milky Way Great Saint as well."</p><p></p><p>A trace of madness appeared in the Nine Phoenix Great Saint's eyes. Her karmic connection with the Shadow Demon Great Saint is deeply intertwined, and she can sense the approximate location of the other's main body through this karmic connection.</p><p></p><p>"Over there." The Nine Phoenix Great Saint looked in a certain direction, using the karmic perception to confirm that the source of the Shadow Demon Great Saint's karma is in that location.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Nine Phoenix Great Saint's figure disappeared, immediately heading towards the area where the Shadow Demon Great Saint is.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the Milky Way Great Saint sympathizes with the affected beings in the universe, so he intervened against us?" The Shadow Demon Great Saint's expression was grim. Through the last few words spoken by Lin Yuan, he deduced this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he found it increasingly unbelievable. Such a powerful being, yet still so merciful?</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Just then, the Shadow Demon Great Saint's expression changed, and he suddenly looked up in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The karmic connection between him and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint is mutual, so if the Nine Phoenix Great Saint can sense him, the Shadow Demon Great Saint can naturally also sense the other party.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Shadow Demon Great Saint clearly felt that the main body of the Nine Phoenix Great Saint was rapidly approaching his location.</p><p></p><p>"Crazy, you crazy Nine Phoenix." The Shadow Demon Great Saint's scalp tingled. Normally, after losing his main combat body, he should have hidden in a corner to cultivate and recover.</p><p></p><p>As for someone like the Nine Phoenix, who unhesitatingly deployed her last main body, it was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Nine Phoenix wants to attract the Milky Way Great Saint's attention, and then perish together with me?" The Shadow Demon Great Saint immediately thought of the Nine Phoenix Great Saint's purpose.</p><p></p><p>Even if she deployed her last main body, the Nine Phoenix Great Saint still could not defeat the Shadow Demon.</p><p></p><p>But if the two of them continued to fight together, when the Milky Way Great Saint emerged from the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he would definitely notice them first.</p><p></p><p>Given the Milky Way Great Saint's hatred towards them, he might even decide to kill them on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Great Saint cannot defeat him, but the Milky Way Great Saint can.</p><p></p><p>However, in that case, the Shadow Demon Great Saint would die, and the Nine Phoenix Great Saint would not be able to escape either.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Great Saint is coming with the intention of a mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Leave." The Shadow Demon Great Saint unhesitatingly began to traverse the distant void.</p><p></p><p>He no longer dared to entangle with the Nine Phoenix Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>In the distant void domain, in front of a massive secret realm, a towering figure coalesced - the incarnation of the Violent Barbarian Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>After the Violent Barbarian Great Saint's incarnation appeared here, he looked at the distant secret realm. The owner of this secret realm was a chaotic great saint, whose strength was even a little stronger than his own.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Violent Barbarian Great Saint's incarnation entered the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Stone." The Violent Barbarian Great Saint saw a three-eyed man.</p><p></p><p>This three-eyed man was Stone Light Great Saint, who had dominated many void domains hundreds of universe cycles ago, his battle prowess reaching the peak of chaotic great saints.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past hundred universe cycles, Stone Light Great Saint had hardly taken any action, constantly cultivating in preparation to break through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Violent Barbarian, you've come." Stone Light Great Saint glanced at the Violent Barbarian Great Saint and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Violent Barbarian Great Saint nodded.</p><p></p><p>Outside, he was extremely unrestrained, but in front of Stone Light Great Saint, he was quite obedient.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Stone's strength has become increasingly unfathomable. In my opinion, breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm has a great chance of success. In the future, when Brother Stone becomes a Time Life, I hope he will remember me."</p><p></p><p>The Violent Barbarian Great Saint immediately began to flatter him.</p><p></p><p>"The Thirteenth Realm?" A trace of a smile appeared on Stone Light Great Saint's face. No chaotic great saint, not even the Peerless Great Saints, would not want to hear such words.</p><p></p><p>"Just get to the point."</p><p></p><p>Stone Light Great Saint looked at the Violent Barbarian Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shiguang should know about my recent ordeal," the Savage Sage immediately said. "A post-heaven universe emerged, and I used the power of the Eyes of the Myriad Laws to reach it in the shortest time, but there I was suppressed by an ancient Sage named 'Milky Way'."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've heard about it," Shiguang Sage nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That Milky Way Sage said he would only let my combat avatar go if I handed over one billion Chaos Stones. You know, Shiguang Brother, I've always been poor. Where would I get one billion Chaos Stones?"</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," Shiguang Sage nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Savage Sage looked at Shiguang Sage, who had only nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Shiguang Brother, I've come to you to ask you to go negotiate with the Milky Way Sage. With your strength, the Milky Way Sage will surely show you respect."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage said, "I don't demand that he doesn't take a single Chaos Stone, but one billion is too much. If he can reduce it to five hundred million, I'm willing to offer an additional one hundred million as your reward."</p><p></p><p>"You want me to negotiate with the Milky Way Sage?" Shiguang Sage looked at the Savage Sage, "What if I also get suppressed by the Milky Way Sage?"</p><p></p><p>"You too would be suppressed?" The Savage Sage was slightly taken aback, "With your strength, Shiguang Brother, it shouldn't be the case, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shiguang Sage smiled wryly at the Savage Sage, "Savage, think about it again. The Milky Way Sage was able to suppress you eight Sages, and even the Dual Source was almost left behind. I can't do that."</p><p></p><p>Shiguang Sage said self-deprecatingly, "Savage, I can't help you with this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Shiguang Brother," the Savage Sage became anxious, "I can increase it to two billion Chaos Stones, no, three billion."</p><p></p><p>"I said I can't help," Shiguang Sage waved his hand, and the Savage Sage's avatar was instantly transported out of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm entrance was rapidly closing.</p><p></p><p>"Shiguang Sage."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage frowned, having no other choice but to seek help from the next Chaos Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Hei Yao, do you want me to help you?" </p><p></p><p>In a special, mysterious place, surrounded by hazy mist, a man with a blurred face sat on a throne, looking down at the avatar of Hei Yao Sage below.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, we roamed together, and I once saved you. You also said you owed me a favor."</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Sage looked at the man sitting on the throne. This Chaos Sage's strength was already infinitely close to that of an Absolute Sage. If it weren't for the fact that his path of Chaos Evolution was not suitable, he would have already become an Absolute Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I do owe you a favor."</p><p></p><p>The man sitting on the throne nodded, "But I can't help you with this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Can't help?" </p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Sage looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you go ask an Absolute Sage for help?" the man sitting on the throne said.</p><p></p><p>"Ask an Absolute Sage for help?" </p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Sage shook his head, "That's no different from directly giving up ten billion Chaos Stones."</p><p></p><p>The cost of asking an Absolute Sage for help would definitely exceed ten billion Chaos Stones. </p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Sage was not stupid, so he naturally wouldn't make such a losing deal.</p><p></p><p>"Then change it to something else," the man sitting on the throne looked down at Hei Yao Sage, "Change it to another matter."</p><p></p><p>"What else can I change it to now?" Hei Yao Sage frowned, "My avatar is in the hands of the Milky Way Sage."</p><p></p><p>"There is still something you can change it to," the man sitting on the throne spoke, "For example, let me borrow a few billion Chaos Stones from you."</p><p></p><p>He added, "But it's just a loan, you have to pay it back."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Sage fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Universe, Lin Yuan examined the Darksky Heart in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Darksky Heart was an item at the Absolute Sage level. After being completely refined, it could form the Darksky Domain.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Darksky Domain would be far higher than Hei Yao Sage's Darksky Domain. Even an ordinary Chaos Sage, after obtaining the Darksky Heart, would be able to instantly become a peak Sage.</p><p></p><p>If an Absolute Sage refined the Darksky Heart, they could condense the Darksky World, whose power would not be much weaker than Lin Yuan's external universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's external universe originated from his internal universe, and his internal universe, after fusing and devouring the Blazing Sun Source, had already formed the second layer of the "Infinite Void", which was not much inferior to an Absolute Sage's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>For those Absolute Sages without domain suppression methods, the Darksky World condensed by the Darksky Heart would be a kind of compensation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to Lin Yuan's internal universe, the upper limit of the Darksky World had already been fixed, and its power would remain the same after condensation. While Lin Yuan's internal universe still had a lot of room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Now, there are only some Chaos Venerable left in this Xuanhuang Universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and he sent out numerous avatars to various regions of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Since he had dealt with all the Chaos Sages, Lin Yuan naturally would not let go of the many precious treasures and rarities within the Xuanhuang Universe, at least the treasures and rarities recorded in the beast skin map had to be obtained.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of avatars went to retrieve the scattered treasures and rarities throughout the universe.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's true self, he headed straight for the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Universe, the mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 672</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is this a brand-new cultivation lineage?" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country was a bit bewildered. He had originally thought it was just a secret technique, a method to uncover the secrets of the ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected it to be an entire lineage. A lineage and a secret technique are completely different, requiring vastly different considerations.</p><p></p><p>"This lineage is unlike the current cultivation lineages of the Six Great Ancient Countries. The path it walks is completely different."</p><p></p><p>Waves of astonishment surged in the heart of the Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country. As the emperor of an ancient country, his experiences and knowledge were naturally very broad. He not only understood the cultivation system of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country, but also had some knowledge of the cultivation systems of the other five great ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>But the only cultivation lineages that could be compared to the one Lin Yuan presented were likely the mainstream lineages passed down by the ancestors of the Six Great Ancient Countries.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan, did you create this lineage yourself?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country calmed himself and asked Lin Yuan tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary path of the Martial Dao was something he had created himself, and the various branching paths that extended from it? The core foundation was still the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you, Yuan, possess such formidable strength."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country sighed. Unlike the pure-blooded ancient country royalty, the existence of someone who could create a cultivation lineage meant that their understanding of power had reached an extremely profound level - they knew both the "what" and the "why".</p><p></p><p>This was far more difficult than the Celestial Sovereigns who merely comprehended the rules of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Celestial Sovereigns comprehended the rules of the heavens and earth by following the great Dao's fluctuations, which they could use as a reference.</p><p></p><p>But to create a brand-new cultivation lineage? Even if there were other cultivation lineages to reference, the final lineage created had to be completely new.</p><p></p><p>Especially this "Martial Dao" lineage that Lin Yuan had created - by any measure, it did not seem inferior to the mainstream lineages passed down by the ancestors.  This was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan, do you really plan to spread this cultivation lineage far and wide?" the Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country asked again.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation lineage of this caliber was fully worthy of being stored in the treasury of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country, without any restrictions on its dissemination. The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country even felt it was a pity.</p><p></p><p>"Let it be spread."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Placing the evolutionary branches of the Martial Dao into the ancient country's treasury could certainly provide him with additional income, but it would greatly reduce the breadth of the Martial Dao's dissemination, as not just anyone would have the qualifications to enter the treasury and select from it.</p><p></p><p>This would not align with Lin Yuan's purpose.</p><p></p><p>He was spreading the Martial Dao in order to form 'anchors' and 'guideposts'.</p><p></p><p>As for the merits and achievements he could earn? If this had been in the past, Lin Yuan might have cared about that, but now? With the backdoor opened for him by the ancestor of the Ancient Blazing Sun, he could freely acquire any and all lineage guidance from the treasury. Such merits and achievements had little meaning to Lin Yuan anymore.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was guarding the newly born Golden Mist Treasure Realm, which was equivalent to monopolizing a supreme rarity that had never appeared in the Six Great Ancient Countries before. Obtaining any resources he desired was effortless for him.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan, you..."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country was quite moved, thinking that Lin Yuan was being benevolent, wanting to pave the way for the masses of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country.</p><p></p><p>"I've already instructed the people below to take care of it."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country closed his eyes for a moment, then spoke to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Blazing Sun Country ruled over numerous great domains, and secret techniques like the "Blazing Sun Nurturing Spirit Art" were constantly being disseminated.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country only needed to add the evolutionary branches of the Martial Dao that Lin Yuan provided into them, without needing to re-establish new dissemination channels.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It is the masses of the ancient country who should be thanking you."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country immediately said. At least from his perspective, Lin Yuan actively spreading such a profound cultivation lineage was an immense boon for the ancient country's masses.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>News about the evolutionary branches of the Martial Dao first began to spread in the capital of the Ancient Blazing Sun Country.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao?"</p><p>"Whose cultivation lineage is this?"</p><p>"Is it the lineage created by Lord Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Many Venerable Ones and even Celestial Sovereigns were immediately stirred up.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Blazing Sun Country, the stronger one's strength, the more clearly they understood Lord Yuan's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>He was the one who had single-handedly swept through four great ancient countries, including the mighty Ancient Profound Country.</p><p></p><p>The lofty and invincible strongest Celestial Sovereign of the Ancient Profound Country could only flee in panic before Lord Yuan, unable to even escape.</p><p></p><p>"This Martial Dao cultivation lineage..." Some Venerable Ones carefully examined it, their expressions pensive. The evolutionary branches of the Martial Dao were completely different from the current many cultivation lineages. Even as Venerable Ones, they found it difficult to immediately adapt to it, but they also vaguely sensed the profundity contained within.</p><p></p><p>"Bloodline, this lineage talks about how to uncover the bloodline? Is this the foundation of Lord Yuan's formidable strength?"</p><p></p><p>More and more powerful Venerable Ones began to ponder and comprehend it. Though the foundation and path of the Venerable Ones was already set, it did not prevent them from referencing, learning from, and cultivating it in parallel.</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Mist Treasure Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body and main entity sat in meditation, self-refining the "Dragon Abyss Blood".</p><p></p><p>As for his divine sense and consciousness, they were immersed in observing the operation of the Source World's primal energies.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>During the refinement of the "Dragon Abyss Blood", Lin Yuan's true body and main entity naturally activated, and the formless aura began to spread and influence the layers of space surrounding the treasure realm.</p><p></p><p>The dozen or so formation masters down below who were setting up defensive formations for the treasure realm were now trembling in their hearts. They were also very powerful, but in the face of the aura casually emanating from Lord Yuan, they felt like tiny insects before a mighty dragon.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ants on the side were trembling and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Heavenly Sovereign is too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I can even feel his aura permeating the deepest depths of space-time."</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the first living being born at the dawn of the heavens and earth was called the 'Abyss Dragon'. Could it be that the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign is on par with the Abyss Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen formation masters were quickly setting up a defensive formation, while also discussing.</p><p></p><p>As formation masters, they were at a very high level and had naturally heard of the existence of the 'Abyss Dragon'.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan, the definition of the strongest Heavenly Sovereign was based on the establishment of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As for the era before the establishment of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom, it was the era ruled by the 'Abyss Dragon', during which the 'Abyss Dragon' was the undisputed absolute overlord, until the Great Buried Ancestor crossed into the Thirteenth Realm and slew the Abyss Dragon, establishing the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immersed in observing the operation of the Source World's primal origin, with the endless Dao rules interweaving and merging, captivating him.</p><p></p><p>The space-time before Lin Yuan's eyes underwent a completely new transformation, with layer upon layer of space-time unfolding like sheets of paper, visible at a glance.</p><p></p><p>【Your transcendent comprehension allows you to observe the mysterious primal origin operation, and your understanding of the space-time fusion rules has been greatly enhanced.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan delved into contemplation, and a complete understanding of the space-time fusion rules gradually took shape in his mind. </p><p></p><p>"Space-time! This is space-time!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was full of vigor, continuously observing the operation of the Source World's primal origin, and comparing it to the Dao rule operation within the Thirteen Realm Weapon of the Chaotic Void, the Heavenly Void Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the space-time fusion rules reached the peak of the Ninth Realm, equivalent to a complete understanding of the space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>"I thought it would take a thousand years to reach the peak of the Ninth Realm." Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>The guidance of the many supreme inheritances in the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom's treasure trove had greatly benefited Lin Yuan, and the inheritances created by the Thirteen Realm Lifespan had naturally been of great help to him.</p><p></p><p>The combination of these factors had allowed Lin Yuan to reach the peak of the Ninth Realm in his comprehension of the space-time fusion rules much earlier than expected.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it is to transcend the space-time fusion rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and continued observing the operation of the Source World's primal origin.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the capital of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom, the Great Buried Heavenly Sovereigns stood respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an invisible aura gathered, forming a figure draped in a magnificent cloak, with gemstones embedded in the cloak, each containing a vast world.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were narrow and devoid of any emotional fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Great Buried Heavenly Sovereigns bowed in unison, their posture extremely reverential.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom, the Ancestor was the supreme "deity". It was because of the Ancestor that the powerful experts of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom could have a sense of superiority over the experts of other ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>The Great Buried Ancestor swept his gaze around, and the time lines of each Heavenly Sovereign unfolded before him. The past was determined, with only one time line, but the future time lines were numerous.</p><p></p><p>The Great Buried Ancestor first looked at the determined past time line.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he descended, he would provide guidance to the top peak Heavenly Sovereigns and the strongest Heavenly Sovereign level descendants.</p><p></p><p>And the guidance was not just empty words, but based on the past experiences of each descendant, which required the Great Buried Ancestor to observe the past time line.</p><p></p><p>Soon, through the past time line, the Great Buried Ancestor saw the experiences of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom's experts in the Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>The scenes of them being swept away and crushed by the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign made the Great Buried Ancestor's brows furrow.</p><p></p><p>He believed that he valued his descendants and was willing to cultivate them. Among the six Ancestors, he was the only one who would descend periodically to provide guidance. The Great Buried Ancient Kingdom occupied nearly a third of the treasure lands, which was also due to the Great Buried Ancestor's covert efforts.</p><p></p><p>To the Ancestor, the rare treasures produced by the treasure lands held no use for him. Yet, under such cultivation, the Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom were still swept away and crushed by the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, which made the Great Buried Ancestor's reputation suffer.</p><p></p><p>He could almost see the Blazing Sun Ancestor's smug and self-satisfied expression.</p><p></p><p>"You all..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Buried Ancestor swept his gaze over the many Heavenly Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sovereigns below trembled in their hearts, wanting to say something but not daring to.</p><p></p><p>The unreasonable strength of the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign was one aspect, but since the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom could produce the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign, the environment of the Great Buried Ancient Kingdom was far better than that of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom. Why couldn't they also give birth to a Galactic Heavenly Sovereign? Many Heavenly Sovereigns had this unspoken thought.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of useless trash!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Buried Ancestor's gaze was icy cold, feeling that the descendants he had cultivated were just a group of useless trash. At the same time, he was also observing the time lines related to the Galactic Heavenly Sovereign, with the time lines extending and unfolding towards the future:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 655</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Refining and completing the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart once again surged with a slight sense of control over the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's an ordinary core celestial pillar or a giant core celestial pillar, they are essentially the key nodes of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, refining all such nodes is equivalent to controlling the entire treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure land core of the Black Jade Nest has only sixty-three, while this treasure land has more than three hundred cores, and even three giant cores," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this newly born treasure land is absolutely the most top-tier among the many first-class treasure lands currently controlled by the six ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>There are only six treasure lands of this level, and three of them are in the hands of the Great Xia Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>"The use of that golden mist must not be simple," Lin Yuan thought again about the rare treasures nurtured by this treasure land.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Liang Yang Ancient Country's research on the golden mist is still limited to slowly absorbing it with their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in front of the giant core celestial pillar, beginning to review the brief confrontation with Fuxu Celestial Venerable just now.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Celestial Venerable retreated on his own and ceded this giant core treasure land, fearing that he would be destroyed together with me, allowing the other ancient countries to benefit?" Lin Yuan was very clear about Fuxu Celestial Venerable's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Given the core celestial pillars that the Xia Ancient Country has already refined, this giant core celestial pillar is not an absolute necessity.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Liang Yang Ancient Country obtained this giant core celestial pillar, in terms of the number of refined core celestial pillars, it would still be less than the Great Xia Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Celestial Venerable believed that the Great Xia Ancient Country still had an absolute advantage, so there was no need to fight to the death with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I'm on par with Fuxu Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell into brief contemplation. Fuxu Celestial Venerable's attack was completely blocked by him with the Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Diagram.</p><p></p><p>But this does not mean that Lin Yuan is definitely stronger than Fuxu Celestial Venerable, it only means that Fuxu Celestial Venerable cannot overcome Lin Yuan in a conventional confrontation.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Celestial Venerable should have cultivated two Thirteen Realms inheritances, his strength is terrifying," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"As for me, I cultivate the 'Infinite Void' and the divine ability 'Radiant Sun Celestial Opening', the two of which are equivalent to two Thirteen Realms inheritances. Moreover, the Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Dao I have evolved is also a Thirteen Realms level technique, even stronger than ordinary Thirteen Realms techniques, as it is my own Dao, perfectly in tune with myself."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation threshold of Thirteen Realms inheritances is extremely high, and to cultivate two Thirteen Realms inheritances at the same time is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>The "Infinite Void" that Lin Yuan cultivates may seem smooth sailing, but that is because Lin Yuan's comprehension is extraordinary. For other powerful cultivators, just the trials in the Jade Gourd state would be difficult to endure.</p><p></p><p>Even if they managed to get through it, most would still be stuck at the threshold.</p><p></p><p>In the treasury of the Liang Yang Ancient Country, there is a Thirteen Realms inheritance called "Radiant Sun Heart". One of the prerequisites to cultivate this inheritance is to maintain a Radiant Sun mentality at all times, which means the cultivator's rationality is almost completely replaced by the Radiant Sun, making them impulsive and easily angered.</p><p></p><p>However, once the "Radiant Sun Heart" is cultivated, the cultivator's heart will transform towards the Thirteen Realms time-life heart, and even if it only has one-ten-thousandth or one-hundred-thousandth of the power of a true Thirteen Realms life heart, it would still be enough to sweep away all Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In terms of boosting combat power, this type of inheritance that evolves towards the Thirteen Realms is absolutely superior to other Thirteen Realms inheritances. But Lin Yuan keeps his distance from it. Even if he fully meets the requirements, he would not attempt to cultivate it, as the loss of most rationality is too risky.</p><p></p><p>"The main difference between me and Fuxu Celestial Venerable is in the realm of life, I am still only at the Sovereign Realm," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not too concerned about it. At his current level, as long as he enters the Chaos Realm, he would directly reach the Chaos Realm Perfection, as he has already evolved the Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Dao.</p><p></p><p>"My greatest advantage is not my inner cosmos, not the 'Infinite Void', nor the 'Radiant Sun Celestial Opening, but the path I have evolved myself," Lin Yuan's gaze became slightly heated.</p><p></p><p>Just the first level of the Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Dao has already brought such a significant increase in his strength. Once he cultivates it to the second or third level, who knows what he could achieve? Compared to the potential of this Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Dao, perhaps only the seventh-level "Infinite Void" could rival it.</p><p></p><p>But the seventh-level "Infinite Void" is still just theoretical, even its creator is not confident about it. Lin Yuan believes that the third-level Chaos Yin-Yang Supreme Ultimate Dao is more reliable.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was examining his own strength, the supreme Celestial Venerables throughout the treasure land suddenly erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the semi-illusory core celestial pillars, the aura emanating from the giant core celestial pillar was impossible to contain.</p><p></p><p>Even Celestial Venerables, as long as they sensed it, could feel the majestic aura of the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>However, the giant core celestial pillar was previously occupied by the Great Xia Ancient Country and refined by Fuxu Celestial Venerable. What could they do about it? But now, the aura of the giant core celestial pillar had undergone a slight change, causing all the supreme Celestial Venerables to have a single thought:</p><p></p><p>The giant core celestial pillar has changed hands.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't that giant core celestial pillar refined by Fuxu Celestial Venerable? How could it have changed hands?" </p><p></p><p>"Who is it? Other than the Great Xia Ancient Country, is there a powerful expert on par with Fuxu Celestial Venerable among the supreme Celestial Venerables sent by the remaining five ancient countries?"</p><p></p><p>"How is it possible to force Fuxu Celestial Venerable to cede the giant core celestial pillar?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme Celestial Venerables were shocked. The previous battle disturbance around the giant core celestial pillar had already left them greatly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Now, the giant core celestial pillar had even changed hands. Given the importance of the giant core celestial pillar, Fuxu Celestial Venerable would not have retreated if he could help it. Since he did retreat, it must have been a voluntary cession.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Galaxy Celestial Venerable, that giant core celestial pillar has been refined by the Galaxy Celestial Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Celestial Venerable? Didn't he just enter the Celestial Venerable realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Celestial Venerable snatched the giant core celestial pillar from Fuxu Celestial Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Many supreme Celestial Venerables were somewhat dazed. They had anticipated that other ancient countries might have deliberately hidden their experts, but they didn't expect that expert to be the Galaxy Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The uniqueness of the Galaxy Celestial Venerable is unparalleled among the six ancient countries, as he is the first to have cultivated the ancestral bloodline to the Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the time was too short. While the cultivation of the ancestral bloodline by the royal family does make it easier to improve in strength, it is not an instant leap to power.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the Celestial Venerable realm ancestral bloodline?" Many supreme Celestial Venerables had their thoughts wander, already planning to study the ancestral bloodline in depth after this battle for the treasure land is over.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the truly powerful supreme Celestial Venerables had looked down on the ancestral bloodline, as the limitations were too great.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Many supreme Celestial Venerables no longer had any fixed prejudices against the ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious and Ancient Great Fuxia Country, this is the first city in this source world, and also the birthplace of the first ancestor. It has great significance for the Great Fuxia Ancient Country and the other five ancient countries, as it is the origin of everything.</p><p></p><p>Even though three out of the five ancestors were not born in the Great Fuxia Ancient Country, their status as ancestors is still closely related to the Great Fuxia ancestor. After all, this cultivation path and cultivation system at the beginning of heaven and earth originated from the Great Fuxia ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the capital.</p><p></p><p>Several figures gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, scenes were flashing by, depicting the moment when Lin Yuan broke through the eleven supreme saints of the Great Fuxia Ancient Country, and finally withstood the attack of the Fuxia Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Fuxia Supreme Saint was also among them, silently watching the flashing scenes, occasionally lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this Silver River Supreme Saint, his methods are indeed remarkable. The path of chaos power cultivation he has evolved is quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I can see that he should have cultivated a thirteen-tier inheritance, but the main reason he was able to block Fuxia's full-force attack was his self-evolved path of chaos power cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful path of chaos power cultivation, it's rare indeed."</p><p></p><p>The figures spoke one after another, evaluating Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"A thirteen-tier inheritance, plus the ancestral bloodline power at the Supreme Saint level, and an extraordinary path of chaos evolution, this Silver River Supreme Saint still has room for further improvement."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if he were to cultivate another thirteen-tier inheritance, I'm afraid we wouldn't be his match even if we joined forces."</p><p></p><p>The figures discussed, highly praising Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"However, the path of chaos power cultivation he has evolved has not yet reached the third level, lacking that sense of perfection." At this moment, a voice that had not spoken before suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet reached the third level of chaos power cultivation?" The other figures were slightly startled upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The path of chaos power cultivation is divided into three levels, with huge differences between them, especially the second and third levels, which is the gap between ordinary Supreme Saints, peak Supreme Saints, and even top-tier Supreme Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxia, since you've fought against him, is this the case?" A figure looked at the Fuxia Supreme Saint and asked.</p><p></p><p>The scenes that flashed by were ultimately just scenes, even if they came from Fuxia's memories, they could not compare to being there in person.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>The Fuxia Supreme Saint nodded after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>The third level of the path of chaos power cultivation is the realm of perfection. Reaching this level of evolutionary path will give a sense of being at the ultimate limit.</p><p></p><p>However, Fuxia did not feel this from the Yin-Yang Taiji diagram of the chaos power cultivation evolved by the Silver River Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that in this era, our six ancient countries will give birth to a powerhouse that surpasses even the strongest Supreme Saints?"</p><p></p><p>A figure couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Since the six ancient countries were established, the strongest Supreme Saints have always been the ceiling, but with the current strength displayed by the Silver River Supreme Saint, he may very well break through this ceiling.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't say that. The more powerful the path of chaos power cultivation, the more difficult it is to reach the level of perfection."</p><p></p><p>Another figure spoke, not too worried, "Besides, even if that Silver River Supreme Saint really reaches that step, what impact would that have on us?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless he reaches the Ancestor level, how could he possibly threaten our Great Fuxia Ancient Country? And even if he reaches the Ancestor level, that would be a problem for the Ancestors to deal with, it has nothing to do with us."</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken, the other figures thought it over and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor level, I wonder if we still have a chance to break through to that."</p><p></p><p>The figures' thoughts scattered, for Supreme Saints, the greatest desire is to break through the time cycle and enter the thirteen-tier Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this is too difficult. Since the Great Fuxia Ancestor established the Great Fuxia Ancient Country, only five Ancestors have been born in the endless years.</p><p></p><p>The figures present are the strongest Supreme Saints of the Great Fuxia Ancient Country, they have possessed Ancestor bodies more than once, and the more they possess, the more they can feel the gap between themselves and the Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>This gap is not a difference in power level, but a difference at a higher level.</p><p></p><p>"That Silver River Supreme Saint, no matter how strong he is, whether he can ultimately become an Ancestor is still uncertain, the probability is not much higher than ours."</p><p></p><p>A figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxia, do you have confidence in this treasure land battle?"</p><p></p><p>The figures chatted for a while, looking at the Fuxia Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Great Fuxia Ancient Country had sent the powerful Fuxia Supreme Saint to compete for that treasure land, which was already a sure victory, but they didn't expect the emergence of the Silver River Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary methods cannot defeat that Silver River Supreme Saint, but if it's a life-and-death battle, the current Silver River Supreme Saint may not be my match."</p><p></p><p>The Fuxia Supreme Saint said.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the future, the Silver River Supreme Saint's strength will surpass his, but for now?</p><p></p><p>The reason Fuxia Supreme Saint actively gave up the giant core celestial pillar was because he didn't want other ancient countries to benefit, and the treasure land battle was still nearly a thousand years away, and the Great Fuxia Ancient Country still had the advantage.</p><p></p><p>It was not because he feared the Silver River Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that if I had known this treasure land battle would produce a powerhouse like the Silver River Supreme Saint, I would have participated as well."</p><p></p><p>The figures conversed with each other, at their level, fighting against peers of the same level is also a kind of pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Inside the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Outside the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>The eleven peak Supreme Saints of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country arrived here.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Supreme Saint... the Silver River Supreme Saint really regained this giant celestial pillar?" Until now, the Blazing Supreme Saint still found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>As a top-tier peak Supreme Saint, he was well aware of the Fuxia Supreme Saint's strength. Even he could only barely withstand the other party by relying on the ancient country's foundation-destroying weapon.</p><p></p><p>If the Fuxia Supreme Saint had also used the foundation-destroying weapon, they would have to unite with other ancient countries to resist him.</p><p></p><p>This was also an inevitable scene in the later stage of the treasure land battle. With the strength of the Great Fuxia Ancient Country, it would certainly attract the joint forces of other ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Supreme Saint's strength is too powerful."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Sun Supreme Saint sighed, at the beginning when the quota to enter the treasure land was determined, he was slightly dissatisfied with the Blazing Sun Ancient Country's emperor forcibly pushing this royal family member.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Crimson Flame Supreme Saint finally spoke up: "The Silver River has let us in."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The other peak Supreme Saints nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the leading Supreme Saint of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country had quietly changed from the Crimson Flame Supreme Saint to the Silver River Supreme Saint.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it.</p><p></p><p>In the six ancient countries, the strongest are the masters. The Silver River Supreme Saint has the strength of the strongest Supreme Saint, and has already been recognized.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Silver River Supreme Saint has regained the giant core celestial pillar, which is of great significance for this treasure land battle.</p><p></p><p>It has alleviated the pressure on the Blazing Sun Ancient Country to occupy more core celestial pillars in the future.</p><p></p><p>With strength comes credit.</p><p></p><p>If the Silver River Supreme Saint is not the leading Supreme Saint, then who is?

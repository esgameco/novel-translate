        <h1>Chapter 492</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ultimate aura permeated the air, and even just a twelfth-stage avatar could unleash an extremely terrifying combat power, far exceeding Lin Yuan's previous performance on the super-large battlefields.</p><p></p><p>This is the twelfth-stage ultimate, the pinnacle of life in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao evolution path of human civilization, after reaching the eleventh stage, has actually surpassed the five major twelfth-stage evolution paths, becoming the fifth evolution path?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestor of the Tianyu Clan spoke with a slightly solemn tone. Unless it involved major events related to the power dynamics of the supreme clan groups in the universe, the many twelfth-stage ultimates would rarely gather together.</p><p></p><p>And the martial dao evolution path had clearly touched the bottom line of the various peak clan groups. Even the eleventh-stage martial dao evolution path of human civilization was able to rank among the top five of all their evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>What kind of concept is this? "It's simply child's play! What are the nine twelfth-stage experts of human civilization trying to do, to make the mere eleventh-stage evolution path surpass the twelfth-stage evolution paths?"</p><p></p><p>A certain Insect Clan Queen frowned, as she simply could not believe the ranking of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>After all, the so-called ranking list was decided by those few twelfth-stage experts of human civilization, right? As long as they wanted to, even a first-stage evolution path could be made to surpass the twelfth-stage evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>But is this the reality? The gap between the eleventh and twelfth stages is far greater than the gap between the first and eleventh stages. This is the difference between the life within the River of Time and the life outside of it.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-stage ultimates stand tall on the shore, theoretically with infinite lifespans, while the eleventh-stage lives? In the eyes of the twelfth-stage ultimates, they are nothing more than ants trapped in the River.</p><p></p><p>"I know Xuanyuan Xiaqin and the others well, they won't do something so empty and flashy. The fact that the martial dao evolution path can surpass the five major twelfth-stage evolution paths must have a reason."</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate of the Yuzu Clan spoke slowly. When the first twelfth-stage expert of human civilization, Xuanyuan Zhi, was trying to break through to the ultimate stage, he had sought the protection of the Yuzu Clan.</p><p></p><p>More than two million years have passed, and although Xuanyuan Zhi has long since repaid the Yuzu Clan's grace, he still maintains a good relationship with several of their ultimates.</p><p></p><p>The conflicts between humans and the Yuzu Clan are also the least.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it involves the interests of the clan groups, killing will still happen. On the super-large battlefields, Lin Yuan had killed not a few eleventh-stage Yuzu, and Xuanyuan Zhi had not specifically tried to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"I think so too."</p><p></p><p>"The twelfth-stage experts of human civilization have no need to 'fake' anything, it's meaningless."</p><p></p><p>The supreme expert of the Star Alliance continued, asking what's the point of forcibly pushing the martial dao evolution path to the fifth evolution path of human civilization? Is it to show off to them? If there are no new twelfth-stage ultimates born for a long time, this would just become a joke.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, to verify this matter, we only need to watch the eleventh-stage martial dao chapter." The Ultimate of the Yuzong Clan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other twelfth-stage ultimates looked at each other without immediately answering.</p><p></p><p>The ten major peak clan group forces all have 'spies' and 'assassins' disguised as humans, secretly embedded within human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If human civilization produces an extraordinary evolutionary genius, they will activate these 'assassins' to assassinate them.</p><p></p><p>Or if they want to obtain other information, they can also have these 'spies' go investigate.</p><p></p><p>However, arranging these 'spies' within human civilization is a huge cost for the various peak clan group forces, as evading the selection of the three Goddesses is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>The implication of the Yuzong Clan Ultimate was to have the major peak forces mobilize the 'spies' they have embedded in human civilization to purchase the eleventh-stage martial dao chapter.</p><p></p><p>Just take a look at the martial dao evolution path for themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, this plan has great hidden dangers. First of all, purchasing the eleventh-stage martial dao chapter is not something just any 'spy' can do - it requires at least tenth-stage strength and high enough authority.</p><p></p><p>But arranging a tenth-stage alien to infiltrate human civilization? The cost of doing so is likely many times more than cultivating an eleventh-stage expert.</p><p></p><p>This level of 'spy' will only be used if absolutely necessary, as any contact could potentially lead to exposure.</p><p></p><p>"Well then."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go."</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor fell silent for a moment, then closed his eyes and began to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>The enmity between human civilization and the Tianyu Clan is deep, and he is also eager to know the truth about the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor opened his eyes, his expression revealing a trace of incredulity.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The other twelfth-stage ultimates immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The expression of the Tianyu Clan ancestor suddenly changed, and he quickly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he had sensed that the tenth-stage 'spy' the Tianyu Clan had arranged within human civilization had died for no reason, and it was a death by memory pollution, unable to be revived even by flowing against the current.</p><p></p><p>"Those twelfth-stage experts of human civilization are specifically monitoring everyone who purchases the eleventh-stage martial dao chapter," the Tianyu Clan ancestor immediately guessed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have died so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Even if they discovered the anomaly, they would have at least tried to control him first, before directly killing him, and in such a thorough way as memory pollution.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the information left by the Tianyu Clan 'spy' before his death, the Tianyu Clan ancestor did not have time to get angry, but instead looked around at the other twelfth-stage ultimates, not beating around the bush, and directly said:</p><p></p><p>"The eleventh-stage martial dao chapter is not simple at all, it contains rule models of thousands of fusion rules, as well as complete rule models from the first to the fifth spatial-temporal realms."</p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of fusion rule models?"</p><p></p><p>"Complete rule models from the first to the fifth spatial-temporal realms?"</p><p></p><p>The other twelfth-stage ultimates were immediately shocked, as they were well aware of the impact these rule models could have on a clan group.</p><p></p><p>"Where are those rule models?"</p><p></p><p>"Have they been replicated?"</p><p></p><p>The Insect Clan Queen quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to replicate, the person I arranged to purchase the eleventh-stage chapter died completely after leaving the information." </p><p></p><p>The Tianyu Clan ancestor's words were brief.</p><p></p><p>"I'll also have someone go buy it."</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-stage ultimates of the various clans immediately began to make arrangements. If what the Tianyu Clan ancestor said was true, even if it meant sacrificing a tenth-stage 'spy', they had to confirm it.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the twelfth-stage ultimates opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They also discovered that the 'spies' who had gone to purchase the eleventh-stage chapter had all died completely.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't pay much attention to this, as the information these 'spies' had brought back was the same as what the Tianyu Clan ancestor had said.</p><p></p><p>"So many rule models? And spatial-temporal fusion rule models as well? Who is the founder of the martial dao evolution path?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with the rule models in the eleventh-stage chapter? After all, we haven't personally seen those rule models."</p><p></p><p>"The probability of problems is not high, the fact that human civilization dares to openly publish the eleventh-stage martial dao chapter means the universality is not problematic, applicable to the vast majority of life forms to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>The various twelfth-stage ultimates quickly began to discuss.</p><p></p><p>Rule models are not just textual information, even if they've seen them a few times, they can't just speak them out or write them down to spread them.</p><p></p><p>But all the peak clan groups...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The forces purchased the 'spy' of the 11th level scriptures, and the information left behind was all the same. Furthermore, the 11th level martial arts scriptures were constantly spreading within human civilization. This made the 12th level ultimate beings realize that those rule models were real.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it ultimately? Who created the evolutionary path of martial arts?" </p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan the Strongest? Impossible, he doesn't have such capability. The rule models from the first to the fifth level of the Peerless Dao Realm, even the peak of the Peerless Dao Realm cannot perfect them."</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the many 12th level ultimate beings were filled with shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>With these rule models, the future cultivation path of the evolvers in human civilization would be much simpler than theirs as outsiders. The number of 11th level perfected beings had increased, and the possibility of producing ultimates would also rise.</p><p></p><p>The most critical point was, who was the founder that created the evolutionary path of martial arts? "Investigate, spare no effort to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the identity of the founder of this evolutionary path must be found out."</p><p></p><p>More than ten 12th level ultimate beings looked at each other, their figures quickly dissipating as they returned to their tribes, utilizing all their intelligence and information capabilities to investigate the information about the founder of the martial arts evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan observed the changes in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, his inner world had expanded by another circle, from the original two light-years in radius, to two point one light-years.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic rules." </p><p></p><p>After comprehending the chaotic rules, Lin Yuan's perspective on the rules of the four directions of the world changed, as he gazed at them from a more fundamental level.</p><p></p><p>"This World Tree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze fell on the majestic tree in the center of his inner world. At this moment, the branches and leaves of the World Tree were full of many fruits, each containing a miniature world with many wondrous uses for 7th level evolvers to open their inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records of the Xuanhuang lineage, Chaotic Realm experts can mobilize a large amount of chaotic force to nurture the World Tree, causing it to metamorphose into a Chaotic Tree?"</p><p></p><p>If the World Tree was a 11-star supreme treasure, then the Chaotic Tree would be a 12-star supreme treasure. Even Chaotic Realm experts would have to spend a lot of time and effort to nurture a Chaotic Tree.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try it now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to operate the chaotic rules, gathering chaotic force to nurture the World Tree.</p><p></p><p>The uses of the Chaotic Tree were too many - it could anchor the inner universe, and even allow the inner universe to expand outwards.</p><p></p><p>At the Silver Galaxy Capital, Lin Yuan glanced at his personal merit point balance.</p><p></p><p>Over 100,150 billion merit points. </p><p></p><p>The 100 billion merit points were obtained from uploading the 11th level martial arts scriptures, and the additional 1.5 billion were his previous surplus.</p><p></p><p>"I'll directly advance to the 11th level citizen."</p><p></p><p>To advance from a 9th level citizen to a 10th level citizen required 500 billion merit points, while advancing from a 10th level citizen to an 11th level citizen required 50 billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>So far, the 11th level citizen was already the highest-ranking citizen in human civilization, with only nine Strongest Experts reaching this level.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention 11th level citizens, even for 10th level citizens, after the Star Sea History opened, only Lin Yuan had managed to accumulate enough merit points to advance.</p><p></p><p>The other 10th level citizens in human civilization were ancient citizens from before the Star Sea History, when the citizen advancement system was much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan had over 100 billion merit points, more than enough to meet the merit point requirement for advancing to an 11th level citizen. As for the other requirements for advancing to an 11th level citizen, such as needing the approval of the nine Strongest Experts, that was naturally not a problem for him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with the consumption of 50 billion merit points, Lin Yuan's citizen rank changed from '10th level' to '11th level'.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? No email notification?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan furrowed his brows. Normally, when advancing in citizen rank, there would be a flood of emails from the Central Star Domain introducing various welfare benefits.</p><p></p><p>When he advanced from a 9th level citizen to a 10th level citizen, the President of Human Civilization even personally contacted Lin Yuan to congratulate him on becoming a 10th level citizen.</p><p></p><p>But now, for his advancement to an 11th level citizen? At this moment, there was a video call request.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned it, his expression immediately becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan the Strongest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose to accept the call - the one applying to video chat with him was Xuanyuan the Strongest, the first and most powerful Strongest Expert of human civilization. If it weren't for Xuanyuan the Strongest, human civilization, even if it became the ultimate victor of the countless eras transmitted from outside the universe, would likely have been devoured by the many 12th level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan." Xuanyuan the Strongest smiled, a middle-aged man with an ancient appearance, looking at Lin Yuan with a gentle gaze. "Are you wondering why there was no other email notification after your advancement to an 11th level citizen?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>Even though his current frontline combat strength was not weaker than a normal Peerless Dao Realm expert, he still held great respect when facing the first Strongest Expert of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." Xuanyuan the Strongest laughed. "Actually, whether it's the three Goddesses or us, we didn't expect the next 11th level citizen to appear so soon."</p><p></p><p>"So we weren't prepared."</p><p></p><p>Not all Strongest Experts were 11th level citizens. Even if human civilization produced its tenth Strongest Expert, to become an 11th level citizen, they would still need to accumulate the corresponding merit points. However, the speed at which Strongest Experts earned merit points was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>But even so, accumulating 50 billion merit points still required Strongest Experts to invest a lot of time, even engaging in battles with 12th level ultimate beings from other races.</p><p></p><p>According to the speed at which experts like Xia Qin the Strongest advanced to 11th level citizenship, a new rising Strongest Expert would need at least 500,000 to 1 million years to smoothly advance to 11th level citizenship.</p><p></p><p>"I also didn't expect the 11th level martial arts scriptures to be worth so many merit points," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>100 billion merit points was indeed beyond Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Your 11th level martial arts scriptures will have a profound impact on human civilization. 100 billion merit points is still an underestimate," Xia Qin the Strongest shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, because of the 11th level martial arts scriptures, our human civilization has exposed more than ten deeply hidden 'spies'." Xia Qin the Strongest's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Spies?" Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, they used the 11th level martial arts scriptures as bait to 'fish' those alien spies.</p><p></p><p>"I digress." Xuanyuan the Strongest looked at Lin Yuan and spoke: "I've come to see you to personally tell you what powers the 11th level citizens of our human civilization will enjoy."</p><p></p><p>"The 11th level citizen will have an unprecedented impact on human civilization, so as long as there is a need, they can freely take any treasures from the human civilization's treasury."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

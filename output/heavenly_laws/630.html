        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is my Chaos Continent."</p><p></p><p>Looking down, Lin Yuan realized that the location he had chosen to establish the Chaos Continent was not within any void domain.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was in the desolate void between void domains, the chaotic void, where 90% of the area was barren void.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the barren void was the main body of the chaotic void, while the void domains were like small islands on the vast expanse.</p><p></p><p>The reason why cultivators mostly resided in a certain void domain was that the chaotic qi within the void domains was more concentrated, providing a better living environment.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial-temporal rules have already stabilized, and the other complex rules will operate and evolve on their own."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. With his strength, it had taken him several years to establish this Chaos Continent, which was already considered a painstaking effort on his part.</p><p></p><p>Although the Chaos Continent was established in the barren void, the spatial-temporal rules that Lin Yuan had invoked had directly devoured the vast amounts of chaotic qi in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>The notion that the barren void had sparse chaotic qi was based on the premise that the area of the barren void was too immense, and the total amount of chaotic qi was too low. On average, it would appear sparse.</p><p></p><p>However, if the chaotic qi from the surrounding vast areas could be concentrated in a small region, the chaotic qi would no longer be considered sparse.</p><p></p><p>Of course, most Chaos Supremes would not be able to achieve this, as the area involved would be too extensive.</p><p></p><p>Only Lin Yuan, whose spatial-temporal rules had reached the Ninth Realm, had the deep enough understanding of space-time to dare attempt this.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Chaos Supremes who wanted to establish a Chaos Continent would do so within an existing void domain, then occupy everything within that void domain.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a large group of Chaos Venerable had long been observing.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the news of the Silver River Sage establishing the Chaos Continent had spread from one to ten, and then to hundreds.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Venerables from thousands, even tens of thousands, of void domains nearby were rushing over, and even though most had not yet arrived, a large number had already gathered.</p><p></p><p>The number of Chaos Venerables was far greater than the scene when the Mysterious Yellow Universe was born.</p><p></p><p>When the Mysterious Yellow Universe was born, many Chaos Venerables had the self-awareness not to join the commotion.</p><p></p><p>But for the Silver River Sage establishing the Chaos Continent? Almost all the Venerables came, and if the main body did not come, their projections would still come, just to witness the subtle spatial-temporal attainments displayed by the Silver River Sage during the establishment.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, the Chaos Continent established by the Silver River Sage must be about one-tenth the size of a void domain!"</p><p></p><p>"Pulling in the sparse chaotic qi from the vast surrounding barren void, making the chaotic qi in the Chaos Continent extremely dense, such a method, such spatial-temporal attainments, no wonder he is the Silver River Sage."</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Sage is indeed benevolent, not establishing the Chaos Continent within a void domain, which would have squeezed the living space of the weaker tribes."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerables exclaimed in awe. Over these years, they had witnessed the establishment of an unprecedented vast expanse of land, from nothing to something, and they had also gained a lot themselves.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the cultivator, the more awe-inspiring they found the methods displayed by the Silver River Sage. Perhaps the newly promoted Chaos Venerables only saw the establishment of a boundless continent.</p><p></p><p>But the slightly more experienced Chaos Venerables could see the interweaving of spatial-temporal rules and the operation of myriad great Dao on this continent.</p><p></p><p>Some of the peak Venerables could even see the radiation and influence of this Chaos Continent on the surrounding infinite barren void, like the radiant glow of a blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>"You all can come in and have a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the gathered Chaos Venerables and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Continent not only served as a home base, but could also be developed into a trade and exchange center for the surrounding void domains.</p><p></p><p>Over time, it could accumulate a vast amount of wealth, which was in line with Lin Yuan's usual style.</p><p></p><p>He would absolutely not risk exploring secret realms and ruins if he could obtain resources through normal trade.</p><p></p><p>And allowing these Chaos Venerables to enter and observe would have a significant effect on establishing this Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p>"Thank you, Silver River Sage."</p><p>"Then we'll go in."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerables were excited and immediately began to enter the Chaos Continent in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Although all the spatial-temporal aspects of the Chaos Continent were under Lin Yuan's control, the Chaos Venerables were not worried, nor did they feel that the Silver River Sage would do anything harmful.</p><p></p><p>Given the strength the Silver River Sage had displayed, if he wanted to attack, he could have done so outside without inviting them in.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Silver River Sage on establishing the Chaos Continent."</p><p>"This Chaos Continent is so vast, I wonder if we can take up residence here."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerables who entered offered their congratulations and inquired about the possibility of commercial forces taking up residence.</p><p></p><p>With the reputation of the Silver River Sage and the scale of this Chaos Continent, it was inevitable that it would attract a large number of powerful cultivators over time, and the commercial settlement would also be a natural occurrence.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to collect billions of Chaos Stones as a welcoming gift this time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat at the center of the Chaos Continent, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Billions of Chaos Stones, even for a Chaos Saint, was a considerable fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Chaos Continent has been established, let's move the human civilization here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the ancient Chaos Continent, the 'Shard World' of Star Tears, whose environment was not bad, but naturally could not compare to the current Chaos Continent he had established.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred.</p><p></p><p>The entire Star Tears Shard World was then moved from the ancient Chaos Continent to the front of him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, human civilization, under the guidance of the Nine Supremes and Three Goddesses, began the great migration anew.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I thought our original homeland was pretty good, why are we migrating again?"</p><p></p><p>Many of the evolved humans were still unclear about the situation.</p><p></p><p>But they soon received a detailed explanation:</p><p></p><p>"Our human civilization's Silver Galaxy Supremes have now established a brand-new Chaos Continent, and we are to migrate there."</p><p></p><p>Silver Galaxy Supremes? Establishing a Chaos Continent? A small number of evolved humans took a deep breath, as their strength was sufficient, and they had enough understanding of the information they had accessed, naturally aware of what establishing a Chaos Continent meant.</p><p></p><p>At least one would need the strength of a Chaos Venerable to accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Silver Galaxy Supremes advanced into the Chaos Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just the Chaos Realm, but the Chaos Realm has been perfected, and the current Silver Galaxy Supremes are now known as the Silver River Sage."</p><p></p><p>Within the human civilization, information and news about Lin Yuan began to spread.</p><p></p><p>This information had previously been sealed by the Three Goddesses, as it involved the pillars of human civilization, but now, with Lin Yuan's strength, there was no need to keep it hidden anymore.</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother has become a Chaos Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Among the migrants to the Chaos Continent, the Star Sovereign of the Crimson Flood and many of his peak disciples gathered together, discussing this matter with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"It's been such a short time?"</p><p></p><p>The Star Sovereign of the Crimson Flood was also shocked in his heart. He had long known that Lin Yuan would inevitably lead the human civilization to the peak, but he didn't expect this day to come so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So sudden and unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Supremacy?</p><p></p><p>As the Lord of the Crimson Koi Star, due to his relationship with Elder Lin, he had some understanding of the various powerful existences in the Chaotic Void. The Chaos Supremacy, that is a Twelfth-Tier Perfected Existence. The reason why his home universe collapsed prematurely and entered the Great Destruction was because of the impact of the clash and slaughter between the two Chaos Supremacies.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Supremacy."</p><p></p><p>The Sacred Son of the Myriad Suns followed the many evolved beings of the Myriad Suns lineage, also beginning to migrate to the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Supremacy." The Sacred Son of the Myriad Suns was stunned. He had just learned some information about the Chaos Supremacy, and before today, he had no idea what the Chaos Supremacy meant.</p><p></p><p>Even with this brief understanding, the Sacred Son of the Myriad Suns realized how great the Chaos Supremacy was, and now, the Galactic Lord he had once fought against on the arena had also reached this level?</p><p></p><p>"I think I even won against the Galactic Supremacy once on the arena back then." The Sacred Son of the Myriad Suns swallowed, recalling his glorious battle record.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he didn't feel anything special, but now, that arena battle has become a memorable event in human civilization history.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the Galactic Supremacy, and since his birth, the Galactic Supremacy had rarely lost a battle.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the legacy I left behind would have such a great impact."</p><p></p><p>Ou Yin was migrating to the Chaotic Continent, and at this moment, he was filled with deep emotions.</p><p></p><p>Before his death, he had hidden his legacy in a corner of a foreign battlefield, originally just wanting to leave it for the future generations of human civilization evolved beings, but it ended up being obtained by the Galactic Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>Because of this relationship with the Galactic Supremacy Ou Yin, he received many privileges within the human civilization tribes, and when the great scholars of human civilization were studying the past deeds of the Galactic Supremacy, they gave a high evaluation of the legacy he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>Those legacies were nothing to Tenth-Tier or Eleventh-Tier evolved beings, but at the time, the Galactic Supremacy's strength was still weak, so it was like a first pot of gold.</p><p></p><p>"Opening the Chaotic Continent, the Galactic Supremacy."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of alien Dao Realm cultivators looked at each other in amazement. Originally, they had submitted to the Galactic Supremacy because of the threat of the universe's Great Destruction, but they didn't expect the one they had submitted to was actually a Supremacy, the Galactic Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>"Although our status is not as high as the evolved beings of the human civilization, we can still migrate to that Chaotic Continent, and we don't know how much stronger we are compared to those powerful tribes."</p><p></p><p>A Dao Realm cultivator from the Star Alliance spoke.</p><p></p><p>This statement was also recognized by the other alien Dao Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>You have to respect the master, let alone the current Galactic Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>"We should be grateful that we were born in the same universe as the Galactic Supremacy, otherwise we would have perished long ago."</p><p></p><p>An alien Dao Realm cultivator said with emotion. It is said that when one person attains the Dao, all his dogs and chickens ascend with him. The Galactic Supremacy, with his own power, has allowed the entire home universe to benefit immensely.</p><p></p><p>As long as they don't go against the Galactic Supremacy, even if they are now the Supremacy's servants, the resources they can enjoy will far exceed those of their peers.</p><p></p><p>A large number of humans quickly migrated, and although they had left their home universe for these years, the entire human civilization had been striving to reproduce, and the population had increased dozens or even hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the vast Chaotic Continent opened up by Elder Lin, it was still far from enough, like a drop of water in the ocean, completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Are those... all Venerable Ones?"</p><p></p><p>The Exalted Mighty One looked towards the outside of the Chaotic Continent, and at this moment, there were one after another terrifying auras entering.</p><p></p><p>Each of these figures gave the Exalted Mighty One immense pressure, but these existences were all cautious before entering the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"In my entire life, I've never seen so many Chaotic Venerable Ones gathered together."</p><p></p><p>The Numinous Deity Mighty One said. Such a large number of Venerable Ones gathering was indeed rare.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of the Galactic One."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin Mighty One couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if it weren't for the Galactic Supremacy, would these Venerable Ones..."</p><p></p><p>The other Mighty Ones nodded. The Chaotic Venerable Ones were high and mighty, with only seven or eight in a Void Domain.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Galactic Supremacy, which Venerable One would have come here with such effort?</p><p></p><p>In the Void, several figures appeared, looking towards the newly opened Chaotic Continent from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Hei Yao, you've come."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Supremacy glanced at the newcomer and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't come, how will I get the main battle body?" Hei Yao Supremacy shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Elder Lin offered ten billion Chaotic Stones to exchange for the main battle body, and although the price was high, it was still more cost-effective than cultivating a new main battle body.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, cultivating a new main battle body not only requires a large amount of resources, but also time.</p><p></p><p>"To gather the ten billion Chaotic Stones, I've owed a lot of favors."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Supremacy sighed with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"It's the same for everyone."</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Supremacy said.</p><p></p><p>The wealth of the Supremacies was mostly used on weapons and armaments.</p><p></p><p>As for Chaotic Stones? Not many. To gather enough Chaotic Stones in a short time, they either have to sell their personal weapons and armaments, or borrow them.</p><p></p><p>And to borrow Chaotic Stones from other Supremacies requires the payment of favors.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Chaotic Continent opened up by the Galactic Supremacy?"</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Supremacy began to observe the distant Chaotic Continent, and his expression became increasingly astonished.</p><p></p><p>With his eyesight, even though he had just arrived and did not witness the entire process of the Chaotic Continent's opening, he could still sense the suppression of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Supremacy's attainment in space-time comprehension must have already reached the Ninth Realm." The Savage Supremacy said beside him.</p><p></p><p>He had been here for quite some time, waiting for the other Supremacies to arrive, so that they could go together to pay their respects to the Galactic Supremacy. And he had also been observing the distant Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The more he observed, the more shocked he was.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time Ninth Realm comprehension?"</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Supremacy took a deep breath. As a Chaos Supremacy, he was very clear on how difficult it was to raise one's space-time comprehension to the Ninth Realm. It was only the Peerless Supremacies who could achieve this through the Chaotic Evolutionary Dao, and ordinary Chaos Supremacies basically had no such possibility.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, in that Posterior Universe, the Galactic Supremacy's space-time comprehension was not at the Ninth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Supremacy said. If at that time, Elder Lin's space-time comprehension had reached the Ninth Realm, he could have suppressed them, the Chaos Supremacies, without spending much time.</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Supremacies would not have been able to escape either.</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Supremacies' shattering of space-time power was indeed powerful, but faced with the suppression of the Ninth Realm space-time, unless they were deliberately holding back, it would be difficult for them to escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Galactic Supremacy was hiding his true strength?"</p><p></p><p>The Savage Supremacy speculated, this was the only possible explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Hiding his strength?"</p><p></p><p>Hei Yao Supremacy fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Chaos Supremacies like Tian Lu Supremacy were trembling inwardly. They had already been able to sweep away other Chaos Supremacies, and yet they were still hiding their strength? (Chapter end)</p>

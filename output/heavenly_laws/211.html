            <p>Chapter 211: Replacing the Ancestral Demon Tree, Lin Yuan's Choice (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountains, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was boiling. Terrifying spatial cracks appeared one after another, but they quickly healed under the recovery of the void itself.</p><p></p><p>If this place wasn't Lin Yuan's old lair that he had operated for more than a hundred years and stabilized the space through special means, perhaps even the void within a radius of tens of thousands of miles would have been shattered.</p><p></p><p>After all, the battle that had just taken place was too terrifying. In order not to give the Ancestral Demon Tree a chance, Lin Yuan didn't let his subordinates hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>Those foundations and hidden means were all thrown at the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, once Lin Yuan's stay was over, he would leave this world. Unless he paid the price of breaking the source power of the world, he couldn't take away a single bit of this world.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan had no intention of saving anything.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor? Are you still there, Ancestor?" Lin Yuan asked in a low voice after swallowing the essence of the Ancestral Demon Tree that had collapsed.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not get any response from the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't surprised. The moment the body of the Ancestral Demon Tree was torn apart, Lin Yuan had noticed that its aura had dropped to freezing point.</p><p></p><p>Now, he couldn't even sense a trace of the Ancestral Demon Tree's aura.</p><p></p><p>As a subordinate Demon Tree, sensing the aura of the Ancestral Demon Tree was instinctive.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far the distance or how many world barriers there were, at most it would just be a little more vague.</p><p></p><p>But it could definitely be sensed.</p><p></p><p>However, now the aura of the Ancestral Demon Tree, or rather its life fluctuations, seemed to have completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the Ancestral Demon Tree had completely fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed, looking a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to exchange a few moves with the Ancestral Demon Tree. He had told the Alliance Leader of Tianqing not to join hands and go all out.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, Lin Yuan's strongest hidden means was still himself.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountains, benefiting from the characteristics of the Demon Tree, Lin Yuan could exert his greatest combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do now?" At this time, the Alliance Leader of Tianqing and many subordinates stepped forward and respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Ancestral Demon Tree passed through the spatial passage, their offensive had never stopped.</p><p></p><p>Until Lin Yuan shouted "Stop", they stopped.</p><p></p><p>"You all go back."</p><p></p><p>The complete death of the Ancestral Demon Tree made Lin Yuan start to face the next problem.</p><p></p><p>That was the other subordinate Demon Trees.</p><p></p><p>First, he had to understand the secrets of the Demon Tree, a kind of alien evil god.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Demon Tree was the absolute ruler of countless Demon Trees. As long as it was alive, other subordinate Demon Trees would unquestioningly obey its orders.</p><p></p><p>This was a kind of mental and ideological restraint.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was physical restraint. The Ancestral Demon Tree could destroy any subordinate Demon Tree with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan was an exception.</p><p></p><p>He used the Gate of Myriad Realms to descend his consciousness into a subordinate Demon Tree that was about to die.</p><p></p><p>Although he replaced the original subordinate Demon Tree, he did not have the kind of mental and ideological restraint of loyalty to the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was mental and ideological restraint or physical restraint, they only existed when the Ancestral Demon Tree was alive.</p><p></p><p>Once the Ancestral Demon Tree died, the mental and ideological restraint and physical restraint would disappear.</p><p></p><p>Countless Demon Trees would produce a certain kind of thought in the dark.</p><p></p><p>That was to grow to the seventh stage and become the new Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to the queen ant in an ant colony.</p><p></p><p>If the queen ant died, it did not mean that the ant colony would collapse.</p><p></p><p>Instead, under the guidance of instinct, a new queen ant would be born.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan was facing this problem.</p><p></p><p>In the dark, he could sense other Demon Trees scattered far away.</p><p></p><p>These Demon Trees were the many hidden means left by the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Some helped the Ancestral Demon Tree guard certain treasures, while others discovered secret realms that needed to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>And now...</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor is dead."</p><p></p><p>"How could the Ancestor, who was so powerful, die?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor is dead, I want to become the new Ancestor!!!"</p><p></p><p>Losing the ideological restraint, countless Demon Trees developed ambitions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, freed from the physical restraint, the many innate abilities that belonged to the Ancestral Demon Tree also awakened in the subordinate Demon Trees.</p><p></p><p>"They all want to become the Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression revealed a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't care much about the Ancestral Demon Tree, after all, he had just killed a real Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan couldn't accept other Demon Trees stealing the fruits of his labor.</p><p></p><p>"Let me become the Ancestral Demon Tree."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this crossing was a descent of consciousness. No matter what he became in the crossing world, he would return to his original state after returning to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also wanted to experience the feeling of becoming an alien evil god.</p><p></p><p>The growth of the Demon Tree was divided into eight stages.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestral Demon Tree was said to be at the eighth stage, it had not actually completely entered it.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the Ancestral Demon Tree was still at the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>And on the premise that the Ancestral Demon Tree was completely dead, whichever Demon Tree grew to the seventh stage first would become the new Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>The seventh stage was a kind of limit for the Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>A seventh-stage Demon Tree could gradually break free from mental and ideological restraints even if the Ancestral Demon Tree was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Ancestral Demon Tree would never allow a seventh-stage Demon Tree to be born.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan was already at the peak of the sixth stage. The reason why he had been reluctant to enter the seventh stage was that he was worried about arousing the vigilance of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no such restriction.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the suppression of the Ancestral Demon Tree, apart from Lin Yuan, the highest growth stage of all other subordinate Demon Trees was only the fifth stage.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to reach the seventh stage in a short period of time, even if they had "unlocked" many of the innate abilities of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan had no pressure at all.</p><p></p><p>After a little preparation, Lin Yuan began to challenge the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for a sixth-stage peak Demon Tree, challenging the seventh stage had risks.</p><p></p><p>Each stage of the Demon Tree was a major transformation for itself.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, the risk was almost zero. After devouring a large amount of essence from the previous Ancestral Demon Tree, plus the assistance of his extraordinary comprehension, if Lin Yuan still couldn't reach the seventh stage, he might as well end the crossing early and return to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, Lin Yuan grew into a seventh-stage Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan entered this stage, a strange feeling came over him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan could not perceive the existence of other Demon Trees.</p><p></p><p>But the death of the Ancestral Demon Tree allowed Lin Yuan to vaguely perceive the many Demon Trees in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many demon trees.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a slight perception, still a slight perception due to the "competitive" relationship between each other.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, other demon trees could also sense Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>Before the birth of the new progenitor demon tree, all demon trees had an "equal" status.</p><p></p><p>But now, after growing to the seventh stage, this "slight perception" turned into complete control.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether the other party was willing or not.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan could control the life and death of any demon tree.</p><p></p><p>Simply put.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was now the progenitor demon tree.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan advanced to the seventh stage and became the new progenitor demon tree.</p><p></p><p>All demon trees received this information at the same time, and new thoughts and ideological restraints were reshaped.</p><p></p><p>From then on, these demon trees were absolutely loyal to Lin Yuan, and the wild ambitions that had arisen due to the death of the previous progenitor demon tree not long ago vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>This was the demon tree race.</p><p></p><p>As long as the progenitor demon tree was alive, the entire race had only one will - that of the progenitor demon tree.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had just become the progenitor demon tree and had not acquired many "permissions", many demon trees still retained the ability to actively contact the progenitor.</p><p></p><p>And now, these demon trees, without exception, offered their congratulations, without any other thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually responded with a few words.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the cruelty and ferocity of the previous progenitor demon tree, Lin Yuan considered himself quite kind.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, bring all the treasures and come towards me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan issued orders to all the demon trees.</p><p></p><p>Why did the previous progenitor demon tree leave subordinate demon trees in many areas?</p><p></p><p>It was nothing more than discovering some treasures, some rare spiritual items from outside the domain, that could not be picked in a short time or were still maturing, so he let the subordinate demon trees guard them first.</p><p></p><p>And then come to harvest them when they were ripe.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>The progenitor demon tree had left him a very large inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor, I will go now."</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor, from my current position, it will take 320 years to reach your side."</p><p></p><p>The many demon trees began to report their own situations. For ordinary lives to cross the outer domain.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem was "endurance", that is, how to survive.</p><p></p><p>The void of the outer domain did not have the various mild energies of the inner world, and it was not easy to survive in such a harsh environment.</p><p></p><p>However, demon trees had the ability of "void roots". Lin Yuan only needed to open this ability to all subordinate demon trees.</p><p></p><p>After roughly handling the issues of the many demon trees.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind once again came to his own body.</p><p></p><p>"Progenitor Demon Tree, the feeling of an outer domain evil god is very special?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's branches swayed. Entering the seventh stage and becoming the new progenitor demon tree, Lin Yuan's body had already swelled to a size of ten thousand meters.</p><p></p><p>Even the entire Black Mist Mountain Range could be overlooked at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, Lin Yuan's body size was still rapidly growing. It could be foreseen that it would grow to the huge height of the progenitor demon tree that had previously spanned the outer domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also acquiesced to this and did not suppress or conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Because now Lin Yuan had no need to hide. The entire Cyan World was in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>What was there to hide?</p><p></p><p>"The origin of the Cyan World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked towards the earth. The perception unique to the progenitor demon tree made him feel the fluctuations of the vast world origin.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could not only perceive the fluctuations of the world origin but also had the ability to merge into the vast ocean of the world origin.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the entire origin of the Cyan World would become Lin Yuan's meal on a plate, to be devoured at will.</p><p></p><p>This was a unique ability belonging to the progenitor demon tree, completely different from methods such as "void roots". Only the progenitor demon tree itself could master it.</p><p></p><p>It was the "uniqueness" ability in the entire demon tree race.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the progenitor demon tree was eager to enter the interior of the Cyan World, completely unafraid of being surrounded and annihilated by other powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the Cyan Alliance Leader wielding the World Sword could exert battle power surpassing the outside world within the world.</p><p></p><p>The progenitor demon tree descending into the Cyan World was easily caught in a trap, like a turtle in a jar.</p><p></p><p>But the progenitor demon tree still yearned to do so, relying on being able to merge into the vast ocean of the world origin.</p><p></p><p>Even the Cyan Alliance Leader could not enter the vast ocean of the Cyan World's origin.</p><p></p><p>If the progenitor demon tree entered, it was equivalent to standing on invincible ground and could happily devour the world origin and rapidly grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for the many consequences caused by devouring the world origin, such as the decline of the Cyan World or even its destruction.</p><p></p><p>That was not something the progenitor demon tree needed to care about.</p><p></p><p>"Now if I'm willing, I can also merge into the world origin and easily devour the entire origin of the Cyan World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even the instinct coming from the progenitor demon tree at this moment was urging Lin Yuan to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I am not the progenitor demon tree."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, he was just a passerby in this world. When his time limit for staying was up, he would leave without taking anything.</p><p></p><p>Devouring the entire origin of the Cyan World could indeed enhance the foundation of the progenitor demon tree and even push it a step further towards the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>But what did that have to do with Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan was willing to pay a huge price to bring the progenitor demon tree back to the main world, otherwise no matter how strong the progenitor demon tree became, it would not have much impact.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's heart, maintaining the stability of the Cyan World and allowing it to carry the spread of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>That was the choice that maximized the benefits.</p><p></p><p>At least it could provide assistance for Lin Yuan's future "ultimate leap".</p><p></p><p>"Even if it devours the entire origin of the Cyan World, the progenitor demon tree cannot step into the eighth stage. The eighth stage is the legendary end of the road for the demon tree race."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The cultivation system of the progenitor demon tree relied on tapping into its own potential.</p><p></p><p>Even if it really entered the eighth stage, it would not produce a "high-level" assistance for him.</p><p></p><p>So</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Lin Yuan never thought about devouring the origin of the Cyan World, because for him, it was harmful and not beneficial.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan continued to comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the progenitor demon tree, Lin Yuan also mastered many methods that only the progenitor demon tree possessed. These could all be considered for incorporation into the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Making the martial dao evolution path more perfect and adaptable to more harsh environments.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share this website on Facebook.

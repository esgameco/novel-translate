        <h1>Chapter 556</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's expression was somewhat fanatical, even... ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Just like a cat seeing a mouse.</p><p></p><p>This reaction left Red Mei and Zhao Yan dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>After all, just from hearing the description of the Xueong Master, they knew how powerful, terrifying, and even desperate the enemy they were facing was.</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful, yet unkillable.</p><p></p><p>How do you fight and kill such an enemy?</p><p></p><p>The Xueong Master also had a hesitant look, with a confused expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, many geniuses had asked him about the existence of the Black Heavens and Black Lands, and all who heard his narration were filled with despair and gloom.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan, with his fanatical expression, was an exception.</p><p></p><p>He seemed not to be a person of the Divine Wood Universe, but rather one of the Black Heavens and Black Lands.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of White Moon is truly exceptional," Qi Yuan was even about to swallow his saliva.</p><p></p><p>This expression puzzled even the usually calm Xueong Master.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, the Xueong Master's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Devilish Gods... have arrived."</p><p></p><p>He was not anxious, only regretful, as if he was also reminding Qi Yuan to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Devilish Gods?" Qi Yuan squinted his eyes, "What Devilish Gods? This is my beloved White Moon!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan rose from the recliner and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sky and earth suddenly darkened.</p><p></p><p>A huge shadow replaced the vast expanse of the land.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Blood City, many civilians subconsciously looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>When they saw those massive beings, many people were stunned, abruptly sitting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Some kept kowtowing, with snot and tears flowing.</p><p></p><p>"The Devilish Gods have descended!"</p><p></p><p>"I told you, those guys shouldn't have rebelled and provoked the wrath of the Devilish Gods!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, ninety-nine Devilish Gods gathered.</p><p></p><p>The smaller ones were only a few hundred zhang in size, while the larger ones spanned dozens of li.</p><p></p><p>The descent of the Devilish Gods blocked out the sun, giving a sense of the arrival of a vast celestial army.</p><p></p><p>However, to describe them as a celestial army would be an overstatement.</p><p></p><p>No one knew, not even the strongest in the Divine Wood Universe, the Primal One, that in the core of the Black Heavens, the Yang Gods... were only ranked as celestial soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at these Devilish Gods, his gaze falling on the familiar Dark-Eyed Devilish God: "So you're still alive!"</p><p></p><p>The Dark-Eyed Devilish God looked at Qi Yuan with some trepidation, but thinking about the other Devilish Gods behind him, he became confident.</p><p></p><p>"Mere human, how do you know the greatness of Lord Kaihuang? You killed me, but with Lord Kaihuang here, I can be revived at any time!"</p><p></p><p>The Dark-Eyed Devilish God said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>The other Devilish Gods also eyed Qi Yuan with malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>As for the Xueong Master...</p><p></p><p>In their sight, the Xueong Master seemed to not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qi Yuan's joy only increased.</p><p></p><p>This was an experience package.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't scare them away.</p><p></p><p>He pondered deeply, trying to find a way to lure all these Devilish Gods down.</p><p></p><p>But after much thought, he couldn't come up with a good plan.</p><p></p><p>Even if his acting skills were excellent, he would still give the impression that they could easily kill him.</p><p></p><p>However, they had not cast any debuff spells, so he could just die a few times and then flee.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, you don't run upon seeing us. It seems that even a withered mythical legend has such confidence," the white-bearded Kaihuang spoke, his face as confident as ever.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I run?" Qi Yuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Especially his left eyebrow, it was jumping frantically!</p><p></p><p>It was jumping so fast that it seemed to have stopped.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan knew that this was a sign of great fortune and blessing.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, with mythical power and the Mandate of Heaven favoring you, you have the qualifications and confidence to not fear us," Kaihuang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>It was true that in the fallen regions of other worlds, even if the Devilish Gods gathered together, they might not be able to subdue Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately... you have encountered me!" </p><p></p><p>Kaihuang's face flashed with a sharp gleam.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan suddenly felt a powerful, massive force pulling him in.</p><p></p><p>This force was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>His left eyebrow twitched violently again.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Qi Yuan shouted, "What is this? Don't pull me in!"</p><p></p><p>Although he shouted this, Qi Yuan did not resist at all, but rather seemed to be actively diving into that precious object.</p><p></p><p>The Feathered Devilish God saw this and flattered, "As expected of a Devilish God from the Black Heavens and Black Lands, Lord Kaihuang's treasure can easily draw in even mythical experts."</p><p></p><p>The other Devilish Gods echoed, "Even the mythical ones are powerless against it."</p><p></p><p>Kaihuang was filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>The effect of this treasure was even better than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's all enter the treasure, don't keep the human waiting."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the nearly hundred Devilish Gods swiftly entered the treasure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan stood quietly in the treasure.</p><p></p><p>The treasure was ethereal, like a true vacuum, occasionally revealing some meteorite fragments or stellar debris.</p><p></p><p>When Kaihuang and the other ninety-nine Devilish Gods entered, a look of apprehension appeared on Qi Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Can't get out of here?" </p><p></p><p>His voice trembled, as if he had a little fear.</p><p></p><p>Before Kaihuang could speak, the Feathered Devilish God said, "This treasure was bestowed by Lord Kaihuang's uncle. Even Yang Gods cannot escape from it."</p><p></p><p>Kaihuang nodded in satisfaction, and added, "Not even at the first level."</p><p></p><p>Seemingly, he was dissatisfied with the Feathered Devilish God for underestimating the treasure.</p><p></p><p>"So strong? Doesn't that mean... we all have to stay here?" Qi Yuan looked very apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was just trying to gather more information.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this treasure has its own sentience... As long as you die, or we all perish, we can then leave," Kaihuang did not mind telling a dead man more.</p><p></p><p>This behavior was like pushing the enemy's minions into their own crystal, not attacking the tower, and taunting in front of the enemy's fountain while waiting for them to revive, occasionally showing off a famous sword to block the fountain's attack.</p><p></p><p>"I don't die, and you can't get out?" Qi Yuan's eyes widened, looking very... fearful and worried.</p><p></p><p>His nose did not grow longer, which meant the other side was not lying.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, now you're afraid, aren't you?" the Dark-Eyed Devilish God said.</p><p></p><p>"Look at him, being a mythical legend, his body trembling, not even better than a commoner!"</p><p></p><p>"But don't underestimate him, he's still a mythical expert!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, although Lord Kaihuang has many Devilish Origins, we can't waste them."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, wasting a little won't matter, I... have many Devilish Origins, and my uncle has many too," Kaihuang said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this information, Qi Yuan suddenly burst into laughter: "Hahaha haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>This behavior startled the Devilish Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>"Is he crazy?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze turned to Kaihuang, his eyes burning with fanaticism: "So you're called Kaihuang, eh? After you die, I'll erect a tomb for you in the Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was always deeply devoted to his White Moons.</p><p></p><p>To ensure their inheritance was not completely devoured by others, he would personally take care of the White Moons' legacy.</p><p></p><p>As for Kaihuang, he was even more considerate, wanting to erect a tomb and offer sacrifices to him.</p><p></p><p>Although Kaihuang did not have an elderly aura.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Yuan's eyebrow was twitching, comparable to refining the Heavenly Emperor's Banner, even stronger by a fraction.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" Kaihuang raged.</p><p></p><p>The other dozens of Devilish Gods were also furious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now, you can only rely on your eloquence!" </p><p></p><p>Facing the attacks of the gods, Qi Yuan's expression was light and casual: "In order to play with you properly, I have decided... to temporarily not become a mortal!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan decided to temporarily not become a mortal.</p><p></p><p>This decision is akin to... seeing a beautiful woman on a certain platform, and commenting: "For you, I'm willing to get a villa and luxury car for free."</p><p></p><p>"Courting death!" Qi Huang raged.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-eight mysterious gods did not hesitate at all, rushing towards Qi Yuan. "Together with you!"</p><p></p><p>Dazzling death! Powerful strength!</p><p>Absolute adaptability!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qi Yuan's combat power was at its peak.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had slain the Phoenix Cry with a single sword, fusing the embryonic form of the universal laws.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his full firepower unleashed, his combat power was even stronger than when he was a mortal.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p></p><p>With just a single sword strike, Kai Chi, who was ranked among the top three, was slain. Kai Chi was a great Saint who had stepped on the Heavenly Path.</p><p></p><p>Slain with a single sword strike?</p><p></p><p>The other mysterious gods were stunned, somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang narrowed his eyes: "Unexpectedly... you actually have the combat power of a fully empowered mythical being."</p><p></p><p>This was far stronger than the decaying mythical beings.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it weren't for their mysterious origins, they might not even be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>"As the Mandate Bearer, you are blessed by the Mandate. If it were other mysterious gods, perhaps you could have turned the tables on them, but unfortunately, you have encountered me!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it were Uncle Luan, he would certainly die today, let alone you!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Luan was the mysterious god who had defeated the mortal Qi Yuan a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't worry... just self-detonate, a quick victory, to give this human a little... shock from the Black Sky."</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was a fool with money.</p><p></p><p>His mysterious origins were endless, and he had no fear of consumption.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other mysterious gods did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Human, let you see the gap between us!"</p><p></p><p>"Despair!"</p><p>"Fear!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, ninety-seven dazzling fireworks rose up.</p><p></p><p>This kind of tremor, if unleashed in the outside world, would be enough to tear the heavens and earth apart.</p><p>In the Qinglan Realm, it could almost sink a entire continent.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks landed on Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was like firecrackers going off, cracking and popping.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>"It hurts so much!"</p><p>"Wah wah wah, I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan shouted frantically, his acting reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>As for the injuries?</p><p>There were none.</p><p></p><p>The embryonic form of the rules, forged by Absolute Adaptability and Death Radiance, allowed him to be immune to any power weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>These attacks couldn't even tickle him.</p><p></p><p>But he had to keep wailing.</p><p></p><p>His experience bar was also rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had experimented before, and the monsters he had "killed" by scaring them to death had also given him experience points.</p><p></p><p>These exploding attacks naturally caused his experience to skyrocket as well.</p><p>In just a few breaths, he had leveled up by 1 whole level.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive..." Qi Huang was stunned, "Is this the peak of mythology?"</p><p></p><p>The other self-detonating mysterious gods also revived one by one, looking at Qi Yuan with astonishment.</p><p>They saw Qi Yuan's weak and fragile appearance, obviously severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"But we are all in our prime state, the advantage is mine!" Qi Huang said proudly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Kai Chi stepped forward: "Lord Qi Huang, I wish to slay him!"</p><p>He was unsatisfied after being slain by Qi Yuan earlier.</p><p></p><p>"He is the Mandate Bearer, although he only has a thread of life left, you going to slay him will certainly not be a match." Qi Huang said grandly, "I'm in a hurry, continue self-detonating."</p><p></p><p>The other mysterious gods saw this and did not hesitate.</p><p>They self-detonated again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah!"</p><p>"It hurts so much I'm going to die!"</p><p>"Mom!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan wailed again, his aura seeming to have only a thread left.</p><p></p><p>When the revived mysterious gods looked at Qi Yuan again, they all felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>One drop of blood and he still wouldn't die? Has he been blood-locked? Qi Huang narrowed his eyes: "Is this the Mandate Bearer? Self-detonate again, twice is not enough, three times, five times, ten times should be enough!"</p><p></p><p>His mysterious origins could support the revival of Realm Lord-level mysterious gods many times over.</p><p></p><p>"Mandate Bearer, even when you encounter me... you have to kneel down!" Qi Huang was full of confidence and domineering.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Academy looked at the disappeared mysterious gods and Qi Yuan, his expression complex.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yan gritted his teeth, the events of today were too much, each one exceeding his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qi... should not have died in this battle." The Academy Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>He made a decision.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of a bronze mirror, a mysterious aura permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The bronze mirror reflected a dilapidated battleship.</p><p></p><p>The dried blood stained the battle flag, and the gaping hole the size of a bowl was pitch black, bottomless.</p><p></p><p>On the battleship, various divine artifacts and ancestral divine artifacts were placed.</p><p>Looking closely, one would find that the battleship was covered in weathered scars, as if it had been left behind on an ancient battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifted, and a towering man was reflected in the bronze mirror.</p><p></p><p>In tattered robes and armor, his long hair scattered, blood dripping from his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... I need your help." </p><p></p><p>The other person in the bronze mirror was none other than Yuan, the strongest in the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p>The second layer of the Solar Deity, at the peak of the Great Principle Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Yuan spoke, his voice aged, yet with an eternal solar brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"In the Kuijin Realm, I discovered a Mandate Bearer, his aptitude... is very high.</p><p>He is only one step away from becoming an Ancestral Deity. If he breaks through and establishes himself, he may have the potential to reach your level in the future." The Academy Master said.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's handsome face revealed a bitter smile: "Is he very dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Academy Master answered.</p><p></p><p>"Within ten years, two Ancestral Deities will come to the Kuijin Realm to bring him to the Taixing Realm."</p><p></p><p>The scene in the bronze mirror disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Academy Master let out a sigh of relief: "I hope he can survive the next ten years, after that, everything may still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>The Academy Master looked at Red Plum, his gaze filled with sorrow: "Alright, it's time for us to leave... the Kuijin Realm."</p><p></p><p>Red Plum was stunned, looking at Zhao Yan with a reluctant expression: "Teacher, I..."</p><p></p><p>The Academy Master shook his head: "He is different from you, he belongs to the Kuijin Realm. Let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and three years had gone by in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Now, the situation in the Kuijin Realm was rather peculiar.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious gods had disappeared, and the rebel army was marching triumphantly, occupying many cities.</p><p>Everywhere was in a state of great battle.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other cities, Cloud Blood City was much quieter.</p><p></p><p>Chen Kang was eating a bun, stuffing it into his mouth: "Don't worry, the young master is a deity descended from the heavens, the world could be destroyed and he would still be fine!"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Shen Lingxuan's cold face had a hint of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Kuijin Realm, a man in blue robes appeared, his face filled with intense battle intent.</p><p></p><p>"Good job, Qi Yuan, to avoid my challenge, you actually hid in the Kuijin Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I still found you!"</p><p></p><p>"Soon, you will know who is the true number one expert of the Heavenly Path Five Steps!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

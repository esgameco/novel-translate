        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing was stationed at the most critical core of the great formation, and he also sensed the chaos within the city.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of peak Sovereign Realm puppets were acting recklessly, and the fluctuations of their aura were hard to ignore.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the Lord's order to have us guard the core of the formation, would a mere few hundred puppets be any trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>A few hundred peak Sovereign Realm puppets were nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the strongest Sovereign Realm experts of Qingfan City had all been ordered by the Qingfan Lord to guard the formation cores. </p><p></p><p>This allowed these peak Sovereign Realm puppets to rampage freely.</p><p></p><p>As for the Qingfan Lord's decision, Feng Wanxing understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>As long as the formation core was secure, Qingfan City would be as stable as Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>As for the destruction caused by those peak Sovereign Realm puppets? It was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord must have been held up by the Purple Dream Lord."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing's thoughts fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>With the Qingfan Lord's strength, dealing with those puppets would be a trivial matter. </p><p></p><p>But since he was allowing it to continue, he must have been held up.</p><p></p><p>"The Purple Dream Lord is holding the Lord back, just to let these puppets rampage?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing pondered carefully, feeling that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even care about the damage caused by the puppets' rampage, as the losses to Qingfan City were very low.</p><p></p><p>Although Feng Wanxing didn't know how the Purple Dream Lord was holding the Lord back, it must have come at a cost.</p><p></p><p>But to pay that cost just to let Qingfan City suffer this negligible loss?</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait until the Lord is free to speak about this."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing planned to raise his doubts when he next saw the Qingfan Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The twelve formation cores in the city are all being guarded."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing looked towards other directions.</p><p></p><p>So far, the other eleven formation cores had not been attacked, and everything was normal.</p><p></p><p>"And there's the junior brother."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing looked towards the direction of Fanshen Hall again. "The junior brother is still inside Fanshen Hall."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing was very clear about how much the Qingfan Lord valued Lin Yuan. If the junior brother encountered any problems during the Purple Dream Domain's rampage, the Qingfan Lord would likely be enraged.</p><p></p><p>But now, the junior brother was still fine, and had not left Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>As long as he remained within Fanshen Hall, the junior brother's safety was assured. The defensive capabilities of Fanshen Hall were the best in Qingfan City, even surpassing his own.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the twelve formation cores are fine, and the junior brother is fine, let those puppets rampage as they please."</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing no longer paid attention to the chaos within the city.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman and other powerful experts were constantly shuttling through the void, passing through every corner of Qingfan City, and the faint glow of the Array Crystallization Stones was gradually revealing the formations within their range.</p><p></p><p>"There are only two formation cores left."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was delighted, and the other powerful experts also wore smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>So far, their movements had not been discovered, as all of the Qingfan Lord's peak Sovereign Realm disciples were guarding the formation cores, not caring about what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to approach the formation cores and use the Array Crystallization Stones to remotely copy them, then they could leave calmly without attracting any attention.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahead is Fanshen Hall, where the Qingfan Lord's most valued junior disciple is cultivating."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thin man following the purple-haired woman suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Fanshen Hall?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman also glanced over, as Fanshen Hall was also an important node within the city's formations, and they needed to pass by it to copy the formations.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>They quickly arrived near Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman used the Array Crystallization Stone to copy the formations around Fanshen Hall, and was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>But the hunched old woman beside her suddenly spoke up, "Since the Qingfan Lord values this junior disciple so much, if we were to kill him, wouldn't that be a great accomplishment?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other powerful experts' eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>Among the tens of thousands of disciples the Qingfan Lord had taken in, even Feng Wanxing could only address the Lord as "My Lord". </p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that even if Feng Wanxing were to perish, the Qingfan Lord probably wouldn't even furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? Not only had the Qingfan Lord personally left Qingfan City, he had also allowed Lin Yuan to address him as "Master", and had been almost unconditionally accommodating to him in recent times, even letting him use the usually restricted Fanshen Hall for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how much the Qingfan Lord valued Lin Yuan, and how terrifying Lin Yuan's talent and potential must be, to make the Qingfan Lord, a peak Great Sage, act in such an uncharacteristic manner.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, since we still have plenty of time, and the Qingfan Lord's peak Sovereign Realm disciples are all guarding the formation cores while he is held up by our Master, why don't we try it?" the thin man said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they wouldn't even have the chance to lay eyes on Lin Yuan, given the Qingfan Lord's regard for him.</p><p></p><p>But now, taking advantage of the conflict between the Purple Dream Domain and the Qingfan Domain, they had the opportunity to approach Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I think we should give it a try as well," another Purple Dream Domain expert spoke up.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, killing Lin Yuan would be a great accomplishment, a tangible benefit.</p><p></p><p>In the long run, with Lin Yuan's terrifying talent and potential, he would become a major threat to the Purple Dream Domain if allowed to grow.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to try to eliminate him now rather than wait for him to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Even if they failed, there would be no real loss, as they still had plenty of time left in Qingfan City to copy the remaining formations.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Qingfan Lord's wrath would be provoked if they killed Lin Yuan? The Purple Dream Domain and the Qingfan Domain were already enemies, so it wasn't like the Qingfan Lord would let them off the hook even if they didn't kill Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's give it a try," the purple-haired woman decided after a moment of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>She also wanted to see what kind of disciple the Qingfan Lord had cultivated so meticulously.</p><p></p><p>Since they had decided to act, the purple-haired woman and the others didn't hesitate, instantly appearing in front of Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Fanshen Hall is one of the Qingfan Lord's cultivation seclusion places, and he has even let his valued junior disciple reside there, so it must be protected by a powerful formation. We need to act quickly. If we find the formation can't be broken, we'll just leave immediately."</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman was clear on their purpose - to copy all the formations in the city. Killing the Qingfan Lord's valued junior disciple was just a bonus, if they succeeded. If not, it wouldn't delay their main task.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," the other experts nodded, agreeing that they would just try it out, as there was no real downside.</p><p></p><p>Inside Fanshen Hall, Lin Yuan looked out.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had already sensed the purple-haired woman's group when they used the Array Crystallization Stone to copy the formations around Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>But following the Qingfan Lord's instructions, he simply continued his cultivation without any particular thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, now they had actually appeared in front of Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>"What do they want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the pavilion, which was still within the protective range of Fanshen Hall's formations.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Qingfan Lord's new junior disciple?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman saw Lin Yuan and didn't say anything further, immediately attacking.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a hazy purple energy began to envelop Fanshen Hall, and the other powerful experts from the Purple Dream Domain also unleashed their various techniques, holding nothing back, seeking to kill Lin Yuan as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>The information the purple-haired woman's group had obtained about Lin Yuan was that before becoming the Qingfan Lord's disciple, he had only reached the Eighth Realm.</p><p></p><p>With their half-Saint Realm strength, even with the protection of the formations, as long as their power could seep through, Lin Yuan would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying auras slammed towards Fanshen Hall.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, an invisible barrier rose up around Fanshen Hall, and the attacks of the more than ten half-Saint Realm experts were all blocked by this barrier without making a sound, quickly dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful defensive formation?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman's expression became grave, and she immediately abandoned the idea of continuing the attack.</p><p></p><p>She could see that the defensive formation of Fanshen Hall was terrifyingly powerful, and even true Saint Realm experts would have difficulty breaking it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingfan Lord really dotes on this junior disciple."</p><p></p><p>The other Purple Dream Domain experts sighed inwardly. Fanshen Hall was not even a formation core, yet its defensive capabilities likely surpassed even the formation cores.</p><p></p><p>And this was because Lin Yuan lived there? The Qingfan Lord had specially adjusted the formation's coverage area for him?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. There's no point wasting time here."</p><p></p><p>They had to leave, as they still needed to copy the remaining formations.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman immediately planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful cultivators from the Purple Dream Realm did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all the strength you have?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the Fengtianyuan for a while, seeing the power displayed by the purple-haired woman and the others. Although their attacks were all blocked by the formation, Lin Yuan was able to estimate their strength.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lin Yuan's divine sense emerged from his body and actively left the Fengtianyuan, stepping out of the range of the formation's coverage.</p><p></p><p>Since moving into the Fengtianyuan, Lin Yuan was very satisfied with the cultivation environment. He had also witnessed the purple-haired woman's chaos in Qingfeng City.</p><p></p><p>If he was unsure of the purple-haired woman's strength, Lin Yuan would naturally be cautious and heed the Qingfeng Marquis' advice to hide inside the Fengtianyuan and not come out.</p><p></p><p>But now? The strength of the purple-haired woman and the others was just average. Lin Yuan immediately had the idea of helping the Qingfeng Marquis deal with these people.</p><p></p><p>Of course, out of caution, Lin Yuan did not send out his true body, but rather a divine sense projection.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if an extreme situation were to occur, such as the purple-haired woman hiding her true strength or there being a peak Venerable or Celestial Venerable-level expert nearby that Lin Yuan couldn't detect, he would only lose a divine sense projection, which he could easily re-condense.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman and the others were about to leave when they suddenly noticed a figure emerging from the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-haired woman immediately stopped, looking at Lin Yuan with some disbelief. Why would he come out of the Fengtianyuan instead of hiding inside?</p><p></p><p>"You all come from the Purple Dream Realm? Sneaking around here, it's definitely not for any good reason," Lin Yuan said, looking at the purple-haired woman and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Attack directly."</p><p></p><p>The thin man's figure disappeared, merging into the space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had actively come out of the Fengtianyuan, which he saw as a great opportunity. Although he speculated that Yuyan must have some trump card to dare come out, didn't he have his own as well?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>A powerful cultivator from the Purple Dream Realm let out a cold snort, and an invisible soul fluctuation appeared, silently enveloping Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Not only did the thin man seize the opportunity, but the other powerful cultivators from the Purple Dream Realm also sensed the chance and almost instantly struck, not even giving Lin Yuan time to react.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Realm cultivator who had launched the soul attack furrowed his brows. Soul attacks were supposed to be instantaneous, so his soul attack should have been the first to land on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, this soul attack had completely disappeared, as if it had sunk into a muddy pond, leaving no feedback at all.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Dream Realm cultivator was somewhat doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying attacks came crashing down towards Lin Yuan, arriving within a few dozen feet of him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"The defensive formation hasn't appeared?" the purple-haired woman slightly faltered.</p><p></p><p>She had originally thought that Lin Yuan had come out fearlessly because he was still within the defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>But now, their attacks were about to hit Lin Yuan, and there was still no trace of the formation's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Yuyan's clone?" the hunchbacked old woman glanced at the Fengtianyuan, having some speculation in her mind. "Whether it's a clone or not, he's doomed."</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>A figure materialized on Lin Yuan's right side - it was the thin man. He stretched out his right hand, reaching towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the purple-haired woman immediately turned to leave. She didn't even need to look to know that Lin Yuan was already doomed. The thin man's physical body was renowned as the strongest among the Purple Dream Realm's Venerables, and he could even withstand several attacks from a Venerable without dying in the pure physical realm.</p><p></p><p>Being so close to the thin man, even the purple-haired woman would feel a chill, let alone Lin Yuan, who would have no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the strength you dare to intrude here with?" Lin Yuan glanced at the thin man reaching out his hand, casually waving his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Although the one who had come out of the Fengtianyuan was just a divine sense projection, with the secret art "Illusory Reality," the divine sense had transformed into a physical body, and its combat power was not much weaker than his true body.</p><p></p><p>Many physical body techniques, the 13th-generation inheritance "Infinite Void," and even the Blazing Sun Divine Body could be cultivated by the divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum!</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan casually waved his hand, the thin man who had just reached out to grab him suddenly had a drastic change in expression, immediately vomiting several mouthfuls of fresh blood. His form and spirit began to disintegrate, until finally, a faint green light emanated from his body, barely stabilizing the injury. He then hastily retreated backwards.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the purple-haired woman and the remaining observing Purple Dream Realm cultivators somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Kuang, he..." the purple-haired woman couldn't quite believe this scene. "He was directly severely injured, and if it weren't for the Patriarch's Life Tear, he might have already died?"</p><p></p><p>Brother Kuang's physical body was unparalleled in the Purple Dream Realm, and even a Venerable's attack might not be able to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Yet, Lin Yuan had just casually waved his hand, and Brother Kuang had already died once?</p><p></p><p>This was something the purple-haired woman could not accept. Even if Lin Yuan had some trump card or defensive method to come out of the Fengtianyuan, it should have been to evade the thin man's attack, not to directly counterattack and severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>But now? Rumble, rumble.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the attacks from the other Purple Dream Realm cultivators also landed, but all of them started to burn upon touching Lin Yuan's clothes, continuously burning and dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, run, he's a Venerable, he's a Venerable!!" the thin man, Brother Kuang, hastily transmitted a message to the purple-haired woman and the others, not even looking back as he fled.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Life Tear, a treasure that could save his life, he would have already been completely destroyed by Lin Yuan's casual wave of the hand. To be able to casually strike him and cause such severe injury, it could only be explained by the fact that Lin Yuan was a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the only thing on his mind was to escape.</p><p></p><p>As for why the junior disciple of the Qingfeng Marquis was a Venerable and other doubts, he didn't have the time to think about them.</p><p></p><p>"A Venerable?" the purple-haired woman's pupils contracted, also planning to flee.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!! Space began to condense from all directions, like amber, trapping all the Purple Dream Realm cultivators inside.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to run?" Lin Yuan took a step forward, appearing behind the thin man, and pressed down with his hand.</p><p></p><p>The thin man's physical body began to collapse again, this time without the Life Tear to save him. In the end, only a wisp of his soul remained, which Lin Yuan then suppressed and collected.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand again.</p><p></p><p>The remaining dozen or so Purple Dream Realm cultivators, nine of them had their physical bodies start to burn uncontrollably, turning to ash in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>From the time Lin Yuan actively came out of the Fengtianyuan until now, with just a few strikes, more than half of the Purple Dream Realm's quasi-Venerable experts had perished, leaving only the purple-haired woman and a few others barely hanging on by relying on their life-saving treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the few surviving powerful cultivators had expressions of terror on their faces. Facing Lin Yuan, they not only couldn't contend with him, but they couldn't even resist, feeling as fragile as ants.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Blazing Sun Divine Fire? What Venerable are you?" the purple-haired woman asked, seeing her fellow disciples burned to ashes, a hint of fear appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Divine Fire of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country could only be used by those who had fully awakened the Blazing Sun Divine Body. To fully awaken the Blazing Sun Divine Body, one would need to be at least at the peak of the Mastery Realm, and possess extraordinary natural talent.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to be able to kill these quasi-Venerables as easily as killing chickens, it was basically certain that he was a Venerable. And a Venerable who had awakened the Blazing Sun Divine Body? That would be extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense." Lin Yuan struck again, reaching towards the remaining few Purple Dream Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Lin Yuan's arm suddenly expanded, piercing through space and appearing in front of the remaining Purple Dream Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>These few Purple Dream Realm cultivators were trapped inside the spatial prison Lin Yuan had set up, their speed greatly reduced. Combined with the fact that they had already exhausted all their life-saving treasures to resist the Blazing Sun Divine Fire earlier, they could only watch helplessly as their physical bodies were pierced by Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Their soul consciousness was suppressed, and then they were casually collected by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The purple-haired woman also faced Lin Yuan's grab.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Lin Yuan's grab seemed ordinary, not even particularly fast.</p><p></p><p>But in the purple-haired woman's eyes, this grab encompassed all of space-time. No matter how she tried to evade or resist, it was meaningless, as if she was destined to be pierced by this grab.</p><p></p><p>At the core of the critical formation of Qingfeng City.</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing was sitting in meditation, strictly following the Qingfeng Marquis' orders to guard this place.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"That place?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Wanxing sensed something, suddenly looking up towards the direction of the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt a fierce spatial fluctuation coming from that direction.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Feng Wanxing immediately became anxious. "My junior disciple is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

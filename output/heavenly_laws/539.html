        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This time, the physical divine ability I've awakened..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart rate accelerated. </p><p></p><p>From the process of nurturing physical divine abilities, one could conclude -</p><p></p><p>The longer the nurturing time, the more powerful the divine ability that is nurtured.</p><p></p><p>After all, the martial dao evolution path's screening of physical divine abilities is entirely based on the principle of survival of the fittest.</p><p></p><p>If a divine ability is not powerful enough, yet takes a long time to nurture,</p><p></p><p>It simply won't become the final awakened divine ability, but instead a divine ability of the same bloodline level that takes less time to nurture will be chosen.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years of nurturing time far exceeds the combined time of the previous six physical divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Merely two thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. After entering the twelfth stage, time was the most abundant resource. Not to mention two thousand years, even twenty thousand or two million years would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>Just the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And nurturing physical divine abilities wouldn't interfere with cultivation. For example, restricting one's power to a certain realm, Lin Yuan wouldn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>"The nurturing of physical divine abilities is not only related to one's bloodline, but is also influenced by the external environment. So using time acceleration methods, where an instant passes in the outside world but thousands or tens of thousands of years pass for oneself, would produce some unpredictable variables in the nurturing of divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, this descent to the Origin World had no time limit for staying, so Lin Yuan didn't plan to take this risk. He would just wait slowly for the physical divine ability to finish nurturing.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Blazing Sun Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shifted his attention to observe the changes in his physical body.</p><p></p><p>After condensing 3,333 Blazing Sun Seeds, all the seeds would form a cycle, influencing and transforming the physical body.</p><p></p><p>This was what Duke Qing Fen referred to as the 'Blazing Sun Divine Body'.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious. From reading countless classics and inheritances of the Burning Sky Academy, he knew how powerful the Blazing Sun Divine Body was. The physical body would be like a blazing sun, illuminating and burning everything.</p><p></p><p>Especially under the eternal blazing sun of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country, the power it unleashed was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"The Duke said I would need ten thousand years for my physical body to transform into a true Blazing Sun Divine Body, but it should only take three to five thousand years at most."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As the number of condensed Blazing Sun Seeds increased, the speed of transformation into the Blazing Sun Divine Body would become faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Duke Qing Fen probably hadn't expected that Lin Yuan would condense another eight to nine thousand Blazing Sun Seeds in just one year at the Burning Sky Academy.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun Seeds can't be replicated in the Chaos Void, probably due to the different dimensions. But what about the Blazing Sun Divine Body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. Whether it was constitution or divine ability, they were all special ways of operating certain rule powers. As long as one comprehended them thoroughly, they could be universally applied.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't plan to have his true self transform into a Blazing Sun Divine Body, but he could experiment on his avatar.</p><p></p><p>After all, this constitution was so powerful that it was no weaker than the miraculous lifeforms nurtured in the Chaos Void. It could definitely take his avatar's strength to the next level.</p><p></p><p>Main Universe.</p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos rules evolve into myriad daos. What should my dao be?" Lin Yuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>His experience in the Blazing Sun Ancient Country of the Origin World had brought Lin Yuan's understanding of rules to a whole new level.</p><p></p><p>This was understanding, not comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang. My dao is yin and yang. I want to evolve Chaos Yin and Yang."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes burst with intense color. The martial dao he walked was rooted in yin and yang. The rotation of yin and yang forms taiji, the Chaos Taiji.</p><p></p><p>Duke Qing Fen's path was the dao of fire, so the power he ultimately evolved was Chaos Fire. To be precise, it was Duke Qing Fen's unique Chaos Azure Fire.</p><p></p><p>Even for the same dao of fire, due to different beings' different comprehensions, what is manifested can be very different.</p><p></p><p>Duke Qing Fen's dao of fire lay in 'azure' and 'burning', so it was called Chaos Azure Fire.</p><p></p><p>"With my current comprehension of chaos rules, I probably can't evolve Chaos Yin Yang Taiji." Lin Yuan tried briefly and came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan's comprehension of chaos rules was at the first level. To evolve Chaos Yin Yang Taiji, he would probably need to reach the second level.</p><p></p><p>The levels of comprehension for other rules ranged from the first to the ninth level, and it was the same for space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>But for chaos rules, there were only three levels.</p><p></p><p>The first level was the lowest, and the third level was the highest.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to improve my comprehension of other rules." Lin Yuan had a clear idea.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time eighth level." Lin Yuan turned to comprehend space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Now his attainment in comprehending space-time fusion rules had reached the peak of the seventh level, just a step away from the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>As long as he reached the eighth level of space-time comprehension, using space-time to drive the comprehension of myriad rules, and then advancing his comprehension of chaos rules, he should be able to enter the second level of chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The internal universe has been adjusted more or less."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, looking towards his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Since mastering the first layer of 'Infinite Void', Lin Yuan's internal universe had reached the level of a Chaos Venerable, and he had begun to adjust it.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that there were imperfections in his internal universe, but rather that compared to the starry sky of the main universe, the pressure in Lin Yuan's internal universe was too great.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's internal universe was only twenty million light-years across, but the starry sky of the main universe far exceeded this size.</p><p></p><p>Under these circumstances, why could Lin Yuan's internal universe rival the starry sky of the main universe? It was because the space-time in Lin Yuan's internal universe was extremely stable. The so-called rivaling of the main universe's starry sky was not in terms of size, but in overall aspects.</p><p></p><p>This caused normal first and second order lifeforms to have great difficulty living in Lin Yuan's internal universe, as if they had come to a place where gravity was thousands or tens of thousands of times that of the main universe's starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Even for</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even high-level evolvers found it extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Lin Yuan had been adjusting constantly.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the upcoming universe collapse, Lin Yuan's internal universe needed to accommodate all the citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the universe's collapse has long been made public in human civilization," Lin Yuan looked towards the starry universe.</p><p></p><p>The news of the universe's collapse, along with the large-scale transfer of citizens, attracted more attention from the public. Subsequently, with the consent of the three goddesses, it was officially announced.</p><p></p><p>There were strict criteria for citizens who could be transferred to the new universe. First, evolvers above the sixth level and citizens above the fourth level would all be able to transfer to the new universe and survive the upcoming collapse.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice - evolvers above the sixth level had the potential to advance to high-level evolvers, while citizens above the fourth level had made significant contributions to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of human civilization as a whole, they were more qualified to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for more ordinary citizens and evolvers, a lottery system was adopted to determine eligibility for transfer.</p><p></p><p>On average, about one in every 120 ordinary citizens and evolvers would be selected to transfer to the new universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as countless planets in the starry universe entered his view.</p><p></p><p>On one life-bearing planet.</p><p></p><p>A huge space battleship was docked.</p><p></p><p>"All citizens selected for transfer eligibility, please proceed to the spaceport as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Messages were automatically sent to every citizen on the planet, repeating constantly.</p><p></p><p>"If you do not arrive at the spaceport within three days, you will be considered to have automatically forfeited your transfer eligibility."</p><p></p><p>"If you do not arrive at the spaceport within three days, you will be considered to have automatically forfeited your transfer eligibility."</p><p></p><p>"If you do not arrive at the spaceport within three days, you will be considered to have automatically forfeited your transfer eligibility."</p><p></p><p>"Dad." </p><p></p><p>A daughter looked at her father reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>"What are you waiting for? You've been selected for transfer eligibility, do you know how many people envy you? Hurry to the spaceport."</p><p></p><p>The father smiled: "As for your mother and me? We've lived most of our lives, born here, lived here, grown old here, and dying here is quite good too."</p><p></p><p>"Dad, we want to stay here with you." The children were in tears, extremely reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Stay?"</p><p></p><p>"You're still young, why would you stay here to wait for death with me?"</p><p></p><p>The father glared, "Hurry up and go, I still need to comfort your mother."</p><p></p><p>"If you stay, your mother and I won't rest easy even in death."</p><p></p><p>The father's tone was stern, frightening the children into shrinking back.</p><p></p><p>"Go quickly."</p><p></p><p>The father turned and went back inside.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the children hesitated for a moment, but still boarded the flying vehicle and headed towards the spaceport.</p><p></p><p>Inside, the father sat with a middle-aged woman, watching the flying vehicle disappear into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they survive, it's fine," the father said softly.</p><p></p><p>The civilization transfer plan had been ongoing for hundreds of years until now.</p><p></p><p>There were too many life-bearing planets, but limited transfer battleships, so they could only evacuate bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>During the transfer period, scenes of farewell were constantly occurring.</p><p></p><p>Especially for families where only one person was selected for transfer, they could only part with other family members.</p><p></p><p>Many citizens who were selected for transfer couldn't bear this separation, and simply gave up their transfer eligibility, choosing to stay behind with family and friends.</p><p></p><p>At the No. 3 Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Supreme Being and eight other human Supreme Beings gathered to discuss the migration of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"All citizens who have obtained transfer eligibility have arrived at the designated locations and need us to send them into our respective internal universes."</p><p></p><p>The Yudie Supreme Being spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Beings also nodded in agreement, ready to act at any time to send citizens into their internal universes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form appeared on the only empty throne, and he slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Supreme Being."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the others' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The other eight Supreme Beings also looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"How is the civilization transfer plan progressing?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"There haven't been any problems," said the Xiaqin Supreme Being. "However, many citizens selected for transfer have voluntarily given up their spots, leading to several additional rounds of selection."</p><p></p><p>"They're giving up their spots because they don't want to be separated from loved ones," the Xushen Supreme Being said from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Alas," Xuanyuan Supreme Being and the others sighed.</p><p></p><p>They also felt powerless, wishing they could take all citizens away, but it wasn't realistic.</p><p></p><p>The more citizens taken away, the greater the backlash they would face during the universe's collapse. If they took too many and couldn't survive the collapse, the losses would be even more devastating.</p><p></p><p>Not only would all life in their internal universes die, but the Supreme Beings themselves would perish completely.</p><p></p><p>"There's a change to the civilization migration plan."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at all the Supreme Beings and said.</p><p></p><p>"A change?"</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme Beings were startled. A change?</p><p></p><p>"I can take away all citizens of human civilization," Lin Yuan said directly without beating around the bush.</p><p></p><p>"Take away all citizens?"</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme Beings looked at each other, taking a long time to react.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Supreme Being, to take away all citizens of human civilization, the backlash from the universe's origin consciousness that you'd have to face..."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Xuanyuan Supreme Being collected his thoughts and couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"The universe's origin consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chuckled lightly and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"It can no longer do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

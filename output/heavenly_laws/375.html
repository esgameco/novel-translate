        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the twenty years within the two-dimensional world, only two to three months had passed in the main universe. </p><p></p><p>The virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was exchanging intelligence with the Vice Patriarch Nalan. </p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, the powerful figures from the various major forces had basically all started joining hands.</p><p></p><p>Even those unique special lifeforms were no exception.  </p><p></p><p>In the main universe, those eleventh-level sixth-rank special lifeforms were terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>But in the two-dimensional world, the peak eleventh-level lifeforms had not fully grown yet, and might even die at the hands of some ninth or tenth-level lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The power limit in the two-dimensional world was not high, even an eighth-level lifeform could easily reach it.</p><p></p><p>Under the same power limit, the peak eleventh-level lifeforms, relying on their formidable spiritual will and comprehension skills, might be able to sweep through ten eighth-level existences of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>"Can't really depend on outside forces." Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. </p><p></p><p>But it needed time to grow.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the vast continent of the two-dimensional world, the ancient nations were enormous entities that transcended gathering spots and cities.  </p><p></p><p>As one of the twelve ancient nations, the capital of the Moran Ancient Nation was extremely prosperous.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.  </p><p></p><p>The topics were mostly concentrated on cultivation, as well as the whereabouts of some extremely famous foreign powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>There, the probability of encountering powerful experts from the main universe was simply too high.</p><p></p><p>But comprehension? Even with the blessings of his lofty wisdom, Lin Yuan believed his comprehension far surpassed those eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh-level lifeforms would definitely surpass Lin Yuan in terms of speed of thought processing and mastery of basic powers.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>It meant there was a high possibility of other powerful experts from various races heading there.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension, given the same starting point...</p><p></p><p>"The Moran Ancient Nation?" Lin Yuan's brows raised slightly.  </p><p></p><p>The peak eleventh-level lifeforms had not grown to their limits yet, and could truly be beheaded if careless.</p><p></p><p>The vast continent in the two-dimensional world was too vast, unable to rely on spatial rules to teleport, so traveling was a big issue.  </p><p></p><p>The peak eleventh-level experts needed time, and Lin Yuan also needed time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan simply did not want to go to crowded places.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered inwardly, and since he confirmed he could not leave through external forces, he began to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted a bit more with Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>This hope was not very high.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as long as the eleventh-level lifeforms were given time, they were destined to surpass the eighth-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign, if you have any issues, you can contact me anytime," Vice Patriarch Nalan said in the end.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had been waiting for news of the supreme experts. If those supreme experts could refine that 'blank paper', they would definitely have the ability to pull him out.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign, the evolutionary of my human civilization has already established a base in the capital of the Moran Ancient Nation. Are you interested in coming over?"</p><p></p><p>Although over 100 million powerful experts from various races had fallen into the two-dimensional world, they were scattered across the vast continent, appearing extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>But what about hundreds or thousands of them? One must know that over 100 million powerful experts from various races had fallen into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The Luochuan Gathering Spot was a large gathering spot, but far from being comparable to a city-level force, let alone an ancient nation-level force.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was confident he could go higher and further than those peak eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to those eleventh-level lifeforms, my biggest advantage is still my comprehension."</p><p></p><p>But from the current look of things...</p><p></p><p>However, before completely clearing out the other foreign powerful experts, the evolutionary of the human civilization was still very united internally.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan only knew of twelve ancient nations, each one established by a Sage Ancestor and ruling over vast territories.</p><p></p><p>"My current location is too remote, the Moran Ancient Nation is too far away," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, casually making up an excuse.</p><p></p><p>Although in this two-dimensional world, every time the heavenly gate opened, only one person could leave.</p><p></p><p>"For now, the Luochuan Gathering Spot I'm at is still very safe, without any traces of foreign powerful experts," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Vice Patriarch Nalan smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>The Luochuan Gathering Spot.</p><p></p><p>"That's really too bad," Vice Patriarch Nalan sighed, not insisting further.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh-level experts, relying on their mastery of power, could still rise up again even if starting over from scratch.</p><p></p><p>The truly powerful experts from various races basically all gravitated towards prosperous areas, as there were more resources there to aid their strength's improvement.</p><p></p><p>But this advantage of comprehension could not be directly converted into combat strength.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the early stages of cultivation, following this two-dimensional world's cultivation system, the demand for comprehension was not that great.</p><p></p><p>The five great realms of Shaman, Shaman King, Shaman Emperor, Shaman Sovereign, and Sage Ancestor - those eleventh-level lifeforms only needed to follow this two-dimensional world's cultivation method and cultivate up step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>The place that truly required the use of comprehension was after the Sage Ancestor realm.  </p><p></p><p>After the Sage Ancestor realm, with no path forward, if one wanted to continue improving their strength, they had to rely on themselves to pioneer a new path.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension would display its tremendous advantage.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, before the Sage Ancestor realm, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed could not match those peak eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But after reaching the Sage Ancestor realm, Lin Yuan would be able to crush those peak eleventh-level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan rejected Vice Patriarch Nalan's invitation and hid in the remote Luochuan Gathering Spot.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could endure through the initial cultivation stage, those eleventh-level lifeforms would be waiting to be flattened by him.</p><p></p><p>Before then, Lin Yuan did not wish to have too much contact with those powerful experts from various races.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years of time, I'll also cultivate to the peak of the Shaman Emperor realm," Lin Yuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he did not hide here but went to more prosperous areas and relied on the vast resources there, Lin Yuan might have already crossed into the Shaman Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>But that kind of behavior carried the risk of prematurely coming into contact with powerful experts from various races.</p><p></p><p>The tallest blade of grass gets cut first - exposing himself too early could very likely cause him to be targeted by those with ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"At the peak of the Shaman Emperor realm, my true combat strength should not be weaker than a Shaman Sovereign," Lin Yuan knew inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the native powerful experts, Lin Yuan was an outsider with a broader perspective. His mastery and application of power was streets ahead of native Shaman Emperors of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, over these years, Lin Yuan had created various killing techniques and tactics by relying on his heaven-defying comprehension, bringing his combat methods to an astonishing level.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the Shaman Sovereign realm. According to my deductions, it is a very crucial stage, related to whether I can unleash my full potential after crossing into the Sage Ancestor realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently pondered. From the very start of his cultivation, Lin Yuan had already begun deducing the path after the Sage Ancestor realm with his heaven-defying comprehension, clearly understanding the importance of the Shaman Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, starting from the Shaman Emperor realm, Lin Yuan had gradually abandoned this world's original cultivation system and begun creating a cultivation method completely suited for himself and adapted to this world.</p><p></p><p>"Still need to draw reference from a great deal of this world's cultivation methods, otherwise crossing into the Shaman Sovereign realm will probably waste a lot of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial dao evolution was also created by observing and learning from numerous other evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was deep in thought...</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly transmitted over.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Lin Yuan glanced towards the door.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a scrawny little man walked in.</p><p></p><p>This scrawny little man was named Cha Ranggu, the controller of the Luochuan Gathering Spot, a Shaman King-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Twelve years ago, after Lin Yuan crossed into the Shaman Emperor realm, he casually took control of Cha Ranggu, becoming the true master of this large gathering spot.</p><p></p><p>Of course, outsiders did not know Lin Yuan's identity, with everything happening in secret.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Cha Ranggu was extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew just how terrifyingly powerful Lin Yuan's strength was.</p><p></p><p>Initially when Lin Yuan appeared before him saying he wanted to take over the gathering spot, Cha Ranggu did not take it seriously. But the events that followed still made him tremble in fear until now.</p><p></p><p>The strength Lin Yuan revealed far surpassed a Shaman King. Many years ago, Cha Ranggu had coincidentally witnessed a Shaman Emperor-level expert, but it seemed even they were inferior to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Did you get any results on the matter I asked you to investigate?" Lin Yuan calmly asked.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to seclude himself in the Luochuan Gathering Spot, then this entire Luochuan Gathering Spot had to be under his control - this was the reason Lin Yuan took control of Cha Ranggu.</p><p></p><p>After becoming the true master of the Luochuan Gathering Spot, at the very least the cultivation resources for the Shaman Emperor stage were alleviated to a great extent.</p><p></p><p>But it was only an alleviation, not enough to satisfy the vast resources Lin Yuan needed to cross into the Shaman Sovereign realm next.</p><p></p><p>So not long ago, Lin Yuan had Cha Ranggu keep an eye out for information in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the traces of the Eighteen Demonic Thieves of Mount Yun have been confirmed," Cha Ranggu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Demonic Thieves of Mount Yun referred to eighteen extremely vicious Shaman Kings.</p><p></p><p>These eighteen Shaman Kings were all at the peak of the Shaman King realm, committing all sorts of evil deeds, with numerous bounties and wanted orders on their heads.</p><p></p><p>Roughly calculated, the bounty on each Shaman King added up to over 200,000 shaman crystals, making it a sky-high price of nearly 4 million shaman crystals for all eighteen Shaman Kings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan needed vast resources for his cultivation, but how to obtain them?</p><p></p><p>The fastest way was plundering, but the risks were too high and it was too high-profile.</p><p></p><p>Whereas taking on the bounties and wanted orders from the ancient nations to hunt down those with huge bounties on their heads was the safest method Lin Yuan could think of.</p><p></p><p>First, killing those fugitives would not lead to any future repercussions, and responding to the ancient nations' wanted orders would definitely ensure his identity remained confidential.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could obtain a huge bounty reward while also acquiring the wealth carried on the Eighteen Demonic Thieves themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan recently committed another major crime and were being pursued by a sovereign-level expert. In the end, they fled to this surrounding area. </p><p></p><p>As the local power, the Luochuan Gathering Place, with Charan Valley operating here for many years, immediately locked onto the general area where the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan were currently located.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to deal with the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan, you must be careful. They have cultivated a combined attack technique. When joining forces, even sovereigns have to retreat before them," Charan Valley said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The combined bounty on the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan was nearly 40 million spirit crystals, a fortune that even sovereigns crave immensely. </p><p></p><p>But over the years, the Eighteen Robbers have roamed freely. More than one sovereign has tried to hunt them down, but all have failed.</p><p></p><p>A few sovereigns were even injured by those eighteen robbers, suffering considerable losses.</p><p></p><p>Charan Valley was in awe of Lin Yuan's strength, but when facing such ferocious foes as the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan, one could never be too careful.</p><p></p><p>Dongyuan City.</p><p></p><p>This was the closest city to the Luochuan Gathering Place, and a rare large city.</p><p></p><p>On the prosperous and lively streets, Lin Yuan walked at ease. His appearance and figure had changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>Since he planned to kill the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan, Lin Yuan naturally accepted the bounty mission first.</p><p></p><p>If he killed them first before accepting the bounty, it could lead to disputes.</p><p></p><p>Bloodrain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>This was the official bounty posting location established by the Bloodrain Empire.</p><p></p><p>It was specifically used to put bounties on extremely vicious criminals. Anyone could also post bounties on certain individuals here.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered Bloodrain Tavern, and someone immediately came to receive him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you here to accept or post a bounty?" The hunchbacked old man receiving Lin Yuan had a deep gaze as he calmly looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Accept a bounty," Lin Yuan glanced at the hunchbacked old man. </p><p></p><p>Although the other party was hiding his strength, Lin Yuan could see at a glance that he was a sovereign-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not at the peak of sovereignty, but rather an elderly sovereign whose power had declined with age.</p><p></p><p>In this two-dimensional world, there was no concept of comprehending rules. One's strength was based solely on the physical body.</p><p></p><p>So once one entered old age and one's blood energy declined, their strength would drop rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It was said that after reaching the Sage realm, one's blood energy would coalesce, maintaining its peak until the moment of death.</p><p></p><p>"Whose bounty are you accepting?" The hunchbacked old man asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan," Lin Yuan said. Only by accepting their bounty at Bloodrain Tavern first could Lin Yuan then complete the mission and collect the reward.</p><p></p><p>The reward of spirit crystals would be issued directly by Bloodrain Tavern, a currency used across the twelve ancient nations without any issues.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the hunchbacked old man looked at Lin Yuan in slight surprise and couldn't help but ask, "Whose bounty are you accepting?"</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan were all peak Sovereign Kings. With their combined attack technique, they could even shake Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>To accept their bounty, one would need at least Sovereign strength.</p><p></p><p>But this young man before him was a Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan," Lin Yuan repeated.</p><p></p><p>"The current bounty for the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan is 60 million spirit crystals. To accept their bounty, you need to submit 10,000 spirit crystals as 'proof'," the hunchbacked old man said.</p><p></p><p>One couldn't just accept any bounty they wanted.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, someone could accept all the bounties at once, affecting those truly capable of completing them.</p><p></p><p>So Bloodrain Tavern had long established a rule.</p><p></p><p>Those accepting a bounty had to submit a certain fraction of the reward amount in spirit crystals as 'proof'.</p><p></p><p>As long as the bounty target was successfully killed, the 'proof' deposit would be fully returned.</p><p></p><p>If unsuccessful, part of the deposit would still be returned.</p><p></p><p>This was to raise the threshold for accepting bounties.</p><p></p><p>"60 million?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that the combined bounty for the Eighteen Robbers was less than 40 million previously.</p><p></p><p>An average of just over 2 million spirit crystals per person.</p><p></p><p>But now it was 60 million?</p><p></p><p>"Half a year ago, the Eighteen Robbers raided the treasury of the Northern Prince of Bloodrain Empire. In a rage, the Northern Prince personally offered spirit crystals to raise their bounty to 60 million," the hunchbacked old man said this with some deeper meaning as he glanced at Lin Yuan. "For the Eighteen Robbers to so easily breach the Prince's treasury, their strength must be higher than imagined."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you still want to accept their bounty?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan's expression didn't change.</p><p></p><p>The Eighteen Robbers' strength was higher than imagined?</p><p></p><p>Even if all eighteen of them reached Sovereign realm, with Lin Yuan's strength rivaling Sage realm, he could easily kill them all.</p><p></p><p>"Here is the bounty order."</p><p></p><p>"After killing the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan, bring back their crucial body parts to claim the reward here."</p><p></p><p>The hunchbacked old man didn't try to dissuade him further, stating the tavern's rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the bounty order and left Bloodrain Tavern.</p><p></p><p>In a vast expanse of primordial forest, Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information Charan Valley obtained, the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan were last tracked to this forest," Lin Yuan looked at the lush ancient trees before him, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Sovereign or even Sage experts, it would be extremely difficult to find the Eighteen Robbers in such a vast forest.</p><p></p><p>Having fled for so many years, the Eighteen Robbers must be extremely cautious, alerted by the slightest movement.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. As a Tenth-Stage Evolution, although many of his abilities were suppressed in this two-dimensional world, his keen perception of auras remained.</p><p></p><p>Even from a great distance, he could vaguely sense them - an 'advantage' all peak experts possessed upon descending to this world.</p><p></p><p>"At most, it will take half a day to search through it all," Lin Yuan's figure vanished, moving at an utterly silent speed as he began searching every corner of the primordial forest.</p><p></p><p>In a valley deep in the primordial forest, the Eighteen Robbers of Yunshan had gathered...</p><p></p><p>(The excerpt ends here)</p>

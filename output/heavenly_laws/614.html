        <h1>Chapter 614</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many great Dao rules governing the rotation of the dark yellow cosmic universe all retreated and made way. That eternal blazing sun spanning the center of time and space, wherever its sunlight shone, was its domain.</p><p></p><p>"The great Dao rules of this post-heaven universe are much more oppressive than the great Dao rules of the outside chaotic void. Now that the great Dao rules within the universe have retreated, it is surely the same in the chaotic void."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage stabilized his form, finding it hard to believe: "This is the power to create a void with a single thought, something only a peerless great sage can achieve? The place you stand, the surrounding time and space rules are all defined by your own self?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's just that the Dao rules have retreated, not to the extent of defining your own rules. You are not a peerless great sage."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the power Lin Yuan displayed, even if he was not a peerless great sage, far surpassed theirs.</p><p></p><p>At least the Savage Sage acknowledged that he was no match, not even needing to engage in battle.</p><p></p><p>"How is he so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Sage was also greatly shocked. Previously, in the outer dark yellow universe, he had still thought he could delay Lin Yuan with his killing moves, which was why he was the first to enter the dark yellow universe.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan had indeed put some pressure on the Dual Source Sage.</p><p></p><p>But that was just the pressure of facing an opponent at the same level.</p><p></p><p>But now? Was this still an opponent at the same level? "If you all want to live..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there, looking down at the chaotic sages, his tone calm: "Then swear to immediately withdraw from this universe and not approach within a million universes for eternity."</p><p></p><p>Except for the Demon Shadow Sage and the Nine Phoenix Sage, Lin Yuan had no major grievances with the other chaotic sages. As long as they did not continue to stay in the dark yellow universe, he did not mind letting them off this once.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he could not achieve complete eradication, as these chaotic sages all had many life-saving methods. Even if they died in this universe, they would revive in other hidden places.</p><p></p><p>They might not even need to revive.</p><p></p><p>"Immediately withdraw from this universe?" The Black Obsidian Sage's black obsidian domain could only be maintained within a radius of ten thousand miles around him. He looked at Lin Yuan with an unsightly expression: "Not just withdraw from this palace, but directly withdraw from this entire universe?"</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's current burst of power, the Black Obsidian Sage no longer planned to stubbornly resist. If possible, he would directly take the Black Darkness Palace and go to other areas to seek treasure opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Since this universe could give birth to a treasure at the peerless great sage level, it could also give birth to a second, a third. Even if he could not obtain a treasure at the peerless great sage level, at least he could obtain a treasure at the chaotic sage level. Otherwise, wouldn't this trip have been in vain? The Black Obsidian Sage had also paid a heavy price to arrive in the vicinity of this universe as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't your appetite a bit too big? Not a peerless great sage, yet wanting to do the things a peerless great sage does?" The Dual Source Sage also stared at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The time and space formed around Lin Yuan as the center indeed exerted great suppression, far exceeding the Black Obsidian Sage's black obsidian domain.</p><p></p><p>If it was just the Dual Source Sage alone, he certainly wouldn't have said these things, because he truly had no means to resist the suppression of the surrounding time and space.</p><p></p><p>But now, in addition to the Dual Source Sage, there were eight other chaotic sages, two of whom were powerful great sages.</p><p></p><p>If the nine chaotic sages joined forces, not to say defeat Lin Yuan, at least they could fight him.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, even if they ultimately lost, the Dual Source Sage believed he had a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength, no matter how strong, was ultimately not that of a peerless great sage.</p><p></p><p>"Correct." The Savage Sage swept a glance at the Dual Source Sage and the Black Obsidian Sage, also staring at Lin Yuan: "This Black Darkness Palace can be given to you, but asking us to withdraw immediately is a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Sage had been severely slashed by the Myriad Law Eye, and he was still feeling the pain. He similarly did not want to give up.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Blessing Sage, the Nine Phoenix Sage, and the other ordinary sages were slightly hesitant. Unlike the Dual Source Sage and the Savage Sage, they truly felt the risk of perishing under the suppression of the surrounding time and space.</p><p></p><p>The three powerful great sages dared to speak up because they had a chance to save their lives, but the six of them? Although their physical bodies would not be completely destroyed if they perished now, to rebuild their peak strength through life-saving methods would require a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>"We nine can only protect ourselves by joining forces." The Dual Source Sage immediately transmitted a message to the six chaotic sages.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these six chaotic sages, although not as good as theirs, could still divert some of Lin Yuan's attention when they fought. This would also lighten the pressure on the three powerful great sages.</p><p></p><p>"If you retreat, it's equivalent to giving up this universe. I can tell you an intelligence, the creator of this universe is a peerless great sage close to the Invincible Sage, whose strength is unimaginably powerful."</p><p></p><p>"The treasures and rarities contained in the universe he left behind are just the beginning. Are you willing to give it up just like that?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Sage did not hesitate to reveal the information he knew in order to get the six chaotic sages to stand on his side.</p><p></p><p>"A peerless great sage close to the Invincible Sage?" The Heavenly Blessing Sage's pupils shrank slightly. He knew the significance of the Invincible Sage - in the boundless chaotic void, only one era was allowed to have one Invincible Sage, and in fact most eras did not have an Invincible Sage.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was a peerless great sage? To make them wholeheartedly acknowledge it, the strength must absolutely surpass, making other peerless great sages feel hopeless and unable to match it, only then would a recognized Invincible Sage appear.</p><p></p><p>Invincible Sages were too rare and scarce, and a peerless great sage close to the Invincible Sage was also not many, at least their strength must surpass other peerless great sages of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Heavenly Blessing Sage and the other chaotic sages thought the creator of this post-heaven universe was just a normal peerless great sage, but a peerless great sage close to the Invincible Sage?</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenix Sage, the Demon Shadow Sage, and a few other chaotic sages also had their thoughts changed.</p><p></p><p>A post-heaven universe left behind by a peerless great sage close to the Invincible Sage, who knew how many millions of universes it would take to encounter one.</p><p></p><p>As these newly ascended sages, to encounter a universe of this level was absolutely a rare opportunity that was hard to come by. If they gave it up this time, perhaps they would never have this chance again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the Heavenly Blessing Sage and the other chaotic sages made up their minds.</p><p></p><p>One was that the value of this universe was even greater than they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The other was that since the Dual Source Sage dared to rally them to confront Lin Yuan, he must have a certain confidence. If he had no backing, the Dual Source Sage would not have done this.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the six chaotic sages' gazes became resolute.</p><p></p><p>They also did not believe that with the combined strength of the nine chaotic sages, they could not resist Lin Yuan. "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The chaotic venerable ones who were attracted by the spatial fluctuations and rushed over, had not even approached yet when they saw the space in the distance seemed to be torn apart, with the Dual Source Sage, the Black Obsidian Sage, and the other chaotic sages all trapped inside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Faces.</p><p></p><p>"Have the nine great saints begun to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this kind of space-time confinement technique has not been used outside before."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that spatial-temporal fluctuation must mean a precious treasure has appeared, and these great saints are certainly going to fight over it."</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Venerable Ones watched from afar. With nine great saints present, they had no interest in the treasure that had appeared, but were curious to see which great saint would ultimately seize it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that all of you do not wish to withdraw." Lin Yuan looked at the nine Chaos Great Saints with a slight smile and said, "Since that is the case, then all of you shall remain."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The space-time around them began to rapidly contract. The external universe formed by the divine ability 'World' could theoretically expand to trillions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>But that was the limit of the external universe. The more it contracted, the more concentrated its power would become, exerting greater pressure on the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, may I ask your name?" The Dual Source Great Saint reformed into a blue-gray glow, and the surrounding space-time continued to shatter and reform.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other eight great saints immediately looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was extremely overbearing, they had to admit that his strength was truly formidable, otherwise the Dual Source Great Saint and the Black Brilliance Great Saint would not have had to join forces to resist him.</p><p></p><p>"My name?" Lin Yuan smiled slightly: "I am called 'Galaxy'."</p><p></p><p>Boom! The majestic space-time surged like tidal waves, and the nine Chaos Great Saints were like solitary boats on the ocean, constantly being battered by the waves and in danger of capsizing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>When he first emerged into the universe, in order to safely cultivate, Lin Yuan had to maintain a low profile, otherwise even the Ancient Bright Venerable Alone would have been enough to threaten him and the human civilization clan at the time.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's combat power was close to invincible among the Chaos Great Saints, capable of roaming the Chaos Void. At this point, there was no need for him to be low-key, nor was there any need to be low-key.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint frowned in thought. He had not heard of this title before.</p><p></p><p>There were two possibilities.</p><p></p><p>One was that Lin Yuan had simply made up a name.</p><p></p><p>The other was that the era Lin Yuan came from was much more ancient, and not only had the techniques not been passed down, but even the name had been eroded by the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint was more inclined towards the latter.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's strength, there was no need for him to lie. A cultivator of such power would not stoop to deception.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! As the Dual Source Great Saint was deep in thought, the majestic space-time surged towards him from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Dual Source Fusion, Rend!" </p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint faced the great enemy, directly using his strongest technique, the most powerful strike after the fusion of his two paths of power.</p><p></p><p>This technique was quite taxing on the Dual Source Great Saint's foundation, and he would not use it unless absolutely necessary. But in order to contend with Lin Yuan and remain in this universe, the Dual Source Great Saint held nothing back.</p><p></p><p>Rip.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying spatial-temporal rifts were continuously torn open, as the Dual Source Great Saint ripped through layer after layer of space-time, trying to approach Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Only by getting close to Lin Yuan could he pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>But moments later, the Dual Source Great Saint was shocked to find that for every layer of space-time he tore through, ten, a hundred times as much would quickly fill the void.</p><p></p><p>This gave the Dual Source Great Saint a sense of powerlessness, as if an ant was looking up at the sky, the distance to Lin Yuan not far, but the intervening space-time seemingly countless billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>"The power path I've fused can't even tear open the space-time to approach him?" The Dual Source Great Saint was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>To contend with Lin Yuan, he had to be able to threaten him, otherwise, how could they talk about contending, about forcing Lin Yuan to retreat, about allowing them to remain in the universe? But now, the Dual Source Great Saint couldn't even get close, let alone threaten Lin Yuan. How could they fight like this?</p><p></p><p>"My fully fused power, capable of easily tearing through the internal universe of a peak Chaos Great Saint, is actually powerless against this space-time. Just how strong is the foundation of this space-time?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint tried a few more times, and after finding it still the same, his heart sank half-way.</p><p></p><p>"Black Brilliance Void!"</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Black Brilliance Great Saint suddenly surged, and the endless black darkness of the Black Brilliance Domain began to expand, becoming even more profound as it tried to forcefully expand under the space-time suppression.</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Void was the Black Brilliance Great Saint's ultimate technique, where he burned his own foundation to the utmost to enhance the Black Brilliance Domain. It was an ability he would absolutely not use unless there was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>After all, burning one's foundation, while bringing a tremendous increase in power, was also extremely difficult to recover from.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great, great!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint exerted his full power on the Black Brilliance Domain, and after burning his foundation, the power of the Black Brilliance Domain increased significantly, the Black Brilliance Great Saint preferring to call it the 'Black Brilliance Void'.</p><p></p><p>But the majestic space-time surged from all directions, and the Black Brilliance Void, which the Black Brilliance Great Saint had poured his all into, only expanded by a ten-thousandth before being suppressed back to its original size, the space-time pressure growing stronger and stronger, to the point where it could no longer maintain even its original size and was rapidly contracting.</p><p></p><p>"My Black Brilliance Void..."</p><p></p><p>The Black Brilliance Great Saint could hardly believe it. This was the technique he had prepared to deal with the Dual Source Great Saint, but under the space-time pressure condensed by Lin Yuan, it couldn't even withstand, let alone contend.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint also wanted to attack Lin Yuan, but in the blink of an eye, he was confined by the omnipresent space-time, feeling as if all his strength was useless.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Great Saint, have the courage to fight me in close combat."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint roared at Lin Yuan, close-quarters combat being his specialty, and the path of Chaos Evolution power he cultivated also excelling in this area.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Great Saint had specifically cultivated some secret techniques to deal with Domain Great Saints, but those techniques were completely ineffective under the space-time suppression condensed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Close combat?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at him, "You can't even get close to me, and you still want to fight me in close combat?"</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Cultivation path was also adept at close-quarters combat, but now that he could resolve opponents by relying on the external universe, Lin Yuan naturally didn't bother with close combat.</p><p></p><p>"Condense."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Savage Great Saint, and the majestic space-time surged towards him, directly suppressing the Savage Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"This-"</p><p></p><p>Even further away, the Heavenly Prosperity Great Saint had also wanted to seize the opportunity to strike, not to threaten Lin Yuan, but at least to divert his attention.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw that in the blink of an eye, the Dual Source Great Saint, the Black Brilliance Great Saint, and the Savage Great Saint were struggling and teetering under the suppression of the majestic space-time all around them, the Heavenly Prosperity Great Saint's spirit was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Heavenly Prosperity Great Saint did not advance but retreated, frantically fleeing in the direction away from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the joint attack on Lin Yuan that he had just discussed with the Dual Source Great Saint? Attack?</p><p></p><p>Attack your mother.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

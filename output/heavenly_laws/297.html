            <p>Chapter 297: Eternal Spring (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky, Lin Yuan stood amidst layers upon layers of space. With each step he took, countless star systems were left behind.</p><p></p><p>"The main universe is truly vast," Lin Yuan marveled in his heart as he hurried along, carefully sensing his surroundings. </p><p></p><p>The "vastness" he spoke of was not a shallow level of vastness, but one that contained endless layers of space - a vastness in the depth of space.</p><p></p><p>Even 9th stage evolved beings, upon reaching the realm of millions, could only derive millions of spatial layers from the worlds within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>But what about the main universe?</p><p></p><p>Millions of spatial layers could not even compare to a single hair of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder over the years, despite the constant battles between the powerful experts of various races, the damage to the main world has been negligible. With such a terrifying foundation, who cares about the attacks of ants?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason humans and other races confined their wars to fixed battlefields was not because they thought they could destroy the main universe, but out of concern that the aftershocks of their clashes would affect those planetary secret realms. </p><p></p><p>The essence of war was the fight for resources. Without resources, what was the point of fighting?</p><p></p><p>As for the permanent spatial rifts caused by the attacks of the most powerful experts? Measured in meters, they probably didn't even amount to the cracks between cells for the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Occupying thousands of spatial layers simultaneously, Lin Yuan discovered some weapon fragments floating in a few of them.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing of value." Lin Yuan glanced at them without much interest.</p><p></p><p>Over countless years, as one powerful expert after another battled and fought across numerous spatial layers, whether one side emerged victorious, both sides suffered heavy casualties, or they perished together, it would all result in their belongings being scattered in certain spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>This was the origin of the weapon fragments Lin Yuan saw.</p><p></p><p>Most were basically scrap, though there were occasionally some good items, but they were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Many 9th stage experts roamed through the spatial layers with the idea of "picking up leftovers", hoping that in some unknown spatial layer, a precious treasure might have been left behind.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, deep within the numerous spatial layers of the main universe, cosmic secret realms had also been born.</p><p></p><p>These cosmic secret realms would, as the main universe revolved, briefly establish passages to the outside world during certain periods. For example, the "Xuanhuang" secret realm that the Chihu Star Lord had once visited was located in an incomparably deep spatial layer.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took dozens of steps in a row, covering tens of thousands of light years in just five or six breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Some of my mental energy has been consumed." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately noticed the change in his own state. After comprehending the complete laws of space, he could utilize the art of grand teleportation.</p><p></p><p>However, using the art of grand teleportation consumed mental energy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated that at this rate of mental energy consumption, if he took a few more tens of thousands of steps, he might start feeling fatigued.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Vice Tower Master Nalan had continuously used the art of grand teleportation to cross star regions and arrive at the Chihu main star, delivering the "Spirit Calming Pearl" to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was because of an order from the most powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>And it also had to do with Vice Tower Master Nalan's own strength.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's cultivation, the weaker the feeling of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>"I should just obediently take the cosmic spaceship, even if it's a bit slower."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Grade A cosmic spaceship Lin Yuan had purchased before appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yuan's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"The consumption of my mental energy is rapidly recovering?"</p><p></p><p>The consumption of mental energy would naturally recover, but right now Lin Yuan clearly felt that the recovery speed far exceeded the natural recovery speed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"It's coming from the World Tree in my inner world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into his inner world and discovered that the branches of the hundred-meter-tall World Tree were swaying, and strands of pale green energy were merging into his inner world along with the aura of the World Tree itself.</p><p></p><p>Then, as his inner world circulated the world power to nourish Lin Yuan's physical body, soul, mind and will, that strand of pale green energy was restoring the consumption of Lin Yuan's mental energy.</p><p></p><p>"So the World Tree has this effect as well?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. The consumption of the physical body and the consumption of the soul were both very easy to recover, it was just a matter of paying a certain price.</p><p></p><p>But as for the consumption of mental energy... Up until now, the treasures known to humans that could restore mental energy consumption were all extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan had the financial means to purchase them, he definitely wouldn't use them for something like hurrying on a journey.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can continue using grand teleportation to hurry along... I just need to reduce the distance of each step a little."</p><p></p><p>If he maintained the speed of traveling over a thousand light years per step, even with the World Tree's replenishment, the recovery speed of mental energy consumption would still be lower than the consumption speed.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan could completely reduce his travel speed, for example, from over a thousand light years per step to eight hundred light years per step, or five hundred light years per step.</p><p></p><p>With smaller steps, the consumption would naturally decrease.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the speed of travel would still far exceed riding a cosmic spaceship. Wormhole travel required cooldown time. Even the best cosmic spaceships could only reduce the cooldown time, but still needed to wait after each jump.</p><p></p><p>However, the art of grand teleportation indeed did not require cooldown time.</p><p></p><p>"Eight hundred light years per step... still not feasible."</p><p></p><p>"Seven hundred light years per step... no, no."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to experiment, seeking a balance point between the speed of consumption and the speed of recovery.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lin Yuan determined that when he traveled at a speed of five hundred and thirty light years per step, the consumption of his mental energy was equal to his own recovery speed plus the World Tree's recovery speed.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as Lin Yuan maintained a speed of five hundred and thirty light years per step, no matter how long, he would not experience any fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Because the bit of mental energy that was just consumed would be immediately restored.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped into star domains and star rivers, one step at a time, heading towards the central star domain.</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the Milky Way galaxy, the Yin Yuan divine soul was rapidly absorbing the liquid inside the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Due to simultaneously cultivating the "Rebirth through Blood" divine ability, the Yin Yuan divine soul's attainment in this divine ability was at the same level as the true body.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in terms of absorbing the previous liquids, the speed was extremely fast. In less than half a month, it had already absorbed the fifth type of cyan liquid, reaching the same progress as the true body.</p><p></p><p>"My strength..."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. The inner world of the divine soul clone had also reached a size of one to two billion miles in diameter, almost no different from the true body.</p><p></p><p>Before comprehending the complete laws of space, due to not fully mastering their own path, the inner worlds opened up by the two divine soul clones were smaller than the basic inner world size of the true body.</p><p></p><p>The two divine souls needed to merge into the Taiji divine soul for the size of the inner world they opened up to match the size of the true body's basic inner world.</p><p></p><p>The basic inner world here referred to the inner world without the enhancement of the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>But after comprehending the complete laws of space,</p><p></p><p>The translation of the excerpt is as follows:</p><p></p><p>There was no longer such a distinction, as the internal world could expand to a maximum of ten million square miles.</p><p></p><p>"Now, my true self, the Yin avatar, and the Yang avatar have the same strength. There is no longer a distinction between the true self and the avatars," Lin Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He now had three bodies, each of which could be considered his true self.</p><p></p><p>The "avatar" techniques of human civilization were called avatars because the condensed avatars generally had less power than the true self.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self and two great avatars could be condensed from any of the remaining ones, no matter which two perished.</p><p></p><p>This alone made it far superior to those avatar techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Above a planet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"Finally made it."</p><p></p><p>The territory of human civilization was too vast. It took Lin Yuan nearly a year to travel from the Milky Way Star Domain to the Central Star Domain, which was far from traversing the entire territory of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that Lin Yuan basically did not stop for this year, always rushing at a speed of 530 light-years per step.</p><p></p><p>"Upon reaching the Central Star Domain, it will no longer be possible to use the Grand Teleportation Technique," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was not allowed to use any means of spatial teleportation.</p><p></p><p>The Central Star Domain was the heartland of human civilization. If one could teleport and move around at will, wouldn't it be in chaos?</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan had just arrived for a short while.</p><p></p><p>A figure quickly flew out from the planet below.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Milky Way Star Lord, I have been waiting for you." This figure was also a ninth-stage evolutionist, specially responsible for receiving and guiding Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, not long ago, I met the Milky Way Star Lord," the ninth-stage evolutionist, a purple-haired man, looked at Lin Yuan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Met me?" Lin Yuan was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"My name is 'Xilan'. I was previously the garrison commander on the battlefield numbered B0001," Xilan said briefly.</p><p></p><p>Xilan looked at Lin Yuan, thinking in his heart, "The time the Milky Way Star Lord arrived is much faster than estimated. Has he been using the Grand Teleportation Technique all the way?"</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, newly advanced ninth-stage evolutionists would be extremely excited, especially after mastering the complete spatial rules. They would use the Grand Teleportation Technique to rush without regard to fatigue.</p><p></p><p>It was like having a new toy that had to be played with all the time.</p><p></p><p>As for the side effects of using the Grand Teleportation Technique—the fatigue caused by the consumption of mental energy?</p><p></p><p>It was not considered a major hidden danger, as one could recover after resting for a while.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>It was not to take action, but to prevent the ninth-stage powerhouses of the opposing alien races from taking action.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if necessary, it was also possible to take action, such as if an unparalleled genius comparable to the Milky Way Star Lord appeared in the Tianyu Race.</p><p></p><p>'Xilan' might really take action to strangle them.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could be resurrected in the end, it could at least suppress the growth rate of the other party.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings generally resurrected their clansmen after accumulating a large number of clansmen and then resurrecting them together.</p><p></p><p>After all, resurrecting one person or resurrecting a hundred people only required going against the flow once.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the backlash of resurrecting one person and resurrecting a hundred people was different.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult for a supreme being to go against the flow specifically for a certain life unless they really valued them.</p><p></p><p>As for bullying the weak with the strong? There was never such a thing as bullying the weak with the strong in the competition between races. Otherwise, how could those weak races, ordinary races, and powerful races oppressed by the apex races be so obedient?</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me down. The ceremony specially prepared to welcome you is ready," Xilan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The planet below them was similar to a transit planet. To enter the Central Star Domain, one had to go through such planets.</p><p></p><p>The Central Star Domain did not allow any means of spatial teleportation, but it had fixed spatial passages.</p><p></p><p>This was to reduce the travel time of living beings coming and going.</p><p></p><p>And the transit planet below housed a spatial passage leading deep into the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xilan appeared on the transit planet.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Milky Way Star Lord for advancing to the ninth stage." On the surface of the planet, there were densely packed living beings standing. These beings included humans and other alien races, and the number of alien races even accounted for half.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Milky Way Star Lord for advancing to the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Milky Way Star Lord for advancing to the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Milky Way Star Lord for advancing to the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>The deafening congratulatory voices were all congratulating Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So many alien races?" Lin Yuan took a rough glance and was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"These alien races have all surrendered to our human civilization or joined our human civilization alliance," Xilan explained beside him.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was to gather all forces to compete with other races.</p><p></p><p>As an apex race, the human civilization naturally had its own grand alliance, so the human civilization was also known as the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Alliance was led by humans and consisted of 182 powerful races and 6,313 ordinary races.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"We'll go directly to the spatial passage."</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Spring is located on the mother planet and requires transit through dozens of spatial passages." Xilan did not linger and directly led Lin Yuan towards the spatial passage on the transit planet.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xilan left this planet through the spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>"I-is it over?"</p><p></p><p>On the transit planet, the alien races in the large congratulatory team finally dared to speak in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, they were pulled over and had been "rehearsing" with the purpose of waiting for the Milky Way Star Lord to come and shout out the words "Congratulations to the Milky Way Star Lord for advancing to the ninth stage".</p><p></p><p>"Sister Luoqin, that Milky Way Star Lord must be a remarkable human, right?" A short-statured alien cautiously asked a human woman beside him.</p><p></p><p>As an alien race, even if they completely relied on humans, there were many restrictions. They could not use the virtual world network until a certain number of years had passed, so their news was very closed off and they had not heard of the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>But even if they had never heard of him, with such a grand reception on this planet, they knew that the Milky Way Star Lord was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that this transit planet received a large number of humans or aliens entering the Central Star Domain every day.</p><p></p><p>But in order to specially welcome the Milky Way Star Lord, it had been closed to the public months ago and was dedicated to waiting for the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although there were many such transit planets on the edge of the Central Star Domain, it was far from what a normal ninth-stage evolutionist could do to specially vacate one.</p><p></p><p>The short-statured alien had also experienced before that other newly advanced ninth-stage human evolutionists did not receive such treatment when they came.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>The human woman called 'Sister Luoqin' showed a hint of pride on her face. "The Milky Way Star Lord is the pride of our human civilization."</p>

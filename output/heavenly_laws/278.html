The world force emanating from his inner world, which spanned nearly a billion miles, reached a certain qualitative change. Coupled with the dozens of cosmic forces he had mastered, Lin Yuan finally restored his peak strength.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, he was even stronger than when he was in the Spirit Realm. After all, the inner world of his main world body had incorporated many cosmic treasures, a treatment his Spirit Realm body didn't receive.</p><p></p><p>"If those five invincible eighth-stage exotic races were to assassinate me at this moment..."</p><p></p><p>The recovery of his inner world to nearly a billion miles in size was an absolutely subversive boost to Lin Yuan's combat power.</p><p></p><p>The gap between an inner world of ten million miles and one of nearly a billion miles far exceeded tenfold.</p><p></p><p>"For now, the absorption of the green liquid inside the mysterious gourd has temporarily reached its limit," Lin Yuan thought as his consciousness returned to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The amplification effect of the liquid inside the mysterious gourd on the inner world depended on two aspects:</p><p></p><p>First was the base size of the inner world, that is, the comprehension of the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>Second was the resistance of the body's divine ability "Rebirth by Dripping Blood" to the flames transformed from the liquid inside the gourd.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to comprehend the laws of space as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"With my heaven-defying aptitude, I can fully comprehend the complete laws of space at the eighth stage," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Other powerhouses, whether human evolvers or exotic lifeforms, had almost no chance of comprehending the complete laws of space at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Because the difficulty was too high.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't feel there was any difficulty. It was just a matter of how much time he invested.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of an eighth-stage evolver was long. How old was Lin Yuan now? He had plenty of time to try.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll focus on fusing laws and continue to study the core spatial models later, listing it as a secondary goal."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, according to the current interpretation of the ninth and eighth stages by human civilization, comprehending cosmic forces at the eighth stage was greatly beneficial for cultivating to the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>But whether one comprehended the laws of space had little impact on reaching the ninth stage. Many powerhouses who had just entered the ninth stage had not yet fully comprehended the laws of space.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Lin Yuan felt it was more worthwhile to step into the ninth stage as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>His heaven-defying aptitude was related to the height Lin Yuan was at. The difficulty of Lin Yuan comprehending the laws of space at the eighth stage was completely different from doing so at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Thereforeâ€”</p><p></p><p>Unless this matter affected his foundation, Lin Yuan would prioritize improving his own realm.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth stage..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>Fusing an ordinary law he had mastered into a pillar law.</p><p></p><p>The pillar law here could be the law of time, the law of space, the law of life, and so on.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current conditions, he naturally chose to fuse it into the law of space.</p><p></p><p>"Fusing laws is not the first time for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered. After comprehending the Yin law, the Yang law and the Yin law began to fuse, giving birth to the high-level cosmic force of Taiji.</p><p></p><p>However, both the Yang law and the Yin law were ordinary laws. The difficulty of fusing them was far less than fusing pillar laws.</p><p></p><p>"When I was in the Spirit Realm, I had already started fusing the Taiji law into the law of space, reaching one-tenth progress. Now I'll just continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The fusion between different laws was much more difficult than simply comprehending a certain law. How could the fusion of two completely different laws be easy?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's fusion of the Yin law and the Yang law was entirely because he had started fusing them from the second and third stages, progressing step by step until he comprehended these two laws, and then carried out law fusion. It was completely a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>But fusing the law of space with the Taiji law? Even if Lin Yuan tried with his heaven-defying aptitude, he would still get stuck from time to time.</p><p></p><p>After continuously comprehending for several days, Lin Yuan stopped and rubbed his brow, planning to take a break.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to fuse the Taiji law with the law of space not only required sufficient aptitude but also demanded Lin Yuan to exert great mental effort.</p><p></p><p>So every time he cultivated for a period of time, Lin Yuan had to stop and rest.</p><p></p><p>If he forcibly continued to comprehend, his mental power would be exhausted, and the fusion efficiency would only get lower and lower.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the number of evolvers on the martial dao evolution path."</p><p></p><p>Whether in the main world or the traversing worlds, Lin Yuan attached great importance to the spread of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>This was related to his "ultimate leap".</p><p></p><p>Many powerhouses below the supreme level, such as those "ancient gods" in the depths of the universe, liked to spread their own evolution paths in preparation for the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current strength had not yet reached the level of ancient gods, but there was no harm in laying out the ultimate leap in advance.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial point was that the martial dao evolution path in the main world could also bring Lin Yuan great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, just from the profit sharing of the martial dao evolution path, Lin Yuan had earned hundreds of thousands of cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>These cosmic crystals didn't come as quickly as Lin Yuan casually killing a few invincible eighth-stage powerhouses, but they had the advantage of being endless and without any hidden dangers or risks.</p><p></p><p>But the profit sharing from the martial dao evolution path was steady and secure.</p><p></p><p>"First Stage Chapter: 626,397."</p><p></p><p>"Second Stage Chapter: 112,560."</p><p></p><p>"Third Stage Chapter: 32,421."</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Stage Chapter: 7,307."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Stage Chapter: 1,038 people."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"There are already more than a thousand people in the Fifth Stage Chapter."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Although in the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan had cultivated several seventh-stage martial dao powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>But that took nearly a thousand years. In just a few decades, the main world had given birth to so many martial dao evolvers, which was already extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In terms of efficiency, it could easily surpass the number of martial dao cultivators cultivated in the Spirit Realm in the same amount of time.</p><p></p><p>"I set the price of the Eighth Stage Chapter at 500 billion civilization coins, and it actually sold more than 10,000 copies?" Lin Yuan glanced at the sales volume of the Eighth Stage Chapter.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the evolvers purchasing the Eighth Stage Chapter were basically not evolvers of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current evolvers of the martial dao evolution path hadn't even reached the sixth stage, so buying the Eighth Stage Chapter was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>It was probably those eighth-stage evolvers, or even ninth-stage and tenth-stage evolvers casually buying it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current martial dao evolution path ranked first on the Annan Star Alliance's evolution leaderboard, and its soaring speed, even if ninth-stage and tenth-stage evolvers couldn't use it, they didn't mind buying it casually to take a look.</p><p></p><p>500 billion civilization coins was a huge fortune for sixth-stage and seventh-stage evolvers, but in the eyes of ninth-stage and tenth-stage evolvers, it wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-stage and tenth-stage evolvers already belonged to the strategic forces of human civilization. Just casually venturing into a cosmic secret realm once, their gains would far exceed that amount.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This number.</p><p></p><p>"Selling over ten thousand copies of the Eighth Stage Chapter, even after deducting the share for human civilization and taxes, I still have thousands of Universe Crystals in hand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in high spirits. It hadn't been long since he uploaded the Eighth Stage Chapter, and the income brought by the martial arts evolution path would only get higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world of the Chiwan main star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and the Chiwan Star Lord sat opposite each other, enjoying fine wine.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've had such a leisurely drink." Lin Yuan took a small sip, feeling the fiery sensation down his throat.</p><p></p><p>"This fine wine costs one Universe Crystal per glass outside, much cheaper in the virtual world, but still costs hundreds of millions of Universe Coins."</p><p></p><p>The Chiwan Star Lord said, even for him, he couldn't bear to buy this kind of fine wine in reality, not that he couldn't afford it, but he felt distressed.</p><p></p><p>"The three kinds of cosmic powers you used to kill those two invincible Eighth Stage experts, are they all high-level cosmic powers?" The Chiwan Star Lord also took a sip, asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure if they are high-level cosmic powers either." Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He only speculated that the Taiji Power, Destruction Power, and Immeasurable Power were high-level cosmic powers, but he didn't know for sure.</p><p></p><p>"Master, take a look." Lin Yuan raised his right hand, with three strands of aura swirling between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>"They are indeed high-level cosmic powers. You have cultivated this strand of cosmic power to at least the third realm." The Chiwan Star Lord exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He had already watched the video of Lin Yuan's actions and saw that his disciple had invoked three kinds of cosmic powers. But when he saw the three high-level cosmic powers obediently nestled between his disciple's fingers with his own eyes, he was still somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>These were high-level cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Not some roadside vegetables.</p><p></p><p>"People really can't be compared. Back then, when I comprehended one kind of cosmic power, I was so proud and elated. Disciple, you comprehended three kinds of high-level cosmic powers all at once."</p><p></p><p>The Chiwan Star Lord said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I was lucky. The three powers I happened to comprehend turned out to be cosmic powers." Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the main world universe, cosmic powers could not be simulated or replicated, so luck played a big role in comprehending a certain cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>Some Eighth Stage experts didn't comprehend a single cosmic power in tens of thousands of years, while some Eighth Stage experts might comprehend it in just a few decades.</p><p></p><p>In any case, there were random factors involved.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending one might be luck, but comprehending three can still be called luck?" The Chiwan Star Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>His disciple was perfect in every way, just too modest.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he would have wanted to brag to all his old friends.</p><p></p><p>"Three high-level cosmic powers! In the future, when you step into the Ninth Stage and forge your Ninth Stage foundation, how solid will it be?" The Chiwan Star Lord clicked his tongue in admiration.</p><p></p><p>What the Chiwan Star Lord didn't know was that his disciple had comprehended not three, but dozens of cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Among them were even primordial powers that surpassed high-level cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world of the Chiwan Lineage.</p><p></p><p>Countless members of the Chiwan Lineage were whispering and discussing, their gazes occasionally turning towards the majestic main peak in the center.</p><p></p><p>In the past, people wouldn't have been so excited about the Galaxy Star Lord, but when news came that the Galaxy Star Lord had killed two invincible Eighth Stage alien experts in the peripheral star domain.</p><p></p><p>It directly ignited all the members of the Chiwan Lineage.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Star Lord had accomplished what even the Chiwan Star Lord had not, making the Chiwan Lineage members extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Even a fool could see that the Galaxy Star Lord's future would be limitless. Being able to kill invincible Eighth Stage experts at such a young age, stepping into the Ninth Stage could be said to be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Thirteenth Peak Lord so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in these years, has the Thirteenth Peak Lord created few miracles?"</p><p></p><p>"If I had known earlier, I would have done everything possible to join the Thirteenth Peak and become a subordinate of the Thirteenth Peak Lord."</p><p></p><p>"The recruitment of the Thirteenth Peak is extremely strict. Do you think you can get in just by doing your best?"</p><p></p><p>The many members of the Chiwan Lineage discussed rapidly. The Galaxy Star Lord's prestige began to spread in the southern star region of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Even the Chiwan Lineage became famous along with him.</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the Chiwan Lineage.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu looked at the distant central main peak with a complex expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Back then, during the Seven Star Cave trial, the Thirteenth Peak Lord had clearly invited him to join the Thirteenth Peak.</p><p></p><p>But he had refused and chose the Peak Lord who had already stepped into the Eighth Stage at that time.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Feng Yu regretted this choice, because the Thirteenth Peak Lord had also stepped into the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Peak Lord who had spent nearly a hundred thousand years stepping into the Eighth Stage, the Thirteenth Peak Lord crushed the former in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu had chosen the Peak Lord at that time precisely because the Peak Lord was already an Eighth Stage expert, but immediately after, the Thirteenth Peak Lord also stepped into the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>This made Feng Yu feel like a clown.</p><p></p><p>Originally, in these years, Feng Yu had barely recovered.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that even if he didn't join the Thirteenth Peak and became a subordinate of the Peak Lord, there was no great benefit.</p><p></p><p>Until not long ago, he heard that the Thirteenth Peak Lord had killed two invincible Eighth Stage alien experts.</p><p></p><p>Those were invincible Eighth Stage alien experts!</p><p></p><p>Just like that, they were killed by the Thirteenth Peak Lord?</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu only felt that his intestines had turned green with regret. If he had chosen the Thirteenth Peak back then, he would be a hot shot now.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Lan?</p><p></p><p>Just an ordinary Silver Stripe.</p><p></p><p>No background.</p><p></p><p>No backing.</p><p></p><p>Just because she accepted the Thirteenth Peak Lord's invitation.</p><p></p><p>Now she was high and mighty in the Chiwan Lineage, even the several Peak Lords treated her with extra courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"One wrong step, every step is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yu sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>On the Galaxy main star.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with his master, the Chiwan Star Lord, for a while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>"I should be at the peak of the Eighth Stage now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Having opened up a complete Eighth Stage Chapter of the martial way, Lin Yuan had reached the end of the Eighth Stage, and what remained was to break through to the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"I can try exploring the Magic Jade Space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending three thousand three hundred and thirty-three evolutionary paths from the corpse fragment of the supreme being from outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>A Magic Jade imprint automatically condensed in the depths of Lin Yuan's soul, making him an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade imprint, besides being a symbol of an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower and being able to stabilize the soul, mind, and will.</p><p></p><p>It was also connected to a mysterious space, the Magic Jade Space, opened up by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>And this space was also the greatest opportunity contained within that supreme being's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan learned from the Magic Jade imprint that it was best to consider entering the Magic Jade Space to explore when one reached the peak of the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>So he waited until today.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's possible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan probed his soul with his mind, locking onto the Magic Jade imprint in the shape of a "nine-layered black tower".</p><p></p><p>"Let's explore and see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated this nine-layered black tower imprint, and in an instant, his will began to rise infinitely, descending into a mysterious space.</p>

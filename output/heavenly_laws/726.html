        <h1>Chapter 726</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds still stood majestic and grand, as if unchanged for eternity.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully. Every time he looked at the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, he had a different feeling.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Lin Yuan divided out a thread of his consciousness, following the coordinates of the third source world deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, wanting to observe the third source world from the perspective of the Gate.</p><p></p><p>This was something Lin Yuan did every time he traversed and descended.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan received a warning from the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Danger?"</p><p></p><p>"The third source world can pose a threat to me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately withdrew his consciousness and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The so-called danger meant that in the judgment of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, there existed the possibility of causing irreversible damage to Lin Yuan's several true body avatars and numerous divine spirit incarnations.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's several true body avatars were completely independent, isolated from cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>But to simultaneously affect several true body avatars did not necessarily require relying on cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>Memory would also work.</p><p></p><p>After all, the several true body avatars shared memories.</p><p></p><p>If memory and mental pollution occurred, it would definitely affect all true body avatars and divine spirit incarnations.</p><p></p><p>When initially exploring the first source world, Lin Yuan had received a similar warning when peering into the second source world with his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It was later proven that the warning from the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds was very necessary.</p><p></p><p>The demonic qi pollution of the second source world involved the mental level.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's mental consciousness at that time, if he had been contaminated even slightly, it would have inevitably caused irreparable losses and injuries.</p><p></p><p>And it would have affected the true body avatars in other dimensional spaces as well.</p><p></p><p>The demonic qi of the second source world was essentially the residual power of a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>Its level was unimaginably high.</p><p></p><p>It was simply not something Lin Yuan could resist at that time.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>In exploring the third source world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had also received a similar warning.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of world is the third source world, that it can pose a real threat to me now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, the fall of a major true body avatar or incarnation did not count as a threat at all.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he could just descend again and re-condense it.</p><p></p><p>A real threat was a method or damage that could implicate the true body avatars in other dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's current strength, plus the isolation from cause and effect, there were not many things left that could cause such a result.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps there is a living Time Lord in the third source world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The abilities and methods of Time Lords were often inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Powerful Time Lords had the ability to slightly alter the past.</p><p></p><p>Of course, unless this Time Lord was desperate.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise they would not dare to change the past, even if only slightly.</p><p></p><p>Changing the past was very likely to attract the attention of 14th level perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level of life, the more fearful they were of 14th level perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>After all, 13th level time beings already stood at the pinnacle of all living things, but in fact, so-called time beings were very likely just "toys" inadvertently shaped by perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>Time beings could exist because perfect time beings allowed it.</p><p></p><p>With such a realization, many time beings were terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head, thinking it was better to heed the warning.</p><p></p><p>He had not planned to formally explore the third source world before reaching the 13th level anyway.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current strength had reached a bottleneck in all aspects, and the only thing that could still be improved was the Way of Chaos Taiji.</p><p></p><p>And the Way of Chaos Taiji did not need to rely on exploring source worlds to improve. With his comprehension of the Yin-Yang Twin Flower, Lin Yuan was already making rapid progress in his understanding of the Way of Chaos Taiji.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Even if he explored the third source world now and gained something.</p><p></p><p>It would not provide any essential help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It was better to wait until after reaching the 13th level to explore slowly.</p><p></p><p>Far away from the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>A celestial river, infinitely wide and infinitely long, swept through numerous time-spaces, swept through all things in the universe, surging forward endlessly. The mere momentum of this celestial river made many time beings tremble.</p><p></p><p>This was the Celestial River Dimension, an extremely special dimensional space that was not exclusive.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because it was not exclusive that the Celestial River Dimension contained nearly a hundred time beings. Apart from those born locally, there were also a large number of time beings from many other dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>"Heart of the Celestial River."</p><p></p><p>In the center of the vast celestial river, the seven main battle bodies of the time beings from the Chaos Void stood tall, looking into the depths of the celestial river, where a heart completely condensed from the power of the celestial river's origin was gradually taking shape.</p><p></p><p>"At most four thousand years, and this Heart of the Celestial River will be condensed."</p><p></p><p>Mo Xujun was in a good mood. With the help of the Heart of the Celestial River, he could not only closely feel the operation of the celestial river's origin rules, but also use it as a congratulatory gift for Lin Yuan, as a gift for breaking through to the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Not good?" While observing the gestation of the Heart of the Celestial River, Mo Xujun was also watching the future timelines.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the future timelines that originally had a very small possibility suddenly began to rapidly expand, almost occupying one-third of all the future timelines that Mo Xujun could observe.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Xujun's expression became solemn, "The time beings from the Taixu Dimension are also coming</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Compete for this Heart of the Celestial River?"</p><p></p><p>The Tai Xu Dimension was a powerful dimensional space no weaker than the Chaos Void. During this great destruction period, the Tai Xu Dimension had given birth to nine Time Beings, making it extremely dominant among neighboring dimensional gaps.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened to make the Time Beings of the Tai Xu Dimension want to compete for this Heart of the Celestial River?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Xu Jun's face was puzzled. In the many future timelines he had originally observed, the possibility of the Tai Xu Dimension intervening to compete was very small, so small as to be negligible, with almost no chance of occurring.</p><p></p><p>But just a moment ago, this possibility began to surge infinitely, until now it occupied nearly one-third.</p><p></p><p>It must have been influenced by some other factor, causing the Time Beings of the Tai Xu Dimension to suddenly become determined to obtain this Heart of the Celestial River.</p><p></p><p>The future holds infinite possibilities and variables. Perhaps a future that was originally certain has been completely overturned due to some subtle change.</p><p></p><p>Even for a powerful 13th-level Time Being, they can only try their best to develop the future they want. As for whether it can actually be achieved, even the Time Beings themselves cannot be certain.</p><p></p><p>"Mo Xu Jun, that Tai Xu Dimension..."</p><p></p><p>The other six Time Beings also took action in succession. They too had discovered the changes in the future timelines, and their expressions all became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the reason, according to the development of future timelines, the Tai Xu Dimension will almost certainly compete with us for this Heart of the Celestial River," Mo Xu Jun said.</p><p></p><p>The past that had already occurred was not important.</p><p></p><p>The many Time Beings of the Tai Xu Dimension who were about to come and compete were what they needed to face.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now?" asked the Time Being wearing black armor with a frown.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Xu Dimension had nine Time Beings stationed there, outnumbering the Chaos Void in terms of 13th-level beings.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, we fight."</p><p></p><p>The Time Being with a human head and snake body said, "Since the Tai Xu Dimension wants this Heart of the Celestial River, let them show their strength."</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Celestial River was a treasure that the seven Time Beings of the Chaos Void had schemed for countless ages to obtain, making multiple concessions and compromises with other forces in the Celestial River Dimension for it.</p><p></p><p>How could they just give it up?</p><p></p><p>13th-level Time Beings are most adept at weighing pros and cons. The Time Beings of the Tai Xu Dimension alone were not enough to make the seven Time Beings of the Chaos Void back down.</p><p></p><p>"Right."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's fight."</p><p></p><p>Mo Xu Jun nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Xu Dimension had the advantage in number of Time Beings over the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But in a 13th-level confrontation, unless there was an absolute overwhelming advantage in strength, the numerical advantage was not very obvious.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, if they didn't even fight this time and just voluntarily gave up the Heart of the Celestial River, it would greatly lower the status of the seven Time Beings of the Chaos Void in the Celestial River Dimension.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest 13th-level being in the Tai Xu Dimension is not as strong as me. If we really fight, we have a chance of winning," Mo Xu Jun said.</p><p></p><p>In a confrontation between 13th-level Time Beings, the main competition was who could see more timelines and find the one where their side was most likely to win.</p><p></p><p>As for direct clashes of strength? They only needed to take action at key time nodes.</p><p></p><p>Prolonged battles of attrition rarely occurred.</p><p></p><p>Battles that couldn't determine a victor didn't have much meaning.</p><p></p><p>Unless continuous fighting was part of a Time Being's scheme.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>A strange flower containing both yin and yang extreme forces was slowly blooming in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the strange flower, yin and yang merged, remained independent, and transformed into each other. This was very similar to the essence of the Taiji principle.</p><p></p><p>It was because of this similarity, plus the fact that the strange flower was born from the supreme rules of the dimensional gaps, that it could guide Lin Yuan towards the third level of Chaos Taiji.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang, Taiji..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed himself in studying and comprehending, with countless inspirations flooding into his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. By studying the mysterious strange flower, your understanding of the Chaos Taiji principle has greatly increased]</p><p></p><p>Almost every moment, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Chaos Taiji principle was skyrocketing. Countless insights began to accumulate, accumulating endlessly, exchanging for the foundation to finally break through the shackles.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three thousand years went by.</p><p></p><p>During these three thousand years, Lin Yuan devoted almost all of his mental energy to comprehending the Yin-Yang Twin Flower. Three thousand years of accumulation, three thousand years of foundation, finally erupted completely at a certain moment.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. By studying the mysterious strange flower, your Chaos Taiji principle has advanced to the third level.]</p><p></p><p>In a daze.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to be standing at a whole new height.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void, Lin Yuan, who had originally been sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were one black and one white, like the Chaos Taiji, and they rapidly spread and diffused in all directions, hundreds above and below, vast and mighty, sweeping everything.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan muttered to himself. At this moment, nearly one-fifth of the Chaos Void was covered in black and white yin-yang colors, constantly interweaving, constantly colliding, constantly evolving, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes again, and the black and white yin-yang covering nearly one-fifth of the Chaos Void quickly dissolved, along with the Chaos Taiji mark on his brow also disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Everything returned to calm, everything returned to its original state.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 337: The Xuanhuang Lineage (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was carefully observing. This towering edifice spanned many spatial layers, extremely inconceivable. </p><p></p><p>"According to human civilization's intelligence on the core area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, such a palace has never appeared when the secret realm opened in the past?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself silently. It didn't exist before. But now it suddenly appeared? </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but suspect it was related to himself. The summoning feeling he perceived was coming from deep inside this palace.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the originally closed main entrance to the palace slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"The door is open?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn. If previously he only suspected the appearance of the palace was because of him, now he was almost certain of it.</p><p></p><p>Those few special ninth-ranks had lingered outside the palace for quite a while but didn't enter. Yet after Lin Yuan waited outside for a bit, the door opened on its own?</p><p></p><p>"No matter."</p><p>"Let me go take a look inside."</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, Lin Yuan had made up his mind. For him, the worst possibility was just losing this spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it would affect his main body, with the Spirit-Sealing Bead bestowed by the paramount Xia Qinzhi, even a twelfth-rank expert couldn't completely annihilate Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The origins of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm were mysterious, and even ultimate existences couldn't lock onto its coordinates. But that didn't mean it was more formidable than paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>If what the stone statue Shen Ji said was correct, the "Xuanhuang Emperor" had disappeared for a vast span of eons, almost forgotten since the era of the Lord of the Demon Jade Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>What methods could be left now?</p><p></p><p>However, before entering the palace, Lin Yuan took out a drop of his essence blood and placed all the treasures he had obtained in the secret realm into a spatial bracelet.</p><p></p><p>He then sent both deep into layers of nested spaces.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if an extreme situation occurred and this spiritual sense of Lin Yuan perished inside the palace, that drop of essence blood could quickly "revive from a drop of blood", taking the gains in the spatial bracelet to leave the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be a complete waste of a trip.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and strode into the palace.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan fully entered, the opened main door slowly closed behind him.</p><p></p><p>The towering palace began rapidly dematerializing until it disappeared from its original spot.</p><p></p><p>If those few escaped special ninth-ranks returned, they would find that the mysterious palace had completely vanished, as if it had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>However, given the formidable reputation of the Galactic Sovereign, those special ninth-ranks, no matter how audacious, wouldn't dare approach the area where Lin Yuan had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked into the palace and vaguely sensed the subtle spatial fluctuations, silently thinking: "I must have left the main spatial layer of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and be in some nested space now."</p><p></p><p>The number of nested spatial layers in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm far exceeded the Divine Realms - at least occupying over 20 billion layers that even Lin Yuan couldn't see the end of.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. This was a vast plain, silent and quiet. In the center stood another palace similar to the one outside, but with a much more serene aura.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Palace?" Lin Yuan noticed three complex characters engraved on the pillars.</p><p></p><p>Although not in any script he was familiar with, like the fundamentals of the Dao, he could understand their meaning at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed the Xuanhuang lineage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart settled. The stone statue Shen Ji had told him some information about the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>Although not much, it allowed Lin Yuan to confirm that the Xuanhuang lineage was not some extreme evil force.</p><p></p><p>In fact, through the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path, Lin Yuan could sense that the existence who created this path had an immensely magnanimous and open-minded nature, deliberately leaving pitfalls for later generations. Such a powerful being shouldn't stoop to do that.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan arrived before the Xuanhuang Palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this palace did not exude any oppressive aura to Lin Yuan, just like an ordinary palace.</p><p></p><p>Standing before it, Lin Yuan felt that summoning feeling almost materialize.</p><p></p><p>"Child, come in." At this moment, an ancient voice rang out from inside.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the palace, a figure dozens of meters tall with six arms and wrinkled skin sat cross-legged, smiling at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Child, you must have many doubts in your heart now." The dozens-of-meters-tall humanoid figure smiled at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I can't sense any aura from him at all?" Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Even an eleventh-rank expert wouldn't give Lin Yuan this feeling - at most he would just be unable to defeat or resist them.</p><p></p><p>"Could he be at the twelfth rank?" Lin Yuan looked at the figure gravely. He had seen the paramount Xia Qinzhi before, but only in a virtual world. </p><p></p><p>As for meeting one in reality, this was the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Child, don't be tense. Since you have cultivated the Emperor's evolutionary path, you are considered his inheritor. I won't cause you any harm," the six-armed figure smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor's evolutionary path?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already guessed this. The summoning feeling he perceived originated from the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path he practiced, and the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was related to the legendary "Xuanhuang Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Ever since first learning about the "Xuanhuang Emperor" from the stone statue Shen Ji, Lin Yuan had speculated that the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path was the one walked by that "Xuanhuang Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"Over the vast span of eons, I left the first half of the 'Xuanhuang' evolutionary path in many places of the secret realm. But unfortunately, until now, not a single living being has comprehended the first half to then enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm," the six-armed figure said with a tone of lamentation.</p><p></p><p>"Not a single living being?" Lin Yuan's expression showed some doubt.</p><p></p><p>Although the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path was abstruse and difficult to comprehend, if ninth-rank experts forcibly tried to comprehend it, they still had a chance, just requiring more time.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan originally comprehended the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path in the Seven Star Cave World, it didn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuanhuang' evolutionary path was created by the Emperor. To comprehend this path, only those beings whose foundations have not been set can possibly do so."</p><p></p><p>"If one's foundation has been set, even an ultimate expert cannot comprehend it," the six-armed figure said slowly.</p><p></p><p>What did it mean by one's foundation being set? According to human civilization's definition, that referred to the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>To cross into the sixth rank, one must confirm their core evolutionary path and achieve 100% integration with their soul.</p><p></p><p>So in theory, every sixth rank expert had already set their foundation.</p><p></p><p>But according to the six-armed figure's words, to comprehend the Xuanhuang...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The prerequisites for the path of evolution are extremely harsh. Once the foundation is set, it becomes impossible to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan's expression turned to one of realization. No wonder the Scarlet Koi Star Master obtained the Xuanhuang path of evolution tens of millions of years ago, yet remained fruitless - this was the reason.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I can sense that outside the secret realm, there are still some lifeforms who have cultivated the Xuanhuang path of evolution to the entry level, but they are too insignificant, lacking even the qualifications to perceive the calling."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure let out a sigh. Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was not the first to comprehend the Xuanhuang path of evolution. Tens of thousands of years ago, the junior disciple of the Scarlet Koi Star Master had also comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>Only -</p><p></p><p>The growth of the powerful is full of twists and turns. To qualify for entering the Xuanhuang secret realm requires at least the invincible eighth stage, and most experts who enter are at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>But how many lives can give birth to a ninth stage expert? One billion? Ten billion? One hundred billion? One trillion? Ten trillion?</p><p></p><p>Far more than that.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Koi Star Domain has over one hundred million life-bearing planets. By the standards of Cangluan Star, with a permanent population of five hundred billion, that would be five hundred trillion citizens.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the true number of citizens in the Scarlet Koi Star Domain is far greater, as the high-level life planets would have populations far exceeding this number.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's not just life planets where citizens reside - there are also large numbers living on resource planets and special planets.</p><p></p><p>But from the founding of the Scarlet Koi Star Domain until now, not a single ninth stage expert has been born.</p><p></p><p>The most important factor for the Xuanhuang path of evolution is compatibility with this path.</p><p></p><p>Just this one point alone filters out the vast majority, leaving only a handful who manage to comprehend it. For those cultivators to then continue practicing to the seventh, eighth or even ninth stage -</p><p></p><p>It is no easier than ascending to heaven.</p><p></p><p>The main issue is that the vast majority of experts, upon finding themselves unable to comprehend the Xuanhuang path, will lose interest and no longer pay attention to it. Those like the Scarlet Koi Star Master who place great importance on the Xuanhuang path are in the minority.</p><p></p><p>And even if they do value it highly, it is of no use unless they can cultivate to the invincible eighth or ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>These limiting conditions, while perhaps not absolutely impossible on their own, become extremely daunting when combined together - as the six-armed figure's tone implies.</p><p></p><p>Since the Xuanhuang secret realm opened, Lin Yuan is the first.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a paramount expert?" Lin Yuan pondered and voiced his doubt.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a paramount expert," the six-armed figure paused briefly before shaking his head. "I am merely the consciousness condensed by this secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"Consciousness condensed by the secret realm?" Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before understanding.</p><p></p><p>Though called a secret realm, the Xuanhuang realm could easily be considered a world unto itself. This so-called consciousness condensed by the realm is akin to a world consciousness or heavenly dao.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Heaven World, Lin Yuan replaced the world consciousness with the primordial demonic tree's consciousness, becoming the heavenly dao of that world.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the primordial demonic tree's consciousness has been upholding Lin Yuan's commands.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure before him was likely the same, carrying out the instructions left behind by the Xuanhuang Emperor over the long years.</p><p></p><p>"Initially, His Majesty opened thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three Xuanhuang secret realms, leaving behind corresponding legacies. Who knows how many are left now?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's tone carried a tinge of reminiscence. Lin Yuan could not help but be taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Even paramount experts could not lock onto the coordinates of the Xuanhuang secret realms, yet there were actually thirty-three thousand, three hundred and thirty-three of them?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was well aware of the profound depths of the Xuanhuang secret realms. Rather than secret realms, it would be more apt to call them the Xuanhuang Realm - worlds far exceeding the depths of the Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>"But that is all in the past. After His Majesty's disappearance, the Xuanhuang secret realms lost their source of power and will only gradually fall into decline. If you had not appeared, in a few trillion years at minimum, or half a cosmic cycle at most, I would have completely fallen into slumber along with the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure said. A few trillion years?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the six-armed figure. But for the eternal paramount experts, a few trillion years was not considered much.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang secret realm was opened by the Xuanhuang Emperor himself. If nothing went awry, it should have persisted eternally alongside His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>In truth, not just worlds but entire universes will eventually decay - hence the concept of cosmic cycles.</p><p></p><p>The reason paramount experts' inner universes can remain eternal is because the paramount experts themselves periodically intervene and make adjustments.</p><p></p><p>"Whether I completely fall into slumber or directly perish is inconsequential. But His Majesty's legacy, the fruits of His Majesty's efforts, cannot be allowed to disappear."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's tone carried an inexplicable resoluteness. Lin Yuan listened quietly, knowing that without him asking, the six-armed figure would explain the reason for summoning him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not believe that the summons from the Xuanhuang secret realm, spanning countless millions of light-years, was merely to have him listen to the other party's "complaints."</p><p></p><p>"However, to truly inherit His Majesty's full legacy, having a successor alone is far from enough."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure gazed at Lin Yuan. "You need to pass through the myriad trials set by His Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the Lord of Demon Jade Pavilion left behind the nine floors of the Black Pavilion, which had to be overcome layer by layer to obtain the corresponding rewards.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was long familiar with such setups. Even in human civilizations and among the various apex races, to obtain something required passing certain trials.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to go through those trials?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Which trials?" The six-armed figure fell silent, his expression turning strange as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty set sixty-eight minor trials, twenty-five intermediate trials, and six major trials."</p><p></p><p>"Only lifeforms that pass through all the trials can inherit everything of the Xuanhuang lineage within this secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure said this, then paused for a moment. "However, for you, there is no need for such trouble."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure gazed at Lin Yuan. As the "heavenly dao" of this secret realm, nothing Lin Yuan did within could be hidden from it.</p><p></p><p>Putting other factors aside, just the level of spatial dimensions Lin Yuan occupied was enough to make the six-armed figure feel shaken.</p><p></p><p>This Xuanhuang secret realm could only accommodate experts of the invincible eighth stage and the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>So all the trials set by the Xuanhuang Emperor targeted lifeforms at the ninth stage realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>What could be used to assess him?</p><p>What trials could be set?</p><p></p><p>"No need for such trouble?" Lin Yuan raised his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure waved his right hand, and an earth-yellow crystal appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the earth-yellow crystal was exceptionally pure, far surpassing the Xuanhuang crystals, faintly connected to the entire Xuanhuang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan and said:</p><p></p><p>"You only need to refine this secret realm core, and you can become the new master of this secret realm. Everything within, including the treasures and legacies of the Xuanhuang lineage, will be yours."</p>

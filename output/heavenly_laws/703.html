        <h1>Chapter 703</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Saints like Wind Candle were in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan made his move, they had imagined many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>There was the Milky Way Saint directly invading that small continent, sweeping through many dimensional native creatures, and finally plucking that Source Fruit, bringing them all back safely.</p><p></p><p>There was the Milky Way Saint using his space-time rule insights to instantly appear next to the Source Fruit tree, taking the Source Fruit and leaving before the many dimensional native creatures could react. </p><p></p><p>There was the Milky Way Saint using special methods to suppress all the dimensional native creatures for a short time, then easily taking the Source Fruit.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>They had thought through all kinds of possible scenarios.</p><p></p><p>But the premise of all possibilities was that the Milky Way Saint would definitely deploy his true self.</p><p></p><p>After all, compared to the true self, an avatar would be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Even with extraordinary methods and rule insights, if the physical body and mind were too weak, they couldn't be utilized.</p><p></p><p>But the scene of the Milky Way Saint reaching out and grabbing the entire Source Fruit tree was still done by an avatar.</p><p></p><p>This left all the Supreme Saints watching in silence. </p><p></p><p>The scene was too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>Could an avatar be this strong? Or rather, how powerful must the true self be, to casually condense an avatar this strong?</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Source Fruit tree was uprooted and suddenly awakened.</p><p></p><p>As a treasure born in the dimensional gap, the Source Fruit tree itself possessed a certain intelligence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the many dimensional native creatures on the small continent were secretly driven by this Source Fruit tree.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, given how precious the Source Fruit tree was, it would have long been devoured by those dimensional native creatures. How could it have waited until the Eye of All Laws discovered it?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Source Fruit tree, which had considerable self-preservation abilities, was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Its branches and leaves were shaking uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional gap was endlessly mysterious. The 13th level time beings within it were behemoths that could roam the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>There were also some beings below the 13th level, all born in the dimensional gap. Life born in such a harsh environment was much stronger in combat power than life born in a cradle like the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>The Source Fruit tree itself belonged to this category. The actions of Supreme Saints like Wind Candle were like child's play in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the fact that the rift connecting to the Chaos Void would close in three days. Even if it didn't close, Wind Candle and the other Supreme Saints definitely wouldn't be able to pluck the Source Fruit in the end.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Source Fruit tree had planned to wait until Wind Candle and the other Supreme Saints went deeper, then make a move to devour them.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Lin Yuan arrived instead.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong."</p><p></p><p>"Is this a life born within dimensional space?"</p><p></p><p>The Source Fruit tree trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>In its drifting through the dimensional gap until now, it had seen many terrifying life forms.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Lin Yuan, they were far too inferior.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan refreshed the Source Fruit tree's understanding of life below the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws was also closely watching the situation on the small continent, and naturally saw Lin Yuan's heaven-covering gesture.</p><p></p><p>"This strength?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought Lin Yuan had only sent an avatar, which was slightly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that just one avatar would be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"The power of one avatar surpasses all the invincible Supreme Saints in history?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws' thoughts spread. Although Lin Yuan obtaining the Source Fruit made him extremely pleased, this terrifying strength left the Eye of All Laws' heart unable to calm for a long time.</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't certain that Lin Yuan had not yet broken through to the 13th level, he would have suspected that a time being had intervened again.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of monster is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws looked on from afar, feeling deeply emotional.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought he couldn't see Lin Yuan's avatar clearly because it was blocked by some technique or secret method.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that it was purely because the avatar's strength was too great, exceeding his limit of observation.</p><p></p><p>"What level of strength is the Milky Way Saint's true self?"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws couldn't help but be curious, but he also knew he probably wouldn't find out.</p><p></p><p>With just one avatar having such strength, who in the Chaos Void could force the Milky Way Saint's true self to go all out?</p><p></p><p>The spirits of those special places?</p><p></p><p>Let's not mention that the spirits of special places cannot take action.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could act, they probably wouldn't be a match for this current avatar of the Milky Way Saint.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Milky Way Saint's true self.</p><p></p><p>In the Eye of All Laws' view, only the lofty 13th level beings could force the Milky Way Saint's true self to go all out.</p><p></p><p>But 13th level time beings were the least likely to take action.</p><p></p><p>The 13th level time beings wouldn't even pay attention to what was happening in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>The gaze and mental energy of 13th level time beings were basically focused on the distant future. As for the past and present? Unless something happened that affected the foundation of the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>For example, if a special place was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it was very difficult to attract the attention of 13th level time beings.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if that one knows that the legacy left behind has cultivated an existence like the Milky Way Saint"</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'that one' was the founder of the 'Infinite Void', and also one of the time beings of this Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Over the long cosmic era, the Eye of All Laws had witnessed a succession of cultivators inheriting the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? All the 'Infinite Void' legacy cultivators in history combined probably wouldn't be enough for the Milky Way Saint to slap with one hand.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, they wouldn't be enough for one avatar of the Milky Way Saint to slap with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"Very smooth."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached out and retrieved the entire Source Fruit tree, without encountering any fierce resistance.</p><p></p><p>At the moment his avatar made a move, his true self had already turned attention to this side, ready to descend and take action at any time if something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>"Dimensional gap."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the vast dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>He had always held a sense of awe towards the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao rules operated within dimensional space, an environment very suitable for cultivation, equivalent to a cradle of life.</p><p></p><p>Some dimensional spaces even had great gifts for life.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Chaos Void's origin infusion was a 'benefit' that every life in this dimensional space could enjoy.</p><p></p><p>But the dimensional gap? The Great Dao rules did not exist, and it had to bear the pressure emitted by huge dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Life that could survive in the dimensional gap was all very strong, because the weak simply couldn't survive.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the dimensional gap was also the battlefield of the 13th level time beings.</p><p></p><p>13th level time beings rarely fought and killed each other within dimensional spaces, as that would cause too much damage to the dimensional space itself.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the battlefield of the 13th level was in the dimensional gap. Only this vast space could withstand the all-out battles between time beings.</p><p></p><p>"This Source Fruit tree?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Source Fruit tree in his hand, his expression showing surprise, "It actually gave birth to a 'spirit'?"</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, Lin Yuan keenly sensed the fluctuations of the Source Fruit tree's own 'spirit'.</p><p></p><p>When he reached out and grabbed it earlier, he hadn't thought too much, just intending to test it out.</p><p></p><p>"My lord."</p><p></p><p>The Source Fruit tree timidly</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A wave of consciousness emanated from it.</p><p></p><p>"Quite timid," Lin Yuan said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know that the Law Source Fruit Tree had originally planned to devour Wind Candle Great Saint and the other supreme great saints as well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if he knew, Lin Yuan wouldn't care too much. With his absolute power suppression, the Law Source Fruit Tree couldn't make any waves.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take one of your Law Source Fruits, if you don't mind," Lin Yuan said, looking down at the Law Source Fruit Tree.</p><p></p><p>"I don't mind at all," the Law Source Fruit Tree immediately responded. "I have many of these fruits."</p><p></p><p>As it spoke, the branches and leaves of the Law Source Fruit Tree swayed. One by one, Law Source Fruits rapidly condensed and hung from the branches and leaves.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Law Source Fruits were merely a gathering of the Law Source Fruit Tree's essence, used as "bait" to attract other living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded. </p><p></p><p>He had promised the Eye of All Laws that he would bring back a Law Source Fruit for him.</p><p></p><p>"Those dimensional creatures..." Lin Yuan's gaze turned once again to the small continent in the distance.</p><p></p><p>While capturing the Law Source Fruit Tree earlier, he had also annihilated quite a few dimensional creatures on the continent. However, it didn't bring about an increase in his mental will like it did in the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that in the Void Secret Realm of the Boundless Void, killing those void creatures from the dimensional gaps would directly enhance one's mental will.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He speculated there were two possible reasons:</p><p></p><p>First, his mental will was already too high now. Killing these dimensional creatures no longer had any effect on improving his mental will.</p><p></p><p>Second, the reason killing void creatures in the Void Secret Realm of the Boundless Void could enhance mental will was due to the special nature of that dimensional space. Each dimensional space had its unique properties, like the infusion of origin in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan believed the second reason was more likely.</p><p></p><p>Because if killing dimensional creatures could truly enhance mental will, even if it had no effect on him, other great saints would surely have noticed by now.</p><p></p><p>Even if it had little effect on great saints, many of them who were raising descendants would certainly have tried to capture dimensional creatures alive to use on their offspring.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan had never heard of such a thing happening.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be heading back then," Lin Yuan said as he put away the Law Source Fruit Tree and looked towards Wind Candle Great Saint and the other supreme great saints.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Wind Candle Great Saint immediately responded, quickly acknowledging.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the power of just one of Lin Yuan's avatars, the supreme great saints present felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws looked at the fist-sized Law Source Fruit before him, his gaze slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you so much, Galaxy Great Saint," the Eye of All Laws said to Lin Yuan. The acquisition of this Law Source Fruit had been incredibly smooth.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Eye of All Laws had prepared for some complications. Even with Lin Yuan, the strongest and most invincible great saint in history, taking action, anything could happen in the dimensional gap. What if some accident occurred?</p><p></p><p>But he hadn't expected Lin Yuan's strength to be so terrifyingly powerful. With just one avatar, he had uprooted and taken away the entire Law Source Fruit Tree.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," Lin Yuan said with a smile. "I'll be keeping that Law Source Fruit Tree."</p><p></p><p>"Of course," the Eye of All Laws immediately replied. He hadn't asked Lin Yuan to bring back the entire tree.</p><p></p><p>Because taking a Law Source Fruit and taking the entire Law Source Fruit Tree were not on the same level of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional creatures on that small continent were incredibly fierce, guarding the Law Source Fruit Tree.</p><p></p><p>If only one Law Source Fruit was lost, it might not have provoked the ferocity of those dimensional creatures.</p><p></p><p>But taking away the entire Law Source Fruit Tree? All the dimensional creatures on the small continent would likely fight to the death without regard for anything else.</p><p></p><p>In this scenario, according to the Eye of All Laws' initial predictions, even Lin Yuan might not have been able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Taking one Law Source Fruit still left the possibility of escaping unscathed.</p><p></p><p>Taking the entire Law Source Fruit Tree greatly reduced the chances of getting away safely.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws was only interested in the Law Source Fruit, so naturally, he didn't want to bear such a great risk.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll be taking my leave," Lin Yuan stood up, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the Eye of All Laws looked at Lin Yuan. "The branch path of Galaxy Great Saint's evolution is currently spreading very smoothly. In the future, even if great saints fall into time loops, with me here, it will continue to spread."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for that," Lin Yuan said with a smile upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After falling into a time loop, the continued spread of one's evolutionary branch path would certainly be beneficial for anchoring oneself.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws saying this was also a way of currying favor with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing," the Eye of All Laws immediately said. "With Galaxy Great Saint's foundation, even without spreading the evolutionary branch path, reaching the 13th level wouldn't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>This was actually the Eye of All Laws' true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The vast Chaos Void had given birth to many 13th-level time beings.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? Since the beginning of the Chaos Void, there had only been this one.</p><p></p><p>There had never been one before.</p><p></p><p>And there likely wouldn't be another in the future.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's existence was even rarer than 13th-level time beings.</p><p></p><p>"It still needs to be spread," Lin Yuan said with a smile, then his form disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws looked at the spot where Lin Yuan had vanished.</p><p></p><p>He fell into deep thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt a hint of regret in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Had he made his request too early?</p><p></p><p>In the Desolate Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Just then, his avatar appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did you understand causality this time, but you also gained something?" Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile as he extended his right hand, and the Law Source Fruit Tree appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the so-called Law Source Fruits were merely "bait" casually condensed from the Law Source Fruit Tree's own essence.</p><p></p><p>The most precious thing was still the Law Source Fruit Tree itself.</p><p></p><p>"My lord..." The Law Source Fruit Tree was almost suffocating. From Lin Yuan's avatar to his true body, it had once again experienced a journey from heaven to hell.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the avatar, the pressure Lin Yuan's true body gave it was countless times stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Let's put it in the inner universe," Lin Yuan thought, and with a slight mental command, the Law Source Fruit Tree was moved into his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>Such a rare treasure born from the dimensional gap would also have a certain degree of nurturing effect on the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>At least much stronger than the Chaos Tree.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Before the Law Source Fruit Tree could react, it found itself in a boundless universe.</p><p></p><p>"This should be the lord's inner universe," the Law Source Fruit Tree thought to itself.</p><p></p><p>It had interacted with Wind Candle Great Saint and other supreme great saints before, so it knew about inner universes.</p><p></p><p>"No, wait."</p><p></p><p>"The lord's inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Law Source Fruit Tree had just breathed a sigh of relief. Lin Yuan putting it into his inner universe meant he had no intention of killing it.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, the Law Source Fruit Tree realized something was off.</p><p></p><p>"This inner universe? This inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Law Source Fruit Tree could hardly believe it. "Perfect, it's too perfect. Even more perfect than this dimensional space?"</p><p></p><p>The Law Source Fruit Tree had drifted in the dimensional gap and come into contact with many dimensional spaces. The largest dimensional space was the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>However, in the Law Source Fruit Tree's perception at this moment, even the vast Chaos Void couldn't compare to Lin Yuan's inner universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

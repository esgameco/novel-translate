        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 443: One Person Blocks the Path, Stopping Myriad Races (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The human peak expert Xia Qinzhi waved his right hand towards the massive battlefield, and nearly two hundred rank eleven experts fell like shooting stars into the edge area of the battlefield. </p><p></p><p>The other eight human peak experts did the same, quickly sending a large number of rank eleven experts from the Human Civilization Alliance into the edge of the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after.</p><p></p><p>The various peak race forces began sending their own rank eleven experts into the edge of the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qinzhi, did that human 'Blood Rain' also go in?" The peak expert from the Cosmic Alliance transmitted a question.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, a space-time fluctuation impacting the ultimate realm had spread from the human civilization domain, and many alien peak experts speculated that the one causing the impact might be the human Blood Rain.</p><p></p><p>Based on Blood Rain's performance in the two-dimensional world, even if he was relying on some treasure to display such exceptional combat power, his personal realm had to be at least at the perfect rank eleven stage.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated he was even closer to rank twelve than the Four Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>So this was the speculation of the alien peak experts.</p><p></p><p>But it was ultimately just speculation, and no one could say for sure whether it was really Blood Rain or not.</p><p></p><p>"You'll find out when the time comes," Xia Qinzhi replied casually. He would never leak any information about Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh..."</p><p></p><p>The peak expert of the Cosmic Alliance didn't say anything further. If the human civilization had Blood Rain, how could the Cosmic Alliance not have an existence at the same level?</p><p></p><p>The Four Divine Kings were crushed by the human Blood Rain in the two-dimensional world, but the environment of the two-dimensional world was special. This time in the massive battlefield, there was no such environment.</p><p></p><p>It would not be easy to defeat the experts of the Cosmic Alliance in this massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In order to avenge their previous humiliation, several peak experts of the Cosmic Alliance had already set up many contingencies.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly broke free from the falling momentum and gently landed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the edge area of the massive battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan surveyed his surroundings. As far as he could see, there were towering ancient trees densely packed without end.</p><p></p><p>Each of these ancient trees emanated a surging vitality. If it weren't for the space-time suppression of the battlefield, they could probably become true life forms if placed in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"There are only three rank eleven experts from the Human Civilization Alliance that fell into this area?"</p><p></p><p>Following the causal resonance, Lin Yuan confirmed the number of rank eleven experts from the Human Civilization Alliance in this area.</p><p></p><p>There were three hundred and thirty-three edge areas in the massive battlefield, and in this particular edge area, there were only four rank eleven experts from the Human Civilization Alliance, which was considered very unlucky.</p><p></p><p>With so few rank eleven experts from the Human Civilization Alliance, they would inevitably face suppression and targeting from other races when competing for the space-time path leading to the core area.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>All of this was under the premise that Lin Yuan was not present.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the space-time path?" </p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing for a moment, Lin Yuan found that in each of the three hundred and thirty-three edge areas, there was a space-time path at a certain location.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this space-time path was easy to discover, as one only needed to slightly sense the space-time fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"The space-time suppression is formidable, making it difficult to perform long-distance spatial movement."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why there was only one space-time path left in each of the three hundred and thirty-three edge areas.</p><p></p><p>Unable to perform spatial movement, even rank eleven perfected experts would likely take until the end of the massive battlefield's war if they only relied on flying from the edge area to the core area.</p><p></p><p>Only by taking the space-time path could one reach the core area at the fastest speed and participate in the struggle between the twelve peak race forces.</p><p></p><p>"However, with my sixfold resonance in the space-time realm, I can still perform spatial movement, but not to the extent of traversing billions of light-years in a single step like in the outside world."</p><p></p><p>After some experimentation, Lin Yuan came to this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>If even he was limited to this extent, those rank eleven experts could probably only slowly fly.</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll head to that space-time path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step and his figure vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the edge area where Lin Yuan had descended.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the alien rank eleven experts began surveying their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"In this area... my Cosmic Alliance has fifty-three rank eleven experts. Steady."</p><p></p><p>A massive rocky life form smiled as it sensed the causal resonance.</p><p></p><p>With tens of thousands of rank eleven experts descending into the three hundred and thirty-three edge areas, the average number of rank eleven experts in each edge area was around two hundred.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred rank eleven experts from the twelve peak race alliances. Among them, the Cosmic Alliance had twenty-three rank eleven experts, exceeding the average number, so they were likely to occupy an advantageous position.</p><p></p><p>If the fifty-three rank eleven experts of the Cosmic Alliance joined forces, they had an excellent chance of all entering the space-time path to the core area.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Path of Void, arriving at the core area. </p><p></p><p>At that time, the forces of the Temporal-Spatial Grand Alliance in the core area would become stronger, and may even influence the final battle situation.</p><p></p><p>On another wasteland.</p><p></p><p>A figure clad entirely in jet-black armor stood silently there. </p><p></p><p>"In this area, my Demonic Race only has twelve at the eleventh rank?" This jet-black armored figure from the Demonic Race opened his mouth and smiled: "But with me here, out of the hundred spots on the Temporal-Spatial Path, my Demonic Race will occupy twelve."</p><p></p><p>This powerful Demonic Race expert was at the fifth level of the eleventh rank, wielding an extremely powerful weapon.</p><p></p><p>Among the tens of thousands of eleventh rank experts from the twelve peak races, only a few hundred to a thousand were qualified to wield such powerful weapons. </p><p></p><p>Scattered across the three hundred and thirty edge areas, perhaps only one or two experts of this level existed in a single area.</p><p></p><p>So the powerful Demonic Race expert was very confident. Relying on his powerful weapon, he considered himself to be at the pinnacle among the tens of thousands of eleventh ranks, with only those eleventh ranks who also wielded powerful weapons posing a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Temporal-Spatial Path...where is it?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful Demonic Race expert sensed for a moment, determined the location of the Temporal-Spatial Path, and directly flew into the sky, heading in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>On the massive battlefield, the temporal-spatial suppression was heavy. Even eleventh rank perfected experts at the fifth level of temporal-spatial comprehension could not achieve spatial movement through their own power alone.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the only way to travel to the Temporal-Spatial Path was by flying.</p><p></p><p>On another hill.</p><p></p><p>A massive mother nest descended.</p><p></p><p>"This edge area..."</p><p></p><p>This mother nest belonged to the Insect Race. She observed the surroundings and quickly began to muster Insect Race warriors.</p><p></p><p>Inside her mother nest, a large number of Insect Race warriors had already been nurtured. In just a short while, tens of thousands of eleventh rank Insect Race warriors appeared, swarming around the mother nest.</p><p></p><p>These eleventh rank Insect Race warriors had only reached the threshold of the eleventh rank in terms of strength. In one-on-one combat, they couldn't even defeat a first level eleventh rank expert.</p><p></p><p>But their sheer numbers were overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of eleventh rank threshold Insect Race warriors charging together would likely give even fourth or fifth level eleventh rank experts some trouble.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these tens of thousands of eleventh rank threshold Insect Race warriors were merely the initial nurturing from this mother nest. As time passed, she could nurture even more powerful Insect Race warriors, no longer limited to just the eleventh rank threshold.</p><p></p><p>In front of a massive temporal-spatial labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm the first to arrive," Lin Yuan glanced around, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the locations where the eleventh rank experts descended in each edge area formed a circular range with the Temporal-Spatial Path at the center.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the distance between each eleventh rank expert and the Temporal-Spatial Path was roughly the same.</p><p></p><p>This was done to prevent certain eleventh rank experts from being too close to the Temporal-Spatial Path, arriving early and entering without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's temporal-spatial comprehension had reached the sixth level, allowing him to move through space even on this massive battlefield, so he could naturally arrive first.</p><p></p><p>"This temporal-spatial labyrinth..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed it briefly.</p><p></p><p>In front of each Temporal-Spatial Path was a temporal-spatial labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>Only by passing through this labyrinth could one truly reach the Temporal-Spatial Path.</p><p></p><p>"Too simple."</p><p></p><p>With just a single step, Lin Yuan crossed the temporal-spatial labyrinth, appearing in front of that Temporal-Spatial Path.</p><p></p><p>Outside the massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Many twelfth rank experts were also observing the various edge areas.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign of the human civilization can actually move through space within the battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, some supreme experts noticed this and showed a hint of surprise on their faces.</p><p></p><p>According to the standards they had set for opening this massive battlefield, eleventh rank lifeforms should basically be unable to achieve spatial movement relying solely on themselves.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the human civilization has invested considerable effort for this Galactic Sovereign, bestowing upon him a treasure that allows forced spatial movement."</p><p></p><p>A Matriarch of the Insect Race coldly laughed and glanced at the supreme experts of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Within this massive battlefield, any eleventh rank expert, even at the perfected eleventh rank, could not move through space relying only on their own power.</p><p></p><p>However, with the aid of certain spatial treasures, it was possible to break through this limitation.</p><p></p><p>But such spatial treasures were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>For them to be effective even in the hands of a newly ascended eleventh rank like the Galactic Sovereign was especially uncommon.</p><p></p><p>Any treasure, once reaching a certain level, required the user to meet certain standards in order to utilize it.</p><p></p><p>For example, to refine a supreme weapon required at least the fifth level of temporal-spatial comprehension. To activate a spatial treasure capable of forced movement also had similar requirements.</p><p></p><p>To avoid or lower these standards required the treasure itself to be exceptionally precious.</p><p></p><p>"This is a matter for my human civilization. What business does the Insect Race have to interject?" </p><p></p><p>One of the human supreme experts retorted.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi the Paramount looked at the insect race's gaze and responded casually. </p><p></p><p>In fact, Xia Qinzhi the Paramount was quite puzzled in his heart. He remembered that he had not bestowed any spatial treasures that allowed forcible movement to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi the Paramount did have the idea of bestowing similar treasures, but they were all rejected by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he obtained some special spatial oddity in the two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi the Paramount speculated in his heart. He knew that Lin Yuan had acquired many strange objects in the two-dimensional world, but he did not ask about the details, after all, they were Lin Yuan's own harvests.</p><p></p><p>In the huge battlefield world, there existed many isolated spaces and times. Even a Paramount at the twelfth level could hardly see through all spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many ultimate beings at the twelfth level could not judge whether Lin Yuan's ability to move through space stemmed from his own power or from some spatial treasure.</p><p></p><p>But based on Lin Yuan's situation when he first entered the eleventh level, the subconscious deduction was that Lin Yuan relied on some special spatial treasure to achieve all this.</p><p></p><p>Even Xia Qinzhi the Paramount thought so.</p><p></p><p>Although he witnessed the movement when Lin Yuan broke through to the eleventh level, Xia Qinzhi the Paramount never thought that this Galactic Stellar Master had already reached the sixfold realm in the comprehension of space-time, which could rival a Paramount.</p><p></p><p>"Bestowing such a spatial treasure to a newly advanced eleventh-level cultivator is like pouring water into a bamboo basket," said the Insect Queen coldly.</p><p></p><p>Within the huge battlefield, those fifth and sixth-rank eleventh-level experts could hardly die, as they possessed paramount weapons.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was merely a newly advanced eleventh-level cultivator. No matter how monstrous he was, without refining a paramount weapon, there was a possibility of death.</p><p></p><p>Once dead, even if it was just a split body, this special spatial treasure would be lost.</p><p></p><p>If it fell into the hands of other peak forces, it would be difficult for the human civilization to demand it back.</p><p></p><p>"The path of space-time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the path of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he wished, he could cross the path of space-time at any time and head to the core area.</p><p></p><p>Only...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced back.</p><p></p><p>Going directly to the core area would be too wasteful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were still a few eleventh-level experts from the Human Civilization Alliance behind him.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan went to the core area now, these eleventh-level experts from the Human Civilization Alliance would probably be stuck in the peripheral area.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan immediately sat cross-legged, blocking the path of space-time, and quietly waited for the other eleventh-level experts from different races to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a day went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In front of the path of space-time, the space-time labyrinth began to surge continuously, as if many experts were constantly fighting inside.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha."</p><p></p><p>"Mingchen, what good is it that you possess a paramount weapon? With your strength, how many strikes can you unleash from the paramount weapon?" A huge rocky lifeform laughed loudly and strode out of the space-time labyrinth with a smug expression.</p><p></p><p>Mingchen was the fifth-rank eleventh-level expert from the Prison Race, wielding a paramount weapon.</p><p></p><p>Shua.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Mingchen, clad in a jet-black armor, also charged out of the space-time labyrinth. He coldly glanced at the massive rocky lifeform but said nothing.</p><p></p><p>There were too many eleventh-level experts from the Stellar Alliance in this area, reaching over fifty. There was no need to fight to the death with them.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were a hundred spots to enter the path of space-time, which was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>After rushing out of the space-time labyrinth, the massive rocky lifeform immediately noticed Lin Yuan sitting cross-legged in front of the path of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Stellar Master?"</p><p></p><p>The massive rocky lifeform immediately recognized him.</p><p></p><p>There was no way he couldn't. The Galactic Stellar Master was too famous, especially after advancing to the eleventh level, making all the stellar races aware of this peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Stellar Master?" Mingchen from the Prison Race also looked towards Lin Yuan, his expression somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In order to reach the path of space-time as soon as possible, they had not delayed at all, especially during the battles in the space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>But from start to finish, they had never seen the Galactic Stellar Master.</p><p></p><p>Yet now the Galactic Stellar Master was sitting here?</p><p></p><p>Didn't this mean that the Galactic Stellar Master had arrived here even before they started to enter the space-time labyrinth?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would have at least caught a glimpse of the Galactic Stellar Master.</p><p></p><p>This made Mingchen quite puzzled. With the Galactic Stellar Master's strength upon first entering the eleventh level, why would he arrive here so much earlier than them?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after the Galactic Stellar Master rushed here, he did not enter the path of space-time but instead sat in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Experts who could cultivate to the eleventh level had such powerful mental processing speeds. They immediately sensed something was amiss and did not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Just as the massive rocky lifeform and Mingchen from the Prison Race were puzzled and wary, Lin Yuan finally opened his eyes, looked at the many eleventh-level experts from different races who had rushed out of the space-time labyrinth, and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"You've finally arrived."</p>

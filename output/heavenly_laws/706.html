        <h1>Chapter 706</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The second Origin World.</p><p></p><p>In the center of heaven and earth, four or five majestic Origin Demons were fleeing, with incomparably dark and profound demonic energy sweeping around.</p><p></p><p>As Origin Demons second only to Demon Gods, since the descent of the Demon Calamity, such a sorry sight had never appeared before, let alone four or five Origin Demons together? Even when facing the foundational strike of an Eternal Sect, many Origin Demons would only choose to temporarily avoid the edge and actively retreat. As for fleeing?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Above the four or five Origin Demons, a young man appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"Where can you escape to?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the four or five Origin Demons.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand.</p><p></p><p>Space and time were scooped up.</p><p></p><p>The four or five Origin Demons appeared in Lin Yuan's palm like four or five ants.</p><p></p><p>Then they were instantly ground into billions of pieces by the Yin-Yang Taiji Great Millstone, turning into the purest energy, surging into the most microscopic particle worlds within Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>The pure energy transformed from the four or five Origin Demons was vast, instantly opening up over a trillion particle worlds. Lin Yuan's energy imperceptibly increased by a notch.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Origin Demons in the center of heaven and earth have all hidden away, making them hard to catch."</p><p></p><p>After successfully refining the four or five Origin Demons, Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, Lin Yuan had made a deal with the Eternal Sect forces, promising to help them deal with the Origin Demons.</p><p></p><p>After that, Lin Yuan began hunting those Origin Demons from the edge of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In this Origin World, most Origin Demons gathered in the center of heaven and earth, but there were still a small number of Origin Demons in the four directions of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's initial target was these Origin Demons located in the four directions.</p><p></p><p>Nine thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Origin Demons in the four directions were hunted to extinction by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's target then shifted to the center of heaven and earth on its own.</p><p></p><p>There, over 90% of the Origin Demons were gathered.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the scattered Origin Demons in the four directions, the Origin Demons in the center of heaven and earth, if not discovered in groups, would at least be encountered much more frequently.</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years ago, 30% of the Origin Demons in the center of heaven and earth were hunted by Lin Yuan, and these Origin Demons also realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Although Origin Demons had no thoughts or consciousness, they had instincts. After perceiving a large decrease in the number of their companions, some Origin Demons began to hide.</p><p></p><p>Until now.</p><p></p><p>In the center of heaven and earth, apart from endless demonic energy, the shadows of terrifyingly powerful Origin Demons could hardly be seen, as they had all hidden away.</p><p></p><p>Origin Demons originated from demonic energy, and demonic energy was everywhere in heaven and earth. Once Origin Demons sincerely hid within the demonic energy, even Lin Yuan had no way to locate and discover them on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>He could only search bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"After ten thousand years of hunting, the particle worlds I've opened up already occupy 99% of my body."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the vast energy within his body and nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The physical body contains infinite sand-like particles, and to open up a world within each particle requires opening up infinite sand-like particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>What is meant by "sand-like"? It means endless.</p><p></p><p>Infinite sand-like particle worlds means endless particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>These particle worlds are maintained by runes, inheriting the cultivation of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>It can be said that each particle world is comparable to the internal universe of a supreme great saint.</p><p></p><p>"Among the three true body avatars of Chaotic Void, the First Origin World, and the Second Origin World, this one is definitely the strongest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure strength, even if the true body avatars of Chaotic Void and the First Origin World were combined and enhanced dozens of times, they still couldn't compare to the true body avatar of the Second Origin World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, who was close to completely opening up infinite sand-like particle worlds, felt that he even had the ability to directly confront a 13th-level time lifeform.</p><p></p><p>"So far, opening up particle worlds hasn't encountered any major problems. I just need to wait until it's completely opened up, then I can apply it to the other two true body avatars."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Opening up one or two worlds from particles is very simple, but opening up infinite sand-like particle worlds? If there's a mistake, the consequence would be the collapse of the true body avatar.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan is currently only trying this on his third major true body avatar.</p><p></p><p>Only after this true body avatar has completely walked this path and confirmed that there are no hidden dangers or questions, will he apply it to the other two major true body avatars.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it would waste time? For Lin Yuan, who has already opened up infinite sand-like particle worlds once, opening them up again wouldn't take much time.</p><p></p><p>Currently, what's limiting Lin Yuan's speed of opening particle worlds is resources.</p><p></p><p>And now, the two true body avatars in Chaotic Void and the First Origin World are already collecting large amounts of resources. As long as the third true body avatar succeeds, he will be able to complete the opening of infinite sand-like particle worlds on the other two true body avatars in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"In ten thousand years, besides constantly hunting Origin Demons, I've comprehended all the rune inheritances of the Eternal Sects and absorbed and digested the great paths walked by those Eternal Lords. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been possible to open up particle worlds so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. The operation of infinite sand-like particle worlds within his body requires the maintenance of rune paths.</p><p></p><p>The more particle worlds opened, the higher the comprehension of rune paths needed. Otherwise, based on Lin Yuan's rune comprehension from ten thousand years ago, it would have been impossible to maintain the current 99% of infinite sand-like particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Runes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the inheritance created by the Lord of Heavenly Light.</p><p></p><p>This inheritance helps in breaking through to the 13th level and has five levels.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, Lin</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Yuan had already cultivated to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Now, after ten thousand years, Lin Yuan had long since crossed into the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>However, the fifth level was exceptionally profound, basically equivalent to the Lord of Heavenly Light's most essential understanding of runes.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan had not yet fully comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>If at the fourth level, everything seen and felt were runes that could be used by me,</p><p></p><p>Then at the fifth level of this inheritance, runes would form with a mere thought. In simple terms, cultivators who comprehend this level have mastered runes beyond just tangible and intangible forms.</p><p></p><p>As long as the thought arises, runes can be gathered.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Lord of Heavenly Light was confident that fully comprehending this inheritance would greatly increase the chances of becoming an Eternal Lord. Now it seems, how could it be just a great increase?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Forming runes with a thought, even within the time loop, could easily utilize the power of runes. It was equivalent to obtaining a machine gun with infinite bullets in the Stone Age.</p><p></p><p>"However, for life forms below the thirteenth level, comprehending this inheritance is far too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even most Eternal Lords were stuck at the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had gathered all the rune inheritances from this source world, and with his heaven-defying comprehension ability, he had spent ten thousand years but still hadn't fully grasped the fifth level. One can imagine how much more difficult it would be for life forms below Eternal Lords to comprehend this inheritance - even harder than becoming an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>A large portion of Eternal Lords had not fully comprehended this inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm almost there."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts, then took a step forward and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Hidden World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden World was originally established as a stronghold by the major Eternal Sects, also serving as their final retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, as Lin Yuan continued to hunt Source Demons, causing their numbers to plummet in the central world, the Hidden World no longer needed to defend against Source Demons.</p><p></p><p>Now the Hidden World had begun to open up, and disciples from various Eternal Sects started exploring the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Eternal Infinite Sect and others immediately bowed respectfully to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, when Lin Yuan demonstrated the might of a single sword strike,</p><p></p><p>The sect masters of several Eternal Sects realized that the pressure they would face in the future might be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>But what none of the sect leaders had anticipated was that in just ten thousand years, the situation between cultivators and 'demons' in the central world would completely reverse.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, Source Demons would attack the Hidden World periodically.</p><p></p><p>But ten thousand years later, not a single Source Demon could be seen in the central world.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a Source Demon appeared, it would be suppressed by Lin Yuan in no time.</p><p></p><p>Because of Lin Yuan,</p><p></p><p>The major Eternal Sects now felt an unprecedented sense of ease.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the endless demonic qi still permeating the outside world, they would have thought they had returned to the time before the great change in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy, about the demonic qi fluctuations detected by the Eternal Treasure..." the Sect Master of the Eternal Infinite Sect inquired tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it was several Source Demons. They've all been dealt with."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>His ability to precisely locate the four or five Source Demons he had just hunted was mainly due to the Eternal Treasure specifically used by the Eternal Sects to observe the four directions of the world.</p><p></p><p>This was also an Eternal Treasure specially crafted by Eternal Lords before the great change in the world, capable of detecting subtle demonic qi fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, these Eternal Treasures were used to defend against Source Demon attacks. The gathering of Source Demons would inevitably cause demonic qi fluctuations, and detecting them through the Eternal Treasures was equivalent to having a defense mechanism.</p><p></p><p>But since Lin Yuan began hunting Source Demons, these Eternal Treasures, originally used as defensive measures, were now being used to hunt Source Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any other special demonic qi fluctuations?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actively inquired. He had now opened up 99.9% of the infinite sand particle worlds and was just a step away from fully opening them all.</p><p></p><p>"Not at the moment."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Eternal Infinite Sect replied with a complex tone.</p><p></p><p>The terrifyingly powerful Source Demons seemed like mere chicks in Lin Yuan's words.</p><p></p><p>"However, there is another matter that needs to be reported to Lord Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Eternal Infinite Sect said in a solemn tone: "Recently, the Eternal Treasure has observed that all the demonic qi in this world is converging in a certain pattern."</p><p></p><p>Even Source Demons could only draw in part of the demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>But all demonic qi converging in a pattern? "Are you suggesting the Demon God?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was calm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon God is usually in slumber, but due to Lord Galaxy's hunting, which has greatly reduced the number of Source Demons, it may have alerted the Demon God..."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Eternal Infinite Sect's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Since the great change in the world, the Demon God had only acted once.</p><p></p><p>That was right at the beginning of the world's great change. Since then, the Demon God had either been in slumber or occasionally awakened to survey the major Eternal Sects before returning to sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hunting Source Demons and disturbing the Demon God was unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan slowed down the pace of hunting Source Demons, as long as their numbers dropped to a certain level, it would still attract the Demon God's attention.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan clasped his hands behind his back, his gaze penetrating through the Hidden World to the vast demonic qi in the central world.</p><p></p><p>A hint of anticipation flickered in his expression.</p><p></p><p>He was eager to measure the might of the thirteenth-level Demon God with his infinite sand particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

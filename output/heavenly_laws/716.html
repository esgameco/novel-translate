        <h1>Chapter 716</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability's eyes flickered with reminiscence: "Come to think of it, I should be considered a disciple of the Lord of Celestial Light? When this world was first born, I fought with other lifeforms for resources."</p><p></p><p>"Just as I was about to die, the Lord of Celestial Light appeared and saved me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened. At the beginning of the origin world's creation, many extremely powerful lifeforms were born, and the struggle for survival began then.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Lord of Celestial Light's body radiated infinite light. I felt very warm and comfortable, so I wanted to follow Him."</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, the Lord of Celestial Light did not agree. He imparted some cultivation methods into my mind, including the way of runes, and then left."</p><p></p><p>"With complete cultivation methods, my strength progressed very quickly."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability paused for a moment, then continued: "Later, I heard more information related to the Lord of Celestial Light. He walked all over this world, spreading cultivation methods, allowing all beings to clearly see the path ahead, and laying the foundation for the cultivation system."</p><p></p><p>"As my strength continued to grow, I would go every time the Lord of Celestial Light preached."</p><p></p><p>"Once after the Lord of Celestial Light finished preaching and hadn't left yet, I mustered up the courage to ask Him why He did this? Why spread precious cultivation methods to all beings?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>He also had this doubt.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods are precious, especially those involving the essence of great Dao like the way of runes.</p><p></p><p>Spreading them to all beings for no reason? Was it merely out of kindness?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spread the branching paths of martial arts evolution in order to reinforce the external 'anchors' and increase the possibility of breaking through the time loop.</p><p></p><p>But what was the Lord of Celestial Light's purpose? At the level of temporal beings, there is no distinction between kindness and evil - everything is one's own path.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Lord of Celestial Light had a light body full of compassion for all beings, but also a dark magic body that was indifferent and emotionless. </p><p></p><p>Through the dark magic body, Lin Yuan understood that the Lord of Celestial Light was not truly pure kindness.</p><p></p><p>So-called kindness is something one does when it doesn't involve one's own interests.</p><p></p><p>Temporal beings can observe future timelines. Their so-called kindness is likely a choice made after viewing many future timelines.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Lord of Celestial Light said this was what He would owe the beings of this world in the future, so He was repaying it in advance to settle the karmic debt."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability said in a low voice: "At that time I didn't understand the meaning of these words. Owing the future beings of this world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened attentively, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The other twelve Eternal Lords also remained silent.</p><p></p><p>In terms of understanding the Lord of Celestial Light, the Lord of Immeasurability far surpassed them.</p><p></p><p>"Later, after I don't know how long, I finally became an Eternal Lord, becoming the second most powerful existence in this world after the Lord of Celestial Light," said the Lord of Immeasurability.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If the Lord of Celestial Light was counted, the Lord of Immeasurability was the second Eternal Lord in this origin world.</p><p></p><p>"After I became an Eternal Lord, the Lord of Celestial Light came personally and talked with me for a long time. I learned that the Lord of Celestial Light was not a being from this world. He came from the gaps between dimensions, accidentally discovered this world, sensed a trace of perfect aura, so He waited outside for a full cycle of great destruction."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, He paid a great price. Taking advantage of the moment when this world was just born and opened up, when the world consciousness was initially awakening, and when no other Eternal Lords had noticed, He successfully integrated into it."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability said.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it was."</p><p></p><p>The guess in Lin Yuan's heart was confirmed.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light's power formed an almost unbridgeable gap with the later thirteen Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Among the six Ancestors of the first origin world, the most powerful was the Great Subjugation Ancestor. Although the Great Subjugation Ancestor's strength was indeed greater than the other five Ancestors, the gap wasn't this large.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, the Lord of Celestial Light was almost certainly a Time Lord. And within a complete cycle of great destruction in a dimensional space world, it was very difficult for a Time Lord to be born.</p><p></p><p>Almost all Time Lords only understood how to converge their own timelines and finally achieve the status of Time Lord after their home dimensional space was destroyed and they roamed the gaps between dimensions for countless years.</p><p></p><p>"Our world contains a trace of perfect aura, which is very important to the Lord of Celestial Light. It's useful for His breakthrough to that step."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Immeasurability said.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect aura?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he vaguely realized that this might be the special characteristic of the origin world.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength and the number of temporal beings nurtured, the Chaos Void was not inferior to the origin world.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Void was not an origin world, while deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, there were only coordinates for thirty-three origin worlds? Among the endless dimensional planes, there were some powerful dimensional spaces, and there were certainly more than thirty-three that could rival the Chaos Void. But why did the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds only designate these thirty-three worlds as origin worlds?</p><p></p><p>It was probably related to the perfect aura.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had experienced different dimensional spaces and even observed the operation of the first origin world's origin. He also sensed that the origin world was very close to perfection, surpassing the Chaos Void by a large margin in this aspect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this perfection was only the perfection of the world itself and did not significantly help in nurturing life.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Lord of Celestial Light said that when He breaks through to that step in the future, with the help of this trace of perfect aura, He might be able to see further," said the Lord of Immeasurability.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Look further."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the Light Lord's description of breaking through to the 14th level perfect time life.</p><p></p><p>If one could do it, they could. If not, no amount of effort would make it possible.</p><p></p><p>But now, with this trace of perfect essence, one could see further? Perhaps "seeing further" here didn't mean any help in breaking through to the 14th level, but rather allowing time lives to clearly understand whether they could truly evolve into perfect time lives?</p><p></p><p>"Later on, Black Void, Wu Shan and the others also successively became Eternal Lords," said the Infinite Lord, glancing at the twelve Eternal Lords behind him.</p><p></p><p>"After this world gave birth to thirteen Eternal Lords, the Light Lord summoned us all and said to prepare for attempting that step," the Infinite Lord sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Attempting that step?" Lin Yuan was startled. </p><p></p><p>Did that mean the Light Lord planned to attempt breaking through to 14th level perfect time life?</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"The Light Lord attempted it in front of all thirteen of us," Black Void Lord added.</p><p></p><p>"What was the result?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>He then realized this question was meaningless. </p><p></p><p>The result must have been failure, otherwise if the Light Lord had evolved into a perfect time life, this source world wouldn't have ended up in its current state.</p><p></p><p>"The result..." </p><p></p><p>The Infinite Lord was silent for a moment. "I watched with my own eyes as the Light Lord's mind and consciousness ascended, then burned. That kind of ultimate brilliance even quickly made the timelines chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the Light Lord's mind and will disappeared. I don't know if it burned out completely or was erased from existence."</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Lord looked at Lin Yuan and continued: "Regrettably, I never called the Light Lord 'teacher' in the end. The Light Lord said His guidance to us was owed to the future, so there was no need to formally become disciples."</p><p></p><p>"What happened after that?" Lin Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Afterwards... without the Light Lord's mind and will to suppress it, His physical body quickly lost control. The dark magic body and light body were driven by instinct and began devouring this world indiscriminately."</p><p></p><p>Black Void Lord spoke up: "We joined forces to fight against it, but found we could only accelerate the destruction of this world. After observing countless timelines, we finally lured away the Light Lord's light body. Only by doing so could we leave a glimmer of hope for the future."</p><p></p><p>"Did the Light Lord know attempting that step would cause this result?" Lin Yuan inquired.</p><p></p><p>"He probably didn't know," the Infinite Lord shook his head. "Breaking through to perfect time life is completely outside the timelines and cannot be observed through them. The Light Lord was willing to teach and enlighten the living beings of this world in exchange for the opportunity to attempt breaking through to perfect time life here. As for the consequences of the attempt? They were unpredictable."</p><p></p><p>"It was only after the Light Lord's light body and dark magic body lost control that we fell back into the timelines and were able to observe, then make a series of arrangements and measures," said the Infinite Lord.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the thirteen Eternal Lords were both complex and fearful.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as the Light Lord had his mind and will disappear while attempting to break through to perfect time life. This was an outcome no time life was willing to accept.</p><p></p><p>"The Light Lord should be considered fallen now," the Infinite Lord said softly.</p><p></p><p>If He hadn't fallen, given the Light Lord's personality, He would not have allowed his two true bodies to lose control like this.</p><p></p><p>"Fallen?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>For time lords like the Light Lord, it seemed only attempting to break through to perfect time life could cause them to truly fall.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect time life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gained a new understanding of this level of life.</p><p></p><p>Time lives could observe timeline after timeline, and the more they observed, the more they felt their own insignificance, yearning to evolve towards perfect time life that could thoroughly comprehend all timelines.</p><p></p><p>"Friend Silver River, we must leave now," said the Infinite Lord, glancing at the gradually boiling demonic energy around them. A blurry figure was gradually materializing - it was the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, outside the source world, in the space filled with infinite light, waves of light were also surging. Clearly, the descent of the thirteen Eternal Lords had caused different degrees of reaction in the Light Lord's light body and dark magic body.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I have ordered the major Eternal Sects to listen to your commands from now on, friend Silver River," said the Infinite Lord.</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Lords had no objections.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, from this moment until the end of the demonic disaster, Lin Yuan would be the sole ruler of this source world. His words would carry more weight than even those of the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"When we meet again, friend Silver River, you will be a time life."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we'll meet again when you're a time life."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lords spoke in succession, then their descended consciousness avatars quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>As the thirteen consciousness avatars disappeared, the gradually boiling demonic energy from all directions calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>"Meet again when I'm a time life?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Then he fell back into cultivation.</p><p></p><p>PS: This volume ends here.

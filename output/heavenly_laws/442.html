            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 442: The Twelve Paramount Forces of the Universe (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"All of us are to listen to the Galactic Sovereign's commands?" </p><p></p><p>The many eleventh-stage evolved beings looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>The strongest few fully evolved eleventh-stage experts revealed looks of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Regardless if it was in human civilization or the myriad races of the vast cosmos, strength was revered above all.</p><p></p><p>For them, these eleventh-stage evolved beings, to completely obey the Galactic Sovereign's commands - </p><p></p><p>The most basic premise was that the Galactic Sovereign's own strength could not be weak.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"By order of the Supreme Expert."</p><p></p><p>The eleventh-stage evolved beings immediately nodded in response. </p><p></p><p>Although the Supreme Expert Xia Qin's order left them all puzzled, since the Supreme Expert said so, there must be a reason. This new eleventh-stage Galactic Sovereign's strength must far exceed their imaginations.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign?" Deputy Tower Master Nalan blinked, looking towards Lin Yuan sitting beside him with a slightly unfamiliar expression.</p><p></p><p>He had watched the Galactic Sovereign progress from the sixth and seventh stages until now, yet he was given such importance by Supreme Expert Xia Qin, to command all the eleventh-stage experts of the Xia You Evolution Spire?</p><p></p><p>Such status, in the Xia You Evolution Spire, was second only to the Supreme Expert. Even in the Human Civilization Alliance, he could firmly rank in the top twenty.</p><p></p><p>Although the nine great evolution spires of human civilization all had deputy tower master positions, the deputy tower masters were basically tenth-stage experts handling minor matters, without authority to command eleventh-stage evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Expert Xia Qin glanced at everyone, and space-time began to shift.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Supreme Expert Xia Qin brought all the evolved beings to the edge of a vast continent.</p><p></p><p>This vast continent contained an extremely heavy space-time suppression, with a diameter exceeding one thousand light-years, like an enormous object suspended in the starry cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"That's the super large-scale battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>"The space-time suppression is too terrifying. I can feel that spatial displacement will be greatly limited there."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the highest-level battlefield jointly created by multiple Supreme Experts."</p><p></p><p>The eleventh-stage evolved beings of the Xia You Evolution Spire couldn't help but whisper in discussion.</p><p></p><p>In the past, these eleventh-stage evolved beings rarely had chances to take action even in large-scale battlefields. Now in this super alien large-scale battlefield, the eleventh-stage was merely the entry requirement?</p><p></p><p>"The Space-Time Labyrinth."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the other eleventh-stage evolved beings, to Lin Yuan's eyes, this super large-scale battlefield resembled an unprecedented space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of space-time rules in operation made the entire battlefield manifest an extremely stable state.</p><p></p><p>"Truly marvelous." Lin Yuan inwardly admired. Although his space-time comprehension had reached the sixth-level realm, he was still far from being able to construct such a vast space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>This required an immense foundation. Even with the joint efforts of the Supreme Experts from the paramount forces, it still took them half a year to complete.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the construction of this super large-scale battlefield took far longer than half a year. Long ago, the various paramount forces had already intended to open such a super battlefield and had begun preparations since then.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Supreme Expert Xia Qin brought the many eleventh-stage evolved beings, dozens of figures with vastly different auras approached.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Supreme Expert Xia Qin."</p><p></p><p>These dozens of figures had profound auras, all eleventh-stage lifeforms, not human evolved beings but rather alien eleventh-stages subordinate to human civilization, as well as independent eleventh-stages, ancient celestial beings and others invited by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>As the paramount race, human civilization naturally attracted many powerful experts to follow, hence also being called the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the battlefield, all shall obey the Galactic Sovereign's commands."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Expert Xia Qin calmly instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The dozens of alien eleventh-stages were inwardly startled. They had heard of the Galactic Sovereign's might, but didn't expect Supreme Expert Xia Qin to entrust him with such a weighty task.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed not only they, these alien eleventh-stages, would follow the Galactic Sovereign's orders, but all the eleventh-stage evolved beings of the Xia You Evolution Spire as well.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Supreme Expert Xia Qin placed too much importance on this newly ascended eleventh-stage expert?</p><p></p><p>The many alien eleventh-stages had fluctuating thoughts but didn't dare disobey the Supreme Expert's order.</p><p></p><p>"A total of fifty-two alien eleventh-stages."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned them and counted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Xia You Evolution Spire itself had one hundred and forty-three eleventh-stage evolved beings. Adding these fifty-two alien eleventh-stages, the number of eleventh-stage experts subordinate to the Xia You Evolution Spire approached two hundred.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up and saw not far away there were...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>This is where the other eight evolutionary spires of human civilization are located for evolution.</p><p></p><p>The nine evolutionary spires of human civilization have similar strength. The Xiayou Evolutionary Spire has gathered nearly two hundred eleventh-stage experts. The other eight evolutionary spires likely have a similar number. </p><p></p><p>If all the eleventh-stage experts from the nine evolutionary spires are combined, the estimate would reach around 1,800?</p><p></p><p>The human civilization has less than a thousand publicly known eleventh-stage evolutionaries. Among these 1,800 eleventh-stage experts now, nearly half are from other races. </p><p></p><p>There is also a portion that are eleventh-stage experts secretly cultivated by the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand eight hundred eleventh-stage experts." Lin Yuan looked towards the distance.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization alone has deployed this many eleventh-stage experts. If all the peak forces gather all their eleventh-stage experts, wouldn't the total number reach tens of thousands?</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of eleventh-stage experts?</p><p></p><p>This is estimated to occupy nearly half the proportion of all eleventh-stage lifeforms in the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>For the dominance of this super large battlefield, the major peak forces indeed attach exceptional importance to it.</p><p></p><p>Among these tens of thousands of eleventh-stage experts, it's estimated there are hundreds to thousands who have reached the fifth rank, basically each wielding an extremely powerful weapon "borrowed" from their backing peak race.</p><p></p><p>"In the previous large battlefield, the number of eleventh-stage experts did not exceed three hundred when the two-dimensional world inside the white paper descended dimensions. But in this super large alien battlefield, the number of eleventh-stage experts has reached tens of thousands?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"However, with my current strength, after entering, I have the opportunity to wipe out all these tens of thousands of eleventh-stage experts while the alien experts have not reacted yet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason it's just an "opportunity" is because it's unpredictable how many alien experts have hidden abilities among these tens of thousands of eleventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>The hidden abilities of experts are difficult to gauge. At least the hidden ability Xia Qin gave Lin Yuan can temporarily unleash tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand strikes of power.</p><p></p><p>If even Xia Qin has such abilities, those other alien experts definitely have their own setups too.</p><p></p><p>But even if he can't wipe them all out, Lin Yuan can still slaughter a great number of eleventh-stage experts and reap many extremely powerful weapons.</p><p></p><p>No one would turn down more extremely powerful weapons, especially Lin Yuan cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Physique' which has a huge demand for resources.</p><p></p><p>But even consuming all the resources of the entire human civilization would not be enough for him to fully cultivate the eleventh-stage 'Xuanhuang Physique'. He can only pin his hopes on the resources from the battlefield of myriad races.</p><p></p><p>This is just the eleventh-stage perfected 'Xuanhuang Physique'. If it's the twelfth-stage perfected 'Xuanhuang Physique', it's estimated that even devouring all the resources of the entire universe would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"When entering the battlefield this time, be careful of Tianyu Meng from the Tianyu Race."</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was deep in thought, the voice of Xia Qin the expert transmitted over.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu Meng?" Lin Yuan nodded slightly. He had also heard of this figure from the Tianyu Race who had the highest hope of crossing into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>He carried the bloodline of the Tianyu Race's first ancestor. The Tianyu Race placed utmost importance on bloodline inheritance, with many of their divine abilities and talents passed down through the bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline of the first ancestor? Tianyu Meng's talents must be formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu Meng himself is nothing much against you. The key is that Angel Holy Crown - it's one of the Tianyu Race's race-protecting weapons. That first ancestor actually utilized even this profound item's heritage."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin continued, his tone revealing a hint of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Although the human civilization had also bestowed many extremely powerful weapons, they truly had no intention of bestowing any race-protecting weapons, as the risks to bear would be too great.</p><p></p><p>If an extreme situation occurred, losing ordinary extremely powerful weapons would just mean losing them. But losing a race-protecting weapon? The impact on the race's force itself would be unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>"A race-protecting weapon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Any weapon deemed a race-protecting weapon was stronger than ordinary extremely powerful weapons. So far, the only race-protecting weapon of the human civilization that Lin Yuan had encountered was the "Void World".</p><p></p><p>There were also race-protecting weapons suppressing the ancestral star of humanity, but Lin Yuan did not know the specifics.</p><p></p><p>"There are also experts from the Universe and Cosmos Races."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin continued, beginning to introduce other forces to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization was one of the twelve peak racial forces, and the Universe and Cosmos were two other major peak racial forces.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during the initial birth of the universe, there were no separate Universe and Cosmos Races - only a single Universe Race.</p><p></p><p>The Universe Race was the strongest force at that time, ruling over the universe for the first billions of years after its birth. But something happened later that caused an internal split within the Universe Race into the Universe and Cosmos Races.</p><p></p><p>The Universe and Cosmos Races each inherited part of the original Universe Race's profound heritage. Although not as powerful as the former Universe Race, they were still absolutely unfathomable existences among the twelve peak forces.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Cosmos and Universe clans held a transcendent position. </p><p></p><p>Even human civilizations were reluctant to offend these two paramount clans, as who knew if they would eventually merge and restore the glory of the Cosmos clan.</p><p></p><p>"You also need to watch out for the Catastrophe clan. This clan is even more mysterious than the Special Lifeforms," the Xia Qinzhi Supreme said gravely. Even when mentioning the Cosmos and Universe clans, his tone had not been as solemn as now.</p><p></p><p>If the Cosmos and Universe clans originated from the beginning of the universe, then the Catastrophe clan seemed to come from the previous universal epoch. </p><p></p><p>When a universal epoch ended, the universe would collapse and be destroyed, with the river of time running dry. Only the most powerful beings could survive and enter the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>But the Catastrophe clan was an exception. For some reason, this clan managed to avoid the ultimate collapse and destruction of the previous universal epoch, successfully entering this new one.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Catastrophe clan was targeted with hostility by the primordial laws and rules of the universal starry realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason this clan was called the "Catastrophe" clan was because from birth, its members had to face countless catastrophes invisibly descended from the primordial laws and rules of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Among the twelve paramount clans, the Catastrophe clan had the smallest number of members, far fewer than even the Special Lifeforms in the Stellar Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, any Catastrophe clansman who managed to survive was undoubtedly immensely powerful. To live through the hostility of the primordial universal laws and rules, and still grow in strength - just how terrifying was that?</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Catastrophe clan only had two members at the twelfth level of ultimate power, the least among the twelve paramount clans. Yet no other power dared provoke them.</p><p></p><p>"The Catastrophe clan..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.  </p><p></p><p>Surviving from the previous universal epoch to this one? </p><p></p><p>Even for a twelfth-level ultimate, that was impossible.</p><p></p><p>When the universe collapsed and was destroyed, even the most powerful beings could barely flee towards the primordial chaos, let alone remain within the universe facing endless annihilation.</p><p></p><p>As far as Lin Yuan knew, the only existence capable of crossing universal epochs was the Profound Yellow Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>The Profound Yellow Secret Realm was fully integrated with the primordial universe, so the universe's collapse did not affect this realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Profound Yellow Secret Realm was created by His Majesty the Profound Emperor, a Chaos Realm expert. Moreover, the Profound Yellow Beasts within could not enter the universal starry realm, yet the Catastrophe clan could wander there?</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>After several days, towering auras gradually appeared outside the massive battlefield - the twelfth-level ultimates of other paramount clans had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to enter the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi Supreme looked at the many eleventh-level experts. "You all understand the rules within the battlefield, right?"</p><p></p><p>He had explained in detail the rules of the massive battlefield before they arrived here.</p><p></p><p>Any eleventh-level expert entering would descend in the outlying areas of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>There were three hundred and thirty-three such outlying areas. In each area was a path of space-time; entering this path would lead to the core area of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>However, outside this space-time path was a space-time labyrinth that had to be passed through to reach the path.</p><p></p><p>Each area's space-time path had a limited capacity - it would close once a hundred eleventh-level experts had entered.</p><p></p><p>In other words, to access the space-time path to the core battlefield area, one had to compete with others in the same outlying area.</p><p></p><p>Only the first hundred could proceed to the core area.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the eleventh-level experts descending into the outlying areas would be randomly distributed, involving an element of luck.</p><p></p><p>If some experts in an area came from the same clan or alliance and worked together, they could secure entry into the space-time path.</p><p></p><p>Or if an area had multiple eleventh-level perfects wielding supreme weapons, the quota for the space-time path would be directly secured by them.</p><p></p><p>The remaining eleventh-level experts wishing to enter would then face even more intense competition.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the paramount powers, the true battle of the massive battlefield took place in the core area. The outlying areas were just an appetizer before the real fight.</p><p></p><p>"There are three hundred and thirty-three outlying areas. In the area where the Galactic Sovereign is, all eleventh-level human experts will follow the Galactic Sovereign's command."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qinzhi Supreme repeated this point again.</p><p></p><p>"All eleventh-level human experts?"</p><p></p><p>Some experts from other races noticed the prefix Xia Qinzhi used.</p><p></p><p>Was it just the eleventh-levels of the human civilizations' alliance, not Xia You's Evolution Spire?</p>

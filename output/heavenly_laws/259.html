            <p>Chapter 259 All is Nourishment (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that the cosmic power coveted by countless Eighth Stage powerhouses in the main world was actually grasped by me in its rudimentary form when I was at the Third and Fourth Stages?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but sigh in his heart. The so-called cosmic power, for the improvement of Eighth Stage powerhouses, was not just in terms of combat strength.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if one could step into the Ninth Stage or even higher, the transformation of cosmic power would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>For Eighth Stage evolved beings, whether they could successfully comprehend cosmic power or not, it would definitely take a long time, possibly tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But the cosmic power comprehended at the Eighth Stage level, apart from the improvement in combat strength, was of little help in breaking through to the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still a large number of powerful figures from various races in the main world who wanted to take the path of invincibility at the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>This seemed quite incredible, after all, if this time was spent on fusing with the rules, there might be a greater possibility of stepping into the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those who could comprehend cosmic power at the Eighth Stage, if they could break through to the Ninth Stage in the future, would go further on the Ninth Stage path.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, among the Eighth Stage powerhouses, those who could comprehend cosmic power were really too few.</p><p></p><p>And even among the Eighth Stage who comprehended cosmic power, the number who finally entered the Ninth Stage was even rarer.</p><p></p><p>Among hundreds of thousands of Eighth Stage powerhouses, if one who comprehended cosmic power at the Eighth Stage could finally step into the Ninth Stage, it would be considered extremely lucky.</p><p></p><p>"My Taiji power..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully comprehended his own cosmic power. The transformed Taiji power no longer had the distinction between Yin and Yang. It seemed to be innate, perfect and flawless.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that cosmic power cannot be replicated. My Taiji power..." Lin Yuan pondered in his heart, and finally shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This sentence was basically correct.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Taiji power was formed by the fusion of Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>Even if in the future, there appeared a martial arts cultivator with supreme talent in Yin and Yang, just like Lin Yuan, simultaneously mastering Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>But whether Yin and Yang could be fused was still uncertain. Even if Yin and Yang were really fused, the power formed in the end would most likely not be Taiji power.</p><p></p><p>The proportion of Yin and Yang in Lin Yuan's Taiji power was not consistent, but adjusted according to his own adaptability.</p><p></p><p>Only then was the new Taiji power born.</p><p></p><p>Even if future martial arts cultivators fused Yin and Yang, the power formed would no longer be Lin Yuan's Taiji power.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, if I erupt with full force, I should be able to easily suppress other invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses. But if we're talking about defeating or even killing them..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a while and felt it was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the Taiji power, Lin Yuan had a deeper understanding of such cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan used all his trump cards, at most he could only suppress, it would be difficult to force the other party to flee.</p><p></p><p>Take Lin Yuan's Taiji power as an example. Once fully defended, it was nearly invulnerable. Even ten invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses might not necessarily be able to break through the defense.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Eighth Stage powerhouses who comprehended a certain cosmic power in the main world were called "Invincible".</p><p></p><p>This was the myth of the invincible Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged. In the main world, those invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses who comprehended cosmic power basically would not continue to delve into cosmic power, but would focus all their energy on fusing with the rules.</p><p></p><p>Originally, comprehending cosmic power had already consumed a lot of time. If they continued to waste time, the hope of breaking through to the Ninth Stage would be even more remote.</p><p></p><p>Without breaking through to the Ninth Stage, even if they were invincible at the Eighth Stage, their lifespan would not be longer than those at the peak of the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yang Primordial Spirit and Yin Primordial Spirit appeared at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Then they began to fuse together.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The perfect and flawless Taiji Primordial Spirit appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous Taiji Primordial Spirit, at this moment, this Taiji Primordial Spirit was purer and had a more stable influence on space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even vaguely felt that even time was subtly affected.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In Xiaoyao City, even if Lin Yuan had mastered the cosmic power of Taiji, he would not try anything, for fear that he might accidentally shatter the entire Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>But naturally, there was no such worry in this Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens were vast and endless. The size of each heaven was comparable to the Spirit Realm. The Spirit Realm here did not refer to the three thousand Daozhu, but the entire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the environment, only True Immortal level powerhouses had the hope of ascending to the Nine Heavens, and that was only the First Heaven and Second Heaven. In the vast Nine Heavens, unless they agreed to meet, it was difficult to encounter others.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan could act recklessly here.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power began to spread wildly in all directions. The fully erupted Taiji power, like a prehistoric behemoth, wantonly stirred up everything in the Fourth Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Refreshing, refreshing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan laughed loudly. At this moment, he finally understood the confidence of those invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Such power that transcended the Eighth Stage was easy to indulge in.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of my current Taiji Primordial Spirit is not inferior to the invincible Eighth Stage at all, and due to the energy spirit body, it is much more troublesome than ordinary invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Spirit was not a physical body and could not rely on the mysterious gourd to enhance the inner world, but the Primordial Spirit also had the advantage of being immune to most physical damage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Primordial Spirit was an illusory body, gathering and dispersing unpredictably, mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, those invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses among the energy lifeforms were even more daunting than ordinary invincible Eighth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to see the true upper limit of Taiji power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan acted recklessly, and the terrifying power ripples began to reverberate throughout the entire Fourth Heaven, even beginning to affect the Third Heaven and Second Heaven below.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Second Heaven.</p><p></p><p>A True Immortal at the peak of the Convergence Dao stage was taking his valued junior on a tour of this heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens of the Spirit Realm were very special. True Immortal level powerhouses often came up, occasionally bringing their descendants and juniors. For lifeforms below the True Immortal level, being able to experience the profundity of the Nine Heavens was a great opportunity and fortune.</p><p></p><p>"In the Second Heaven, some 'wonders' and 'anomalies' often appear. Tomorrow, you should carefully observe and remember them in your heart. They will be of great use for your future cultivation journey."</p><p></p><p>This True Immortal at the peak of the Convergence Dao stage was an old man with white eyebrows. He stroked his beard and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Old Ancestor." The young man beside him swallowed and tried his best to look around, attempting to remember everything he saw.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor, this Nine Heavens is really too big, isn't it?" The young man couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Heavens of our Spirit Realm are vast and boundless. This is only the Second Heaven. Above there are still the Third Heaven, Fourth Heaven..." The True Immortal at the peak of the Convergence Dao stage patiently explained.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"However, only those at the half-step Tribulation Transcendence stage can attempt to climb to the Third Heaven. As for the Fourth Heaven, that is the realm of Tribulation Transcendence Immortal Kings," the white-browed elder sighed. Although he had already reached the peak of the Dao Convergence stage, the distance to the Tribulation Transcendence stage was still far beyond reach.</p><p></p><p>Just the Heart Demon Tribulation and the Physical Body Tribulation were two great chasms, blocking countless true immortals.</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder was feeling emotional for a while, and just as he was about to continue speaking, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder raised his head and looked up. It was the region of the Third Heaven. At this moment, a terrifying fluctuation was being transmitted from the Third Heaven to the Second Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Like the drumming of gods, the vast Second Heaven's sea of clouds dispersed, and the space continuously rippled.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder's face was shocked. In the Nine Heavens, even if a peak true immortal like him were to make a full-strength move, the affected range would be at most ten thousand miles. But now? Just the remnant power alone actually penetrated through to the Second Heaven?</p><p></p><p>The remnant power from the higher heavens swept down like the might of gods.</p><p></p><p>"It's not from the Third Heaven, but from a heaven higher than the Third Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder carefully sensed for a while, his face turning slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>As a peak true immortal, although he could not climb to the Third Heaven, he still had the ability to judge the source of the remnant power.</p><p></p><p>"A heaven higher than the Third Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>The youth was stunned for a moment. Wouldn't that be...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal King, at least a Tribulation Transcendence Immortal King is making a move."</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder said with difficulty. He still had a guess in his heart. Ordinary Immortal Kings would not be able to extend the remnant power to other heavens.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the legendary Supreme Immortal King!!</p><p></p><p>"In my life, I actually witnessed a Supreme Immortal King making a move?"</p><p></p><p>The white-browed elder's heart was excited. For a peak true immortal like him, in his long years of traveling through the three thousand Dao Realms, there was hope of seeing a Tribulation Transcendence Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>But a Supreme Immortal King? That was the supreme powerhouse among Tribulation Transcendence Immortal Kings. The vast majority of true immortals would never see a Supreme Immortal King in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Xuanwang Realm.</p><p>Dao De Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Li sent me a message?" A plain-looking and capable woman's expression changed slightly as she looked at the two peers beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Li?"</p><p>"With Patriarch Li's personality, if there's nothing major, he wouldn't bother contacting us."</p><p>"Quickly take a look. Could it be that something unexpected happened in the war with the Huailong Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The two peers realized the seriousness of the matter.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were the most outstanding among the descendants of "Jun Xiaoyao" back then.</p><p></p><p>They were Jun Haiqiu, Jun Nangong, and Jun Yunxun.</p><p></p><p>In the Ling Realm's Dao De Immortal Sect, the Mu family could be considered a relatively powerful lineage. But before Jun Dongjin and the others ascended, there was no Jun family.</p><p></p><p>After hundreds of thousands of years, with the efforts of the Jun family's generations of descendants and the support of Patriarch Li Qing, the Jun family finally established a foothold in the immortal sect.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a look now."</p><p></p><p>After quickly browsing through it...</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Li said..." Jun Haiqiu was stunned for a moment, not knowing how to say it.</p><p></p><p>"You guys take a look."</p><p></p><p>Jun Haiqiu displayed the message.</p><p></p><p>Jun Nangong and Jun Yunxun quickly finished reading.</p><p></p><p>"An old ancestor of our Jun family has returned?"</p><p>"This old ancestor is the youngest son of the Dongjin Progenitor and the Progenitor of the Martial Dao who developed the martial arts cultivation system?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Haiqiu and the other two were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Since childhood, they had heard many legends about this "Wuji" Old Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this "Wuji" Old Ancestor had unparalleled talent and even negotiated with Immortal Cangqing. The current status of the Jun family in the immortal sect was basically fought for by that Old Ancestor Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Without Old Ancestor Wuji, the Jun family definitely would not have today's achievements. Back in the lower realm, they might not have even been able to ascend.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor Wuji has returned?"</p><p></p><p>Jun Nangong's face was somewhat excited. For hundreds of thousands of years, the Jun family's generations of ancestors had never given up searching for Old Ancestor Wuji.</p><p></p><p>Even the Dao De Immortal Sect was searching, but there had never been any news.</p><p></p><p>Many Jun family ancestors even thought that Old Ancestor Wuji might have died long ago. Otherwise, how could there be no news for so many years?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p>"We'll go see Old Ancestor Wuji now."</p><p>"The desire of my father, my mother, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, and the generations of ancestors of my Jun family has actually been fulfilled in our generation."</p><p></p><p>Jun Yunxun was equally excited. Patriarch Li Qing's search for Old Ancestor Wuji was to find his own master. Immortal Cangqing's search for Old Ancestor Wuji also had other purposes.</p><p></p><p>Only their Jun family's search for Old Ancestor Wuji was completely from the heart. From the Progenitor Jun Dongjin, it had been the ultimate goal for generations.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Temple has begun large-scale recruitment of disciples?"</p><p>"As long as they are from the human race, they can join the Martial Temple?"</p><p>"After joining the Martial Temple, they can obtain the martial arts cultivation techniques? Even immortal cultivation practitioners can join the Martial Temple?"</p><p></p><p>In Xiaoyao City, a piece of news spread like a hurricane. In the past, the Martial Temple was very strict in accepting disciples, but now, this restriction had been lifted.</p><p></p><p>"There are free martial arts cultivation techniques being given out."</p><p>"It is said that the seventh stage of martial arts is not inferior to Dao Convergence true immortals. The martial arts cultivation system must have extraordinary aspects."</p><p></p><p>One figure after another quickly lined up outside the Martial Temple, discussing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you think the Martial Temple is doing this?"</p><p>"Not long ago, the three old ancestors of the Martial Temple returned? Could it be their idea?"</p><p>"I don't think so. In the past, for such a long time, even with the three old ancestors present, the rules of the Martial Temple basically didn't change. Now suddenly opening up, something we don't know about must have happened."</p><p>"Who cares? Anyway, martial arts cultivation techniques are being given out, so there's no loss for me."</p><p></p><p>Martial Temple Grand Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in the main seat, his gaze sweeping across the entire Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>"Master, opening up the martial arts cultivation techniques like this, is it..." Patriarch Li Qing respectfully stood to the side, cautiously asking.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly spread the evolved martial arts cultivation system in this realm, relying on just the Martial Temple's small territory would take millions of years.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan decided to open up the martial arts cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these opened-up Martial Temple techniques had all been modified by Lin Yuan and could increase one's strength in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>For low-level cultivators, whether it was the immortal dao, martial dao, or other cultivation systems...</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was short-term effectiveness. Even if it was the supreme great dao, if one couldn't enter the door and it didn't provide any improvement, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>As for opening up the martial arts cultivation techniques like this, leading to the martial arts cultivators being a mix of good and bad in the future, and even having no loyalty to the Martial Temple...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>Myriad realms, as long as they entered my martial dao, regardless of their thoughts, they were all nourishment for the future "Ultimate Leap".</p>

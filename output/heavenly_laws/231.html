He looked towards that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm-Breaking Source Power has now accumulated to 7 strands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan checked the amount of Realm-Breaking Source Power. With the blessing of the Yin Spirit constantly at the side of that permanent spatial rift in the alien battlefield, it only takes 290 days to accumulate one strand of Realm-Breaking Source Power.</p><p></p><p>"Spending one strand of Realm-Breaking Source Power for peace of mind is not a loss."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The main goal of this traversal was to pass the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>As for continuing to cultivate? Comprehending laws? Perfecting the martial dao evolution path? Push all that back.</p><p></p><p>"Traverse."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly consumed one strand of Realm-Breaking Source Power, and his will surged into the Gate of Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"This old man, added together there's not much meat on him."</p><p></p><p>"Having some is better than none, at least we can boil some soup."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, that's how it is. But that girl I saw today, she looked so pretty and delicate."</p><p></p><p>"Pretty and delicate, so what? In times like these, no matter how pretty, it's not as good as a pound of grain."</p><p></p><p>His consciousness had just awakened not long ago and hadn't fully adapted yet, so he could only quietly listen to the conversation outside.</p><p></p><p>After a dozen breaths or so, Lin Yuan's consciousness finally stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Great Yan Empire? End of the dynasty, warlords fighting? People can barely survive?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly accepted the original body's memories and understood his own situation.</p><p></p><p>The level of this world is not very high. At least in the original body's memories, even those rare powerhouses who could fight a hundred were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yan Empire has ruled the world for nearly 500 years, and is now completely corrupt. With various "righteous armies" rising up in rebellion, the entire empire is already on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>The reason it has come to this is because the common people simply can't survive. Continuous disasters, coupled with increasingly heavy taxes imposed by the court year after year.</p><p></p><p>It has now reached the point of cannibalism. </p><p></p><p>Just like Lin Yuan now, being treated as food, and even complained about for having little meat.</p><p></p><p>"My current body..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed his body and frowned slightly. First was the age - the original body was already in his 60s, with severely degraded bodily functions. Plus being in a prolonged state of starvation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even standing up was a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a while. In the memories, the original body was a small landlord, but with the world in chaos and warlords attacking, he was forced to relocate with his family servants.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after escaping, he encountered a group of refugees. All his possessions were robbed, and he barely escaped, soon ending up here.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rested for a moment. Relying on his powerful mental willpower, he mobilized his qi and blood circulation, and managed to recover a little.</p><p></p><p>"This world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. From the moment his consciousness awakened until now, he hadn't felt the slightest bit of world spiritual qi or primal qi.</p><p></p><p>"The era of decline?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan judged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time:</p><p></p><p>[Name: Chen Jun (Lin Yuan)]</p><p></p><p>[Identity: Wielder of the Gate of Myriad Worlds] </p><p></p><p>[Divine Ability: Rebirth from a Drop of Blood]</p><p></p><p>[Current State: Consciousness Descended]</p><p></p><p>[Remaining Stay Time: 30 years]</p><p></p><p>"Only 30 years of stay time?"</p><p></p><p>"So the duration of stay in the traversed world depends on the world's level, not one's own realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>In the previous six traversals, Lin Yuan's stay time got longer each time, making him think that the stay time in the traversed world was related to his own realm.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the longer the stay.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems it should depend on the level of the traversed world.</p><p></p><p>After all, the current world seems to be only a low-level martial world or even a non-martial world, probably even weaker than the world Lin Yuan traversed to the first time, so there's only a 30-year stay.</p><p></p><p>"The traversal performed by consuming one strand of Realm-Breaking Source Power is completely random. The previous six times, I was lucky, so each traversed world was helpful to me. But this time, I don't have the same luck as before."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>However, the level of this traversed world doesn't really impact Lin Yuan's main goal.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the weaker the traversed world, the happier Lin Yuan is. Because according to the analysis of those evolutionary scholars of human civilization:</p><p></p><p>The Heart Demons of the Heart Demon Tribulation come from the outside, condensed from the negative emotions of countless living beings.</p><p></p><p>Then the Heart Demons condensed from the negative emotions of the countless beings in the main world,</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Heart Demons condensed from the beings in this low-level martial world, they must be worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>Completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan undergoing the Heart Demon Tribulation here is equivalent to lowering the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Facing the Heart Demon Tribulation has nothing to do with the physical body and soul. The Heart Demon doesn't target the physical body and soul, but the mental willpower."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the realm is reached, the Heart Demon can be attracted to descend at any time."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for the physical body and soul to simultaneously reach the 7th stage limit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought.</p><p></p><p>Stepping into the 8th stage requires the physical body and soul to reach the ultimate perfection.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan at this moment could already attract the Heart Demon to descend.</p><p></p><p>"Although the stay this time is not long, it's still 30 years. There's no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his eyes around. Most importantly, his current situation is not very good. He can't have his physical body disturbed by others while he's in the middle of the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey old man, what are you standing up for?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you're trying to escape? Where can you escape to?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was adjusting his qi and blood, and getting up to move around, two burly men not far away also looked over. Butcher knives hung all around them as they sized up Lin Yuan with ill intent.</p><p></p><p>As if looking at a pig or sheep about to be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>"Scram."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the two men.</p><p></p><p>He didn't use any-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>What power, in fact, could not be used, Lin Yuan now just regained consciousness, and the only means he could use were those of the mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Those two strong men were glanced at by Lin Yuan, only to feel that heaven and earth had collapsed, their minds seemed to have been crushed dozens of times, directly causing their will to collapse, and their whole bodies fell to the ground, twitching incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The physical body was still alive.</p><p></p><p>But the mind and will had collapsed.</p><p></p><p>This is the advantage of a strong mind and will, with just a glance, it can completely crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these two strong men were also too weak. If they were sixth or seventh stage evolved beings, even if their mind and will were far inferior to Lin Yuan's, they would not be so weak by relying on their physical body and soul to guard.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out with a swagger.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, there were people who wanted to stop him, but they all collapsed under Lin Yuan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength of mind and will, even if surrounded by millions of troops, he could still walk out at a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>This was still a fragile physical body, greatly limiting Lin Yuan's mind and will.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In these ten years, Lin Yuan did not choose to immediately cross the heart demon tribulation, but traveled all over the world, observing the living beings in the posture of a bystander.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yan Dynasty had been broken through by rebel armies in the fourth year of Lin Yuan's descent, and the imperial capital was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the world situation was in chaos, with various warlords taking turns on stage.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a newly emerging warlord waving the "Great Chu" banner, campaigned from the south to the north, and after six years, ended the chaos and established the Great Chu Empire.</p><p></p><p>In a sunny valley.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a noble temperament stood outside respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>If there were outsiders present, they would find that this middle-aged man was surprisingly the founding emperor of the Great Chu Empire, the most respected person in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, now, this founding emperor stood outside the valley with great respect, not daring to have any overstepping.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a boy walked out of the valley.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Master, is the Immortal Master willing to see me?" the middle-aged man asked in a low voice upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>"You go."</p><p></p><p>"The old master said that there is not much great favor between you and him, no need to care." The boy said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Not much favor..."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man looked lost. Back then, if it weren't for the Immortal Master's help, he would have died at the hands of the rebel army long ago, how could he have established such a foundation?</p><p></p><p>Although he only followed the Immortal Master for a few years, the middle-aged man deeply realized that the Immortal Master was a true immortal, and all mundane things were not in the Immortal Master's eyes at all.</p><p></p><p>Even he, the founding emperor of the Great Chu Empire, was just casually cultivated by the Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man took a deep breath and said in a low voice, "Tell the Immortal Master that I will let the Great Chu offer sacrifices to the Immortal Master's tablet day and night."</p><p></p><p>Inside the valley.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the departing middle-aged man, without much concern.</p><p></p><p>He was not of this world, and all his actions were done as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yan was destroyed, the world was in chaos, Lin Yuan got tired of watching, so he cultivated a founding emperor to stabilize the world, making it look a bit more pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>That's all.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that in these ten years, he had traveled the world, pondering, and his mind and will had been enhanced here.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that here, I can't feel the 'Demon Jade Space'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>As early as the moment when Lin Yuan's consciousness descended, his memory synchronized, and he comprehended the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three ways of evolution, naturally condensing the 'Demon Jade Imprint'.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, at the moment of condensing the Demon Jade Imprint, Lin Yuan was able to sense that vast and mysterious Demon Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>But here, he got nothing.</p><p></p><p>From this point, it can be inferred that even the owner of the Demon Jade Tower is far inferior to the Gate of Myriad Realms. At least the casual shuttling of the Gate of Myriad Realms exceeds the sensory limit of the owner of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another fifteen years passed.</p><p></p><p>In these fifteen years, the Great Chu Empire ushered in a period of prosperity, with a large increase in population, and the founding emperor of the Great Chu was even more praised by the people.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, the founding emperor of the Great Chu directly stated that everything he did now came from the guidance of the Immortal Master.</p><p></p><p>Without the Immortal Master, there would be no him, and no Great Chu Empire today.</p><p></p><p>The entire empire, the whole country, was worshipping the Immortal Master's tablet day and night.</p><p></p><p>On a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this world is too weak, and there is no need to even spread the martial arts evolution path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the suppression of this world that was almost like the Dharma-ending era, even if Lin Yuan spread the martial arts evolution path to the outside world, the martial arts cultivators of later generations would at most only cultivate to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to not entering any stage.</p><p></p><p>It was fundamentally impossible to involve the core essence of the martial arts evolution path.</p><p></p><p>It was also difficult to provide any 'benefit' to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan did not give up on this world either.</p><p></p><p>In these twenty-five years, he traveled around, replicating the martial arts evolution path on some special metals and spreading it all over the world.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if this world is released from suppression and the Dharma-ending era ends, the martial arts evolution path is bound to rise first.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still five years left in his stay.</p><p></p><p>But the past twenty-five years had already allowed Lin Yuan's tempering in mind and will to reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>Dragging it out further was not very meaningful.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Lin Yuan began to actively attract the heart demons.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation descended.</p><p></p><p>In a daze.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>He found himself in a room.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>Mother Lu Qiong walked in, "Xiaoyuan, I have asked your uncle, he said he can take your name off the compulsory conscription list."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong said with great joy.</p><p></p><p>"Compulsory... conscription list?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked a little stunned, and vaguely, he seemed to feel that there was something wrong with this sentence.</p><p></p><p>Who dared to conscript him?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your uncle also said that he found a job for you in the government. Tomorrow you go find your uncle and he will arrange everything."</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyuan, your uncle is the benefactor of our family, you must be polite when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong kept reminding him beside.</p><p></p><p>"When Xiaoyuan's job is stable, it will be time to find a girlfriend. At that time, when you get married and have children early, your dad and I can also help take care of them. Those robots don't know how to take care of children at all, it's better to let us do it..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong began to think about the future.</p><p></p><p>"Get married?"</p><p></p><p>"Have children?"</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's eyes, starry vortexes faintly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"My journey is the vast starry sea, how could I be trapped on an ordinary planet?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched lazily, stood up and laughed loudly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 564</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sheng Nü remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He was already very irritable, with a bad temper, and had never even thought about taking action against the Black Sky Black Earth in this situation.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, in this kind of battle in the Void Sea, the Celestial Realm would avoid it if possible.</p><p></p><p>There had been hardly any initiative to take action.</p><p></p><p>"If the Realm Lord can act on their own initiative while ensuring their own safety, they may do so freely," Yuán said calmly in the end.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also added, "Realm Lord, be very careful, the Void Sea is complex, and the slightest carelessness will lead to your demise."</p><p></p><p>This irritable big-bearded man had also started to advise Qi Yuán to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, okay, I'll go take a look at this so-called Black Sky Black Earth army."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán did not speak further, and walked alone in the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Sea, it was a chaotic scene, with various colorful specks of light everywhere.</p><p></p><p>These specks of light seemed to be fragments of broken rules, or the primordial matter before the opening of chaos, full of danger.</p><p></p><p>They could even corrode the body of a Solar Deity.</p><p></p><p>Half a day passed quickly, and Qi Yuán's figure came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>The seven Enlightened Ones emitted a terrifying aura, like a scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán looked ahead and saw a huge battleship traversing the cold Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>That battleship was enormous! Even larger than the Qingshan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Sky Black Earth truly lives up to its name, such a massive battleship... If it were to fall from the sky, wouldn't it crush a hundred thousand ants?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán murmured.</p><p></p><p>Holding the seven Enlightened Ones, the surrounding Void Sea environment changed, and he seemed like the moon surrounded by stars.</p><p></p><p>The scorching light, contrasting with him, made him appear like a war god.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord, just confront them, blocking the battleship's advance will suffice!" Yuán reminded.</p><p></p><p>The irritable big-bearded man also hurriedly said, "Realm Lord, you must remain calm."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán looked at the ominous battleship, his gaze profound: "I want to confront them, but they have to agree to it first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuán's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... there is an unexpected situation?</p><p></p><p>The other Ancestral Deities' thoughts were also rapidly turning, seemingly realizing something.</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuán's voice fell.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a towering figure flew out from the battleship.</p><p></p><p>Eternal burning flames, crackled and popped, and the colorful specks of light in the Void Sea were all blown away.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying flame giant roared, "Qi Yuán, die!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord furiously attacked.</p><p></p><p>This kind of supremely powerful being's attack was overbearing and unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the surrounding space turned into a domain of flames.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Realm Lord realm, one could already influence the environment and rules of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the Flame Realm Lord were to sneeze, it could turn a cultivation realm the size of the Qinglan Realm into a Flame Realm, with the great fire lasting for billions of years without extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>This was just a casual sneeze, and if he were to attack, the might of his flames would be able to consume everything.</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of scorching heat assailed him, and even with Qi Yuán's strength, he could feel the intense heat.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Flames, capable of burning through heaven and earth, Qi Yuán... where will you run, just let my flames consume you!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord let out a thunderous roar, and flames filled the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Absolute Adaptation!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Qi Yuán unleashed the rules he had mastered.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he transformed into a being of fire.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, I'm indeed being burned, and have become a being of fire," Qi Yuán said casually.</p><p></p><p>He did not use the Enlightened Ones, but only Absolute Adaptation, fighting fire with fire.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord was stunned, his expression furious: "Die!"</p><p></p><p>The flames grew even more intense, their power ten or even a hundredfold stronger than before! Qi Yuán's rule was something the Flame Realm Lord had seen similar versions of before.</p><p></p><p>However, most were crude imitations.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán shrugged, his gaze shifting: "You're a bit hard to kill, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>His eyes could see many things.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Realm Lord realm, they were not so easily killed.</p><p></p><p>Unless the power gap between them was too great.</p><p></p><p>Now that Qi Yuán had just advanced to the Myriad Realms Boundary, to kill the Flame Realm Lord of the Rule Realm, it would take at least a day.</p><p></p><p>This was far too slow for Qi Yuán.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're hard to kill as well," the Flame Realm Lord said seriously.</p><p></p><p>What he understood as "hard to kill" was different from Qi Yuán's understanding.</p><p></p><p>What he understood was that even standing at the edge of the universe, it would be difficult for him to defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>"But... even if you're hard to kill, I, the Sovereign, will kill you!" The flames in the Flame Realm Lord's eyes burned even more intensely, and a sinister expression appeared in his eyes, "I have the Ominous Source, I do not fear death, what do you have?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the Void Sea, Yuán, Sheng Nü, and the other Ancestral Deities' expressions suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, the Flame Realm Lord has gone mad, he's going to trade his life for yours!"</p><p></p><p>"How could this be? Is the one revived by the Ominous Source him? How could he be so unwise?"</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord, retreat quickly, do not engage in prolonged battle, stay away from the Flame Realm Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Yuán urgently warned.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Deities present were on edge.</p><p></p><p>Between Realm Lords, no one could truly harm the other, but if one side was willing to sacrifice themselves, consuming their own source rules in a self-destructive manner, then a single such act could severely injure an opponent of equal strength, and a second time... would surely result in mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Black Sky Black Earth had not used such methods, because no one knew whether the one revived by the Ominous Source was still themselves.</p><p></p><p>But the Flame Realm Lord did not care about that.</p><p></p><p>"Wuxkong, lend me the Ominous Source to block this person's retreat!" The Flame Realm Lord roared.</p><p></p><p>The Wuxkong Realm Lord's gaze was indifferent, and the Ominous Source flew into the Flame Realm Lord's hand. His towering figure just happened to block Qi Yuán's path.</p><p></p><p>"With me here, he won't be able to escape," the Wuxkong Realm Lord said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do?" Qi Yuán had a terrifying guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, don't you know?" The Flame Realm Lord's expression was cold.</p><p></p><p>"This is too unwise of you," Qi Yuán pretended to be alarmed.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was about to burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, Uncle Qihuang, or rather, the main body of Qihuang, just as foolish as Qihuang.</p><p></p><p>To actually self-destruct, not knowing... that I have a Blood Lock Hanging?</p><p></p><p>The more severe the injury, the more terrifying the Absolute Adaptation empowered by the Death Radiance.</p><p></p><p>"The seven Enlightened Ones can help you block my rule dissolution seven times, but what about after the seventh time?" </p><p></p><p>Rule dissolution, that is, the Realm Lord's self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lord's self-destruction was not an explosion of the body, but the dissolution of the rules.</p><p></p><p>The power released by the dissolution of the rules was no less than a great earthquake on the dimensional scale of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"To kill you, I specifically borrowed the Wuxkong Realm Lord's Ominous Source, enough to sustain my rule dissolution thirty times... how will you survive?"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord roared, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán's expression became serious: "No, don't!"</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to act more convincingly, saying something like "Is the one revived by the Ominous Source still you?" But he was afraid of being too harsh and scaring the Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>So he could only keep saying "No, don't!" Inwardly, he was thinking, "Just self-destruct already! After all, it would take me a day to kill you, but self-destruction only takes an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The Flame Realm Lord let out a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Endless flames of rule dissolution surged forth at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sea seemed to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Even the majestic battleship appeared to be shaken by this.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuán saw this and held the Enlightened Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Block it for me!"</p><p></p><p>In reality, all the rule dissolution was being blocked by his own body.</p><p></p><p>Death.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light and absolute adaptation, the least afraid of are those weaker than him self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if someone ten times stronger than him self-destructs, this blood probably can't be contained.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a massive amount of experience poured in.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan felt refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>This was even more refreshing than killing the Qihuang people for several years.</p><p></p><p>They are indeed family, equally stupid.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure of the Flame Realm Lord reappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was no different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>Even Qi Yuan's eyes could only discern a slight subtle difference between this person and the previous Flame Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord looked at the dimly lit Qi Yuan with a surprised expression and then said, "The Enlightened One is a bit stronger than I imagined. It seems the Anomalous Source in my possession is not enough."</p><p></p><p>He was not in a hurry at all.</p><p></p><p>There was plenty of Anomalous Source on the battleship.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he could borrow from other Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>He could just exhaust Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Come again!" The Flame Realm Lord roared loudly, shattering like a brilliant firework.</p><p></p><p>"Block for me!" Qi Yuan roared again, but in his heart, he really wanted to say to the Flame Realm Lord, "Don't say anything before you self-destruct? If you feel it's not cool, should I dub for you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Void Sea, the usually calm Yuan was also a bit unstable.</p><p></p><p>"The Enlightened One can only block about fifteen rule dissolutions, the remaining... the Realm Lord will be hard to block!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this Black Sky Black Earth has no sense of honor!"</p><p></p><p>"The Void Realm Lord has also blocked the Qi Yuan Lord's retreat path, the Realm Lord can't escape at all!"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's mood was very heavy.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, the determination of the Black Sky Black Earth was great, with the intention of completely slaying Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a woman's voice suddenly sounded in the void.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan... this matter can seek the help of the Radiant Dao Master, only the Radiant Dao Master can save Qi Yuan."</p><p></p><p>All the Ancestor Gods immediately looked into the void, and saw a woman who resembled Yuan to some extent standing in the void. She was dressed in a blood-red robe, looking charming and alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Yi!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor Gods present were moved. This person was the leader of the Radiant Association, "Yi", Yuan's sister.</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Association and the Enlightened Association have always been in opposition.</p><p></p><p>Although these people were surprised to see Yi appear, they were not terrified.</p><p></p><p>Yuan's expression kept changing.</p><p></p><p>As for the majestic existence of the Radiant Dao Master, Yuan could not fathom his mentality at all.</p><p></p><p>However, since they wanted to see him, they must have to give up something.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would the Radiant Dao Master lend a hand?</p><p></p><p>Now, the Flame Realm Lord was self-destructing, and the time left for him was not much.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hesitate any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Yuan agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, he also understood that this was just Yi's suggestion, and the Radiant Dao Master might not necessarily lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Light Void Symbol." Yi looked at Yuan and tossed him a symbol.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Yuan used the Light Void Symbol.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the environment around him changed.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, it was as if he had appeared in a world of dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>This world seemed to be entirely constructed of light, brilliant and beautiful, unlike the light of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"The leader of the Radiant Association, I request an audience with the Unilluminated Lord!" Yi said softly.</p><p></p><p>As her words fell, a child of six or seven years old walked over. His lips were red, his teeth were white, his hair was fine and dense, not black but pure white.</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord, the child servant of the Radiant Dao Master, was an Alaya Yang God.</p><p></p><p>He smiled gently, "I already know the purpose of your visit."</p><p></p><p>"Please, Unilluminated Lord..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop." The Unilluminated Realm Lord raised his short, chubby, white and tender finger, and the smile on his face did not fade, "I will not lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Yi's expression changed abruptly. She did not expect this result.</p><p></p><p>Yuan gritted his teeth and said, "The Divine Wood Universe is willing to pay a price that will satisfy the Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Unilluminated Realm Lord was bargaining.</p><p></p><p>Now time was running out, no matter how reluctant, he had to make sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, the Unilluminated Realm Lord shook his head, "It's not a matter of price."</p><p></p><p>Yuan and Yi were both slightly stunned, not understanding the meaning of the Unilluminated Realm Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>"You follow me and see." The Unilluminated Realm Lord waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the scene in front of the three of them changed.</p><p></p><p>"Look... the line that the Patriarch drew back then."</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord's chubby white finger pointed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yuan and Yi looked over, and their expressions froze, revealing horror and despair.</p><p></p><p>Even the usually calm Yuan now looked as pale as death.</p><p></p><p>"The line... is gone... how is this possible, didn't it have more than ten thousand years left?" Yi said loudly, her expression agitated.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the Patriarch had drawn a line.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch had once said that the line was slowly disappearing, and when the line completely disappeared, that would be the time when the Black Sky "awakened" and truly devoured the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Black Earth was nothing more than a parasite on the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>The Black Sky was the true terror, and even the Radiant Dao Master was unwilling to confront it directly.</p><p></p><p>According to the speed of the line's disappearance, the Divine Wood Universe should have had at least ten thousand years left.</p><p></p><p>But now... only a trace remained, which meant that the Black Sky could "awaken" at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, in the next breath.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle in the Void Sea was no longer important.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that the Black Sky was about to awaken... how would the Divine Wood Universe cope?</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" Yi murmured to herself, "The Patriarch is omniscient and omnipotent, how could the judgment be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>She was in despair.</p><p></p><p>In Yi's eyes, the Patriarch was an omniscient and omnipotent existence.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch could restart the universe with a word, and reverse the rules with a word.</p><p></p><p>But now, the line drawn by the Patriarch was not following the original trajectory, how could she not be shocked, only hoping that everything was false.</p><p></p><p>The Unilluminated Realm Lord shook his head, "The Patriarch's omniscience and omnipotence are limited to the Radiant Universe. As for the Black Sky... it is very special, and even the Patriarch can easily misjudge it."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuan's expression changed from numb to calm, and he looked at Yi and said seriously, "Please send me back to the Taistar Domain."</p><p></p><p>Now that the line drawn by the Patriarch had disappeared, he needed to tell the Enlightened Association about this.</p><p></p><p>The time left for them was not much, perhaps... less than a day.</p><p></p><p>Yuan also didn't expect that a normal confrontation would evolve into a great battle, and then evolve into an apocalypse.</p><p></p><p>"Here is the Light Void Symbol for you." Yi gritted her teeth and handed the symbol to Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you." Yuan thanked her and his figure dissipated at that moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his mood was very complicated.</p><p></p><p>The remaining time for the Divine Wood Universe was too short, only one day... how should they break the deadlock?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... I almost died, Flame Realm Lord, you are so powerful!" Qi Yuan said, with fresh blood spilling from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Realm Lord's face was solemn, and there was an angry expression in his eyes, "You're tricking me!"</p><p></p><p>He had self-destructed twenty-three times, but each time Qi Yuan seemed to be on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Although his rationality and the insight of a Realm Lord level told him that Qi Yuan was really about to die, he still felt that the other party was tricking him!</p><p></p><p>How could he half-dead block his several rule dissolutions?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

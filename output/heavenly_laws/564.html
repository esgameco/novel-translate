        <h1>Chapter 564</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared, gazing afar at that secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the extremely secretive secret realm of the Stone People Tribe, the Nine Profound Secret Realm could be considered 'flamboyant', with vast and majestic chaotic energy formations forming a series of deadly formations that shrouded the entire secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm of the Stone People Tribe was secretive for the sake of safety.</p><p></p><p>But the Nine Profound Secret Realm? With a Venerable guarding it, being in the chaotic void already meant safety, unless one encountered the power of a Great Saint, otherwise who could shake it? And Great Saints? How many were there in the entire chaotic void?"I can sense that there is a karmic connection with the Stone People Tribe in this secret realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself as he looked at the Nine Profound Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained the legacy of the peak Sovereign-level expert of the Stone People Tribe, 'Cang Weiyang', so it was only natural that he had a karmic connection with the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's karmic connection with 'Cang Weiyang' was the strongest, after all, it was a direct connection. As for the Stone People Tribe? They were the tribe that 'Cang Weiyang' belonged to, so Lin Yuan's karmic connection with them was already very tenuous.</p><p></p><p>But even if it was tenuous, it still existed, and with Lin Yuan's profound understanding of the Dao of Karma, he was still able to detect and directly lock onto it.</p><p></p><p>"Only one karmic connection with the Stone People Tribe?" Lin Yuan furrowed his brows. "The other Stone People Tribe members must have been imprisoned in the universe within the Nine Profound Venerable, so I can't sense them."</p><p></p><p>This karmic connection could be shielded, just like the Mysterious Yellow Secret Realm in his homeland, which could isolate the karmic space-time.</p><p></p><p>The universe within a Chaotic Venerable was almost equivalent to the true universe, and could also isolate the karma to a large extent.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the fact that Lin Yuan's karmic connection with the Stone People Tribe was tenuous, and with the isolation of the internal universe, it was only natural that he couldn't sense them.</p><p></p><p>"Is it there?" Lin Yuan looked towards a certain location in the Nine Profound Secret Realm, which was the only area where he could sense the karmic connection.</p><p></p><p>"I still have to go in and find out what's going on."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what grudge the Stone People Tribe had with the Nine Profound Venerable, so he had to understand it first.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved a Venerable, so if it could be peacefully resolved, it would be resolved peacefully. As for directly taking action? With his cultivation at the Chaotic Realm, unless it was a true life-and-death feud, he wouldn't casually take action.</p><p></p><p>"These formations and deadly formations?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the numerous formations and deadly formations outside the Nine Profound Secret Realm and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If it was a while ago, he might have been troubled by these formations and deadly formations, as they were meticulously arranged by the Nine Profound Venerable and could block even Venerables at the same level.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, Lin Yuan had obtained the Myriad Formation Crystal, and although he had eventually traded it away to the Great Venerable Red Leaf, he had already comprehended most of its essence beforehand.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Formation Crystal was the culmination of the heart and blood of a peak Great Venerable who was proficient in the Dao of Arrays. The essence of the formations contained within it was extremely exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Having comprehended the Myriad Formation Crystal, the numerous formations and deadly formations outside the Nine Profound Secret Realm became much simpler to him.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was careful and avoided a few key array nodes, he could infiltrate silently without any problems.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if something went wrong in the end, it wouldn't matter much to Lin Yuan, as this was just a clone, and he could disperse it at any time without leaving any traces.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's clone divided into two clones.</p><p></p><p>Considering the extreme situation, Lin Yuan had already prepared to disperse the clone and enter the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as the clone outside remained, there was no need to rush back here.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Secret Realm, the Abyss of Sins.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of Sins was a unique feature of the Nine Profound Secret Realm. Every natural secret realm nurtured by the chaotic void would have some 'specialty', and the Abyss of Sins was one such example.</p><p></p><p>The water of the Abyss of Sins was pitch-black and profound, containing endless sins. Any living being that approached it would be assaulted by the boundless sins within.</p><p></p><p>Just approaching it was like this.</p><p></p><p>Once in contact, even Dao Ancestors or Sovereign-level beings would suffer unbearable torment and agony.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the pitch-black and profound pool, a figure was soaked, its limbs and body bound by black chains.</p><p></p><p>The figure's expression revealed pain, but the pain in its soul was even greater than the physical torment.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, father, mother, elders, it's my fault that you were all captured by the Nine Profound and have to suffer this torment with me," Cang Yulong's soul was convulsing. "But I absolutely cannot bow my head. If I bow my head, not only will I die, but all of you will die as well, and not a single member of our tribe will survive."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Nine Profound doesn't know the source of that space, we have a chance to live. I will endure and hold on, as long as the Nine Profound wants to know the information about that space, I won't die, and neither will you. If I tell them, we will all die."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong was in immense pain, but his thoughts were very clear.</p><p></p><p>Although the Nine Profound had made him a promise that he would be spared if he told the truth, how could Cang Yulong believe that? Even as he constantly endured the invasion of endless sins.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice resounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I'm curious why the Nine Profound Venerable would single you out and torture you in this manner."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure silently appeared in the distance, observing Cang Yulong with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>He could see the effect of the Abyss of Sins at a glance, which was why he was so curious about what kind of enmity could make the Nine Profound Venerable treat him this way.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Cang Yulong was startled in his heart, and the pain he was enduring also decreased slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I have a connection with your Stone People Tribe, so I came to take a look," Lin Yuan did not mention Cang Weiyang, but used 'connection' instead.</p><p></p><p>"Connection?" Cang Yulong looked at Lin Yuan and immediately bowed his head without hesitation. "Please, senior, save my Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>This was the Nine Profound Secret Realm, the lair of the Nine Profound Venerable. For Lin Yuan to be able to infiltrate silently, he was at least not far from the Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Lin Yuan was one of the Nine Profound Venerable's people or not, Cang Yulong had the means to judge, and he determined that he had no connection with the Nine Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Save your Stone People Tribe?" Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong. "Why should I risk becoming the Nine Profound Venerable's mortal enemy to save your Stone People Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing Cang Yulong's predicament, Lin Yuan had basically judged that the latter and the Nine Profound Venerable were already in a life-and-death feud. If it wasn't such extreme enmity, a Venerable wouldn't use such methods against a mere Dao Ancestor-level being.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The legacy left by Cang Weiyang had smoothly helped Lin Yuan transition to the Chaotic Realm, but Cang Weiyang's request at the time was to take a Stone People Tribe disciple.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was a Stone People Tribe member, it would do.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could see that the current plight of the Stone People Tribe was probably due to the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He could have normally negotiated with the Nine Profound Venerable to take one Stone People Tribe member as a disciple from the billions of them, and the Venerable would have likely agreed.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>That's right.</p><p></p><p>No matter how great the connection, compared to being the mortal enemy of a Venerable, it was nothing. "Senior, I am willing to offer a reward, please save my Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong calmed himself and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Reward?" Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong, waiting for him to mention what reward.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong took a deep breath and said gravely, "The Chaotic Tree, I am willing to give the Chaotic Tree to you, just please save my Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Tree?" Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tree was a rare and precious item of the Twelfth Rank.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining a World Tree in the Demon Jade Space, and his inner world transforming into an inner universe as he advanced to the Twelfth Rank, Lin Yuan had felt the potential for the World Tree to evolve into a Chaotic Tree.</p><p></p><p>In theory, any being nurtured by the Chaotic Void had the potential to become a Chaotic Saint.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, Lin Yuan increasingly felt how difficult it was for a World Tree to evolve into a Chaotic Tree, akin to a Eleventh Rank being growing into a Chaotic Saint.</p><p></p><p>The literal difficulty was already comparable, let alone the actual difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"You have a Chaotic Tree?" Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong, understanding dawning on him.</p><p></p><p>He had been wondering why the Nine Profound Venerable, a Chaotic Realm expert, would treat a Dao Ancestor-level being in such a manner.</p><p></p><p>It was because of the Chaotic Tree.</p><p></p><p>Any Chaotic Venerable would have an intense desire for the Chaotic Tree, as its ability to stabilize the inner universe could allow a Chaotic Venerable to rapidly cultivate to the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you give the Chaotic Tree to the Nine Profound Venerable?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"That Chaotic Tree was something I snatched from right under the Nine Profound's nose. If I gave it to him, I would have a hard time surviving," Cang Yulong said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Chaos Tree, there is also an inheritance space. As long as the senior is willing to lend a hand, I will hand over everything at that time."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he already knew the reason for the crime of holding the precious jade.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for handing over the item to the Ninth Profound Venerable, the possibility of surviving would have been almost non-existent, and he would have handed it over long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Tree?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, the Chaos Tree was also of great use to him. Combined with the 13th-tier inheritance "Infinite Void", it could also greatly enhance the universe within his body.</p><p></p><p>On the second layer of the "Infinite Void", if the Chaos Tree could suppress the universe within his body, the difficulty of cultivation would also be reduced.</p><p></p><p>"For the sake of a Chaos Tree, to become mortal enemies with a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan weighed the pros and cons, without a doubt, if he planned to save the Stone People Tribe, he would completely offend the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I can do it."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan made up his mind. In terms of strength, he was not much weaker than ordinary Chaos Venerables now, and the Ninth Profound Venerable was a newly promoted Venerable, about on par with himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not a powerful figure in the Myriad Realms Void Domain, and after saving the Stone People Tribe, he could directly cut off the cause and effect, and move far away. It would be very difficult for the Ninth Profound Venerable to track him down again. Even if he could find him, it would be tens of thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>By that time, Lin Yuan would have already entered the Sovereign Realm, and with his current foundation, once he entered the Sovereign Realm and digested various methods, he would not need to take the newly promoted Ninth Profound Venerable seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>The key is that Lin Yuan's public identity is just a peak Dao Realm cultivator living on the Ancient Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the Ninth Profound Venerable investigates, he will only investigate powerful Chaos Venerables, and will not be able to trace it back to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you..."</p><p></p><p>In the Karma Pond, Cang Yulong looked at Lin Yuan cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Chaos Tree and the mysterious inheritance space as rewards, Cang Yulong did not dare to be sure whether Lin Yuan was willing to help him. After all, the enemy was a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I promise you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Cang Yulong and said.</p><p></p><p>"You promise me?" </p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong was a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>This sentence contained too much information.</p><p></p><p>There was the possibility that he would no longer be endlessly eroded by the Karma Pond.</p><p></p><p>There were countless Stone People Tribe members who no longer had to live in constant fear of being killed by the wrath of the Ninth Profound Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And the young man in front of him, who had a connection with the Stone People Tribe, was most likely also a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>If he was not a Venerable, even if the reward was ten or a hundred times more precious than the Chaos Tree, he must have the ability to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't guarantee that I can save all the Stone People Tribe, but I can save you and me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Can't guarantee to save all the Stone People Tribe"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong felt relieved when he heard these words. If Lin Yuan promised everything, Cang Yulong would not feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>Now all the Stone People Tribe members are in the universe of the Ninth Profound Venerable, only Cang Yulong is outside, in order to bear the torment of the Karma Pond.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guaranteeing to save all the Stone People Tribe is simply not realistic.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the senior is willing to lend a hand, I will hand over everything to the senior."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Now he really has no other choice.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Wait here for a while."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lin Yuan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The senior has left."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong looked around, but could no longer see Lin Yuan's figure.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>A childish voice suddenly resounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"You stinky boy, you scared me just now, I almost thought I was going to be discovered."</p><p></p><p>This childish voice revealed a sense of panic.</p><p></p><p>"Can we really trust that senior just now?" Cang Yulong asked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was this childish voice that reminded him that Lin Yuan and the Ninth Profound Venerable were not on the same side, and Cang Yulong finally chose to reveal everything.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, that person has no karma with the Ninth Profound at all. He probably doesn't even know the Ninth Profound, and he sneaked in here, most likely he really has a connection with your Stone People Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The childish voice was a little surprised, "I didn't expect your weak Stone People Tribe to be able to make acquaintance with a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that senior really a Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if he is a Venerable, but his understanding of time and space should have reached the Eighth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The childish voice replied.</p><p></p><p>"Time and Space Eighth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong swallowed hard. As far as he knew, not all Chaos Venerables had the realm of understanding of the Time and Space Eighth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ninth Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"That Stone People Tribe member..."</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's mind, the image of Cang Yulong appeared, and the moment he saw him, he vaguely felt that there was another consciousness fluctuation hidden in his body.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was very vague and indistinct, even an ordinary peak Chaos Venerable might not be able to perceive it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the boy also has a secret, but the Chaos Tree should be real."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"For a Chaos Tree, it's worth dispatching two major divine souls."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Tree is priceless, and is one of the few treasures that can directly enhance the foundation of a Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It will also be of great help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It even has a certain driving effect on the cultivation of the third layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>"Divine Souls."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ancient Chaos Continent, in the boundless chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Sun and Moon Divine Souls were sitting cross-legged there.</p><p></p><p>"Using the incarnation as a coordinate, you can directly perform long-distance teleportation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his two divine souls' minds.</p><p></p><p>This is also one of the abilities of the Time and Space Eighth Realm. As long as there is a 'coordinate' that can support the teleportation, then long-distance teleportation can be performed.</p><p></p><p>To deal with the Ninth Profound Venerable at the Chaos Realm, relying on just one incarnation is obviously not enough, so for the sake of safety, it's better to dispatch the two major divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two major divine souls, once fused and transformed into the Taiji Divine Soul, their combat power would only be slightly inferior to his true body.</p><p></p><p>They also have the strength to reach the Chaos Realm threshold.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>Around the Sun and Moon Divine Souls, dense time and space fluctuations arose, and in the blink of an eye, they disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the Ninth Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Karma Pond.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong was still soaking in it.</p><p></p><p>"Has the senior reneged?" Cang Yulong was tormented in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If it was always hopeless, Cang Yulong could still hold on, but after seeing hope and then falling into despair again, the taste in Cang Yulong's heart was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"You stinky boy, just wait patiently, what are you thinking about?" The childish figure was about to scold Cang Yulong, but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared again next to the Karma Pond.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong perked up.</p><p></p><p>"These chains..." Lin Yuan looked at the chains that bound Cang Yulong's limbs and body.</p><p></p><p>These chains not only bound Cang Yulong's physical body, but also his soul and spirit.</p><p></p><p>To rescue Cang Yulong, he must cut off these chains.</p><p></p><p>"I will break these chains as quickly as possible, it may be very painful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan warned.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, feel free to do whatever you want, in these years, I'm not good at anything else, pain? No big deal."</p><p></p><p>Cang Yulong said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could also slowly erode these chains, but that would waste too much time, and the moment the chains were eroded, the Ninth Profound Venerable would know.</p><p></p><p>At the highest point of the Ninth Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable sat on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious space should contain a certain inheritance, and using the Chaos Tree to suppress that inheritance space, it is most likely an inheritance at the Saint Realm level."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable began to fantasize, having just reached the Chaos Realm, and already obtaining an inheritance at the Saint Realm level? The Ninth Profound Venerable felt that his luck was very good.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he let that Stone People Tribe boy take the lead.</p><p></p><p>But now, that boy and the entire Stone People Tribe have fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable believed that obtaining that inheritance space was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable's expression changed, he sensed that the aura in the Karma Pond had completely disappeared, and his perception of Cang Yulong had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable was furious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the palace, a suffocating hot aura suddenly enveloped the place, with an ancient and majestic presence, burning the sky and boiling the earth.</p><p></p><p>In the heaven and earth, a young man with his hands behind his back appeared, blocking the Ninth Profound Venerable's path.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Profound Venerable stared at the young man in front of him, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

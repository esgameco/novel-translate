        <h1>Chapter 622</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Venerable Ones were greatly agitated in their divine spirits, and it took them a while to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, just now, did a supreme great sage enter?"</p><p></p><p>"To form a new void space with a single thought, replacing the rules of the chaotic void, it must be a supreme great sage. Only a supreme great sage can form a new great Dao of the void rules in a single thought."</p><p></p><p>"A supreme great sage, ah."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerable Ones quickly discussed and conversed. The evolutionary power and foundation of the path of the supreme great sage were thick enough to bear the many great Dao rules of the chaotic void, so they could form a new great Dao rule.</p><p></p><p>To become a supreme great sage, the strength and weakness are secondary.</p><p></p><p>It means that the path they have walked is broad enough.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that the great Dao has thousands of variations, they all lead to the same destination, and there is no distinction of high and low in the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>But a muddy little path and a towering great path, even if they both reach the destination, the process is vastly different.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, for a Chaos Sage to become a supreme great sage, it has nothing to do with natural talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>It depends on whether the power path they have walked is thick and broad.</p><p></p><p>Why did the All-Seeing Eye immediately believe that Lin Yuan could become a supreme great sage when it detected the evolutionary path he was spreading, which was a branch of his own evolutionary path? It was because the martial Dao evolutionary path could branch out so many paths at the Dao-opening realm, and the paths that could reach the Chaos Realm could be imagined to be how broad and thick the martial Dao evolutionary path itself was.</p><p></p><p>Such an evolutionary path, as long as it grows smoothly, becoming a supreme great sage can be said to be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, were there two supreme great sages who came?"</p><p></p><p>"Two supreme great sages?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerable Ones quickly exchanged, and one Venerable had just caught a fleeting glimpse of two blurry figures appearing from the distant space-time.</p><p></p><p>Grand Sage Hunxiao and Jade Unicorn Grand Sage did not intend to enter the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos silently at all.</p><p></p><p>As supreme great sages, they should be roaming the chaotic void, how could they be sneaky? </p><p></p><p>So they didn't conceal themselves at all, but even so, most of the Chaos Venerable Ones were unable to raise their heads under the oppressive aura of the supreme great sages, only a few Venerables saw their blurry figures.</p><p></p><p>"The two supreme great sages both entered this post-heaven cosmos?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems this post-heaven cosmos really has a great origin."</p><p></p><p>"I don't care if it has a great origin or not, it has nothing to do with me anyway."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's just that the Galaxy Grand Sage... is in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Many Chaos Venerable Ones suddenly thought of the situation within the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Ever since suppressing the Black Brilliance Grand Sage, the Savage Grand Sage, and other eight Chaos Grand Sages, this post-heaven cosmos had been completely occupied by the Galaxy Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>With the battle power the Galaxy Grand Sage had shown, the other Chaos Grand Sages didn't dare to enter, and as for the Chaos Venerables originally inside, the Galaxy Grand Sage didn't drive them out, but these Chaos Venerables also knew their limits and only dared to wander around the outer areas of the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, this post-heaven cosmos had become the backyard of the Galaxy Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>But now, the arrival of the two supreme great sages has completely broken this situation.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Grand Sage is very strong, the domain world he has condensed can make many great Dao rules retreat and avoid, but after the decision of several Chaos Grand Sages, the Galaxy Grand Sage has ultimately not reached the level of a supreme great sage.</p><p></p><p>In this case, with the two supreme great sages entering, the Galaxy Grand Sage, who is located within the cosmos, can almost foresee his fate.</p><p></p><p>If lucky, those two supreme great sages might be in a good mood and let him live, but all the gains from this cosmic journey must be handed over.</p><p></p><p>If unlucky? Just like how the Galaxy Grand Sage treated the Black Brilliance Grand Sage and the Savage Grand Sage, he will be suppressed by the two supreme great sages and have to "pay a ransom" to exchange.</p><p></p><p>If even more unlucky, being disliked by the two supreme great sages, he might even end up dead directly.</p><p></p><p>The supreme great sages are at such a high level that they don't care much about "ransoms".</p><p></p><p>In the distant void domain.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Grand Sage saw many of his friends, but none of them were willing to come forward to help him negotiate with the Galaxy Grand Sage.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Grand Sage received a message.</p><p></p><p>"The two supreme great sages have also entered that post-heaven cosmos?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Savage Grand Sage's expression changed from displeasure to alarm.</p><p></p><p>His main combat body was in the hands of the Galaxy Grand Sage in the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, so he was naturally very concerned about the situation in that area and was the first to know about the arrival of the two supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>"The situation has become troublesome."</p><p></p><p>The Savage Grand Sage frowned, his main combat body falling into Lin Yuan's hands, although it would require a huge price to exchange it back, at least that price had been determined.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Savage Grand Sage only needs to gather 10 billion chaos stones to exchange back his main combat body.</p><p></p><p>This was something the Galaxy Grand Sage had agreed to.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence generally does not go back on their word.</p><p></p><p>But now with the addition of two supreme great sages? It has gone beyond the Savage Grand Sage's control.</p><p></p><p>With the two supreme great sages entering the post-heaven cosmos, the Galaxy Grand Sage should be suppressed, which means that the main combat bodies of these Chaos Grand Sages are equivalent to falling into the hands of the two supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Grand Sage was willing to use their main combat bodies to exchange for 10 billion chaos stones, but that doesn't mean the two supreme great sages will do the same.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Grand Sage, you must escape!"</p><p></p><p>The Savage Grand Sage looked towards the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, silently hoping that the Galaxy Grand Sage, who had suppressed his main combat body, could escape from the hands of those two supreme great sages.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Savage Grand Sage, but the Black Brilliance Grand Sage and the Heavenly Prosperity Grand Sage also had some uneasy speculations, as the entry of the supreme great sages had made the situation more complicated.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they only needed to hand over the corresponding amount of chaos stones to safely exchange back their main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>But now? Who knows what price they would have to pay.</p><p></p><p>"Two supreme great sages?"</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Grand Sage, who had already arrived in another void domain, was slightly taken aback, but then felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Grand Sage, it seems I should thank you."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Grand Sage thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the Galaxy Grand Sage, he would still be exploring the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos right now.</p><p></p><p>At this time, with the two supreme great sages coming in, what would his fate be? The Dual Source Grand Sage had barely escaped from Lin Yuan's hands by fighting for his life.</p><p></p><p>But facing the supreme great sages? No matter how hard he fought, he wouldn't be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>His fate would certainly be much worse than it is now.</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Grand Sage, to have persisted for so long in Hunxiao's hands? Remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"Probably Hunxiao is unwilling to pay the price and wants to suppress the Galaxy Grand Sage without any loss."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, it's still quite an achievement, as the Galaxy Grand Sage doesn't even have the power of chaos evolution."</p><p></p><p>The Broken Sword, the Ancient Altar Spirit, the All-Seeing Eye, and other special existences were also observing the situation within the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>The one-thought void formation of the supreme great sage level, which can form a completely independent void world, was something they as special existences could not forcibly penetrate and observe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Relying on the vague spatial-temporal fluctuations, many things could be inferred.</p><p></p><p>These special existences had experienced countless cosmic eras, with keen eyesight, and could draw many conclusions from the subtlest of details.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Xuanhuang Universe had completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>This freezing was not only the freezing of space, but also the freezing of time.</p><p></p><p>If the previous Xuanhuang Universe was a constantly flowing stream of living water, then at this moment, the Xuanhuang Universe had transformed from living water to solid ice.</p><p></p><p>The myriad power fluctuations and rule auras had all vanished without a trace, unable to be transmitted at all.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The broken sword, the ancient altar spirit, and other special existences suddenly changed expressions, and the same thought arose in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>A towering and majestic man stood in the void, without emitting the slightest aura. But after his appearance, the entire Xuanhuang Universe began to undergo inexplicable changes, the Dao rules started to boil, and the Dao rules that had been suppressed by the Grand Saints of Hunxiao and Yulian were now rapidly counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the changes in the Xuanhuang Universe, the Grand Saints of Hunxiao and Yulian did not seem to care at all. The gazes of these two supreme Grand Saints were firmly fixed on the towering and majestic man, as if they had witnessed something unbelievable, as if a person who should absolutely not have appeared had suddenly shown up.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Emperor? Weren't you about to break through to the Thirteenth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Hunxiao spoke with a trembling voice, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that the towering and majestic man before him was not some imprinted consciousness, but the Xuan Emperor himself, the invincible Grand Saint who had dominated other supreme Grand Saints tens of millions of cosmic eras ago.</p><p></p><p>In the past, before the Xuan Emperor's breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm, he had specifically hunted down a group of supreme Grand Saints to eliminate hidden dangers, and Hunxiao and Yulian were among them.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, Hunxiao and Yulian had no choice but to choose reincarnation, which allowed them to escape the Xuan Emperor's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Chaos Realm allowed for reincarnation, and Grand Saints who had reached Chaos Realm Perfection could retain some memories after reincarnation, with supreme Grand Saints retaining even more.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they retained all their memories, after reincarnation, every Grand Saint would be at their weakest. Reincarnating into powerful races was still fine, but if they reincarnated into weak and frail races, it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>During reincarnation in the Chaos Void, whether it was an ordinary Venerable or a supreme Grand Saint, the reincarnation target was random, and they could not choose. The vast Chaos Void was dominated by countless innate universes and secret realms, with the weak and frail races occupying 99% of them, and the powerful races being extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In other words, unless their luck was extraordinary, even if they were supreme Grand Saints, the starting point of their reincarnated forms would most likely be very low. With a low starting point, even if they retained some memories, if they found themselves in a desperate situation, it would still be difficult for them to survive.</p><p></p><p>If they died during reincarnation, they would undergo a second reincarnation, and the memories retained in the second reincarnation would become extremely scarce, making the hope of returning to the Grand Saint realm even more remote.</p><p></p><p>At the Chaos Saint realm, especially for supreme Grand Saints, their paths were already broad and profound, and they had the hope of becoming temporal lives. If it was not absolutely necessary, they would never choose to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>"Have you broken through to the Thirteenth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Yulian beside him was also shaken. The Xuan Emperor's escape from the temporal cycle, his first thought was that he had broken through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>"You have not broken through to the Thirteenth Realm. The birth of every temporal life in the Chaos Void would cause spatial-temporal fluctuations in the Chaos Void, and we would definitely know about it."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Yulian was filled with terror, but he still managed to maintain a basic rationality.</p><p></p><p>When the Chaos Void's life forms broke through from the Eleventh Realm to the Twelfth Realm, they would endure the baptism of the Chaos Void's primal essence.</p><p></p><p>And when they broke through from the Twelfth Realm to the Thirteenth Realm, it would be the same, and the resulting fluctuations would far exceed the previous one.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you have not broken through to the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Hunxiao also realized this. They looked at the towering and majestic man in the distance, who had become their nightmare for over thirty million cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>The two supreme Grand Saints did not dare to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, and they wanted to completely erase the traces of the Xuanhuang lineage, also to minimize the impact of this nightmare on themselves.</p><p></p><p>"After so many cosmic eras, you two are still useless."</p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man smiled on his face, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuan Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also looked at the towering and majestic man beside him, his heart constantly rippling.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Emperor? He was the Xuan Emperor? The founder of the Xuanhuang lineage? Although not an invincible Grand Saint, he was no weaker than an invincible Grand Saint.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts were in turmoil. Ever since he had broken through to the Ninth Realm and taken control of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, he had heard of this Xuan Emperor. The inheritance of the Xuanhuang lineage in his home universe had also played a significant role for him.</p><p></p><p>And now, he actually saw the true Xuan Emperor? "Crushing that pearl would summon the Xuan Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts were tumultuous, but an even greater doubt arose in his heart - if that was the case, why did the Mausoleum Spirit urge him to avoid crushing it as much as possible?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saints of Hunxiao and Yulian had grim expressions, and although their hearts were still filled with terror, when they heard the Xuan Emperor's "useless" remark, their gazes became somewhat dazed, as if they had been transported back to over thirty million cosmic eras ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they were also supreme Grand Saints, and they should have been able to dominate the Chaos Void and eventually condense everything to break through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in that era, the monstrous Xuan Emperor had appeared. In terms of birth, the Xuan Emperor was nothing more than a lowly life form nurtured by a natural universe.</p><p></p><p>In terms of inheritance, the Xuan Emperor had no elders to rely on.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this lowly being had rapidly grown to the Chaos Realm, Chaos Realm Perfection, and then to the supreme Grand Saint realm! The Grand Saints of Hunxiao, Yulian, and many other supreme Grand Saints of that era had basically lived in the shadow of the Xuan Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Emperor, it has been over thirty million cosmic eras. Yulian and I have experienced one reincarnation and returned to our peak, our strength is now much greater than before."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Hunxiao's voice grew louder, shaking the space-time.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saint of Yulian was the same, his gaze quickly calming down.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>The towering and majestic man smiled slightly, then raised his right hand behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Saints of Hunxiao and Yulian fled like startled birds, without any hesitation heading towards the entrance. At this moment, the Xuanhuang Universe was fused as one, and they could not tear open the surrounding space-time, so their only hope was to escape through the entrance.</p><p></p><p>In the body universe, in the Mausoleum, the Mausoleum Spirit sat there, with a somber expression, murmuring softly, "Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you cannot break through the temporal cycle in thirty million cosmic eras and enter the Thirteenth Realm, the hope, however remote, still exists. The distant future may bring changes."</p><p></p><p>"Even if there are no changes, and you are trapped in the temporal cycle, as long as you are alive, there is hope, there is hope!"</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit's eyes lowered, with faint tears glistening.</p><p></p><p>"But why give up this hope? Why give up?"</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit's body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

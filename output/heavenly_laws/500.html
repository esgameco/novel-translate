        <h1>Chapter 500</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The void was hazy and chaotic, when a figure suddenly appeared and descended.</p><p></p><p>"I've arrived." Lin Yuan carefully looked at the vast continent floating in the distance. This continent was dozens of times larger than his home universe, emanating an endless aura that radiated out to the distant, chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Chaotic Continent?" Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>This continent was the closest Chaotic Continent to his home universe. While a hundred years had passed in his home universe, only four months had elapsed in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, Lin Yuan had been aimlessly wandering the chaotic void when he accidentally discovered the aura emanating from the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>After three months of travel, Lin Yuan had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got to the Ancient Chaotic Continent, the more frequently he encountered other powerful experts. In his interactions with these experts, he had obtained information about the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The information left behind by the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang' also included an introduction to the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"I'm quite lucky." Lin Yuan felt pleased. The Ancient Chaotic Continent was at the edge of the map left behind by Senior Cang Weiyang.</p><p></p><p>Any further and it would be beyond the mapped area.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void was boundless, and even Chaotic Saints would be unable to reach the edge, let alone Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I'm this far from my home universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced back.</p><p></p><p>With his current understanding of space-time, he could traverse an entire home universe with each breath, yet it had still taken him over three months to get here. One could only imagine how distant his home universe was from the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this distance was only significant to Lin Yuan. For Sovereigns, it might only take a few hours to cross, and for Chaotic Realm experts, a single thought could span the distance.</p><p></p><p>The three levels of the Twelve Realms - Transcendent, Sovereign, and Chaotic - were like vast chasms, and it was said that upon crossing the Chaotic Realm, one could approach the perfection of temporal life, possessing some of its characteristics.</p><p></p><p>"The connection between my true self and my incarnation is reaching its limit," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate Twelve Realm experts in his home universe could only linger near the universe with their incarnations, and they would not last long before being eroded and collapsing by the Chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's space-time comprehension had reached the Seventh Realm, allowing his incarnation a much greater range than the Sixth Realm, but even that had its limits.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yuan had discovered the Ancient Chaotic Continent before reaching that limit, or rather, the Ancient Chaotic Continent happened to be within the range of his true self and incarnation's connection.</p><p></p><p>"The ruler of the Ancient Chaotic Continent..."</p><p></p><p>Information about the Ancient Chaotic Continent flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>For it to be called a Chaotic Continent, there must be a Chaotic Realm expert behind it. And the Chaotic Realm expert behind the Ancient Chaotic Continent was named Gu Ming, after whom the entire continent was named.</p><p></p><p>Gu Ming valued fairness greatly, and the trade in the Ancient Chaotic Continent was prosperous, attracting powerful experts from the nearby chaotic void and even other Chaotic Continents to come and trade.</p><p></p><p>"When Senior Cang Weiyang was still alive, Gu Ming was already a renowned Chaotic Venerable. Even now, after several universe cycles have passed since Cang Weiyang's death, Gu Ming still remains."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt somewhat awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Chaotic Venerables were extremely difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of the Demon Jade Pavilion Master and the Mysterious Emperor were not definitive proof that they had died. Even if they had, it might not have been from being killed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued approaching the vast Chaotic Continent in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Chaotic Continent was protected by a grand formation, with thirty-three entrances and exits. Lin Yuan chose the nearest one.</p><p></p><p>"To enter the Ancient Chaotic Continent, you must pay ten Chaotic Stones," a mental message was transmitted to Lin Yuan at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Chaotic Continent prohibited fighting, making it extremely safe. Since it was safe, it naturally required a fee. Compared to the perilous chaotic void, the Ancient Chaotic Continent at least had order and security.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out ten Chaotic Stones. He had obtained many Chaotic Stones from the residence of the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang', though he had sent most of them back to his home universe. He had kept a few on his incarnation for this very purpose.</p><p></p><p>With the information left behind by Senior Cang Weiyang, Lin Yuan was quite familiar with many of the rules of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Lin Yuan looked up and saw several figures descending.</p><p></p><p>These figures seemed to be from the same group, and after pausing at the entrance, they took out a few Twelve Realm weapons to make up the "fee" to enter the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Ancient Chaotic Continent, one had to pay ten Chaotic Stones. If one did not have Chaotic Stones, they could use treasures of the same realm as substitutes. However, most experts would choose to use Chaotic Stones, as using other treasures would incur a premium, with the Ancient Chaotic Continent offering the lowest price.</p><p></p><p>"Those experts are likely just emerging from their universes as Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm cultivators," Lin Yuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void had birthed countless universes, and every moment there were universes undergoing great destruction, with Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm cultivators surviving the calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm experts from the universes, having endured the great destruction, formally entered the chaotic void and, if lucky, would find the nearest Chaotic Continent to settle down.</p><p></p><p>If unlucky, they could wander the chaotic void for a long time and encounter various dangers that could lead to their demise.</p><p></p><p>Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm experts were virtually unkillable within their universes, as the universe's protection and scale were equivalent to that of a Chaotic Realm expert. This shielded them from most threats.</p><p></p><p>Without the universe's protection, and with poor luck, Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm experts would often find themselves in peril.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void had many experts who specifically targeted the Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm cultivators who had survived the great destruction of their universes, as they would be carrying the majority of their universe's wealth.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, since they had not yet entered the chaotic void, their battle prowess would be weaker than the Twelve Realm Transcendent Realm experts already in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Carrying great wealth but being weak in strength, they became prime targets, or "fat sheep," for many experts in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the Chaotic Continents, the chaotic void had no semblance of order, only the rule of the strong.</p><p></p><p>"The great destruction of the universe..." Lin Yuan's expression became somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of a universe targeted all life within it. When a universe collapsed, the time stream would shatter, and all life would perish.</p><p></p><p>Only the Twelve Realm Ultimate experts who had transcended the time stream had a chance of surviving. But even for them, the collapse of many rules during the great destruction could still prove fatal, and often only a small fraction would ultimately endure.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Second Realm Ultimate can smoothly exit the universe and enter the chaotic void. As for the lives below the Twelfth Realm? </p><p></p><p>There is only one way for them to survive.</p><p></p><p>That is to imprint their life essence and migrate it from the long river of time within the universe into the long river of time within the Twelfth Realm Ultimate's universe.</p><p></p><p>When the universe is destroyed and the long river of time collapses, any life within the river will perish, because their life essence is also within the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>As long as they transfer their life essence into the long river of time within the Twelfth Realm Ultimate's universe, they can survive.</p><p></p><p>After the great destruction of the universe, the countless lives within the Twelfth Realm Ultimate's universe will naturally be able to live on.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Twelfth Realm Ultimates have this ability, they will not transfer too many lives from the universe into their own universe.</p><p></p><p>Because the more lives they carry from the universe, the more attention the universal consciousness will pay to them, and the greater and more terrifying the pressure they will bear during the great destruction.</p><p></p><p>"In the great destruction of the universe, 99% of the citizens of human civilization will die," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, 99% is already considered good. The lives that can enter the Twelfth Realm Ultimate's universe are at most one in a million or one in ten million. And with half of the Twelfth Realm Ultimates also falling during the great destruction of the universe, the number becomes even smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, thinking about this is too far away now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts gathered, his home universe was still very young, and barring any accidents, the great destruction of the universe was still an immeasurably long distance away.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan entered the Ancient Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Chaotic Continent has nine cities, which are the gathering places for all foreign lives.</p><p></p><p>As for outside the cities? It is also covered with many formations, and is the cultivation ground of the Ancient Bright Venerable, forbidden for any foreign strong ones to enter.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the center of the continent.</p><p></p><p>There stood a black mountain peak, with a terrifying aura permeating in all directions. This black mountain peak was filled with the aura of dark chaos, enough to make even Sovereign Realm experts tremble.</p><p></p><p>"That is the horn of the Chaotic Dragon Beast subdued by the Ancient Bright Venerable," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>As a Chaotic Venerable, the Ancient Bright Venerable had roamed the chaotic void in his early years and recovered a Chaotic Dragon Beast with nearly Chaotic Realm combat power. </p><p></p><p>The mountain peak standing in the center of the Chaotic Continent was just one horn of the Chaotic Dragon Beast, and the true body of the Chaotic Dragon Beast was sleeping deep within the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>"A Chaotic Dragon Beast on par with Chaotic Realm combat power." Lin Yuan retracted his gaze. The prosperous trade of the Ancient Chaotic Continent was not unrelated to this Chaotic Dragon Beast.</p><p></p><p>No matter who it is, even peak Sovereign Realm experts, seeing that horn piercing the sky, will have their scalp tingle, and dare not cause trouble on the Chaotic Continent.</p><p></p><p>But the prosperity of a Chaotic Continent is not too closely related to the strength of the Chaotic Venerable.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong you are, if the order of your Chaotic Continent is in chaos, other strong ones will not be willing to trade there.</p><p></p><p>"Can't provoke you, can't hide from you either?" The Ancient Bright Venerable believes in fairness, and for countless universes, there has been no reputation of evil. Many Transcendent and Sovereign Realm experts also like to come to the Ancient Chaotic Continent to trade and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered one of the nine cities of the Ancient Chaotic Continent, Mingchuan City.</p><p></p><p>The city was vast, divided into many areas, such as the trading area and the living area.</p><p></p><p>"The trading area has many shops, and behind them are all Sovereign Realm experts, with their influence limited to the Ancient Chaotic Continent or even just Mingchuan City."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept a glance, then looked deeper.</p><p></p><p>There stood majestic buildings, and behind these buildings were forces from other Chaotic Continents, with Chaotic Realm experts standing behind them.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the many private shops of the Sovereign Realm, these large shops had a better reputation, and of course, higher prices.</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Ten Thousand Paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the building at the very back, one of the pavilions of which was shrouded in mist, unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of Ten Thousand Paths did not sell treasures or materials, but evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>To cross into the Twelfth Realm, one must reach the end of an evolution path, and this evolution path cannot have any Twelfth Realm existence.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void is boundless, and the lives that can perfect a brand new evolution path from scratch and eventually cross into the Twelfth Realm are extremely few.</p><p></p><p>Most Twelfth Realm experts walk paths that already exist.</p><p></p><p>An evolution path to the Twelfth Realm requires great perseverance and great opportunities for lives below the Twelfth Realm to create.</p><p></p><p>But for many Chaotic Realm experts, perhaps a single closed-door cultivation, exploring hundreds or thousands of paths, can uncover hundreds or thousands of Twelfth Realm evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>The great Dao is boundless, and any evolution path has the potential to ascend to the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of the probability being higher or lower, but when Chaotic Realm experts are in closed-door cultivation, observing the essence of the great Dao, many evolution paths will emerge, and some Chaotic Realm experts will record these evolution paths and then perfect them.</p><p></p><p>"Evolution paths are also graded, with some having the potential to reach Sovereign or even Chaotic Realm," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had no particular interest in the evolution paths traded at the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths. Any evolution path that suits him best is the most important. And as a martial dao evolution path he created himself, it is naturally a perfect fit for him.</p><p></p><p>Since the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths dares to trade evolution paths, the existence behind it is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>In the many intelligence reports left by the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang', the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths is definitely one of the forbidden existences to provoke.</p><p></p><p>Even in the era of Emperor Xuan and the Demon Jade Pavilion Master, the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths had already existed, and these two Chaotic Great Saints were also extremely wary of it.</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of Ten Thousand Paths, suspected to be the layout of a near-perfect time life?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of Emperor Xuan's description of the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths, which was one of the rare moments when his tone was grave.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no intention of contacting the Hall of Ten Thousand Paths for now.</p><p></p><p>After entering Mingchuan City, what Lin Yuan needed to do was to take up permanent residence here.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void is too dangerous. In the past four months, Lin Yuan had almost experienced a life-and-death crisis, and if it were not for his mastery of the Seven Layers of Time-Space Realm, he might have already ended his journey in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Staying in Mingchuan City has many benefits. First, it is safe, and second, the trade here is extremely prosperous, so Lin Yuan can easily obtain the treasures and materials he wants.</p><p></p><p>Exploring the chaotic void? Obtaining rare treasures?</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, who is still at the Eleventh Realm, this is still too much of a stretch.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he directly obtained the abode of the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang', which was an extremely lucky result.</p><p></p><p>But luck cannot last forever.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

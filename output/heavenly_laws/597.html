        <h1>Chapter 597</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord had flames burning in the center of his brow, resembling a miniature blazing sun, and he cooperated with Lin Yuan to take control of the Black Jade Nest with great delight.</p><p></p><p>"Initially, I detected a hidden danger in the spiritual will, and at great cost, I obtained the opportunity to become the guardian of the Black Jade Nest. Now, I have finally remedied the hidden danger for the most part," the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The special resource of the Black Jade Nest, the black jade, has great benefits for the spiritual will of all beings.</p><p></p><p>However, the black jade is rare and hard to come by, and the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord needs it, as do the other Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming the guardian of the Black Jade Nest can one stably obtain the black jade.</p><p></p><p>Since he had resolved the hidden danger in his spiritual will, the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord was not inclined to continue occupying the Black Jade Nest, especially with the recent arrival of the renowned Grand Celestial Lord of the Silver River to take over.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual will issue has been resolved, and now it's time to prepare for the next step."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the Celestial Lords of the Six Ancient Kingdoms all ardently desire to take that next step.</p><p></p><p>It is said that in the distant past, there was only one ancient kingdom, and later the second, third, and so on, ancient kingdoms were successively born, until the present day when the Six Ancient Kingdoms stand side by side.</p><p></p><p>"If I can take that step, I will open up the Seventh Ancient Kingdom, shining like the Ancestor and illuminating this world eternally, knowing the past and the future."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord yearned for this deeply.</p><p></p><p>Why do the Celestial Lords have to obey the commands of the various Ancient Kingdoms? It is simply because they want to increase their chances of taking that step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Over the years, I have accumulated enough merits to exchange for a chance to possess the Ancestor. I can experience the height and vision of the Ancestor in advance."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord had served the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom for countless years. With his strength as a Celestial Lord, he had experienced hundreds of full-scale wars between the other Ancient Kingdoms, and on top of that, the harvests from guarding the resource treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>He had already accumulated tens of billions of merits, enough to possess the Ancestor once.</p><p></p><p>"I have lived long enough, and going forward, it will only be an endless repetition."</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord was well aware of the risks of taking that step, even with his years of preparation and the final possession of the Ancestor. The chances of success were still minuscule.</p><p></p><p>But even if the chances were slim, it was still a hope, and the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord felt that he should give it a try, even if it meant being completely immersed in a certain cycle of time.</p><p></p><p>After giving Lin Yuan a few more instructions, since he was about to take that step, the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord had let go of everything.</p><p></p><p>What were the struggles between the Celestial Lords and the royal families? If he could succeed and open the Seventh Ancient Kingdom, those struggles would naturally dissipate.</p><p></p><p>If he failed and became immersed in the time loop, the so-called struggles would have no meaning to him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord's instructions to Lin Yuan were sincere, without any hidden deception.</p><p></p><p>After the instructions, the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord directly left and disappeared into the spatial transmission array.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan successfully took control of this first-class resource treasure trove, commanding all the formations and killing arrays of the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it went so smoothly, all thanks to Brother Crimson Treasure," Lin Yuan said with a smile as he looked at Crimson Treasure King.</p><p></p><p>"Strange," Crimson Treasure King frowned in thought. "The Blazing Sun Celestial Lord has always been extremely domineering. In the past, he almost completely offended the other four or five Celestial Lords just to compete for the opportunity to be the guardian of this Black Jade Nest. So why did he give it up so easily now?"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Treasure King's expression was full of suspicion. "But he did give up this resource treasure trove, without doing anything, and just left directly. You, Silver River, have completely taken control of all the formations and killing arrays of the Black Jade Nest."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord's personality is, he has been good to me," Lin Yuan said. "The things he instructed me just now also made a lot of sense."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they made a lot of sense," Crimson Treasure King nodded. "That's why I didn't say anything the whole time. The things the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord told you are all the things that need to be paid attention to when guarding a border resource treasure trove."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Crimson Treasure King shook his head and said, "Anyway, this is a good thing. To take control of the Black Jade Nest so smoothly, it saved a lot of time. Originally, I was planning to have a good talk with that Blazing Sun Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's a good thing," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>To take control of this first-class resource treasure trove without any trouble, it was indeed a good thing. Even with the imperial decree of the Ancient Kingdom's emperor, if the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord had secretly obstructed it, it would have been a hassle. Now that these issues did not arise, Lin Yuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, how do you plan to guard this resource treasure trove?" Crimson Treasure King asked Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll use a clone to guard it," Lin Yuan thought, and his Yin Spiritual Deity walked out and entered the core of the Black Jade Nest, commanding all the formations and killing arrays.</p><p></p><p>The guardians of resource treasure troves rarely guard them with their true body and main spirit. They usually use clones, transformed bodies, or subordinates to guard them.</p><p></p><p>Every resource treasure trove has a spatial transmission array, as well as defensive formations and killing arrays. As long as the guardian can hold out for ten breaths, the main body will have time to provide support.</p><p></p><p>"Using a clone is the best," Crimson Treasure King nodded. Even the Blazing Sun Celestial Lord had used a clone to guard the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>A first-class resource treasure trove is extremely precious. Sending a transformed body or subordinates to guard it would still be somewhat risky.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the next treasure trove," Crimson Treasure King immediately led Lin Yuan into the spatial transmission array, heading to Lin Yuan's second resource treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Black Jade Nest, Lin Yuan's Yin Spiritual Deity sat in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the black jade?"</p><p></p><p>A deep, black jade stone floated before him.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, a captivating aura circulated within it.</p><p></p><p>The next full convergence of the black jade was still tens of thousands of years away, but here, the black jade had already fully converged. Now, a small portion had even 'matured' in advance. As the guardian, Lin Yuan could naturally extract them.</p><p></p><p>Just by sensing the aura of the black jade from up close, Lin Yuan felt as if he had experienced layer upon layer of illusions, and his own spiritual will was being imperceptibly tempered and enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"My current spiritual will index is almost 70 million points."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Twelfth Realm, Lin Yuan's spiritual will index had soared to 60 million points.</p><p></p><p>Now, after thousands of years, he had increased by 10 million points, a progress rate that could be considered astonishingly fast.</p><p></p><p>70 million points of spiritual will index had completely reached the peak of the Sovereign Realm and even entered the initial stage of the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to Lin Yuan's current strength, 70 million points of spiritual will index was still a weak point.</p><p></p><p>After all, among the Chaos Saints, their spiritual will indices were generally over 100 million points, having experienced countless cosmic eras. 70 million points was quite low in comparison.</p><p></p><p>But spiritual will index does not have a huge impact on strength, unlike physical power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The difference in cultivation was so visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"Next, the task of this spiritual body is to refine the Black Jade as much as possible and enhance the strength of the spiritual will."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the floating Black Jade in front of him and began to refine it directly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, </p><p>a series of awe-inspiring auras surged into the depths of Lin Yuan's soul, refining his spiritual will strength imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual will strength, although not that useful in battle, cannot be too weak, especially when breaking through bottlenecks. If the spiritual will is too weak, it will lead to failure in the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one is, the more they value their spiritual will. The Blazing Yang Sovereign was willing to completely offend the other four or five Sovereigns just to occupy the Black Jade's Nest, just to make up for the hidden danger in his own spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Another first-class resource treasure land, called the Azure Wave Cliff, was guarded by one named the Crimson Meteor King.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Blazing Yang Sovereign, the Crimson Meteor King was a core royal family member who had grown to his limit.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Brother Silver River, I just received an order from His Majesty, saying that he wants you to take over the Azure Wave Cliff, and I've been waiting here all morning."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Meteor King was a majestic man, his laughter hearty and enthusiastic: "Come, come, come, this is the fine wine I've collected for years. That Crimson Treasure fellow has never tasted it."</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Meteor, are you saying this in front of me?" Crimson Treasure King rolled his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with saying it in front of you?" The Crimson Meteor King said without a care.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Crimson Meteor King," Lin Yuan said beside them.</p><p></p><p>In Crimson Treasure King's initial estimation, the most difficult of the three major treasure lands for Lin Yuan to occupy was the Black Jade's Nest.</p><p></p><p>After all, it involved the enthronement of a Sovereign, and the Blazing Yang Sovereign was one of the most tyrannical among the Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two resource treasure lands? There would basically be no problems.</p><p></p><p>The guardian of the Azure Wave Cliff was one of the royal family's own people.</p><p></p><p>The three of them drank the fine wine and chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Meteor King then voluntarily handed over the grand formation and killing formation of the Azure Wave Cliff to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He then stood up and left through the spatial transmission array.</p><p></p><p>After the Crimson Meteor King disappeared, the Crimson Treasure King laughed beside him.</p><p></p><p>"That Crimson Meteor fellow, he's probably feeling very depressed."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Depressed? " Lin Yuan looked at the Crimson Treasure King, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"How can he not be depressed? Giving up such a first-class treasure land, if it wasn't for His Majesty's special arrangement, he, the Crimson Meteor King, probably wouldn't have handed it over so smoothly."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King said casually.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty has great prestige among the royal family?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think a first-class treasure land like this would fall into the hands of a royal family Sovereign if His Majesty didn't favor them?" The Crimson Treasure King asked.</p><p></p><p>"Probably not."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If His Majesty didn't favor them, to obtain a first-class treasure land, they would have to rely on their own strength. And even for a core royal family member who had grown to his limit, in terms of strength, he could at most contend with those Sovereign-ranked kings. In a real fight, he would definitely lose.</p><p></p><p>"So, His Majesty has tilted a lot of resources towards the royal family, and the powerful royal family members have to unconditionally support His Majesty's orders."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King said.</p><p></p><p>Those Sovereign-ranked kings, if they felt uncomfortable, might secretly obstruct the Emperor's edict.</p><p></p><p>But the royal family Sovereigns? They naturally dared not do so.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>To the lofty Progenitor of the Blazing Sun, the so-called royal family and Sovereigns were not much different.</p><p></p><p>They were all his bloodline descendants, which could be seen from the fact that the chance of possession was also open to the Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"What does His Majesty mean by this? Even if that Silver River has great potential, he hasn't truly broken through the Sovereign's shackles, but directly awarded him the Azure Wave Cliff? And that Black Jade's Nest? This is too much favoritism!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Meteor King walked out of the spatial transmission array and entered his own mansion, his expression not looking very good.</p><p></p><p>When he was enthroned, he was only awarded a fourth-class treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he still didn't have a true first-class treasure land to guard.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wave Cliff was only a temporary guardianship.</p><p></p><p>But now? Directly granting that Silver River two first-class treasure lands? Those were first-class treasure lands, and even though Sovereigns were strong, they still needed to establish great merits to receive such rewards. Royal family Sovereigns had a slightly easier time, but it was still very difficult to obtain an imperial decree.</p><p></p><p>"Since His Majesty is showing such favoritism, what can I do about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Meteor King sighed. From the perspective of the entire royal family, Lord Silver River had the hope of breaking through the Sovereign's shackles that constrained the royal family, so granting him two first-class treasure lands was not unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>But the treasure land he had painstakingly fought for was one of them, which made the Crimson Meteor King feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>The two first-class treasure lands were smoothly occupied, and as for the remaining second-class treasure land, there was no particular trouble either.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had the Yin-Yang Spiritual Bodies guard the Black Jade's Nest and the Azure Wave Cliff, and he split off a manifestation to guard the second-class treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The second-class treasure land was not as precious as the first-class ones, and the danger was not high, so a manifestation guarding it would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was danger, the manifestation only needed to hold out for a dozen breaths before Lin Yuan's true body could provide support.</p><p></p><p>"The three treasure lands, in addition to obtaining one-tenth of the output resources, will also grant merit rewards every ten thousand years of guardianship."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan returned to his manor, pondering.</p><p></p><p>The first-class treasure lands would grant one hundred merit rewards every ten thousand years of guardianship, and the second-class treasure land would grant ten merit rewards every ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, Lin Yuan would have two hundred and ten merit rewards accruing to him every ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and ten merit rewards, although it may not seem like much, would be a continuous and steady stream. Ten thousand years is just a short period of seclusion for a Great Sovereign or Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Many Great Sovereigns and Sovereigns calculate their seclusions in terms of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years of two hundred and ten merit rewards would amount to twenty-one thousand merit rewards in a million years, which could be considered a very impressive income.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful Sovereigns who fought for ancient kingdoms for billions of years didn't have two first-class treasure lands to guard.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to ponder the Chaotic Profundity Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and continued to ponder the Chaotic Profundity Diagram.</p><p></p><p>The three Chaotic Profundity Diagrams he had exchanged were sufficient for him to comprehend up to the third layer of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a year had gone by in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"The twenty-seventh diagram."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at a diagram shrouded in chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>Threads of chaotic qi constantly formed profundities, as if they were the ultimate truths of the heavens and earth, triggering many inspirations and insights in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Each thread of chaotic qi, though seemingly ordinary, was like the origin of the Dao. As the chaotic qi intertwined, it spawned countless mysteries.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary. Observing the Chaotic Profundity Diagram has greatly enhanced your understanding of the rules of chaos.】</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the twenty-seventh profundity diagram in front of Lin Yuan began to become clearer and more understandable.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were bright, as if he had parted the clouds and seen the clear sky.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

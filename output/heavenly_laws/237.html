            <p>Chapter 237 Galaxy Star Lord (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"It's you." ¬´-(¬Ø`v¬¥¬Ø)-¬´ ‚ûÖÔºôùê¨‚íΩùî≤ùìç.c‚ìÑùêå ¬ª-(¬Ø`v¬¥¬Ø)-¬ª</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the edge of the map, a star domain that had just been incorporated into the territory of human civilization, and made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization was constantly expanding outward, with large swathes of star systems being incorporated into its territory every day.</p><p></p><p>These star systems and domains, in order to integrate into human civilization as much as possible, needed a strong enough powerhouse to hold the fort and facilitate large-scale immigration.</p><p></p><p>And an eighth-stage evolution powerhouse would suffice.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of wars between the many races in the cosmic starry sky generally stopped at the eighth stage. Ninth-stage evolution powerhouses? Unless a large-scale war broke out, like the recent purge of the many races of the Insect Race Grand Alliance by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Then ninth-stage or even stronger evolution powerhouses were dispatched.</p><p></p><p>But this was a rare case, as the Insect Race wanted to monopolize an ultimate evolution path without a supreme existence.</p><p></p><p>Thus incurring the fury of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, the Insect Race also had self-awareness. Faced with the purge by human civilization, they did not put up fierce resistance, otherwise it would trigger a full-scale war between the two peak race grand alliances.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in wars of normal scale, eighth-stage combat power was already at the top. As for ninth and tenth stage? Even on large-scale alien battlefields, ninth and tenth stage powerhouses could not easily make a move.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization having eighth-stage evolution powerhouses hold the fort in frontier star domains was already showing enough importance.</p><p></p><p>"This star domain has twelve star systems in total. Preliminary surveys show that there are as many as 1.5 million life planets suitable for normal human habitation, and over 100 billion resource planets of various types."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully browsed the detailed information of this star domain. Since only preliminary surveys had been conducted, much of the information was not accurate, but it was enough for him to get a general idea.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the star domain he chose was about half larger than the Chiyan Star Domain, which could be seen from the number of life planets.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the neighboring alien races of this star domain did not include any peak races, so it was relatively safe.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, this star domain will be where I hold the fort for five hundred years or even longer."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed that star domain on the map from various angles.</p><p></p><p>"I'll apply directly."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan began to apply to the Wisdom Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Application approved."</p><p></p><p>"Next, staff will contact you to confirm your strength."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Wisdom Goddess came.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the Chiyan Lineage had issued an announcement stating that Lin Yuan had entered the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>But to go and hold the fort in a star domain, it had to be reconfirmed by the human civilization authorities.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they doubted the Chiyan Lineage was falsifying anything.</p><p></p><p>But it was a fixed procedure.</p><p></p><p>"Master told me to go see him before leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan received a message from the Chiyan Star Lord and felt a slight movement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Grand Peak Master had also gone to see the Chiyan Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>It should be that the Chiyan Star Lord had individually gifted some treasures to help deal with the many difficulties in the frontier star domains.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the frontier star domains was complex. Although on the surface human civilization had driven out the alien races, many problems still remained.</p><p></p><p>For example, how to deal with certain special lifeform races?</p><p></p><p>These special lifeform races had lived here since their birth.</p><p></p><p>They had no hostile behavior towards human civilization, so how should human civilization deal with them after occupying this star domain?</p><p></p><p>These were all difficult issues.</p><p></p><p>Special lifeform races had small populations, but that didn't mean they were easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>The staff from the human civilization authorities arrived at the Chiyan main star.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>There were two staff members, one tall and the other thin.</p><p></p><p>"This is the rule, I hope Thirteenth Peak Master will understand." The thin staff member said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Many eighth-stage evolution powerhouses would be quite resistant to this kind of behavior, but rules were rules. To wield the great power over a star domain, one naturally had to go through layers of procedures.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master, please activate the power of the world and use this crystal ball." The tall staff member took out a crystal ball and placed it in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The crystal ball was transparent in color, with specks of starlight inside, as if a starry sea was contained within.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, Lin Yuan activated a thread of world power, touched that crystal ball, and quickly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master's world power looks fine." The thin staff member's pupils slightly contracted. He glanced at the tall staff member beside him and hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had confirmed the strength of many eighth-stage evolution powerhouses and were considered knowledgeable.</p><p></p><p>But they were still shocked by how frighteningly high the quality of Thirteenth Peak Master's world power was.</p><p></p><p>It was nearly at the level of world power of a peak eighth-stage evolution powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The two staff members were shocked in their hearts. They had originally thought that since Thirteenth Peak Master was able to enter the eighth stage under a hundred years old.</p><p></p><p>His foundation must not be as stable as those evolution powerhouses who spent tens of thousands of years to enter the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that from a thread of Thirteenth Peak Master's world power, one could see that the stability of the world inside his body far surpassed that of ordinary newly advanced eighth-stage evolution powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master, please drip a drop of blood into here." The tall staff member took out a metal bowl and placed it in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>To confirm whether an evolution powerhouse had reached the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>It needed to be looked at from three aspects.</p><p></p><p>First was world power.</p><p></p><p>Second was physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Third was soul strength.</p><p></p><p>World power alone could not determine if one was definitely an eighth-stage evolution powerhouse. A small number of seventh-stage evolution powerhouses could open up an inner world before reaching the peak of the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had even opened up his inner world at the peak of the sixth stage, just before breaking through to the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>Only by combining it with physical strength and soul strength could it be determined whether an evolution powerhouse had entered the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan squeezed out a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>It dripped into the metal bowl. After the thin staff member confirmed it, Lin Yuan moved his mind and that drop of blood vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the physical divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", Lin Yuan had absolute control over every drop of his blood.</p><p></p><p>After verifying the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then verified his own soul power.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The two staff members got confirmation.</p><p></p><p>They even speculated during the confirmation process that Thirteenth Peak Master's strength was far beyond what an ordinary eighth-stage evolution powerhouse could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>"We have finished confirming."</p><p></p><p>The two staff members said with some respect.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Peak Master decided on a name for the star domain he wants to hold the fort in?" The thin staff member asked with some curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"A name?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and said, "I've already thought of one."</p><p></p><p>"What is it called?" The thin staff member asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't really a secret. The name of a star domain would have to be made public sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>"It will be called 'Galaxy</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it 'Galaxy'," Lin Yuan said calmly, but his voice carried a deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Domain?" </p><p></p><p>"Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>The two staff members were unsure of the meaning behind this name, but they smiled and congratulated him, saying, "Then congratulations to the Galaxy Star Lord on his inauguration."</p><p></p><p>With the star domain named "Galaxy", Lin Yuan naturally became the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord," Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered.</p><p></p><p>He named that star domain Galaxy to commemorate the Milky Way galaxy where Earth was located before he traversed to this vast universe.</p><p></p><p>After the two staff members left, in less than a minute, Lin Yuan received confirmation from the Wisdom Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, your application for the star domain has passed the review," the Wisdom Goddess' solemn and cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What about the main star configuration?" Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the main star, the most core area of a star domain, such as the Chiron Main Star of the Chiron Star Domain. </p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, the so-called main star configuration is choosing which level of resources to use to transform the main star," the Wisdom Goddess explained.</p><p></p><p>"As a newly incorporated star domain, the human civilization officially provides a free C-level transformation. Once you confirm the main star, specialized evolvers will go to transform it, giving it basic combat capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Main Star, as the most prosperous area of the Chiron Star Domain, even Level 8 Evolvers dared not act recklessly there. </p><p></p><p>What was it relying on?</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, not entirely.</p><p></p><p>The Chiron Star Lord spent most of his time in seclusion, and aside from matters on the thirteen mountain peaks, he was too lazy to manage other areas.</p><p></p><p>What usually managed the Chiron Main Star were the planetary defense systems and other warfare technological weapons.</p><p></p><p>The planetary defense systems on the Chiron Main Star were enough to easily suppress ordinary Level 8 Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"What level of planetary defense system does a C-level transformation belong to?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"It can suppress all Level 6 powerhouses and most Level 7 powerhouses," the Wisdom Goddess replied.</p><p></p><p>"What about higher-level transformations?" Lin Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"B-level transformation can suppress all Level 7 powerhouses and most Level 8 powerhouses. It requires the Star Lord to pay an additional 100,000 cubic universal crystals," the Wisdom Goddess' voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"A-level transformation can suppress almost all Level 8 Evolvers, except for Level 8 Invincibles. It requires the Star Lord to pay an additional 1 million cubic universal crystals."</p><p></p><p>"So expensive?" Lin Yuan clicked his tongue. Even a B-level transformation required 100,000 universal crystals. What did this mean? It was equivalent to the total wealth of a peak Level 8 Evolver, including the value of treasures and weapons, adding up to only this amount.</p><p></p><p>Let alone an A-level transformation.</p><p></p><p>"The main star of a star domain is the future economic and political center of this star domain. There absolutely cannot be any security risks," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As long as the main star was well-managed, it would be a money tree in the future. How much profit could the Chiron Main Star generate for the Chiron Star Lord every day by gathering a large number of merchants from surrounding star domains?</p><p></p><p>"I choose B-level transformation," Lin Yuan said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was B-level or A-level transformation, they were both "benefits" given by human civilization to the various Star Lords.</p><p></p><p>A planetary defense system capable of suppressing most Level 8 powerhouses, if purchased privately, would cost hundreds of thousands of cubic universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>"B-level transformation requires 100,000 cubic universal crystals. Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, please confirm," the Wisdom Goddess' voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Confirm," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, 100,000 cubic universal crystals were deducted from his account balance.</p><p></p><p>"It was deducted so quickly?" Lin Yuan felt a little heartache. If the 100,000 cubic universal crystals stayed in his account a little longer, it would have generated several million civilization coins in interest.</p><p></p><p>"This money really can't withstand spending," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>After the Level 8 Ceremony, Lin Yuan's total wealth had once reached nearly 200,000 cubic universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>Now it had shrunk by more than half in one go.</p><p></p><p>"I can earn it back in the future," Lin Yuan comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are no security issues with the main star, it will definitely become the economic center of a star domain. By then, how can I be afraid of not being able to recoup the investment?"</p><p></p><p>These were all early-stage investments. If he had a choice, Lin Yuan even wanted to choose A-level transformation.</p><p></p><p>After choosing the star domain application was approved, Lin Yuan did not return to the hall.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he directly headed to the crimson palace where the Chiron Star Lord was in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Master," even though Lin Yuan had now entered Level 8, when facing the Chiron Star Lord, he still felt a sense of being unable to match him.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that although Lin Yuan had just entered Level 8, relying on the world within his body, he was capable of fighting against late-stage and even peak Level 8 Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a Level 8 Invincible? Mastering a kind of universal power?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Every Level 8 Invincible had mastered a power that transcended Level 8.</p><p></p><p>This power was also known as "Universal Power".</p><p></p><p>Level 8 Invincibles were essentially still at the fourth stage of Level 8, which was Level 8 Extreme.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of combat power, Level 8 Invincibles could almost crush Level 8 Extremes. A million years ago, the Level 8 Invincible Black Abyss Qingyu of the Black Abyss Clan killed the late-stage Level 8 Evolver Ou Yin with a single soul attack.</p><p></p><p>Each Level 8 Invincible was irreplicable, and the universal powers they mastered were all different.</p><p></p><p>"Good disciple, have you chosen the star domain?" The Chiron Star Lord looked at Lin Yuan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Among his thirteen disciples, Lin Yuan was the one who gave him the least trouble and currently had the highest achievements.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that in the future, Lin Yuan would still have the highest achievements.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have chosen," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a map and marked that area of the star domain.</p><p></p><p>"There, huh," the Chiron Star Lord nodded and said, "It's not bad."</p><p></p><p>"When heading to the frontier star domains, you must be careful in all matters. By the way, you should have met the Supremes, right?" The Chiron Star Lord suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>If it was only a Level 7 under a hundred years old, there was a high possibility that the Supremes would not pay attention. But for a Level 8 under a hundred years old, the Chiron Star Lord could almost be certain that it would definitely attract the attention of the Supremes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the one who met me was Supreme Xia Qin," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this. How could the top twenty or top ten peerless genius evolvers in the history of human civilization not have met the Supremes?</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Xia Qin... He is known for his combat power among the Supremes of our human civilization," the Chiron Star Lord said.</p><p></p><p>There were nine Supremes in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Each Supreme excelled in different aspects.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, the Supremes had no shortcomings, but compared to other Supremes, their areas of advantage differed.</p><p></p><p>For example, although Supreme Yu Die was not good at direct combat, the evolution path she was on could construct an illusory universe.</p><p></p><p>The current virtual world of human civilization came from the "Authority" of Supreme Yu Die, which could almost 100% replicate everything in the universe, even simulating the rules.</p><p></p><p>The importance of Supreme Yu Die was in no way inferior to Supreme Xia Qin.</p>

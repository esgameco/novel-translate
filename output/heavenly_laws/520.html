        <h1>Chapter 520</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tower of Martial Evolution.</p><p></p><p>Massive and majestic, standing ten light-years tall, it towered in the core heartland of human civilization, worshipped day and night by countless lives.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in the deepest part of the tower. This was a vast realm, with eighteen extraordinary trees planted not far away, their branches swaying gently in the breeze.</p><p></p><p>These eighteen extraordinary trees absorbed and exhaled chaotic qi, emanating an aura of pressure no weaker than any peak Path-Breaking realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"These extraordinary trees can directly absorb chaotic qi without needing to refine or purify it, because they have special corresponding structures internally," Lin Yuan thought, as many flashes of insight burst forth in his mind.</p><p></p><p>As early as the 11th level, when he obtained these eighteen Sovereign-realm extraordinary trees, Lin Yuan had been very curious about their ability to directly absorb and exhale chaotic qi, and had conducted multiple studies.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan crossed into the 12th level, these studies finally perfected the last part, and all the pieces came together to form a complete and perfected secret technique.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. By observing the extraordinary trees absorb and exhale chaotic qi, you have comprehended a secret technique to directly absorb chaotic qi]</p><p></p><p>A secret technique took shape in Lin Yuan's mind. At its essence, this technique involved making micro-adjustments to the internal world, allowing it to achieve an effect similar to how the extraordinary trees absorbed and exhaled chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally done." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. The secret technique increased Lin Yuan's utilization and absorption of chaotic qi, making him no longer overly reliant on chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>The internal universes of Path-Breaking realm experts could also absorb chaotic qi, but it required multiple steps. This was fine under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>But in critical moments, such as battling enemies, where was the time for slowly absorbing chaotic qi? This was where the effectiveness of chaos stones became apparent.</p><p></p><p>Chaos stones refined by Chaos Venerable himself contained extremely pure chaotic qi internally, which could be directly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan could also achieve a similar feat, directly absorbing chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>"The greatest benefit of this secret technique for me is the understanding of chaotic qi," Lin Yuan pondered thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic qi was an energy found everywhere in the chaotic void, the foundation of everything. However, because it was so common, it was easily overlooked by 12th level experts.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, Mingchuan City.</p><p></p><p>Inside an inn.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his physical aura gradually stabilizing.</p><p></p><p>"With my current utilization of chaotic qi, the avatar bodies I can condense are enough to make my combat power fully reach the peak of the Path-Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when suppressing dozens of 12th level alien race members in the universe, the dozens of avatars Lin Yuan condensed only had power close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Roughly equivalent to the level of Xuanyuan Supreme Being and Mother Queen of Myriad Transformations, or perhaps slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>But now, it had fully reached the peak of the Path-Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that being close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm and actually being at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm were two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Supreme Being and Mother Queen of Myriad Transformations had been close to the peak of the Path-Breaking realm for a long time, but before the great destruction of this universe, whether they could cross into the peak of the Path-Breaking realm was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Most likely, they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>The two Ultimate beings of the Calamity Race were at the peak of the Path-Breaking realm because they had cultivated for more than one universe era.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, it was very difficult for even hundreds or thousands of universe eras to produce a peak Path-Breaking realm expert within the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to be careful, this isn't the universe after all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned his surroundings, his excited state of mind quickly calming down.</p><p></p><p>In the universe, Lin Yuan was absolutely invincible, sweeping through everything. But on this Ancient Ming Chaos Continent? Forget about Path-Breaking realm peak avatars, even his true body at a level comparable to the Sovereign realm didn't dare to be too reckless.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign realm experts were indeed considered strong in the chaotic void, but this was the Chaos Continent, a Chaos Continent presided over by Chaos Venerable, gathering a large number of 12th level lives from the vast surrounding areas. Path-Breaking realm experts were everywhere, and there were quite a few Sovereign realm experts as well.</p><p></p><p>There were even occasional passing Chaos realm beings.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Someone's looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed as he looked outside the inn.</p><p></p><p>"I just arrived on this Chaos Continent and have been cultivating bitterly here. Who would be looking for me?" Lin Yuan was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan got up and went to another area.</p><p></p><p>The inn was like a small world, divided into different areas.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, sir." The one seeking Lin Yuan was a woman with a gentle gaze and respectful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately recognized that she was an 11th level life form. The emblem on her sleeve indicated she was under Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, meaning this woman was working for Venerable Ancient Ming.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she definitely wasn't directly under Venerable Ancient Ming, but at least she was working for him.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to sir, in half a year, it will be the 'Thousand Treasures Convention' of our Mingchuan City. At that time, many rare treasures that are usually hard to come by will appear. I have been ordered by the city lord to present to you a 'Thousand Treasures Catalog', which records the treasures that will be sold at this 'Thousand Treasures Convention'."</p><p></p><p>The woman took out a book.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged as he took the book.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall take my leave." The woman immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped through the many treasures recorded in the 'Thousand Treasures Catalog'.</p><p></p><p>The reason Mingchuan City gave him this 'Thousand Treasures Catalog' was naturally to give Lin Yuan ample time to prepare and gather chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>Knowing in advance what treasures would appear at the Thousand Treasures Convention, if there was something he desperately wanted, he could naturally make preparations in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Mingchuan City's 'Thousand Treasures Convention' is backed by Venerable Ancient Ming, so the credibility is very reliable. Moreover, the treasures that appear each time are quite extraordinary, attracting many powerful beings from the surrounding chaotic void to participate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had intelligence information from 'Cang Wei Yang' and was quite familiar with the 'Thousand Treasures Convention'.</p><p></p><p>"This Thousand Treasures Convention has 8,633 treasures, all of very good quality."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped through.</p><p></p><p>"5,311 Path-Breaking realm treasures, 1,476 Sovereign realm treasures, and even 6 Chaos realm treasures? As for the rest, they are some rare flowers and fruits, special treasures, special materials, and so on."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed that just the treasures presented at one 'Thousand Treasures Convention' far exceeded the entire wealth of 'Cang Wei Yang', a peak Sovereign realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"Time Crystal: Contains concentrated time power. After use, it greatly increases the speed of comprehending time laws, limited to those below the seventh level of time law comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"Starting price: 800 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>"Directly increasing the speed of law comprehension? That's rare." Lin Yuan looked carefully, "But it's of no use to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of time laws had long reached the ninth level, just one step away from evolving into the Great Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>Time law was a pillar law, much simpler to comprehend than the fusion of space-time law. Lin Yuan had been at the ninth level of time law comprehension for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-colored Thunder Stone: A strange stone that fell from the Chaos Thunder Pool, containing the power of seven-colored thunder internally. It has great benefits for 12th level beings who follow the path of thunder."</p><p></p><p>"Starting price: 10,000 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>There were many peculiar places in the chaotic void that required numerous conditions to enter.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For example, the Chaos Lightning Pool?</p><p></p><p>This place is filled with endless destructive lightning intent. Only Chaos Venerables who follow the lightning path can enter.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, every long era, the Chaos Lightning Pool drops some stones, which are the Seven-Colored Lightning Stones.</p><p></p><p>Seven-Colored Lightning Stones contain part of the essence of the Chaos Lightning Pool. They can be considered the source of lightning and are very beneficial for comprehending the lightning dao.</p><p></p><p>"The lightning dao." Lin Yuan pondered for a while. He currently had no urgent desire for the lightning dao.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand chaos stones is equivalent to the entire fortune of an ordinary Sovereign realm expert." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, Seven-Colored Lightning Stones were priceless and unobtainable at other times even if one wanted to buy them, so it was normal for them to be a bit expensive.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flipped through the 'Thousand Treasures Catalog', many treasures making him quite tempted, until he saw a certain item.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was a golden box, with a mottled surface, likely having experienced countless years.</p><p></p><p>In the lower left corner of the golden box was engraved a complex pattern. When Lin Yuan saw this pattern, he actually felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the mark of the Primordial Yellow lineage?" Lin Yuan's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>As the inheritor of the Primordial Yellow Secret Realm and disciple of His Majesty the Primordial Emperor, he naturally had some understanding of the Primordial Yellow lineage's mark.</p><p></p><p>"This box, does it originate from the Primordial Yellow lineage?" Lin Yuan speculated inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked at the 'Thousand Treasures Meeting's' introduction of this golden box.</p><p></p><p>"Unknown Box: Contains Chaos realm level energy fluctuations, origin unknown, effects unknown."</p><p></p><p>"Starting price: 30,000 chaos stones."</p><p></p><p>The golden box had been in Mingchuan City for some time. Including Venerable Gu Ming, no one could determine the box's true origins.</p><p></p><p>But just based on the Chaos realm level energy fluctuations inside the box, it was determined to be a Chaos realm level treasure, so the price was set at 30,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this price was considered very low among Chaos realm level treasures. Any Chaos realm secret treasure could sell for 50,000 chaos stones, 100,000 chaos stones or even higher.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Venerable Gu Ming doesn't know the true origins of this box at 30,000 chaos stones." Lin Yuan thought to himself. His Majesty the Primordial Emperor was an unparalleled Great Saint after all.</p><p></p><p>How could a treasure left behind by the lineage of an unparalleled Great Saint be worth only 30,000 chaos stones?</p><p></p><p>This was actually quite normal. His Majesty the Primordial Emperor existed countless universe eras ago. Not to mention now, even in the era of the owner of the Magic Jade Tower,</p><p></p><p>Information about His Majesty the Primordial Emperor was already extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Magic Jade Tower also only learned about the existence of His Majesty the Primordial Emperor from some ruins.</p><p></p><p>"30,000 chaos stones, it's worth competing for."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Other 12th level experts, including Venerable Gu Ming, couldn't figure out what the golden box was because they weren't cultivators of the Primordial Emperor's lineage.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>He could certainly give it a try.</p><p></p><p>A treasure left behind by the Primordial Yellow lineage that has survived until now must be extraordinary. Its true value would definitely far exceed 30,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>Even slightly ordinary treasures would have been worn away over the long years.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Gu Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Gu Ming suddenly opened his eyes, his expression quite heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Ming, what's wrong? Have you found out where the crisis is coming from?" the Chaos Dragon Beast beside him immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, he had foreseen an impending crisis, so he immediately informed Venerable Gu Ming of the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"I've found out." Venerable Gu Ming nodded, the heaviness on his face not diminishing at all.</p><p></p><p>"What is it because of?" the Chaos Dragon Beast inquired.</p><p></p><p>"The battle between Great Saint Shadow Demon and Great Saint Nine Phoenix will spread to this area." Venerable Gu Ming said.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint Shadow Demon and Great Saint Nine Phoenix" The Chaos Dragon Beast was shocked inwardly.</p><p></p><p>These two were renowned Great Saints. From the moment they entered the Chaos realm, they had been mortal enemies, competing all the way, almost simultaneously crossing into the Great Saint realm.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming Chaos Great Saints, these two powerhouses had engaged in a long era of battles and confrontations, affecting vast areas.</p><p></p><p>This time, when Venerable Gu Ming investigated the source of danger nearby, he learned from a friend that the battle between these two Great Saints was very likely to pass through the area of the Gu Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Even just the aftershocks of a battle between two Chaos Great Saints would plunge the Gu Ming Chaos Continent into turmoil. Even beings close to the Chaos realm like the Chaos Dragon Beast would be severely injured by this.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Chaos Dragon Beast could move and hide. In areas where Great Saint Shadow Demon and Great Saint Nine Phoenix battled, everything would collapse and be destroyed. Even universes nurtured by the Chaos Void would prematurely enter the stage of great destruction because of this.</p><p></p><p>Great Saint Shadow Demon and Great Saint Nine Phoenix had battled for tens of universe eras, causing countless universes to prematurely enter great destruction.</p><p></p><p>"We're really unlucky to be right in the range of the two Great Saints' upcoming battle." Venerable Gu Ming of the Chaos was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>The gap between ordinary Chaos Venerables and Chaos Great Saints was very, very large. It was very difficult for a Chaos Great Saint to kill a Chaos Venerable, meaning it was very difficult to completely kill a Chaos Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Venerables had many life-saving methods after all.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, very unlucky."</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Dragon Beast also understood and sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Void was boundless. Although the impact range of the two Great Saints' battle was very wide, affecting tens or hundreds of thousands of universes to prematurely enter great destruction,</p><p></p><p>In reality, relative to the entire Chaos Void, it was still insignificant. This was also why Great Saints of the same level hadn't intervened to stop the two Great Saints' battle until now.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Ming, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Dragon Beast looked at Venerable Gu Ming. Logically, one should stay as far away as possible from a battle between two Great Saints. Who knows if one might end up in the center of the Great Saints' battle aftershocks?</p><p></p><p>"I plan to activate the Chaos Continent and move as far away as possible."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Gu Ming of the Chaos said. Actually, if they abandoned the Chaos Continent now and fled directly, there probably wouldn't be any danger.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaos Continent was the result of nearly a hundred universe eras of effort by Venerable Gu Ming, and he was unwilling to give it up so easily.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Ming Chaos Continent was as large as hundreds of universes. Venerable Gu Ming's internal universe couldn't accommodate it.</p><p></p><p>So he could only directly activate the Chaos Continent to move, in order to avoid the range covered by the aftershocks of the two Great Saints' upcoming battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the movement speed of a Chaos Continent would certainly be far inferior to Venerable Gu Ming fleeing by himself, but it was still a solution.</p><p></p><p>Even if they ultimately failed to escape the range covered by the Great Saints' battle aftershocks, at least they would be far from where the aftershocks were strongest, and the chances of withstanding it would be much higher.</p><p></p><p>"This is the only way." The Chaos Dragon Beast nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This area will face destruction." Venerable Gu Ming said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>As a Chaos Venerable, he still had the ability to avoid danger, but the numerous universes nearby, as well as the countless lives within those universes, wouldn't be so lucky.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

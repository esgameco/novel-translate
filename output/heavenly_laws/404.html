        <h1>Chapter 404</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Now the popularity of the Martial Dao evolution path has even surpassed the nine supreme evolution paths."</p><p></p><p>Several days later, on the main star of the galaxy. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually glanced at the 'updates' to the Martial Dao evolution path and was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of the Stellar Era, the supreme evolution paths had always been the most popular evolution paths in human civilization. </p><p></p><p>They represented the ultimate of a certain evolution path, worshipped by countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For the vast majority of cultivators, unless they had no choice, they would definitely prioritize cultivating the supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>The only shortcoming of the supreme evolution paths was that the upper limit was capped at the eleventh stage, with no chance to breakthrough to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>But what did that matter? The eleventh stage was already an almost unimaginable goal for most cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other evolution paths, each level of the supreme evolution paths was extremely complete, even perfect.</p><p></p><p>If two cultivators of the same stage fought, with all other means, abilities and foundations being equal, the one cultivating a supreme evolution path would have an edge.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the popularity of the nine supreme evolution paths in human civilization was unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>It was just that now, Lin Yuan clearly felt that the frequency of discussions about the Martial Dao evolution path on the virtual network had surpassed the nine supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>This didn't mean that the Martial Dao evolution path had surpassed the supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Rather, for the first time in over two hundred million years, an evolution path at the tenth stage had reached a level second only to the supreme evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>If a tenth stage could crush an eleventh stage, what would happen when the Martial Dao evolution path reached the eleventh stage?</p><p></p><p>This led to countless cultivators in human civilization speculating that the Martial Dao evolution path might become the tenth supreme evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth supreme evolution path?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. He had no certainty of crossing into the ultimate realm. Once he failed, even with the protection of the Realm Gate, he didn't know if he could survive.</p><p></p><p>"The number of cultivators on the Martial Dao evolution path has begun to surge dramatically these past few days."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pulled up the specific data on the Martial Dao evolution path and studied it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"First Stage Scripture: 2,680,000,000,000,000,000."  </p><p>"Second Stage Scripture: 832,000,000,000,000."</p><p>"Third Stage Scripture: 4,000,000,000,000." </p><p>"Fourth Stage Scripture: 1,200,000,000,000."</p><p>"Fifth Stage Scripture: 5,300,000,000."</p><p>"Sixth Stage Scripture: 86,000,000."  </p><p>"Seventh Stage Scripture: 17,000,000."</p><p>"Eighth Stage Scripture: 0."</p><p></p><p>"It's been over a hundred years, yet not a single Martial Dao cultivator has crossed into the eighth stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to over a hundred years ago, the number of cultivators on the first and fourth stages of the Martial Dao evolution path had increased by thousands to tens of thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>The number of cultivators from the fifth to seventh stages had also increased by hundreds to thousands of times.</p><p></p><p>But at least for now, there were no eighth stage Martial Dao cultivators registered.</p><p></p><p>"The time is still too short."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head. The Martial Dao evolution path had only been uploaded for less than five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>No matter how great the potential, it couldn't immediately translate into high-stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The evolution of life was a long process, even with a specific evolution path as guidance.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll need to spend some time producing videos analyzing the path from the seventh stage peak to the eighth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ultimate Leap didn't explicitly state the requirement for the number of high-stage cultivators on one's evolution path, the more the better.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the progenitor of the Martial Dao evolution path, Lin Yuan didn't need to worry about future Martial Dao cultivators threatening him. Any Martial Dao cultivator, regardless of realm or bloodline, would naturally be suppressed by him.</p><p></p><p>"In over a hundred years, the income share from the Martial Dao evolution path has exceeded six trillion cosmic crystals."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. A few hundred years ago, he was still worried about thousands or tens of thousands of cosmic crystals. Now in the blink of an eye, his net worth had skyrocketed to the point of being calculated in billions of cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"However, while the income is high, the cultivation expenses are also not low."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently. So far, his main cultivation expense came from the 'Xuan Huang Body', one of the three great Dharma protector secret arts of the Xuan Huang lineage.</p><p></p><p>The 'Xuan Huang Body' was a physical body cultivation method accumulated from boundless resources. Coupled with Lin Yuan's monstrous physical foundation, amplified by the mystical gourd, the Eternal Spring, Martial Dao itself, and the infusion of primordial chaos, it led to Lin Yuan's current physical strength being so formidable that even the slightest improvement required an immense price.</p><p></p><p>And the improvement to the physical body from the 'Xuan Huang Body' depended on the original strength of the physical body, ultimately causing the cost of cultivating this secret art to exceed Lin Yuan's expectations multiple times.</p><p></p><p>After all, when Lin Yuan first obtained this secret art, he hadn't anticipated that his physical foundation would be greatly enhanced again under the infusion of primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>"I can vaguely sense the life auras of those cultivating the Martial Dao evolution path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes and carefully sensed it.  </p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was at the center, surrounded by darkness in all directions, then at this moment, points of light as faint as fireflies emerged. Individually they seemed insignificant, but the sheer number was vast, like a sea of stars igniting.</p><p></p><p>"Will these become the 'boost' for my Ultimate Leap?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered. These starry points were not limited to the main universe, but also came from extremely distant and blurred places that even Lin Yuan, as the Martial Dao's creator, could not pinpoint the coordinates of. They must be the life auras of Martial Dao cultivators from other dimensions he had spread it to during his past travels.</p><p></p><p>"Spreading one's own evolution path, allowing more beings to cultivate it, and ultimately having it feed back to oneself, propelling the Ultimate Leap...this method is simply inconceivable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought. This feedback was not like the power of faith, but came from the evolution path itself, essentially without any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which powerful being created this method of cultivation? An existence approaching the perfect time-life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious. Eons ago, there was no concept of spreading one's own evolution path. To charge towards the ultimate realm, one could only rely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Xuanhuang Emperor had never widely spread the Xuanhuang evolution path, as its threshold was too high to spread indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"That's about it."</p><p>"Time to advance to a ninth-rank citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at his remaining merit points, over 5.2 billion. Of that, 5 billion merit points were the reward for uploading the tenth stage scripture of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The remaining over 200 million merit points were what Lin Yuan had accumulated previously, including leftovers from uploading the ninth stage scripture.</p><p></p><p>"To advance from an eighth-rank to a ninth-rank citizen requires 1 billion merit points, equivalent to the value of ten entry-level twelfth-grade cosmic treasures."</p><p></p><p>After a moment's thought, Lin Yuan chose to increase his citizen rank.</p><p></p><p>Every time he had advanced his citizen rank in the past, he had gained far more value than just the merit points consumed.</p><p></p><p>The higher the citizen rank, in addition to privileges, more importantly it allowed influence over some decisions in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yuan was now the Chief Speaker of the Northern Frozen Star Alliance, the highest authority across hundreds or thousands of star domains. A single thought from him could decide human civilization's policies towards neighboring alien races.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary tribes, weak tribes, or nearby alien tribes within the Northern Frozen Star Alliance all had to heed Lin Yuan's will.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom Goddess."</p><p>"I wish to advance to a ninth-rank citizen now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately contacted the Wisdom Goddess and made his request to increase his citizen rank.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, over 5 billion of Lin Yuan's merit points were reduced by 1 billion.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on Lin Yuan's personal information page, the entry for citizen rank silently changed from eighth to ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>A ninth-rank citizen.</p><p>A ninth-rank citizen of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This was a weight that any single star domain or even star alliance would find difficult to bear.</p><p></p><p>Even among the many eleventh-stage cultivators of human civilization, most were not ninth-rank citizens.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful an eleventh-stage cultivator was, accumulating 1 billion merit points still required an immense price.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tenth-stage cultivator Xuanyuan Fan from the Xuanyuan clan had fought on the alien battlefields for one to two hundred million years, yet had only accumulated 20 million merit points in the end.</p><p></p><p>In order to gain the opportunity to undergo the brutal enlightenment on the Black Planet, the clan had borrowed 80 million merit points from human civilization in the clan's name, gathering 100 million merit points to complete the transaction with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>For such an ancient tenth-stage cultivator like Xuanyuan Fan...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It's always like this. Even if the 11th tier evolved ones accumulate more merit points, the gap will not be too large.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the vast majority of evolved ones will inevitably spend some merit points during the accumulation process. </p><p></p><p>For example, Xuanyuan Fan spent the two million merit points he had accumulated in advance in order to increase his chances of crossing into the 11th tier.</p><p></p><p>After all, merit points are extremely valuable in human civilization and can be exchanged for unimaginable inherited resources.</p><p></p><p>It's very rare for someone like Lin Yuan to save every single merit point to upgrade their citizen level.</p><p></p><p>Using merit points to upgrade citizen levels is indeed the most valuable approach, but the most valuable does not mean the highest short-term return.</p><p></p><p>Rustle rustle.</p><p></p><p>Right after Lin Yuan successfully advanced to the 9th level citizen,</p><p></p><p>A flurry of "emails" from the central star domain of human civilization were sent over.</p><p></p><p>Besides congratulating Lin Yuan, these "emails" introduced the many privileges and treatments for 9th level citizens.</p><p></p><p>"Privileges and treatments for 9th level citizens"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan browsed through the "emails" one by one.</p><p></p><p>First was the regular treatment - he would receive a 9th tier evolutionary elixir.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the 6th level citizen, every citizen level upgrade would grant a corresponding evolutionary elixir.</p><p></p><p>Even the lowest 6th tier evolutionary elixir was considered a special resource that could not be purchased with any amount of cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>Only merit points could be used to exchange for them. A 6th tier evolutionary elixir required 10,000 merit points.</p><p></p><p>A 7th tier required 100,000 merit points.  </p><p>An 8th tier required 1 million merit points.</p><p>A 9th tier required 10 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, to exchange for evolutionary elixirs, one needed the corresponding authority. Even if lower-level citizens had enough merit points, they could not make the exchange.</p><p></p><p>"Participation rights in the Human Civilization Central Council." Lin Yuan glanced at the second privilege.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization Central Council was a key conference that determined the future direction of the entire human civilization. At that time, even the strongest beings would descend their consciousness to participate, and the three Goddesses would pay close attention.</p><p></p><p>To participate in such a high-level council, one needed to be at least a 9th level citizen.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no interest in the council. This privilege was invaluable to some citizens skilled at maneuvering, but to Lin Yuan, it was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Gifted three chances to bathe in the Eternal Spring?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze paused on a certain benefit.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Spring was one of the twelve stellar wonders of human civilization. Any who bathed in it could extend their lifespan by hundreds of thousands of years without any side effects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, during the bathing period, one's physical body would slowly metamorphose, raising the upper limit of their potential.</p><p></p><p>Once, a powerful alien being was willing to trade a piece of 11th tier supreme wonder to the human civilization in exchange for one chance to bathe in the Eternal Spring for their descendant.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization rejected the offer.</p><p></p><p>A piece of 11th tier supreme wonder was worth hundreds of millions of merit points.</p><p></p><p>It was a very sincere offer.</p><p></p><p>However, the human civilization's refusal was not because the 11th tier supreme wonder was insufficient, but due to other considerations.</p><p></p><p>Within the human civilization, besides the one chance to bathe in the spring after advancing to the 9th tier, additional chances cost 500 million merit points each.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had advanced to the 9th level citizen, the three gifted chances to bathe in the Eternal Spring were equivalent to 1.5 billion merit points.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity for my two primordial spirits to take a dip."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that such chances to raise the upper limits of one's physical body were rare.</p><p></p><p>"Also get discounts for exchanges in the civilization's treasury."</p><p></p><p>"Civilization currency, cosmic crystals exchange at 60% discount."  </p><p></p><p>"Merit points exchange at 90% discount."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>The so-called civilization currency and cosmic crystal exchanges referred to exchanging for regular resources and strategic resources in the human civilization's treasury.</p><p></p><p>They could be obtained through civilization currency or cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was an 8th level citizen, he also enjoyed a corresponding discount, but it was 80% at the time.</p><p></p><p>Now as a 9th level citizen, he could enjoy a direct 60% discount for exchanges, a reduction of two levels. Who knew how many cosmic crystals this would help Lin Yuan save.</p><p></p><p>As for the merit point exchange discount...</p><p></p><p>The merit point exchanges in the human civilization's treasury were all restricted resources, some not even open to the public.</p><p></p><p>This included many of the twelve stellar wonders, many special inheritance grounds, as well as places like the Black Planet that were useful for comprehending and fusing rules.</p><p></p><p>Although the merit point exchange was only a 90% discount, the discount applied to merit points. The wonders and treasures that could be exchanged were extremely rare throughout the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>"90% discount. If I exchange 100 billion merit points worth of wonders and treasures, I can recoup the merit points spent on advancing to the 9th level citizen."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. This was the effect of upgrading one's citizen level - the short-term gains might not be the greatest, but extending the time frame, the benefits would be far-reaching.</p><p></p><p>There were thousands of privileges and treatments for advancing to the 9th level citizen.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly browsed through them. Most were enhanced versions of the 8th level, while the remaining new privileges could also help him,</p><p></p><p>At the very least saving him trouble in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The merit points needed to advance to the 10th level citizen..."</p><p></p><p>After viewing the various privileges, Lin Yuan looked at the requirements for the 10th level citizen.</p><p></p><p>"500 billion merit points?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Lin Yuan's mouth twitched slightly. Even if he exchanged all the wonders obtained from the Two Worlds Traveler journey, it would be far from enough for such an enormous amount of merit points.</p><p></p><p>"Currently in the human civilization, besides the nine strongest beings, there probably aren't many 10th level citizens or higher, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Even for an 11th tier evolved one, accumulating 500 billion merit points was almost an impossible feat,</p><p></p><p>Unless they slaughtered their way through a major alien battlefield. But even the peak Four Celestial Kings would find that extremely difficult, as the strongest beings would intervene at any time.</p><p></p><p>And even if the strongest did not act, those peak 11th tier evolved ones of the apex tribes, wielding weapons of the strongest, would not be easy to deal with. If one couldn't defeat them, then there would be five or ten.</p><p></p><p>Who could withstand that?</p><p></p><p>The current 10th level citizens of the human civilization were mostly 11th tier evolved scholars or those citizens from before the Starsea Era who made tremendous contributions during their long hibernation.</p><p></p><p>"Purchase resources to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body Scripture."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the human civilization's treasury and began selecting items.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Body Scripture was one of the three great dharma protections of the Xuanhuang lineage, divided into four levels: entry, minor attainment, major attainment, and perfect attainment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these four levels corresponded to each tier.</p><p></p><p>At the 9th tier, if one cultivated the Xuanhuang Body Scripture to the perfect attainment level, upon advancing to the 10th tier and undergoing a major life level leap, the Xuanhuang Body Scripture would fall to the major or even minor attainment level.</p><p></p><p>In theory, if a 12th tier ultimate being could cultivate the Xuanhuang Body Scripture to the perfect level of that tier, they could easily withstand a universal cataclysm.</p><p></p><p>It's important to know that during a universal cataclysm when everything collapses, even the strongest beings could only survive halfway at most.</p><p></p><p>Only those strongest beings who had experienced a universal cataclysm could be considered truly free.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had cultivated the Xuanhuang Body Scripture to the major attainment level and was one step away from perfection.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's foundational physical body strength, the perfect 10th tier Xuanhuang Body Scripture would make his physique so powerful that it could suppress rules. His physical body alone could match the second level of 11th tier evolved ones.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p></p><p>After selecting for a while, Lin Yuan had spent around 2 trillion cosmic crystals. With the 9th level citizen's 60% discount privilege, he only paid 1.2 trillion cosmic crystals in the end.</p><p></p><p>Directly saving 800 billion cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Quite an expense."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the Xuanhuang Body Scripture was expensive.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Body Scripture did have high resource demands, but just for the 10th tier level, no matter how expensive, it was limited.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Lin Yuan's foundational physical body was too powerful, resulting in a very high starting point. The Xuanhuang Body Scripture increased one's physical strength tenfold.</p><p></p><p>If a normal 10th tier life's initial physical strength was 10, increasing it tenfold would be 100.</p><p></p><p>If the initial physical strength was 100, increasing tenfold would be 1,000.</p><p></p><p>The resources required for the two would naturally differ. As for Lin Yuan's initial physical strength, it was not just 100, or even 10,000 or 100,000!</p><p></p><p>The resources needed for him to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body Scripture to the perfect level would be millions or tens of millions times more than normal.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

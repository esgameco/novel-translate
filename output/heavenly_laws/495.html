        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Give them to me?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the round, plump figure.</p><p></p><p>Everything on the island - the eighteen sovereign realm extraordinary trees, the three sovereign realm secret treasures, and the one chaos realm secret treasure - were all being given to him? "Haha, if I hadn't brought most of the treasures with my true body into the Taiyan Ruins, what you could obtain now would be ten times more."</p><p></p><p>The round, plump figure of 'Cang Weiyang' said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>"However, I do have a request."</p><p></p><p>The round, plump figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, senior," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"If one day in the future, you become a Chaos Sage, could you go to a certain place and take on a disciple?" The round, plump figure said: "This is just a request, if you're not interested at that time, you don't have to do it."</p><p></p><p>"Senior is too generous in your estimation of me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>A Chaos Sage?</p><p></p><p>What is a Sage?</p><p></p><p>Only figures like the Sovereign of Xuanhuang and the Master of the Moyu Pavilion, who have reached the peak of the Chaos Realm, are qualified to be called Sages. </p><p></p><p>They are great existences who can pursue and approach the perfection of time and life, their methods and abilities have reached unimaginable levels, and Lin Yuan even doubted whether these two Sages had truly perished.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why has there not been a single Twelfth Tier cultivator born from the evolutionary path of Xuanhuang?</p><p></p><p>And the evolutionary path that the Master of the Moyu Pavilion took, Lin Yuan still did not know, and the stone statue Shen Ji had never told Lin Yuan about it either.</p><p></p><p>"This is just my request, whether you do it or not is up to you," the round, plump figure of 'Cang Weiyang' said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If he really could become a Chaos Sage, then traversing the Chaotic Void would be a simple matter, and taking on a disciple would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Then I entrust everything to you."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the round, plump figure's face, and then the entire figure transformed into a strong light, and a flood of information surged into Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ninety-two secret techniques? All of them are sovereign realm secret techniques?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly absorbed all the information. "The Chaos Undying Technique?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Undying Technique was a special secret technique that 'Cang Weiyang' had obtained, which could conceal one's aura. Even if a Chaos Realm expert were to carefully observe, they might not necessarily detect it.</p><p></p><p>The information left behind by 'Cang Weiyang' suggested that Lin Yuan should first cultivate this Chaos Undying Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, the fact that a Dao Splitting Realm cultivator had comprehended the Chaos Rules was too shocking. And since Lin Yuan came from the Universe, he had no background, so if this news were to spread, it might attract the attention of some Chaos Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this attention might be benevolent.</p><p></p><p>But there could also be malicious intent. Before he had grown strong enough, 'Cang Weiyang' advised Lin Yuan to hide this matter as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>And the Chaos Undying Technique could help Lin Yuan conceal his Chaos aura. In this way, even if Lin Yuan sent out his avatar to wander the outside world, it would be very secure.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cang Weiyang is thoughtful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only sent out an avatar, for Chaos Realm experts, they could still lock onto the location of his true body.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Realm experts, although they could not enter the Universe, could still guard the outside and wait.</p><p></p><p>Wait until the Universe's great destruction, and Lin Yuan came out.</p><p></p><p>It would be like lying in wait for the prey.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Undying Unity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to comprehend the Chaos Undying Technique.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension is extraordinary, you have comprehended the Chaos Undying Technique to the perfect stage.】</p><p></p><p>After dozens of breaths, Lin Yuan had cultivated this secret technique to perfection.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Undying Technique was not complicated, it was just a technique to conceal one's aura, so Lin Yuan comprehended it quickly.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved.</p><p></p><p>His aura was completely concealed, without the slightest leak of Chaos energy.</p><p></p><p>"This is enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outsiders would not be able to tell that his body was condensed from Chaos energy.</p><p></p><p>Even if he encountered a Chaos Realm expert, Lin Yuan could choose to disperse his avatar.</p><p></p><p>Once the avatar was dispersed, even if there were residual Chaos energy, the source could not be determined, as there were many treasures in the Chaotic Void that could absorb Chaos energy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, encountering a Chaos Realm expert was an extreme situation.</p><p></p><p>Those Chaos Realm existences, which one of them did not reign over a domain? It's not something that can be easily encountered.</p><p></p><p>Even if he really encountered a Chaos Realm expert, with their status, they would not deign to even look at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll refine this Dao Palace core." Lin Yuan looked at the twelve-sided crystal stone in the distance.</p><p></p><p>After 'Cang Weiyang's' imprint faded, this Dao Palace core was completely without an owner, and Lin Yuan could easily refine it.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Lin Yuan successfully refined the Dao Palace core.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the entire thousand-mile area of the Dao Palace came under his control.</p><p></p><p>"Eighteen sovereign realm extraordinary trees?" Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, and he left the central palace, coming to the eighteen extraordinary trees around.</p><p></p><p>These eighteen extraordinary trees were cultivated by 'Cang Weiyang' at great cost.</p><p></p><p>Every ten million years, these eighteen trees would bear spiritual fruits, and the value of a single spiritual fruit would be equivalent to a Dao Splitting Realm weapon.</p><p></p><p>And now...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Below, the spiritual fruits on the eighteen strange trees totaled over a thousand, which were equivalent to a thousand Transcendent Dao Boundary weapons.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these Transcendent Dao Boundary weapons would regenerate another batch every million years.</p><p></p><p>A million years was not a long time for someone at the Sovereign Realm peak like 'Cang Wei Yang', let alone Lin Yuan, who was at the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the spiritual fruits that grow on the strange trees will fall off after a certain period of time, and if they are not collected, they will dissipate," Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>On the ground around the eighteen strange trees, countless spiritual fruits had fallen, and if all of them were gathered, they could have been enough to fulfill the consumption of Lin Yuan's Twelfth Realm 'Mysterious Yellow Body'.</p><p></p><p>"These strange trees are all money trees that bear fruit once every million years," Lin Yuan concluded after observing them.</p><p></p><p>After examining the condition of each strange tree, Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and he returned to the central palace.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and three weapons appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The one in the middle was a gourd, half a meter in size, glowing a deep yellow and emanating a terrifying aura, as if it could reduce everything to chaos.</p><p></p><p>The weapons on the left and right were weaker in aura, but still extremely formidable, far surpassing the clan's guardian weapons of the major peak factions in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Sovereign Realm treasure, Chaos Realm treasure," Lin Yuan observed carefully. "My current strength is completely incapable of activating the Sovereign Realm treasure, let alone the Chaos Realm treasure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>With his current foundation, he could easily activate the Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapon, but the Sovereign Realm treasure? Even Transcendent Dao Boundary peak experts would find it extremely taxing to activate.</p><p></p><p>Each strike of the Sovereign Realm secret weapon consumed an unimaginable amount, and the universe within an ordinary Transcendent Dao Boundary expert could be drained.</p><p></p><p>"But once I reach the Twelfth Realm, I should be able to activate the Sovereign Realm treasure," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the Chaos Realm treasure? The level was too high, even 'Cang Wei Yang', an experienced Sovereign Realm peak expert, only had three Chaos Realm treasures.</p><p></p><p>Two of them were taken away, and the remaining gourd was left in the cave dwelling since it was unusable.</p><p></p><p>The two Chaos Realm treasures taken by 'Cang Wei Yang', one offensive and one defensive, along with this gourd, were of no further help.</p><p></p><p>"There are also some Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapons," Lin Yuan counted the many treasures in the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>'Cang Wei Yang' had only mentioned the two Sovereign Realm treasures and the one Chaos Realm treasure, as well as the eighteen Sovereign Realm strange trees outside.</p><p></p><p>But that did not mean the cave dwelling only contained those items.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were other treasures, but 'Cang Wei Yang' was too lazy to mention them.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapons," Lin Yuan's eyes lit up. Compared to the Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm secret weapons that he could only look at but not use, these seven Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapons were something he could activate and utilize.</p><p></p><p>And the Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapons that were specifically collected by 'Cang Wei Yang' in the cave dwelling were essentially the cream of the crop, surpassing the guardian weapons of the major peak factions in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, Lin Yuan could fully unleash the power of these top-tier Transcendent Dao Boundary weapons.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Twelfth Realm cultivation path left behind by Senior 'Cang Wei Yang'," Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he briefly comprehended it, then shook his head and said, "Unfortunately, this cultivation path already has a new ultimate existence."</p><p></p><p>It had been unknown how many years since 'Cang Wei Yang's true self had perished, and the cultivation path he had cultivated was not a closely guarded secret, so it had naturally been occupied by later cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was not too concerned about this, as he had no intention of following 'Cang Wei Yang's cultivation path anyway. After briefly grasping the essence and advantages of this cultivation path, he put away the three secret weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Stone."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and a stone emanating pure Chaos Qi appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Stones were the 'universal currency' of the Chaos Realm, equivalent to the universe crystals in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>The source of Chaos Stones was the Chaos Realm experts, who refined and condensed the massive amounts of Chaos Qi, and the Chaos Qi within the Chaos Stones could be directly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>However, the Chaos Qi floating in the Chaos Realm contained various energies and mechanisms, which even Chaos Realm experts could not directly absorb.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the inherent value of Chaos Stones that they became the circulating currency in the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>Normally, in the Chaos Realm, one hundred Chaos Stones could be exchanged for one ordinary Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapon.</p><p></p><p>And the remaining Chaos Stones in the palace were over ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand Chaos Stones could buy hundreds of ordinary Transcendent Dao Boundary secret weapons, but they were far from enough to purchase a single Sovereign Realm secret weapon, which is why 'Cang Wei Yang' did not even mention them.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that absorbing the Chaos Qi in the Chaos Stones will greatly benefit my inner world," Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as he was currently just a manifestation, he did not want to waste the Chaos Stones and planned to send them back to his main body in the main universe to try them out.</p><p></p><p>"This exploration of the Chaos Realm has been of immense help to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in high spirits. Not to mention the two precious Sovereign Realm secret weapons and the one Chaos Realm secret weapon, as well as the eighteen Sovereign Realm strange trees.</p><p></p><p>Just the seven top-tier Transcendent Dao Boundary weapons and the ninety-eight Sovereign Realm secret techniques had already greatly boosted his strength.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

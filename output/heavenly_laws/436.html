            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 436 The Soaring Speed of Comprehension (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>In the distorted space-time center.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen the nine paramount experts," Lin Yuan slightly bowed, showing respect. </p><p></p><p>After crossing into the eleventh level, the first thing Lin Yuan did was come to see the paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>After all, during the breakthrough period, the nine paramount experts had been shielding the heavenly laws for him.</p><p></p><p>The impact on life at the eleventh level was ultimate. Whether there were paramount experts' protection was a completely different matter.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Lin Yuan had not impacted the ultimate realm and had never attempted the ultimate leap, there was a possibility of interference during the breakthrough period.</p><p></p><p>"No need for such formalities. I believe it won't be long before our human civilization establishes the tenth evolutionary tower," said the ancient paramount expert.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization currently had nine evolutionary towers, corresponding to the nine paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>The tenth evolutionary tower meant the birth of the tenth paramount expert in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>To receive such an evaluation from the ancient paramount expert upon just entering the eleventh level showed how valued Lin Yuan was.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, the ancient paramount expert had already regarded Lin Yuan as a future paramount expert.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the paramount experts, I am still far behind," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The more he cultivated, the more Lin Yuan felt the gap between the twelfth and eleventh levels.</p><p></p><p>The two were simply not on the same level of existence. Even the strongest eleventh level life could only live within the river of time. Although they could temporarily leap out, they would eventually fall back in.</p><p></p><p>But the twelfth level? They had completely broken free from the shackles of the river of time, standing on the shore and looking down at the countless struggling lives in the river.</p><p></p><p>Not only was there an immense gap in realm and strength, but their mentalities were also completely different.</p><p></p><p>"Do not belittle yourself. If even you cannot cross into the twelfth level, then our human civilization, or even the myriad races of the universe, will never give birth to a twelfth level existence."</p><p></p><p>The ancient paramount expert said, "Walking the path of evolution requires appropriate humility, but you must also have confidence."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other eight paramount experts slightly nodded. From the fluctuations of Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the eleventh level, they vaguely sensed the profound foundation of this Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>Tearing open the spatial rift in the universe to welcome the descent of the primordial chaos was entirely based on one's own circumstances.</p><p></p><p>No one could fake that.</p><p></p><p>The spatial rift torn open by Lin Yuan at the tenth level was not at all smaller than those torn by eleventh level perfected experts impacting the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Under circumstances of a lower realm, yet ultimately tearing open an equal spatial rift, meant that in other aspects, Lin Yuan surpassed eleventh level perfection.</p><p></p><p>This was what most shocked the nine paramount experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The paramount expert is right," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he couldn't help but mutter.</p><p></p><p>What he meant by being far behind the paramount experts was only in terms of combat strength.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's combat strength was far beyond eleventh level perfection. Even eleventh level perfected experts wielding paramount weapons could at most barely survive before him.</p><p></p><p>But compared to true twelfth level experts, Lin Yuan had no confidence at all.</p><p></p><p>Eleventh level perfected experts impacting the ultimate realm, as long as they succeeded and landed on the shore, experiencing the "shoreline" trigger, would basically comprehend the six-fold space-time realm.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the six-fold space-time realm was called the threshold of the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>In terms of comprehending the fusion of space-time, Lin Yuan had no advantage, and was even at a disadvantage. In physical body and soul, he was also inferior to paramount experts. As for his inner world?</p><p></p><p>A paramount expert's inner world would metamorphose into an inner universe spanning tens of thousands to a hundred thousand light-years across - something Lin Yuan could not compare to.</p><p></p><p>The only place where Lin Yuan could surpass ordinary twelfth level experts was in his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>With a spiritual will index as high as over 3,330,000 points, it was estimated that most paramount experts in the universe had never reached that level.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual will was certainly important and could play a huge role when combined with any foundation. But if one only had spiritual will, the effect would be very limited.</p><p></p><p>What Lin Yuan meant was simply that at the current stage, he could not defeat paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>But the ancient paramount expert mistakenly thought he lacked confidence in crossing into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan was quite confident in impacting the ultimate realm. He had been tempering and elevating all the fusion rules to the twelfth level realm during the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did not comprehend the primordial rules in the end, Lin Yuan impacting the ultimate realm had a relatively high chance of success.</p><p></p><p>This chance of success came not only from his own profound foundation, but also from many external factors, such as that "Heart of Space-Time" artifact.</p><p></p><p>Being able to extend the time spent in the river of time, this kind of reverse...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The heavenly effect was equivalent to forcibly increasing the possibility of crossing into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan, what is your current strength?" </p><p></p><p>The summer Qin Supreme Being looked at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Upon these words being spoken, the other eight Supreme Beings also looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate a bit stronger than the eleventh stage," Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"A bit stronger? How much stronger?" The Xuvirtual Supreme Being couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh stage is divided into six levels. Which level of the eleventh stage was Lin Yuan a bit stronger than?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said that he had already exaggerated the eleventh stage perfection as much as possible. In reality, the gap between the eleventh stage perfection and Lin Yuan would only be greater.</p><p></p><p>"About the same as the difference between the tenth and eleventh stages?"</p><p></p><p>The nine Supreme Beings of human civilization fell silent. This is called a bit stronger?</p><p></p><p>The limit of a tenth stage evolver is to comprehend a certain pillar-level fusion law at the second boundary.  </p><p></p><p>But the eleventh stage perfection? The fifth boundary of space-time, involving many pillar-level fusion laws.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan compared the gap between himself and the eleventh stage perfection to the gap between the eleventh and tenth stages, almost making the nine Supreme Beings of human civilization doubt whether Lin Yuan was really an eleventh stage life or not.</p><p></p><p>"I estimate that from the beginning to the end of this universe, you should be the strongest eleventh stage," the Butterfly Supreme Being said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>So far, the myriad tribes of the starry sky have no specific numbers for the strongest eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>Because most eleventh stage perfections rely on the blessing of supreme weapons.  </p><p></p><p>Even so, there has been constant controversy about the strongest eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>But now, there should be no more controversy.</p><p></p><p>The strongest eleventh stage, is Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It may not even be limited to this universe period.</p><p></p><p>In the past and future universe periods, it is probably impossible to give birth to an eleventh stage stronger than Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan, with your strength, you can completely sweep the upcoming super-large alien battlefield," the summer Qin Supreme Being's heart moved, and he immediately spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Super-large alien battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart moved. He had already heard about the super-large alien battlefield from the summer Qin Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>This was a battlefield larger than any previous battlefield, a place where all the peak forces of the myriad starry sky tribes would compete.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the Ancient Force Supreme Being's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>"After the super-large battlefield is opened, any force or tribe that obtains the first main dominance of the war will be able to obtain one ten-thousandth of the domain of all participating forces."</p><p></p><p>The Xuvirtual Supreme Being said from the side.</p><p></p><p>"One ten-thousandth of the domain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>In the battlefields opened by the myriad starry sky tribes, they would fight, and according to set rules, the victorious side would take over the defeated side's domain or certain resource mysteries.  </p><p></p><p>The galaxy domain Lin Yuan was in used to be ruled by the Shadow Tribe, but on the battlefield, the Shadow Tribe lost to human civilization, so they had to give up that domain.</p><p></p><p>However, in previous battlefields, even in large-scale battlefields, the domain lost by the defeated side had little impact on the foundation of human civilization as a whole.</p><p></p><p>But a super-large battlefield? With one ten-thousandth of the domain as the price?</p><p></p><p>How many star domains would one ten-thousandth of human civilization's domain encompass? More precisely, how many star unions?</p><p></p><p>The size of a domain not only includes the number of lives that can be nurtured, but also means countless resources.  </p><p></p><p>Many precious resource planets, as well as many cosmic mysteries, are located within certain domains. Once given away, these would also be relinquished.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"So in this super-large alien battlefield, those peak tribes and forces will spare no effort, and may even equip fifth-level eleventh stage fighters with supreme weapons."</p><p></p><p>The summer Qin Supreme Being said.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules set by the myriad starry sky tribes for opening a super-large battlefield, the twelfth stage is prohibited from taking action.</p><p></p><p>With no twelfth stage Supreme Beings acting, the strongest combat strength is the eleventh stage. To increase their side's chances of winning, equipping eleventh stage perfections with supreme weapons is the baseline, and even fifth-level eleventh stage fighters will be bestowed with supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>To initially refine a supreme weapon requires at least the comprehension of the fifth boundary of space-time, which is the fifth level of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>But normally, cases of fifth-level eleventh stage fighters being bestowed with supreme weapons are very, very rare.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>From becoming an evolver until now, he had always been under the protection of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan also planned to give back to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't really be considered purely giving back, as Lin Yuan was not going out of obligation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Super-Massive Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>According to the nine Paramount Experts, every eleventh-stage cultivator who goes to the Super-Massive Battlefield will receive a massive number of merit points as a reward for human civilization. </p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength surpassing the eleventh stage, even without an invitation from the Paramount Experts, he would still plan to visit the Super-Massive Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After all, in order to obtain the first battlefield dominance in the Super-Massive Battlefield, those peak clan eleventh-stage experts would probably arm themselves to the teeth.</p><p></p><p>And to Lin Yuan, they are all moving wealth and treasures.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Super-Massive Alien Battlefield basically poses no risk to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is only going with his Primordial Spirit. Even if it dissipates, Lin Yuan can quickly re-condense it.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the eleventh stage, even if the Paramount Experts attack Lin Yuan, at most they can only destroy his Primordial Spirit, which will not affect his true self at all.</p><p></p><p>With a spiritual willpower strength of over 333 million points, Lin Yuan can easily resist any memory contamination at the twelfth stage level.</p><p></p><p>As for karmic curses? At Lin Yuan's current level of life, even if the twelfth stage pays an immense price, they cannot curse him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is the Profound Yellow Secret Realm to isolate karma.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the current Lin Yuan cannot defeat the twelfth stage, but for the twelfth stage to completely kill him?</p><p></p><p>That is also very difficult to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it is impossible.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, do you want to make public your breakthrough to the eleventh stage?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Paramount Expert, thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>So far, the entry standard for the Super-Massive Battlefield has been peak eleventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>As for those below the eleventh stage? To the perfected eleventh-stage experts wielding Paramount weapons, tenth-stage cultivators are not very significant.</p><p></p><p>Unless they can reach the Bug Hive's tactic of birthing billions of bug warriors into a bug sea, they basically have no effect.</p><p></p><p>So -</p><p></p><p>To enter the Super-Massive Alien Battlefield, the threshold is the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan plans to enter the Super-Massive Alien Battlefield, he has to reveal his eleventh-stage strength.</p><p></p><p>"I'll make it public," Lin Yuan calmly said.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he broke through from the fifth to sixth stage, in order to prevent assassination by aliens, Lin Yuan needed to keep his identity secret.</p><p></p><p>Now he no longer needs to keep it secret.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan has grown to a level where those alien Paramount Experts can no longer kill him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, entering the Super-Massive Alien Battlefield requires the eleventh stage as the threshold, so announcing his crossing into the eleventh stage is preparation for that.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, even if it's made public, it doesn't really matter," said the Butterfly Paramount Expert. Considering the talent the Galactic Prime once displayed, breaking through to the eleventh stage now is just a bit faster, but completely understandable.</p><p></p><p>From the seventh to eighth stage, eighth to ninth, ninth to tenth - wasn't the Galactic Prime dropping everyone's jaws every time?</p><p></p><p>After chatting with the nine Paramount Experts for a while, Lin Yuan successfully returned to the Galactic Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>"The realm of my physical body, the 'Profound Yellow Body', has dropped to the minor achievement stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt it slightly and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Actually, saying that the 'Profound Yellow Body' realm has dropped is not accurate.</p><p></p><p>More precisely, the upper limit of the 'Profound Yellow Body' has been raised.</p><p></p><p>The perfected tenth stage 'Profound Yellow Body' and the perfected eleventh stage 'Profound Yellow Body' are completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan crossing into the eleventh stage and entering the eleventh section of body cultivation in the 'Profound Yellow Body', the original tenth stage section has not weakened in strength at all. It's just that Lin Yuan now has greater room for improvement in this body refining secret method.</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate the eleventh stage 'Profound Yellow Body' to perfection..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly. After the infusion of the primal chaos origin, his current physical body strength is too high, resulting in the 'Profound Yellow Body' having an excessively high baseline.</p><p></p><p>To make further improvements would require resource costs far exceeding that of a normal eleventh stage 'Profound Yellow Body'.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, with his current physical body strength as the base, once he cultivates the 'Profound Yellow Body' to eleventh stage perfection, in terms of physical body and constitution, he will surpass ordinary Paramount Experts and approach the perfected twelfth stage 'Profound Yellow Body'.</p><p></p><p>After considering the resources needed to cultivate the 'Profound Yellow Body' further, Lin Yuan was quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Lin Yuan stopped focusing on his physical body and began perceiving the vast fluctuations of the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>"My current comprehension speed..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes slightly, only feeling the myriad rules and ways of the universe rushing towards him.</p>

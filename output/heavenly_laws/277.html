            <p>Chapter 277 Sensation (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Chikun, you have taken in an excellent disciple."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord looked at the Scarlet Roc Star Lord and spoke.</p><p></p><p>In the human civilization of the universe, disciples surpassing their teachers was not a rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in those alien races, there existed oppression, control, and enslavement of the geniuses within the race.</p><p></p><p>This led to the strong remaining strong, and those in high positions limiting the promotion channels of those below them to consolidate their own status.</p><p></p><p>But currently, this phenomenon was almost non-existent in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Under the rule of the three ultimate intelligent goddesses, as long as you could display talent in a certain aspect, you would be protected.</p><p></p><p>Even if you had no talent at all, you could still live a stable life.</p><p></p><p>As long as you didn't violate the law, there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the average individual in human civilization could be considered very weak compared to other peak races, they were able to steadily and continuously give birth to a large number of powerful individuals.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they swept across the universe, and even when facing peak races like the Insectoids, they could contend with them and even gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"When the disciple is too outstanding, the teacher also feels troubled."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord sighed, making the White Light Star Lord beside him roll his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At the Scarlet Roc Star Lord's level, it was difficult for him to make further progress in a short period of time. When chatting and comparing with many good friends, it was mostly about his own disciples.</p><p></p><p>The more outstanding Lin Yuan was, the more glory the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, as his teacher, had on his face.</p><p></p><p>I can teach such a powerful disciple, can you?</p><p></p><p>Even if I didn't teach him, I still had the keen eye to recognize his talent.</p><p></p><p>In short, ever since taking in Lin Yuan in recent years, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord had been living very comfortably, and he had never lost in comparisons with his good friends.</p><p></p><p>Especially just now, after learning about Lin Yuan's impressive battle achievements from the White Light Star Lord, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord felt even more delighted. Even if in the future, some of his good friends stepped into the ninth stage, he would still be able to suppress them when it came to taking in disciples.</p><p></p><p>"What are you, old fellow, being smug about?"</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord glanced at the Scarlet Roc Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Don't end up with your disciple reaching the ninth stage while you're still stuck at the eighth stage."</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord teased.</p><p></p><p>Ninth stage powerhouses began to merge with the grand universe, so even though the White Light Star Lord found Lin Yuan's displayed battle power incredible, he was certain that the other party was still at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Roc Star Lord said, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>The battle outside the Milky Way's main star spread like a hurricane in the human territory as time passed.</p><p></p><p>The human territory was vast and boundless. Even the matters of ninth stage evolvers and tenth stage evolvers might not spread very widely, with very few able to spread across star regions.</p><p></p><p>No matter which star region it was, there were definitely invincible eighth stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>And as an invincible eighth stage powerhouse, they were very clear about the difficulty for another invincible eighth stage powerhouse of the same level to kill another invincible eighth stage powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>This was killing.</p><p></p><p>Not defeating or suppressing.</p><p></p><p>"Junior martial brother," in another peripheral star domain, the Great Peak Master of the Scarlet Roc lineage looked at the information in front of him, somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>He had long known about his junior martial brother's terrifying innate talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the eighth stage, he could suppress and beat him, a powerhouse who had adapted to the eighth stage for some time, without any suspense.</p><p></p><p>Even his teacher, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, said that Lin Yuan was "holding back with all his strength".</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Great Peak Master had been clear that the gap between him and his junior martial brother would only grow larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Peak Master did not expect that it had only been such a short time. He was still working hard to balance the various forces within the star domain.</p><p></p><p>His junior martial brother was already killing among the invincible eighth stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Master, he killed two invincible eighth stage powerhouses?"</p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Sun Star Domain, the Myriad Sun Sacred Son sighed inwardly after learning this information.</p><p></p><p>"I had wanted to challenge the Thirteenth Peak Master back then. Now it seems too ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Sun Sacred Son was also shocked by Lin Yuan's means of killing invincible eighth stage powerhouses, he had once regarded the Thirteenth Peak Master as a target to chase after.</p><p></p><p>He had a deep understanding of the Thirteenth Peak Master's growth speed. Breaking the myth of the invincible eighth stage powerhouses being undefeated was something other powerhouses couldn't do, but the Thirteenth Peak Master did it. The Myriad Sun Sacred Son quickly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought I had once fought against the Thirteenth Peak Master on the arena." The Myriad Sun Sacred Son's mood was calm, and he felt a hint of pride.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way's main star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his consciousness descending into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Wei Clear Crystal."</p><p></p><p>Tai Wei Clear Crystals the size of dozens of planets were piled up in a certain area of his inner world, and the aura of pure energy spread out.</p><p></p><p>"The expansion has begun."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, he released the suppression on his inner world.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, hundreds of thousands of tons of Tai Wei Clear Crystals shattered and turned into pure energy, merging into his inner world and supporting the crazy expansion of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan secretly thought that this was also the most energy-saving method to the greatest extent.</p><p></p><p>After traveling for half a month, Lin Yuan did not directly begin absorbing the liquid in the mysterious gourd, but waited for the Tai Wei Clear Crystals to arrive.</p><p></p><p>If he had absorbed the liquid in the mysterious gourd first, increasing the base multiple of his inner world to thirteen times, then the energy required to expand his inner world to the size of his spatial law comprehension would far exceed what he needed now.</p><p></p><p>Going from one to three consumed two, but going from ten to thirty consumed twenty.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the amount of universe crystals Lin Yuan would need to consume would not be 800,000 cubic meters, but 8 million cubic meters, or even more than 10 million cubic meters.</p><p></p><p>"At the current expansion rate, it will take five or six days to expand to 37.5 million miles. Then, after absorbing the liquid in the mysterious gourd, it will take at most half a month to restore the inner world to nearly 100 million miles."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a while and made an estimate in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm for nearly a thousand years, he had spent a lot of time absorbing the several colored liquids in the mysterious gourd, greatly enhancing his physical divine ability "Rebirth with a Drop of Blood".</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't take long to reabsorb it next.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while longer, Lin Yuan's consciousness returned to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the inner world was an instinctive behavior and did not require Lin Yuan's constant attention.</p><p></p><p>It only needed to ensure a sufficient energy supply.</p><p></p><p>"My current merit points are 26 million?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced and pondered with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao Eighth Stage Chapter was worth 22 million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Of the remaining 4 million merit points, 1.5 million were obtained by Lin Yuan informing the Goddess of Wisdom that he had comprehended the 3,333 evolutionary paths contained within the bodies of those top powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Another 1 million merit points were the reward bestowed upon Lin Yuan for killing those two invincible eighth stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, completely killing an invincible eighth stage alien would earn 1 million merit points, and killing an invincible eighth stage powerhouse would earn even more.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not completely kill those two invincible eighth stage powerhouses; their true bodies were still alive.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when added together, there were only one million merit points.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was already content. Not to mention other things, the treasured weapons contributed by the two 8th-stage invincible alien races, worth nearly 500,000 cubic universe crystals, had already allowed him to make a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>Getting an additional one million merit points was simply a free gift.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining one million merit points, they were Lin Yuan's previous accumulation.</p><p></p><p>"Five million merit points are needed to advance from a 7th-level citizen to an 8th-level citizen?" Lin Yuan checked the merit point requirement for the next citizen level and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Five million merit points was simply an astronomical price. Even those 8th-stage invincible evolvers found it out of reach.</p><p></p><p>An evolution scholar needed to at least pioneer a brand-new 8th-stage evolution path, which alone was worth at least several million merit points.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each evolution scholar possessed a research planet in the central star domain, where they could deduce various achievements at any time, which would also generate a considerable merit point income over a long period.</p><p></p><p>Finally, evolution scholars could join the human civilization's Academy of Sciences and Evolution Academy, where they could still obtain a stable amount of merit points every once in a while.</p><p></p><p>Compared to most evolvers, evolution scholars had many more ways to acquire merit points.</p><p></p><p>Even so, a considerable portion of evolution scholars had not yet become 8th-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can pioneer the 9th-stage chapter of the Martial Dao, it should be enough to advance to an 8th-level citizen."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart. The 8th-stage of the Martial Dao was worth 22 million merit points alone. The 9th-stage chapter of the Martial Dao couldn't be lower than this number. Advancing to an 8th-level citizen would be more than enough.</p><p></p><p>"8th-level citizen." Lin Yuan's expression showed a hint of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>At this level, one was no longer just a citizen, but also a decision-maker of human civilization, and could even influence entire star alliances.</p><p></p><p>The current chairman of the Annan Star Alliance was an 8th-level citizen, with an influence so great that even the surrounding dozens of star alliances dared not take him lightly.</p><p></p><p>Outside human territory.</p><p></p><p>In a desolate star domain.</p><p></p><p>The enormous phantom of the Insect Race Venerable descended, and several other majestic figures also condensed.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with that Galaxy Overlord? He just stepped into the 8th stage not long ago, yet he already possesses the strength to kill 8th-stage invincibles?" One majestic figure spoke, his tone somewhat questioning.</p><p></p><p>For them, 8th-stage invincibles were nothing special, but that Galaxy Overlord was so young. Growing to this step at such an age, what would become of him in the future?</p><p></p><p>"Kanalan, you are most clear about the assassination of the Galaxy Overlord. What exactly happened?" The second majestic figure looked at the phantom of the Insect Race Venerable and frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The facts are just as you know them." The Insect Race Venerable said.</p><p></p><p>She also did not expect the outcome of the assassination to be like this. That Galaxy Overlord had just stepped into the 8th stage with one foot, and with the next, he became an 8th-stage invincible, with a battle power so strong that it defied imagination.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't borrow any external powers?" </p><p></p><p>The third majestic figure inquired.</p><p></p><p>This was very important. If the Galaxy Overlord had borrowed external powers to kill the two 8th-stage invincibles, then it was nothing special. External powers were limited.</p><p></p><p>"These are the battle footage from that time."</p><p></p><p>In front of the Insect Race Venerable, scenes appeared one by one, showing Lin Yuan confronting and engaging the five 8th-stage invincible alien races.</p><p></p><p>The existences all finished watching the footage.</p><p></p><p>"No external powers were used."</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Overlord has mastered at least three cosmic powers, and they are three high-grade cosmic powers at that."</p><p></p><p>"One of the cosmic powers should have reached the third realm."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figures discussed in low voices, their tones revealing surprise.</p><p></p><p>Cosmic powers were not easy to comprehend, and high-grade cosmic powers were even more so.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Overlord comprehending three high-grade cosmic powers was even more exaggerated than killing two 8th-stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he was able to kill two 8th-stage invincibles."</p><p></p><p>"These three high-grade cosmic powers, working together, barely touch upon the threshold of the 9th stage in power, but in other aspects, they are far more brilliant than a simple 9th stage."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figures looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>For a 9th-stage powerhouse, killing an 8th-stage invincible was difficult. That was because 8th-stage invincibles would run, activating the cosmic powers they mastered to stall the 9th-stage powerhouse for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the 9th-stage powerhouses mentioned here referred to the most ordinary ones. In front of those powerful 9th-stage experts, 8th-stage invincibles would have a hard time surviving.</p><p></p><p>It was just that although the Galaxy Overlord was not a 9th-stage powerhouse, his methods had no shortcomings. The cosmic powers of 8th-stage invincibles simply could not affect him.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the three high-grade cosmic powers mastered by the Galaxy Overlord could greatly restrict 8th-stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was not that the Galaxy Overlord's strength surpassed normal 9th-stage powerhouses, but that those 8th-stage invincibles were restrained by him.</p><p></p><p>"Three high-grade cosmic powers. Once this Galaxy Overlord steps into the 9th stage, he will make rapid progress. His future success rate of impacting the 10th stage will be very high."</p><p></p><p>"If we had known the Galaxy Overlord had such great potential, our race should have dispatched 9th-stage battle power to assassinate him."</p><p></p><p>"If we have to tear off the facade, then so be it. At most, we'll face retaliation from human civilization, but letting this Galaxy Overlord grow will likely result in even greater losses for our race on large-scale battlefields in the future."</p><p></p><p>The majestic figures discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Their killing intent towards the Galaxy Overlord was very strong, but at this moment, they also realized that with the Galaxy Overlord displaying such strength, he had definitely attracted the attention of human civilization. </p><p></p><p>It was already too late to send 9th-stage powerhouses to assassinate the Galaxy Overlord now.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the assassination would fail and they would be ambushed by the powerhouses of human civilization, wasting their own forces.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Inside Lin Yuan's inner world, it had successfully expanded to a radius of 37.5 million miles.</p><p></p><p>This was the inner world enhanced by a five-fold amplification. The base size of the inner world should be around 7.5 million miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can absorb the liquid inside the mysterious gourd." Lin Yuan immediately took out the gourd.</p><p></p><p>The absorption of the mysterious gourd by the main world body had stopped at the second orange-yellow liquid, while in the spirit realm, the absorption of the fourth green liquid was almost complete, with the amplification reaching thirteen-fold.</p><p></p><p>Inhale.</p><p></p><p>Exhale.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began absorbing the liquid inside the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>The body divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood" was greatly enhanced, easily able to withstand the burning of the orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>In just over ten days.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's absorption of the liquid in the mysterious gourd had caught up with the progress in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The inner world ushered in a frenzied expansion. If Lin Yuan had not made preparations in advance, the spatial fluctuations caused by the expansion would likely have swept across the Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"Finally."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness descended into the inner world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the inner world had reached its expansion limit, with a radius of nearly 100 million miles.</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>Endless.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

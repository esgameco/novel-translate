        <h1>Chapter 633</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great revered ones (天尊) among the major ancient nations often have close relationships and engage in mutual exchanges and transactions.</p><p></p><p>Many secret techniques and inheritances are naturally included in these transactions.</p><p></p><p>However, the secret technique inheritances that can be traded at the level of the great revered ones are still too shallow for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Now, these two Heavenly Revered Ones from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation have given Lin Yuan the hope of accessing the profound inherited secret techniques of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan does not expect to obtain the truly unparalleled secret techniques of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation. Those levels of inheritances would not even be recorded by the Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One and the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One, even if they cultivated them.</p><p></p><p>But the ordinary secret technique inheritances at the Heavenly Revered One level are very likely to be kept as backups.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Burning Heaven Institute founded by the Marquis of Azure Burning contains many secret technique inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to investigate the world's secret treasures left behind by the two Heavenly Revered Ones, which contained the long-accumulated precious collections of the Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One and the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One.</p><p></p><p>These two Heavenly Revered Ones never imagined that they would be completely trapped in the Black Jade's Nest this time.</p><p></p><p>So the main combat physical bodies that infiltrated here carried many precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept past the various precious treasures and directly looked towards the area of secret technique inheritances.</p><p></p><p>"'The Thirteen Slashes of the Mysterious Yin', created by a supreme Heavenly Revered One of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation based on the highest inheritance of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, the 'Mysterious Yin Classics', can condense the Mysterious Yin Qi to annihilate with a single slash."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully studied and comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>The so-called supreme Heavenly Revered Ones correspond to the supreme great saints of the chaotic void. Compared to the supreme great saints, the supreme peak Heavenly Revered Ones do not have a universe within their bodies as a support, but they are ahead of the supreme great saints in the path of the power of chaotic evolution.</p><p></p><p>The supreme Heavenly Revered Ones of the six major ancient nations have each created their own attack methods on the chaotic theory path they have walked.</p><p></p><p>For example, "The Thirteen Slashes of the Mysterious Yin" was created by a supreme Heavenly Revered One of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation. Each slash is enough to severely injure an ordinary Heavenly Revered One, and the last few slashes can even annihilate a normal Heavenly Revered One.</p><p></p><p>"Remarkable," Lin Yuan exclaimed as he comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>If the path of chaotic power evolution is divided into three levels, then the chaotic great saints of the chaotic void are at the first level.</p><p></p><p>The supreme great saints are at the second level, and the supreme peak Heavenly Revered Ones of the six major ancient worlds in this source world are standing at the third level.</p><p></p><p>The third level of the chaotic evolution path has already condensed its own Dao fruit, no longer just a simple path.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the truly profound inheritances of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation are basically not passed on." Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This "Thirteen Slashes of the Mysterious Yin" could be found in the world's secret treasures because it was quite widely circulated among the Heavenly Revered Ones of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>"But this harvest is already very substantial."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the many inherited secret techniques in the world's secret treasures, which were on the same level as the "Thirteen Slashes of the Mysterious Yin", and there were four of them. As for the weaker normal Heavenly Revered One level inheritances, there were dozens of them.</p><p></p><p>The Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One and the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One naturally absorbed the essence of various schools, and it was impossible for them to succeed in closed-door cultivation alone. They had to comprehend countless secret technique inheritances before finding their own path.</p><p></p><p>"As I comprehend these secret technique inheritances, I clearly feel that my Yin Dao has become much 'fuller'," Lin Yuan thought to himself. This "fullness" is not a fullness of power, but a fundamental fullness. Lin Yuan's Yang had always been superior to his Yin.</p><p></p><p>Even with the mutual transformation of Yang and Yin, the Yin has always been in a lagging state overall.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what great Dao is recorded in the 'Mysterious Yin Classics' of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation?" Lin Yuan was quite looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The "Mysterious Yin Classics" is the supreme classic of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, originating from the Mysterious Yin Ancestor, and is on par with the highest inheritance of the Scorching Yang Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, the true bodies of the two powerful figures, the Northern Yin and Extreme Cold, opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>As Heavenly Revered Ones, as long as they are willing to serve the ancient nation, they are basically appointed as kings and have a royal palace in the capital.</p><p></p><p>"That Silver River has actually become a Heavenly Revered One?" The Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One still found it hard to believe. The shackles that the core royal families of the six major ancient nations could not cross for countless years were broken by Silver River.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin," the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One immediately sent a manifestation to the Northern Yin's royal palace to discuss the next steps with the Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One.</p><p></p><p>In the Northern Yin royal palace, in a pavilion, the Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One was sitting there, and the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One was sitting opposite him.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin, what should we do now?" the Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>They had secretly intervened, but gained nothing, and their main combat physical bodies were left behind.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?" The Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One sighed inwardly. If he had known that Heavenly Revered One Silver River was so monstrous, he would never have had any thoughts about the Black Jade's Nest.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that with Heavenly Revered One Silver River taking control of the Black Jade's Nest, this first-class treasure land would be weakened, but unexpectedly, it was not only not weakened, but even stronger than when the Scorching Yang Heavenly Revered One was guarding it.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Scorching Yang Heavenly Revered One was already approaching that of the supreme Heavenly Revered Ones, but his methods were biased towards frontal assault, and at most he could only severely injure the two of them.</p><p></p><p>As for holding them back? That was impossible.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's external universe suppression had restricted the two Heavenly Revered Ones to death in the Black Jade's Nest.</p><p></p><p>"There's no choice, we can only report the truth to the Emperor," the Northern Yin Heavenly Revered One thought for a while and said.</p><p></p><p>"Report the truth to the Emperor?" The Extreme Cold Heavenly Revered One fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This meant that they would certainly be punished by the Emperor. Arbitrarily interfering with a first-class treasure land and breaking the unwritten rules between the two ancient nations, even if the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation just went through the motions, the consequences would be severe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They would not let them off easily.</p><p></p><p>"If we don't confess, are we just waiting for the Leiyang Ancient Country to come after us with our personal weapons?"</p><p></p><p>The Northern Yin Celestial Master glanced at the Extreme Cold Celestial Master.</p><p></p><p>Although they had both extinguished their main combat bodies, their personal weapons were still there.</p><p></p><p>And among the Six Ancient Countries, the personal weapons of Celestial Master-level experts were highly distinctive. Relying on their personal weapons alone, it would be enough to confirm that the two of them had infiltrated the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the Northern Yin Celestial Master and the Extreme Cold Celestial Master had displayed their own strength within the Black Jade Nest. As long as a Celestial Master proficient in the Dao of Time went there, they could trace back the scenes and expose them.</p><p></p><p>"Can we make a deal with that Silver River Celestial Master, so that he doesn't spread this matter?" The Extreme Cold Celestial Master pondered for a while and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"A deal." The Northern Yin Celestial Master thought about it, "Let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>So far, only the three of them knew about this matter. As long as the Silver River Celestial Master didn't say anything, outsiders wouldn't know.</p><p></p><p>Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was contemplating the spoils of war he had harvested.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up at the distance.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A manifestation of Lin Yuan descended to the border between the two ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the manifestations of the Northern Yin Celestial Master and the Extreme Cold Celestial Master were also standing there.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want from me?" Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the two Celestial Masters of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country and said casually.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Master." The Northern Yin Celestial Master looked at Lin Yuan, "Can you keep today's matter a secret?"</p><p></p><p>"Keep it a secret?" Lin Yuan understood why the Northern Yin Celestial Master wanted him to keep it a secret, "What can you give me?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Silver River Celestial Master keeps today's matter a secret, then I and the Extreme Cold will owe you a favor." The Northern Yin Celestial Master spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we'll owe you a favor." The Extreme Cold Celestial Master also said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Just a favor?" Lin Yuan looked at the two Celestial Masters.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the two Celestial Masters from invading the Black Jade Nest and leaving their main combat bodies behind would also be rewarded with no small merit in the Leiyang Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>With such merits, Lin Yuan could easily exchange for more Leiyang inheritance techniques in the Leiyang Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want, Silver River Celestial Master?" The Northern Yin Celestial Master asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yin Scriptures." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible." The Northern Yin Celestial Master immediately shook his head, "I have already sworn an oath to the Ancestor, I cannot pass down this inheritance."</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like that, you have no bargaining value with me." Lin Yuan's figure directly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with enemy Celestial Masters always had risks, and it was easy to be threatened by the other party afterwards.</p><p></p><p>If he had something as supreme as the Mysterious Yin Scriptures, Lin Yuan wouldn't mind taking a risk.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear that the Northern Yin Celestial Master and the Mysterious Yin Celestial Master couldn't offer anything that would tempt Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan didn't bother continuing the negotiation and transaction.</p><p></p><p>Capital of the Leiyang Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>"According to the merit exchange standard set by the ancient country, the main combat bodies of two Celestial Masters are worth 500,000 merits each."</p><p></p><p>"The main combat bodies of the two Celestial Masters are worth 1 million merits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the previous battles in the Qingfen Domain and the Purple Dream Domain, where Lin Yuan single-handedly turned the tide, only earned him a little over 10,000 merits.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't leave the merits unclaimed, and directly went to the imperial palace to see the ancient country's emperor.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall.</p><p></p><p>The Leiyang Ancient Country's emperor looked at Lin Yuan with a smile on his face: "Silver River, what can I do for you?"</p><p></p><p>"The Black Jade Nest I was guarding was infiltrated by two Celestial Masters from the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Two Celestial Masters infiltrated?" The emperor's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The black jade in the Black Jade Nest had a great tempering effect on the mental will of Celestial Master-level experts, so it was not surprising that Celestial Masters were attracted to it. Previously, the Black Jade Nest was guarded by the Blazing Yang Celestial Master, a veteran Celestial Master with rich experience, so enemy Celestial Masters didn't even have a chance to infiltrate.</p><p></p><p>"Which two Celestial Masters were they?"</p><p></p><p>The emperor asked.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin and Extreme Cold." Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>There were only a few Celestial Masters in the Mysterious Yin Ancient Country, so it was easy to identify them.</p><p></p><p>"So it was them."</p><p></p><p>The emperor nodded slightly: "It's fine, this time it can be considered a lesson. I will give you a nominal punishment, but still let you guard the Black Jade Nest."</p><p></p><p>The emperor looked at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Nest nurtured precious black jade, and being plundered once was not a big deal. The emperor also wanted to use this opportunity to temper Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the lost black jade? In the long run, it was not a serious loss, after all, the Black Jade Nest was still there, and it could continue to nurture precious black jade endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Punishment?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback, and immediately realized that the emperor must have misunderstood, thinking that he had failed to guard the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>"The black jade was not plundered by those two Celestial Masters."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't plundered?"</p><p></p><p>The emperor looked at Lin Yuan, his brow furrowing.</p><p></p><p>"Northern Yin and Extreme Cold were left behind by me. The main combat bodies of the two Celestial Masters should be worth a total of 1 million merits?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the emperor and said. The distribution of merits involving Celestial Master-level experts had to be approved by the emperor.</p><p></p><p>The emperor of the Leiyang Ancient Country was still puzzled why the two Celestial Masters who had infiltrated did not plunder the black jade, but after hearing the explanation, he looked at Lin Yuan with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

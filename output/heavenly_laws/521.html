        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Three million chaos stones," Lin Yuan assessed his wealth.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he only had a few thousand chaos stones in his possession, which were left to him by the peak Sovereign realm powerhouse 'Cang Weiyang'.</p><p></p><p>In order to buy that golden box related to the Xuanhuang lineage, Lin Yuan planned to gather as close to three million chaos stones as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll have to sell some weapons and treasures," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He currently had many extra weapons and treasures, but most were at the Path-breaking realm level. Only a few Sovereign realm weapons and secret treasures originated from 'Cang Weiyang'.</p><p></p><p>"First, I'll send these weapons and treasures to the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, then sell them and see if it's enough." Lin Yuan selected some unused weapons and treasures from his treasury.</p><p></p><p>If the chaos stones obtained from selling these weapons and treasures were still not enough, Lin Yuan planned to sell a few Sovereign realm spirit trees.</p><p></p><p>As for that Chaos realm secret treasure? He'd rather not sell it if possible, after all, Lin Yuan would be able to use it once he reached the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>"Still short on chaos stones," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's current understanding and mastery of chaos energy, he could do what Chaos Lords do - directly refine chaos stones from chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>But being able to do it is one thing, efficiency is another matter.</p><p></p><p>Without the powerful willpower of a Chaos Lord, and the support of an internal universe, the chaos stones Lin Yuan could refine in a year probably wouldn't exceed ten.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his hand and tore open a spatial rift, penetrating all layers of space, connecting the universe to the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>He then threw out the many treasures he had selected, and with a thought, an avatar condensed outside the spatial rift in the chaos void, receiving the various treasures.</p><p></p><p>Now even Lin Yuan's avatar had peak Path-breaking realm combat power, more than enough to roam the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the dozens of meters long spatial rift in front of him quickly healed.</p><p></p><p>After tearing through all the spatial layers of the universe, Lin Yuan could easily form a permanent spatial rift if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"Each strand of boundary-breaking source power needs ninety days to accumulate, is that already the limit, unable to improve further?" Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>Since breaking through to the twelfth level, Lin Yuan had tried to increase the speed of accumulating boundary-breaking source power, to tear open larger permanent spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>But the efficiency of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds in accumulating boundary-breaking source power still remained at one strand every ninety days, with no further increase.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be requirements for absorbing boundary-breaking source power that I don't know about?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actively connected to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected human supreme being, the Goddess of Wisdom is pleased to serve you." The solemn and cool voice of the Goddess of Wisdom sounded.</p><p></p><p>The core parts of the three goddesses of human civilization originated from that event where countless treasures fell from outside the universe, which was one of the greatest fortunes obtained by human civilization. They possessed mental power and computing power comparable to Sovereign realm beings.</p><p></p><p>That's why they could support the nearly endless major and minor decisions of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Upload the twelfth level Path-breaking chapter," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>He had basically perfected and pioneered the Path-breaking chapter of the twelfth level of martial arts, and could upload it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether or not to upload the twelfth level Path-breaking realm of martial arts didn't mean much, since besides Lin Yuan's demise, there was no other martial arts cultivator who could break through to the twelfth level of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"When there's time, I can pioneer branches of martial arts," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>An evolution path is equivalent to a great Dao. If this Dao is wide enough, it can branch out into many paths.</p><p></p><p>These branches are also considered great Daos. Based on martial arts, they head in different directions, and can also give birth to twelfth level beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the premise is that the foundation of this Dao is thick enough. It's like branches of a river - if it's just a small stream, even if there are branches they can't go far. But if it's a great river, even just a branch would be much wider than a small stream.</p><p></p><p>"The branch Daos derived from martial arts as the foundation can also benefit me," Lin Yuan realized the advantages of his own path being widely spread during his ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>That was being able to maintain oneself and never fall, which was much more difficult than having unlimited lifespan.</p><p></p><p>With the upload of the twelfth level Path-breaking chapter of martial arts, the martial arts evolution path successfully became the number one evolution path of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This didn't cause any surprise, and even in the eyes of countless evolvers in human civilization, including the nine supreme beings, it was extremely normal and expected.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts evolution path had already ranked fifth among humans with just the eleventh level chapter uploaded. Now with the twelfth level Path-breaking chapter uploaded, it would be strange if it wasn't number one.</p><p></p><p>Martial Arts Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Tower Lord, this is the list of all those who have made contributions to human civilization since its birth and have already passed away," Zhang Tianzhi said respectfully as he stood below.</p><p></p><p>As the first eighth level of the martial arts evolution path, Zhang Tianzhi immediately joined the Martial Arts Evolution Tower. Although limited by his strength, his status wasn't high, he had successfully entered Lin Yuan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the list, which densely recorded the names of billions of humans.</p><p></p><p>Although the Star Sea Calendar of human civilization was only over two million years old, the true history far exceeded this number. Over such a long time...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>During that time, how many humans were born? Even if only a small percentage contributed to human civilization, the total number was still enormous.</p><p></p><p>"Tower Master, you plan to resurrect them," Zhang Tianzhi asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"These people made contributions to human civilization, so of course they can be resurrected," Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when human civilization resurrected deceased evolvers, there were many prerequisites. First was potential, second was strength, and lastly was contribution. </p><p></p><p>All three were indispensable, which was also for the consideration of the nine supreme beings of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>When supreme beings resurrected the dead, they would face backlash from the universe. One or two was fine, even hundreds or thousands were okay, but in large numbers, even supreme beings couldn't withstand it and would suffer some injuries.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's life essence was unprecedentedly powerful. Even if he resurrected eleventh-level beings, he could easily neutralize and ignore the backlash he would endure. So he planned to lower the resurrection threshold and extend the time range.</p><p></p><p>It could also be considered a benefit that the deceased ancestors of human civilization deserved to enjoy.</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>All evolvers of human civilization at the ninth level and above gathered outside the Martial Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>When supreme beings resurrected the dead, they needed to go against the flow, involving the manifestation of rules related to time and space. Observing this would provide evolvers with insights.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when supreme beings from various evolution towers performed resurrections, many evolvers would also come to watch. Lin Yuan had personally witnessed Supreme Being Xia Qin perform a resurrection before.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way Supreme Being is going to resurrect the deceased of our human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the scope of the Milky Way Supreme Being's resurrection this time is unprecedentedly broad. As long as someone made even a small contribution to human civilization, regardless of their potential or strength, they're all on the resurrection list."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, resurrecting so many people, how much backlash will he have to endure?"</p><p></p><p>The many evolvers of human civilization discussed among themselves. Now that human civilization occupied the entire universe, there naturally wasn't an issue of resource scarcity.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan and Supreme Being Xia Qin also arrived. They had originally planned to help Lin Yuan share some of the pressure, but were refused.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had previously resurrected his former relatives and friends in the immortal realm, but the river of time in the immortal realm was completely different from the river of time in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the river of time in the main universe was only a tributary of the river of time in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to go against the flow. With the resurrection list, he was intimately familiar with the life essence aura of every human evolver that needed to be resurrected. Lin Yuan began to continuously fish people out of the vast river of time.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, wake up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan exerted a bit of force, and over ten billion evolvers were forcibly fished out, returning to the current time period.</p><p></p><p>In each moment, over ten billion evolvers were resurrected. In just a few breaths, the number of resurrected evolvers exceeded ten trillion.</p><p></p><p>"How is it that when the universe's backlash reaches the Milky Way Star Lord, it doesn't even cause a ripple?" Many eleventh-level evolvers were shocked.</p><p></p><p>With the resurrection of ten billion lives, the universe's river of time was almost boiling locally. Enormous backlash pressed down on the Milky Way Supreme Being, but it didn't even lift the corner of Lin Yuan's clothes.</p><p></p><p>"His life essence is too strong. I feel that if it weren't for the fact that our life essences are not in the river of time, the Milky Way Supreme Being could even resurrect us."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings were also extremely amazed. They had performed many resurrections and knew what the universe's backlash was like. Resurrecting ten billion lives would directly severely injure even a supreme being, let alone Lin Yuan resurrecting at the ten billion level each time.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, after a few breaths, the number of resurrected lives exceeded ten trillion.</p><p></p><p>"I, I've been resurrected?"</p><p></p><p>"Has my human civilization reached its ultimate form?"</p><p></p><p>Countless human evolvers from eras long before the Stellar Sea opened their eyes wide. In their era, human civilization didn't even have twelfth-level beings. They never imagined they would have a chance to be resurrected.</p><p></p><p>"I, I've been resurrected too?"</p><p></p><p>A cold-faced man looked astonished. His name was 'Ou Yin', and he had perished at the hands of Black Abyss Qingyu. Originally, based on his potential, talent and strength, he had no qualifications to be resurrected at all.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Supreme Being..."</p><p></p><p>Ou Yin looked up and saw a towering figure slowly lowering his head to look in his direction, revealing a kind smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Milky Way Star Lord obtain the legacy I left on the alien battlefield back then?"</p><p></p><p>Ou Yin immediately understood the cause and effect, and felt an indescribable emotion rise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"That's about all of them resurrected."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swept his gaze over the densely packed newly resurrected lives, then looked at the many eleventh-level evolvers beside him. He assigned them the task of arranging these resurrected lives, then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Martial Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Everything has been taken care of more or less," Lin Yuan let out a light breath. "Now I can properly explore that source world."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Lin Yuan divided his consciousness and sank into the depths of his mind, gazing at that majestic and grand Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

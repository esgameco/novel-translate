            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 468 The Sixth Bodily Spiritual Attainment</p><p></p><p>Inside the Grade-A Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace requests you to refine fifty Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"Is he willing to offer three portions of 'Immortal Source' as remuneration?"</p><p></p><p>Below, Yun Zhenzi cautiously asked.</p><p></p><p>As the 'steward' of this immortal abode, he handled many trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hide most things from Yun Zhenzi.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought he would not have a chance to obtain 'Immortal Source' in the short term, and could not acquire it through normal means.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace actively offered 'Immortal Source' as remuneration?</p><p></p><p>This saved Lin Yuan a lot of trouble, at least he did not need to act personally.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace"</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi thought for a moment, and couldn't help but say, "Master, they say the Patriarch of the Nine Dragons Commerce Guild's Azure Dragon Hall is tyrannical, but in fact, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace is even more so."</p><p></p><p>"The nine Jade Immortal Lords of the Nine Dragons Commerce Guild do not dare to act rashly in front of the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi continued to ponder for a while, then said, "This time, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace is half-selling, half-gifting, offering three portions of Immortal Source as remuneration. Master still needs to be a little careful."</p><p></p><p>Normally, refining fifty Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs would not be worth three portions of Immortal Source, especially with the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace personally coming.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of thing had actually happened, which made Yun Zhenzi vaguely sense that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Careful?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind was calm.</p><p></p><p>If it was five hundred years ago, when his consciousness had just descended into the Immortal Realm, facing the towering Cangwu Immortal City, he would still need to be cautious and careful.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of areas in the entire Cangwu Immortal City were as fragile as thin paper before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace schemed against Lin Yuan, it would be meaningless in the face of absolute power.</p><p></p><p>And before the three portions of Immortal Source were in his hands, Lin Yuan would not hand over the refined Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs, the initiative was in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace left not long after.</p><p></p><p>A Gold Immortal from Cangwu Immortal City then brought a large batch of resources, which were the main materials and auxiliary medicines for refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir is so rare has two aspects.</p><p></p><p>One is that some of the main materials are scarce, and the other is that the refining difficulty is very high.</p><p></p><p>So it resulted in almost no circulation of Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs in the market. Those Elixir Refiners, after refining a Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, either kept it for themselves or sold it on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start refining directly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the main materials and auxiliary medicines, intending to act quickly.</p><p></p><p>Other Elixir Refiners, even the top-tier ones, if they wanted to open the furnace and refine a Heavenly Elixir like the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, they would at least need to sit in meditation for several months, adjusting their own state to perfection.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not need to go through this trouble, the 12th level of mental and spiritual strength allowed Lin Yuan to refine elixirs as smooth as the wind.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>In the immortal abode, Lin Yuan opened his eyes, the elixir furnace was rotating, fragrance wafting, an ordinary mortal who smelled it would directly be able to prolong their lifespan by millions of years.</p><p></p><p>The Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir could instantly heal any injury at the Gold Immortal level, and the tremendous life force it contained was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked it over and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, refining this batch of Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs was just a clone he had split off, his true body and two major spiritual beings were still continuing to comprehend various rules.</p><p></p><p>"Next, it will be to experience the Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Why is the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir called 'Nine-Cycle'? It is because to succeed in refining it, it needs to withstand nine Heavenly Tribulations.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the boundless destructive vitality in the Heavenly Tribulation, to complete the final step of refinement.</p><p></p><p>And the most difficult part of refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir is the Heavenly Tribulation, wanting to pass through nine Heavenly Tribulations requires extremely high demands on the Immortal Elixir itself.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of Nine-Cycle Golden Elixirs are destroyed in the Heavenly Tribulation, because the various medicinal powers within the Immortal Elixir have not been perfectly fused, and cannot withstand the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Cangwu Immortal City has a large number of immortals coming and going every day, mainly Tribulation Transcendence and Greater Ascension Realm cultivators, occasionally there are also Gold Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the huge immortal population, the number of Gold Immortals is very scarce, as for Jade Immortals?</p><p></p><p>Jade Immortals basically reside in the Grade-A Immortal Abode area, just by approaching a certain range of the Immortal City, they can directly enter the immortal abode through the Jade Immortal Talisman.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A suppressive force from the heavens and earth began to descend.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, strands of black tribulation clouds began to gather, and purple lightning surged like a long dragon.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p>"What is that?"</p><p>"It's the tribulation clouds, is someone going to undergo the Tribulation?"</p><p>"It's not a person undergoing the Tribulation, it's an Immortal Elixir, there is an Elixir Refiner refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir."</p><p></p><p>The many immortals quickly discussed, a few experienced immortals immediately recognized the origin of the tribulation clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation of immortals and the Tribulation of Immortal Elixirs have subtle differences.</p><p></p><p>And the Tribulation of Immortal Elixirs? The most famous one is the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, this life-saving Immortal Elixir is greatly coveted by even Gold Immortals and Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, yes, I've seen the scenes of Elixir Refiners refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir a few times, many of them fell at the final Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which Elixir Refiner in our Cangwu Immortal City is opening the furnace to refine the Elixir."</p><p></p><p>The immortals carefully observed, the scene of Elixir Refiners refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir was not common, they took the opportunity to watch for a while, perhaps they could gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"The Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir?"</p><p>"Is Yun Zhenzi refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir?"</p><p></p><p>In another Grade-A Immortal Abode, the Patriarch of the Azure Dragon Hall of the Nine Dragons Commerce Guild also sensed the aura of the tribulation clouds.</p><p></p><p>For Jade Immortals, they could easily feel the range that the tribulation clouds in the sky were targeting, which was precisely the immortal abode where Yun Zhenzi was.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace requested Grandmaster Yun Zhenzi to refine the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir," the white-haired elder beside him said.</p><p></p><p>He had a wide network and knew many hidden information and intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"I know about this matter," the Azure Dragon Hall Patriarch nodded.</p><p></p><p>After his falling out with Yun Zhenzi, the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace had specifically asked him about the conditions Yun Zhenzi had proposed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace has great trust in Grandmaster Yun Zhenzi," the white-haired elder smiled.</p><p></p><p>With the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace's level, he could completely invite a top-tier Elixir Refiner to refine the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he chose Yun Zhenzi? This could only be described as great trust.</p><p></p><p>The Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, how important is it? Surely he would let a trusted Elixir Refiner refine it, otherwise if the refinement failed, the loss of the many main materials and auxiliary medicines would be huge.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, trust alone is not enough, the Elixir Refiner's own strength is still needed," the Azure Dragon Hall Patriarch said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He had just fallen out with Yun Zhenzi, and the Patriarch of the Immortal Transcendence Palace had immediately contacted Yun Zhenzi, which made the Azure Dragon Hall Patriarch's face a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>"To succeed in refining the Nine-Cycle Golden Elixir, it must withstand nine Heavenly Tribulations."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder nodded, "From this, we can see..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On this aspect, one can see the attainments of a great Elixir Master. The highest-level Elixir Masters can perfectly blend the various medicinal properties within the Nine Cycles Golden Elixir, allowing them to easily traverse the Nine Heavenly Tribulations. Elixir Masters who are slightly inferior...</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder had not finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the black tribulation clouds above the azure sky, the Heavenly Tribulations began to descend.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Streams of white, blue, and purple lightning surged into the Intermediate-grade Immortal Abode where Lin Yuan was located.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, the Nine Heavenly Tribulations had all concluded, and the black tribulation clouds in the azure sky began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>A rich fragrance of the Elixir gradually permeated half of the Sanguang Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Has the refinement succeeded?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder paused, as the Nine Heavenly Tribulations had been completed, and the aroma of the Elixir had emerged, indicating the successful refinement of the Nine Cycles Golden Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Cycles Golden Elixir refined by Master Yunzhenzi this time is of very high quality, which many top-tier Elixir Masters may not be able to achieve."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder gently inhaled the Elixir fragrance and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not an Elixir Master, he was quite familiar with various immortal Elixirs. The instantaneous Elixir fragrance that emerged during the refinement of the Nine Cycles Immortal Elixir was enough to reveal the high quality of the Elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>"High quality?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Azure Dragon Association fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Although he was unwilling to believe it, he had reached a similar conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Dragon Association Leader, you should have accepted Master Yunzhenzi's conditions. With just a hundred million top-grade Immortal Crystals, if the twenty Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs refined are of this quality, it would be a huge profit."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired elder spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Among the Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs, the quality varies. The highest-quality Nine Cycles Golden Elixir can instantly heal all injuries of a Golden Immortal, and even have a significant effect on Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>For Elixir Masters, occasionally refining one or two Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs may be due to luck. But refining a batch of high-quality Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs is a testament to their profound cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The batch of Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs refined by Yunzhenzi clearly shows that his Elixir refinement attainments far surpass ordinary Elixir Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say that Yunzhenzi is just an ordinary Elixir Master?" The Azure Dragon Association Leader frowned, looking at the white-haired elder.</p><p></p><p>If the white-haired elder had clearly stated that Yunzhenzi was also a top-tier Elixir Master, the Azure Dragon Association Leader might have agreed to Yunzhenzi's conditions.</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't know." The white-haired elder was somewhat helpless. Who could have thought that Yunzhenzi, who had disappeared for nearly a million years, would have made such rapid progress in Elixir refinement?</p><p></p><p>"Then what now?" The white-haired elder looked at the Azure Dragon Association Leader tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Help me contact Master Yunzhenzi again, and tell him that I agree to his conditions." The Azure Dragon Association Leader immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not reached a cooperation agreement earlier, the Azure Dragon Association Leader felt that Yunzhenzi would not refuse the top-grade Immortal Crystals.</p><p></p><p>Refining twenty Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs would earn him a hundred million top-grade Immortal Crystals as compensation, which even a top-tier Elixir Master would find hard to refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll try." The white-haired elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the Intermediate-grade Immortal Abode, Lin Yuan looked at the thirteen round golden Immortal Elixirs before him.</p><p></p><p>The vigorous life force was circulating within each Immortal Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Nine Cycles Immortal Elixir?" Lin Yuan, who was refining such a high-level Elixir for the first time, carefully examined them for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Refining thirteen Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs in one batch, I should have fully utilized the main and auxiliary materials." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even the most top-tier Elixir Masters would not be able to use every bit of the medicinal properties. In a batch of Nine Cycles Golden Elixir, they would at most succeed in refining five or six Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The remaining medicinal properties would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. Even though he was just an insignificant incarnation, with his firm will and determination, he could perfectly utilize every bit of the medicinal properties to refine the Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>This is why he was able to refine thirteen Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs in one batch.</p><p></p><p>"With my current refinement efficiency, the batch of main and auxiliary materials given to me by the Palace Master of the Immortal Celestial Palace, I can easily refine over a hundred Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The agreement with the Palace Master of the Immortal Celestial Palace was to refine fifty Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs using those main and auxiliary materials.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had refined over a hundred Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs, so the fifty he would give to the Palace Master would be the remaining ones he could keep for himself.</p><p></p><p>This would be a huge cultivation resource for Lin Yuan, and with the rarity of the Nine Cycles Golden Elixir, he could exchange them for resources like the 'Immortal Source' that are not circulated on the market.</p><p></p><p>"Elixir refinement is truly lucrative," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This Elixir refinement only took him a month, and it was just the time of one of his incarnations, yet he had harvested more than ten of the highest-quality Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs. If sold on the market, they could fetch tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of top-grade Immortal Crystals.</p><p></p><p>This kind of wealth accumulation efficiency is unmatched by even the most ruthless plundering.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the many risks and hidden dangers that come with plundering.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>After completing the batch of Nine Cycles Golden Elixir refinement, Lin Yuan received a summons from Yunzhenzi.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Lin Yuan appeared on the throne, looking down at Yunzhenzi.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Dragon Association Leader wants to see the Master again, saying that he has agreed to the conditions, and is willing to give out ten million Immortal Crystals, only asking the Master to help him refine the Elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Yunzhenzi immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"He's agreed to the conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. "The conditions have changed now."</p><p></p><p>"If the Nine Dragon Merchant Association wants me to refine twenty Nine Cycles Golden Elixirs, they'll have to pay fifty million top-grade Immortal Crystals as compensation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Just now, after successfully refining the Nine Cycles Golden Elixir, at least dozens of forces from the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms had requested him to help refine the Nine Cycles Golden Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan no longer cared about the Azure Dragon Association's measly ten million Immortal Crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Yunzhenzi nodded and disappeared from the spot to convey the message to the Azure Dragon Association Leader.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation area of the Immortal Abode, Lin Yuan was mainly observing the irregular rift in the azure sky, while a small portion of his spiritual focus was comprehending the divine imprint the size of a palm, which seemed to be composed of endless arrays of symbols, deep within his body.</p><p></p><p>This divine imprint was the sixth Flesh Cultivation Technique that Lin Yuan had awakened during his journey in the Immortal Realm, using this physical body and bloodline as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous five Flesh Cultivation Techniques, this sixth one that Lin Yuan had awakened was more inclined towards the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally fully comprehended this divine imprint."</p><p></p><p>The profound and complex divine imprint within Lin Yuan's body no longer had any secrets, and its many mysteries were now fully revealed to him.</p><p></p><p>To bring the Flesh Cultivation Techniques back to his main universe, he must fully comprehend the corresponding divine imprints.</p><p></p><p>And just now, Lin Yuan had completely comprehended this divine imprint.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Flesh Cultivation Techniques Lin Yuan possessed, the comprehension time of this one was the longest, taking him five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"This technique..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan extended his right hand, and a stream of awe-inspiring energy began to swirl around his fingertips.</p>

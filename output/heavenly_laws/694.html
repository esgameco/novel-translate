        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>Even those eternally blessed sons, if they encountered one of the three grand paintings, they would be pressed and defeated. Let alone all three of them?</p><p></p><p>Especially the last one, which was painted by the Lord of Wu Mountain based on the prototype of the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Celestial Light is not only the mightiest eternal lord in this world, but also the most mysterious eternal lord.</p><p></p><p>No one knows the past of the Lord of Celestial Light. It is only clear that when the Lord of Celestial Light first appeared, he had already become an eternal lord. The other eternal lords, including the Lord of Wu Mountain, in a strict sense, have all received the grace of the Lord of Celestial Light.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Dao of Runes was passed down by the Lord of Celestial Light, and the other eternal lords were not the founders of the Great Dao of Runes.</p><p></p><p>"Can I use any technique I want?" Lin Yuan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what techniques you use, as long as they originate from your own strength, you can pass the test by entering the central entrance of the world."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure said, "There are no restrictions."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"My suggestion, you can listen to it or not."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure added, in his view, the only hope for Lin Yuan to pass the test was to completely transcend the rules of space-time fusion.</p><p></p><p>But this was just a suggestion, the golden figure could not force Lin Yuan to follow his advice.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the three grand paintings. "Can I try it now?"</p><p></p><p>"You can."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Whether he can block it or not, the previous test takers would always try to engage the powerful beings within the paintings first.</p><p></p><p>After all, these three grand paintings were considered the pinnacle of the Carefree Realms by the Lord of Wu Mountain. Even if they were not opponents, they could still witness their might.</p><p></p><p>There would be no danger anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan. "Within a thousand myriad li of the entrance, the powerful being in the first grand painting will emerge. Within a hundred myriad li of the entrance, the powerful being in the second grand painting will emerge. Within ten myriad li of the entrance, the powerful being in the third grand painting will emerge."</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the closer to the entrance, the greater the obstruction, especially within ten myriad li of the entrance, where the powerful beings from all three grand paintings will come out to block the way.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately flew towards the central part of the world.</p><p></p><p>The closer he got, the more he could feel the immensity and wonder of the grand paintings.</p><p></p><p>"These powerful beings in the three grand paintings, were they all painted by the Lord of Wu Mountain, created out of thin air?" Lin Yuan was slightly amazed, at least the six progenitors of the Source World did not have such abilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, each of the Thirteenth-Tier Lives excelled in different areas, and the Lord of Wu Mountain was proficient in the Dao of Painting, which was essentially the creation of the void.</p><p></p><p>And in terms of killing power, compared to the other eternal lords, he might be a bit inferior. Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived within a thousand myriad li of the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Ripples suddenly appeared as the first grand painting unfurled, the scene seeming to come alive like the surface of water.</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth, as if awakened, moved his hands and directly stepped out of the painting.</p><p></p><p>"You are the three thousand six hundred and thirty-fifth test taker."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth lazily looked at Lin Yuan and shook his head, "But it seems you can't even get past me here."</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching within a hundred myriad li of the entrance would the powerful being from the second grand painting emerge.</p><p></p><p>And during this time, the golden-armored youth would obstruct Lin Yuan from getting closer.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly serious. This was the first time he had encountered a powerful being on par with the 'Abyss Dragon'.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth burst into laughter, his aura suddenly surging, and countless runes began to appear on his golden armor, causing the surrounding space-time to condense and solidify.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of Dao of Runes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, the golden-armored youth's mastery of the Dao of Runes far surpassed any rune inheritance Lin Yuan had obtained. The terrifying aura was almost crushing the space-time into particle form.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth raised his right hand and pressed down towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space-time instantly transformed into countless runes, instantly enveloping Lin Yuan. An ordinary Carefree Third Realm expert would be completely immobilized and suppressed by this.</p><p></p><p>Yes, an ordinary Carefree Third Realm expert would not even have the strength to block the golden-armored youth's first attack, let alone break through.</p><p></p><p>"Expressing space-time with runes?"</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in Lin Yuan's eyes, and he took a step back, easily evading the golden-armored youth's grab.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, Lin Yuan had been constantly contemplating the operation of the Source World's primal origin. His understanding of the rules of space-time fusion was nearing its limit. Even though he had no hope of entering the entrance, he could still easily block the golden-armored youth's attack.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth was slightly taken aback, obviously not expecting Lin Yuan to be so "slippery".</p><p></p><p>"Your comprehension of space-time is not bad." The golden-armored youth praised, then spoke calmly, "But it's still far from enough."</p><p></p><p>Rumbling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Countless golden runes filled the surroundings from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The runes intertwined and flowed, gradually forming a massive golden cage.</p><p></p><p>"This move?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became more serious. Even with his understanding of space-time, breaking free from this golden cage would require considerable effort, and during that time, the golden-armored youth's attacks would have already arrived.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of crashing.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly transformed into an eternal blazing sun. As the solar divine spirit, the power of this killing move was immense.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The divine ability 'World' also activated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The golden cage began to tremble, and then shattered with a loud noise. The next strike from the golden-armored youth then came thundering.</p><p></p><p>With the restraint of the golden cage lifted, Lin Yuan smoothly merged into the space-time and evaded.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of method, I haven't seen it before?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth was slightly surprised. Since the calamity descended, he had seen many challengers over the long years, but someone like Lin Yuan who could transform into a blazing sun and possess such tyrannical control and distortion of space-time, this was the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, very interesting."</p><p></p><p>"But strength is the foundation of everything."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth continued his attack, with golden runes permeating the space-time.</p><p></p><p>From start to finish, since the golden-armored youth made his move, Lin Yuan had been at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention breaking through, even just holding on in front of the golden-armored youth was quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>"This time of descent, all resources were prioritized for the true body and the two divine spirits were neglected," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Yin divine spirit or the Yang divine spirit, neither had opened a particle world, nor had they invested much resources in cultivating the cosmic universe within the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The 'Infinite Void' had caught up, but even the 'Infinite Void' cultivation, upon reaching the fifth layer, could only be comparable to a normal invincible great saint or supreme celestial lord. It was just the third realm of this source world.</p><p></p><p>While the golden-armored youth was an existence that surpassed the Eternal Sons.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, for Lin Yuan's Yang divine spirit to be able to persist for so long in front of the golden-armored youth was already considered rare.</p><p></p><p>Under the full-force attack of the golden-armored youth, an Untamed Third Realm expert, which was an invincible great saint or supreme celestial lord, could not withstand it at all and was quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Solar Force."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan transformed into a blazing sun again as the Yang divine spirit. As a pure sun, he could not rely on the Yin path, so the chaotic evolution path was not a perfect chaotic Taiji, but a single chaotic sun.</p><p></p><p>The blazing sun burned, consuming the heavens and earth, and the space-time in all directions rapidly transformed, all under his domain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even the golden runes permeating the space-time released by the golden-armored youth were retreating.</p><p></p><p>"This move?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth rarely stopped his hand, carefully observing for a while, and then nodded approvingly: "Rare, rare indeed. This power of the chaotic evolution path, although extreme, is truly powerful."</p><p></p><p>This source world uses runes as the foundation to sense all things, and also comprehends the rules of the Dao and the power of the chaotic evolution path.</p><p></p><p>In the golden-armored youth's eyes, even the single chaotic solar force was enough to be astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"With the path you have taken, if you cultivate to the limit, you should be able to reach the Eternal Son realm." The golden-armored youth's tone gradually became colder: "But you are still far from it."</p><p></p><p>"Go back and continue to cultivate for billions of years before coming back."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth waved his hand, and endless golden runes swept in again, with majestic power that instantly crushed Lin Yuan's outer universe.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Lin Yuan was instantly pushed back millions of miles away, and it took several breaths for his aura to calm down.</p><p></p><p>And as Lin Yuan left the millions of miles range, the golden-armored youth turned around and walked out of the giant painting.</p><p></p><p>The golden runes dissipated, and everything returned to normal. Only Lin Yuan stood there, his expression sinking into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the untrained Yang divine spirit, it is indeed very difficult to pass the trial," Lin Yuan concluded. The golden-armored youth in the first giant painting alone could push him back, let alone the second and third giant paintings.</p><p></p><p>"How was it? How do you feel?" The golden figure appeared beside him, with a hint of admiration in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the strength Lin Yuan had just displayed in his clash with the golden-armored youth had already exceeded the golden figure's expectations, almost reaching the level of a normal Eternal Son.</p><p></p><p>"It's still best to follow my suggestion. Relying on direct strength, you have no hope of passing the trial. You can only have a chance by completely transcending the space-time fusion rules," the golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, completely transcending the space-time rules was a way to bypass the trial, as it meant not directly confronting the powerful beings in the three giant paintings, but completely relying on the supreme comprehension of space-time to enter the passage.</p><p></p><p>But the Lord of Mount Qingyun did not prohibit this method, and the golden figure was advising Lin Yuan in the direction most likely for him to pass the trial.</p><p></p><p>"Completely transcending the space-time fusion rules comprehension is too slow," Lin Yuan said honestly.</p><p></p><p>He really felt that this method was too slow. He didn't know if it would take a thousand years or ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow?" The golden figure was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was hope, what did a billion years or a hundred billion years matter? "I still have a method I haven't used."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure and said, "Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Qingyun Holy Mountain, Qingyun Academy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, slowly stood up, and then took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The space-time was instantly torn apart, and the terrifying power of the physical body and the vast cosmic aura within him permeated everything.</p><p></p><p>Outside the trial space, in the surrounding valley, runes began to light up one by one, and the space-time unfolded, as if resisting the intrusion of an unimaginable existence.</p><p></p><p>The entire trial space trembled.</p><p></p><p>It shook without stopping.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

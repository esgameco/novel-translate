        <h1>Chapter 696</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This sword strike?" </p><p></p><p>The man in white robes felt a chill run down his spine. His strength was superior to the powerful beings depicted in the previous two giant paintings.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when faced with the sword strike unleashed by Lin Yuan, he was not caught completely off guard and instantly annihilated, returning to the painting.</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes reacted in time, and in an instant, arrays of talismans permeated the void.</p><p></p><p>The talismans the man in white robes had condensed were exceptionally substantial and emanated an aura of boundless radiance.</p><p></p><p>But they were useless.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the black and white sword light that split the yin and yang of heaven and earth, all the talismans were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant,</p><p></p><p>The black and white sword light arrived before the man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes let out a light sigh and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after,</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes, like the powerful beings in the previous two giant paintings, had his form disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>However, unlike the golden-armored youth and the alluring woman, the disintegrated form of the man in white robes did not return to the painting.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it re-condensed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>His expression couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>Although that strike just now couldn't be considered his strongest killing move, it was still a full-power strike.</p><p></p><p>A full-power strike in his normal state.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, even if it were ten or a hundred abyssal dragons, they would not be able to withstand this strike.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this strike contained the Dao of the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji, possessing boundless destructive power. With a single strike, the physical body, spirit, and soul would all be annihilated, and at the very least, this true body could not be restored.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's comprehension, if his Dao of the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji cultivation reached the third layer, it would encompass causality, and the enemies he slew with this Dao would have their true bodies and main bodies affected by the pull of causality.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, any experts below the Thirteenth Realm were like helpless ants before Lin Yuan, having no means of saving their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much about it."</p><p></p><p>"You have passed the test."</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes looked at Lin Yuan, as if he had perceived something, and said, "I was able to re-condense my form by relying on the power of the giant paintings. If I didn't have the giant paintings, I would have been completely annihilated by your sword strike."</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes carefully examined Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As the most perfect and powerful life created by the Lord of the Wu Mountain, he had never been directly defeated by any existence since his birth.</p><p></p><p>Not even the Eternal Scions were an exception.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wu Mountain had opened up numerous test realms, and many powerful beings had come to undergo the tests since the great changes in heaven and earth, including some Eternal Scions and Heaven-Endowed Scions born under the threat of the Calamity.</p><p></p><p>But even among those who had passed the test, they had only managed to forcibly overcome the man in white robes through desperate means and methods to enter the entrance and pass the test.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Lin Yuan, who directly annihilated the man in white robes with a single sword strike, had never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes himself had never imagined that he would be so easily defeated by a being under the Eternal Lord, even those Primal Demons would not be able to achieve this level.</p><p></p><p>"You're too kind."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the man in white robes and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that the man in white robes was the strongest life form Lin Yuan had encountered so far below the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first abyssal dragon in the first source world was somewhat inferior to the man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the man in white robes had encountered Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years ago, Lin Yuan's strength had already surpassed the abyssal dragon and was not inferior to the current man in white robes.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the tremendous increase in his rule comprehension and methods after a thousand years of cultivation, and the opening of the hundred billion particle world.</p><p></p><p>The hundred billion particle world, which had been reshaped by the "Infinite Void", brought terrifying blessings to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After descending into this source world, Lin Yuan had gathered all resources and abandoned the cultivation of the two great divine souls, focusing on opening the particle world, which could also demonstrate the importance of this method to his advancement.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a matter of being too kind."</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes shook his head, "I am indeed not your match, far from it."</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes frankly admitted.</p><p></p><p>His gap with Lin Yuan was too large.</p><p></p><p>The sword strike that Lin Yuan had unleashed, after annihilating the golden-armored youth in the first giant painting and the alluring woman in the second giant painting, was still able to annihilate him.</p><p></p><p>It meant that he couldn't even block the residual power of that sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"You are the strongest among the six who have passed the test, and are likely the most powerful being under the Eternal Lord. I hope you can fulfill the expectations of the Lord of the Wu Mountain and completely eradicate the 'Calamity'."</p><p></p><p>The man in white robes looked at Lin Yuan, not knowing what he was thinking, and his form disintegrated, returning to the painting.</p><p></p><p>The reason he relied on the power of the giant paintings to re-condense his form was simply to see what the existence that had one-shot him was like.</p><p></p><p>Nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Completely eradicate the Calamity?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>According to the golden figure's implication,</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the Lord of the Wu Mountain in opening up numerous test realms</p><p></p><p>Was to cultivate a new Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>In other words, to eradicate the 'Calamity', one must become the new Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Although in the future timeline seen by the six progenitors of the first source world, Lin Yuan was almost certain to reach the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't have complete confidence, and Lin Yuan always felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Lin Yuan had been striving to break through to the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the steps, the reason for the descent to the second source world.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to gain more accumulation to impact the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was like other strong ones, the hope to impact the Thirteenth Realm would be slim.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he just went for it with a stubborn head, since everyone was the same, not afraid to go barefoot.</p><p></p><p>But the higher the grasp, the more cautious Lin Yuan became, because he was not just going barefoot.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the very center of the heavens and earth, in front of that small entrance door.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A golden figure appeared, standing beside the small entrance door.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you have successfully passed the test." The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past, the appearance of a cultivator who had passed the test would certainly make him joyful in mind and spirit, as it meant that the arrangement of the Lord of Mount Wu had taken effect.</p><p></p><p>If not a single test taker had passed and acquired the legacy left behind by the Lord of Mount Wu, then what would be the meaning of the existence of the many test spaces? However, the scene of Lin Yuan passing the test made the golden figure's cognition begin to shatter.</p><p></p><p>Although the descent of Lin Yuan's true self to the test space had already made the golden figure estimate highly enough.</p><p></p><p>But to slay the strong ones in the three giant paintings with a single sword, especially the last giant painting, which the Lord of Mount Wu believed to be the most perfect and strongest life under the Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man was the most perfect and strongest life under the Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Then what was Lin Yuan? Did this mean that the Lord of Mount Wu was wrong? But how could the lofty Eternal Lord, who could see through many future timelines, be wrong?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Lord of Mount Wu has seen this scene now."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lord could see through many future timelines, and the Lord of Mount Wu, when opening up the many test spaces, probably also watched through them once, and perhaps already knew how many test takers would pass the test in the coming billions of years.</p><p></p><p>Probably he had not seen Lin Yuan, and was muttering to himself inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He descended to this source world through the Myriad Realms Gate, and the Myriad Realms Gate transcended all timelines, not within the observation of the many time lives.</p><p></p><p>In the first source world, the six ancestors could not see the future appearance of Lin Yuan before his descent, not even in a single timeline, because they could not observe the Myriad Realms Gate, let alone determine that Lin Yuan would descend.</p><p></p><p>It was not until Lin Yuan completely descended to the first source world, appearing in the timeline of that source world, that by observing the timeline of Lin Yuan's descent, they could observe the timeline with Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>As for the past, from the timeline before Lin Yuan's descent, there was no trace of Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>This source world was the same.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had descended to this source world for more than a thousand years, while the Lord of Mount Wu had opened up the many test spaces before the great changes in heaven and earth, so from that time, he must have been unable to detect the slightest trace of Lin Yuan, let alone see the scene of Lin Yuan passing the test.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the principle was only known to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for those time lives? Probably it was just that their strength was limited? The timelines they observed were limited, and they did not discover Lin Yuan's existence in those timelines? In fact, as long as Lin Yuan did not descend to a certain source world, even if they observed all the timelines of that source world, there would be no trace of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Lord of Mount Wu now?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Before entering this test space, the golden figure had already answered some of Lin Yuan's doubts, such as the fact that the Demon God was not the true source of the 'Demon' disaster.</p><p></p><p>But what Lin Yuan wanted to know more, the golden figure was not convenient to tell him.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Mount Wu." The golden figure fell silent, thought for a while, and then said, "Since you have passed the test, it means that there is hope to clear the 'Demon' disaster, so many secrets can be told to you."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of Mount Wu, at the time of the great changes in heaven and earth, on the day the 'Demon' disaster descended, was trapped in a certain space-time." The golden figure said.</p><p></p><p>"Trapped in a certain space-time?" Lin Yuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>A mighty Thirteenth Realm time life could also be trapped? "It's not that he was trapped, but that the Lord of Mount Wu chose to be trapped." The golden figure thought for a moment and then spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A Thirteenth Realm time life who could observe future timelines must have seen the scene of himself being trapped.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Lord of Mount Wu was trapped was that he had weighed the results in many timelines, and the outcome of him being trapped was absolutely the best, so he was willing to be trapped.</p><p></p><p>"Not only the Lord of Mount Wu, but all the other Eternal Lords were also trapped, and they could not directly interfere with heaven and earth, but could only influence through the arrangements made before the great changes."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure continued.</p><p></p><p>"Were all the Eternal Lords trapped, or did they choose to be trapped willingly?" Lin Yuan's thoughts scattered. What could make all the Eternal Lords choose this outcome? "What was the reason for the trapping?" Lin Yuan asked further.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know that." The golden figure shook his head. "But as long as you become the new Eternal Lord, you will certainly know."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure finished speaking and looked towards the nearby small entrance door. "Since you have passed the test, you can obtain the legacy left by the Lord of Mount Wu."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure finished speaking, and the small entrance door emitted an invisible wave.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind merged, and in a daze, he saw a giant painting.</p><p></p><p>A painting that encompassed the universe and all beings.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

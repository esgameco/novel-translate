        <h1>Chapter 603</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Map... Is it Expanding?"</p><p></p><p>In the inner cosmic realm, Lin Yuan descended and manifested, observing the changes in the animal hide map before him.</p><p></p><p>As the aura of the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos gradually diffused outward, the map on the animal hide was clearly expanding and growing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the map only occupied one-fifth of the animal hide, but now it was expanding - one-quarter, one-third, and eventually half of the animal hide surface was covered by the map.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the mausoleum, many other regions have also appeared."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, and many regions had informative introductions.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a place called the Floating Stupa Tower, which was a place for tempering the physical body. Any being that approached this area would be enveloped by the power of the Floating Stupa, even Great Saints would be trapped for a moment.</p><p></p><p>There was also a place called the Nine Realms Pavilion, which connected the nine small worlds separately created by the Mysterious Emperor, housing some extraordinary life forms nurtured by the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>These were for the Mysterious Emperor's daily research.</p><p></p><p>"With this map, after entering the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, I will definitely have many advantages."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Other powerful experts, even those Chaotic Great Saints, would be completely in the dark after entering, not knowing where to go.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, they would not be clear about the locations and values of those regions.</p><p></p><p>Rushing in blindly, they might easily stumble into places like the Nine Realms Pavilion or the Floating Stupa Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Realms Pavilion connected nine small worlds, and if a Chaotic Great Saint accidentally entered, it would likely take a lot of effort to break free.</p><p></p><p>The Floating Stupa Tower was even more so, as the Floating Stupa power was no weaker than the Chaotic Evolutionary Force, a unique power of the Mysterious Yellow lineage used for tempering the body. If a Great Saint got trapped there, they would suffer greatly.</p><p></p><p>And in the newly opened Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, every moment was extremely precious. Being trapped for a while? By the time they got out, many precious resources might have already been taken.</p><p></p><p>"After I enter, I will follow this route."</p><p></p><p>According to the map, Lin Yuan formulated his route of entering the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos. The locations along these routes contained many precious treasures and rare weapons, which were the most profitable path he had planned.</p><p></p><p>To prevent himself from randomly appearing in some location in the cosmos after entering, Lin Yuan directly formulated more than ten routes, basically covering any possible situation.</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately, I must go to the mausoleum, where the Mysterious Emperor's most precious treasures are likely kept."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the central area of the map, which was the mausoleum that had initially appeared.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that this time the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos has opened, but not a single Mysterious Yellow Sanctuary Master has come?" Lin Yuan glanced outside, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Each being that had refined and mastered a Mysterious Yellow Sanctuary would have a slight connection with each other.</p><p></p><p>Refining a Mysterious Yellow Sanctuary was equivalent to becoming a disciple of the Mysterious Emperor, belonging to the Mysterious Yellow lineage, and they would naturally have the means to recognize each other.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it has been so many cosmic eras. Even if there are still Sanctuary Masters, they may not necessarily know that the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos has emerged. And even if they know, they may not be able to make it in time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was able to know that this cosmos was the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos because he had obtained the animal hide map. The two could resonate with each other.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have this animal hide, Lin Yuan would not be able to confirm that the newly emerged cosmos was the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>If the distance was too far, and the cost of coming was too great, they would most likely choose not to get involved.</p><p></p><p>And becoming a Mysterious Yellow Sanctuary Master was not an easy task. Lin Yuan could do it because of his extraordinary comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But for other beings from other cosmoses? It would be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Out of the 33,333 Mysterious Yellow Sanctuaries, how many had actually been refined and mastered, that was another matter.</p><p></p><p>Outside.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the spatial-temporal fabric at one corner of the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos revealed a glimpse of the inner aura, stirring the hearts of the many powerful experts waiting.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self was also closely monitoring this.</p><p></p><p>"It should take a few more days."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The collapse of the spatial-temporal fabric at that corner had caused a spatial-temporal storm within the cosmos. It would likely take a few more days before the conditions were suitable for entry.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>While most of Lin Yuan's attention was focused on that corner of the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, he suddenly noticed a powerful aura rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Saint Wind Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recognized the identity of the figure, a renowned Chaotic Realm Pinnacle Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Saint Wind Venerable were two other Chaotic Realm Pinnacle Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do not be alarmed, we mean no hostility," the Saint Wind Venerable immediately transmitted a message and stopped without approaching further.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want from me?" Lin Yuan looked at them.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you must have realized the extraordinary nature of this newly created cosmos. Its creator must be an incredible Great Saint." The Saint Wind Venerable said, "However, most of the precious treasures and rarities in this cosmos are destined to fall into the hands of the nine Great Saints."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Wind Venerable glanced at the nine figures closest to the Sanctuary.</p><p></p><p>At first, the auras of the Chaotic Great Saints were somewhat restrained, but now, as they were about to enter the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos, the nine Chaotic Great Saints no longer hid their terrifying auras, but instead fully unleashed them.</p><p></p><p>"We Chaotic Venerables can only follow behind the Great Saints and have a taste of the leftovers. Even then, we still need to be wary of other Venerables."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Wind Venerable sighed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine Chaotic Great Saints, they had to compete with each other. And among the Chaotic Venerables, the competition was even more intense.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the level of competition among the Venerables was far greater than that of the Great Saints, as there were only nine Great Saints, who would occupy most of the resources and treasures in the Mysterious Yellow Cosmos.</p><p></p><p>But the Chaotic Venerables? There were already more than a hundred of them, competing for the 'leftovers' that the Great Saints did not want. One could imagine how fierce the struggle would be.</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to say?" Lin Yuan looked at the Saint Wind Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I want to invite you to join us." The Saint Wind Venerable said, "We Chaotic Venerables need to work together, so that we can have an advantage in competing with the other Venerables."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we already have twelve Chaotic Venerables, and four of them are Pinnacle Venerables. If you join us, you will definitely not leave empty-handed this time."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Wind Venerable continued, "Of course, after joining us, all the gains from exploring this new cosmos will be under my control, and after the exploration is over, I will distribute them accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"Believe me, only by doing this can we maximize the gains, and it will only benefit you, with no downsides."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Saint Wind Venerable and shook his head, saying, "All the gains to be handed over to you for you to distribute?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had no intention of joining in the first place, Lin Yuan still felt a bit helpless. Were they just treating him as a free fighter? Who knows how the Saint Wind Venerable would distribute the gains?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested?" The Saint Wind Venerable was slightly taken aback. Before coming, he had already spoken to other Venerables, and they all agreed with his proposal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Chaos Lords gathered, and if some of these Lords could unite and work together, they would indeed have a great advantage.</p><p></p><p>Among the Chaos Lords, even the peak Lords, the gap between them is not very large, far from the vast chasm between the Great Sages and the Lords.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the numerical advantage becomes very important.</p><p></p><p>"You should think it over again," the Chaos Lord Shenfeng continued to say.</p><p></p><p>"I said, I'm not interested," Lin Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the choice is up to you." Shenfeng was silent for a while and did not continue to persuade him. "But let me remind you, going it alone will put you at a great disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>Shenfeng then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Shenfeng, you've actually been rejected?"</p><p></p><p>A peak Chaos Lord next to Shenfeng sneered, "Which realm does this Lord come from? Surely he's never even heard of Shenfeng's reputation?"</p><p></p><p>"Facing a great enemy, yet he doesn't want to join forces, but instead prepares to go it alone? How short-sighted!"</p><p></p><p>Shenfeng shook his head, his tone icy, "When this post-heaven universe fully opens, and many Lords rush in, he will know how mistaken he was to reject me."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, does he really think of himself as a Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Another peak Chaos Lord also said, feeling that Lin Yuan would eventually regret his decision.</p><p></p><p>They, the two peak Chaos Lords, had personally invited him, which was an immense honor. Yet Lin Yuan didn't even think about it before refusing? If it weren't for the imminent opening of the Xuanhuang Universe, and the many Lords around them, the two peak Lords would have planned to teach Lin Yuan a lesson.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's invite the next one."</p><p></p><p>Shenfeng continued to fly forward, and with each Lord they invited to join, their strength would increase, giving them more advantages in the upcoming struggle.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the layered space-time, the two-horned Great Sage Liangyuan looked towards that corner of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"The Altar Spirit said this post-heaven universe was opened by the Xuan Emperor Great Sage, and the Xuan Huang Great Sage is the closest to the invincible Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Lianguan thought to himself, it was precisely because of this information that he had rushed over, risking being slaughtered by the Altar Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"For the Altar Spirit to evaluate him so highly, the Xuan Emperor Great Sage's strength must be terrifying, almost able to dominate all the supreme Great Sages of that era."</p><p></p><p>"The post-heaven universe he left behind is worth my full effort to contend for."</p><p></p><p>Lianguan's gaze was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Altar Spirit is similar to the All-Seeing Eye, all related to the Thirteenth Realm life forms, and Lianguan was able to enter the space of the Altar Spirit by a fortuitous coincidence.</p><p></p><p>If one does not have enough luck, even a supreme Great Sage would be unable to contact the Altar Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I just need to watch out for Kuangman, Tianluo, and Heizhao - as for the other five..."  Lianguan glanced at the nine Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>He did not pay much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine Great Sages on the scene, they were clearly divided into three levels.</p><p></p><p>The first level was Lianguan, Kuangman, and Heizhao.</p><p></p><p>These three Great Sages were the strongest, especially Lianguan, whose path had a great chance of becoming a supreme Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>For a Chaos Great Sage to become a supreme Great Sage, it mainly depends on the path they walk.</p><p></p><p>If the path is not suitable, the Chaos Great Sage is destined to never become a supreme Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in terms of breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm, the gap between Chaos Great Sages and supreme Great Sages is not that large, the main difference is that supreme Great Sages have a deeper understanding and exploration of the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The second level was Tianluo and the other two Chaos Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>The third level was Yingmo, Jiufeng, and the other four newly ascended Chaos Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Why did that Lianguan come?" </p><p></p><p>The towering Kuangman glanced at Lianguan, feeling slightly troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, he had heard that Lianguan was exploring an ancient relic, which was extremely far from this place, even for a Chaos Great Sage, it would take hundreds of thousands or millions of years to get here.</p><p></p><p>"I arrived in a short time through the All-Seeing Eye, but how did Lianguan manage it? Also through the All-Seeing Eye?"</p><p></p><p>Kuangman pondered, he had exchanged blows with Lianguan a few times before, and the other's strength was indeed terrifying, even he could only barely maintain an even footing. He even felt that Lianguan had not used all his trump cards.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, whoever dares to obstruct me this time, I'll just steamroll over them."</p><p></p><p>Kuangman's aura shook, constantly tearing the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>To arrive here, he had paid three billion Chaos Stones in advance to the All-Seeing Eye, if he couldn't even recoup this cost, he would be taking a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>As a Chaos Great Sage, and one who excelled in offensive abilities, Kuangman could not accept such an outcome. When had he ever suffered such a loss?</p><p></p><p>"In terms of strength, I'm not as good as Lianguan, Kuangman, and Heizhao."</p><p></p><p>Tianluo silently observed the surroundings, very clear about his own position in the hierarchy.</p><p></p><p>"But in contending for treasures, it's not just about strength alone." Tianluo thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Each Chaos Great Sage, depending on the path of their Chaos energy cultivation, has different specialties. Lianguan, Kuangman, and Heizhao were clearly adept at offense.</p><p></p><p>But Tianluo's specialty was in self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I seize the opportunity and obtain the precious treasure, even Lianguan and the others won't be able to do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Tianluo had no intention of directly confronting those three Great Sages, that would clearly be playing to his weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>"But this post-heaven universe has actually attracted Lianguan to come."</p><p></p><p>Tianluo's thoughts expanded, he also had a general understanding of Lianguan's position, which was extremely far from here.</p><p></p><p>He was currently exploring an ancient relic.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Lianguan still rushed over here.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning the relic he was exploring and paying a great price to arrive, it could only mean one thing.</p><p></p><p>That the creator of this post-heaven universe was extraordinary, or there was something inside that Lianguan desperately needed.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Chaos Great Sages?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also observing the nine Chaos Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Lianguan?" Lin Yuan looked towards the two-horned Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos path Lianguan had cultivated was a fusion of two forces, although not as perfect as Lin Yuan's cultivation of the Yin-Yang fusion.</p><p></p><p>And while he could not form the Taiji like Lin Yuan, it was still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>After all, for a regular Chaos Great Sage, even if they cultivate two Chaos paths, they cannot achieve complete fusion, the requirements for the Great Sage himself are very high.</p><p></p><p>Of course, once the fusion is successful, the boost to combat power will be unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Chaos cultivation of Yin-Yang-Taiji, the ultimate Chaos Taiji Dao, is likely to directly reach the realm of the supreme Great Sages.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

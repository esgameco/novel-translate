            <p>Chapter 213: The Demonic Ancestral Tree, Covering the Sky and Blocking the Sun (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"You guys came so early?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also extended his consciousness, arriving outside the Tianqing World, and converging with the few consciousnesses that descended. ‚úã‚ô£‚ùªÔºôùì¢ ∞œÖÀ£.¬¢‚ìÑùî™üê†üë£</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness projection was a black ancient tree, while the other three consciousness projections were a giant snake, a pale green lake, and a huge eyeball respectively.</p><p></p><p>The vast and boundless outer realm, of course, was not only home to the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>These three consciousness projections came from three other outer realm evil gods.</p><p></p><p>The outer realm evil gods did not necessarily have to fight each other when they met. There was also the possibility of cooperation.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yuan and these three outer realm evil gods usually got along well, occasionally exchanging or trading information with each other.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, besides cultivating, Lin Yuan had been trying to befriend those outer realm evil gods.</p><p></p><p>According to what he had learned over the years, Lin Yuan found out that in the depths of the outer realm, there existed a large number of "gathering places" where outer realm evil gods resided.</p><p></p><p>The ruler there was also an outer realm evil god, said to have reached the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>The growth of outer realm evil gods was divided into stages. For example, Lin Yuan was currently at the seventh stage, and the previous generation Ancestral Demon Tree was also at the seventh stage in a strict sense.</p><p></p><p>As for the ninth stage, although it was said that the growth stage of outer realm evil gods had nothing to do with strength, how weak could an outer realm evil god who reached this stage be?</p><p></p><p>You should know that for outer realm evil gods like the Ancestral Demon Tree, the growth limit was the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>Even with Lin Yuan's heaven-defying comprehension, he could not deduce any useful information about the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's speculation, the ninth-stage outer realm evil gods, even if not as strong as the supreme beings of the main world, probably were not too far off.</p><p></p><p>"The gathering place of outer realm evil gods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. If possible, he really wanted to go there.</p><p></p><p>However, according to the information obtained from other outer realm evil gods,</p><p></p><p>To go from the Tianqing World to that gathering place,</p><p></p><p>The time spent would be calculated in thousands or even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for outer realm evil gods with almost endless lifespans,</p><p></p><p>Thousands or tens of thousands of years were just a few naps, but in Lin Yuan's view, there was no need for that at all.</p><p></p><p>Because the duration of stay was not enough.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what a ninth-stage outer realm evil god looks like? Can it be observed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a little curious.</p><p></p><p>Outer realm evil gods were very special lifeforms. Their growth stages were completely different from the normal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Lin Yuan were to grow the Ancestral Demon Tree to the eighth stage, perhaps the meaning of his own existence would be "conceptualized"?</p><p></p><p>"Demon Brother, we envy you for being able to occupy such a world as a place for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was lost in thought, the giant snake projection sent out a mental fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>However, they could only envy and desire. Now that the Tianqing World had Lin Yuan, this Ancestral Demon Tree, guarding it, the defense had almost reached the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Other outer realm evil gods, even if more than a dozen came, might not necessarily be able to break through the world barrier.</p><p></p><p>And wanting more than a dozen outer realm evil gods to join hands was harder than ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, even if they broke through the Tianqing World, a mere world was far from satisfying the appetite of more than a dozen outer realm evil gods.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk less and start the transaction."</p><p></p><p>The huge eyeball evil god projection sent out a mental fluctuation to remind them.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the three of them let their consciousnesses descend here was to conduct a transaction with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, outer realm evil gods wandered in the vast void. Occasionally, they could still obtain some good things.</p><p></p><p>"The usual rules."</p><p></p><p>"I only want Sin Water and secret techniques related to the world consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and with a slight movement of his mind, pure cyan-colored demon seeds appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The demon seeds condensed by the Ancestral Demon Tree, besides being used as a means to deal with enemies, could also be a treasure that was quite beneficial to other evil gods by recalling the life imprint inside.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, Lin Yuan had indeed earned a lot of wealth by relying on the demon seeds.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the demon seeds here referred to the ones after Lin Yuan perfected the "parasitism" method.</p><p></p><p>Each time such a demon seed was condensed, Lin Yuan had to spend some time and energy.</p><p></p><p>And the demon seeds after recalling his own life imprint did not occupy Lin Yuan's "parasitism" quota.</p><p></p><p>That's why Lin Yuan was willing to make such an exchange.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Here are ten portions of Sin Water."</p><p></p><p>The lake consciousness projection took out the collected Sin Water.</p><p></p><p>And exchanged it for twenty portions of demon seeds from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Sin Water was a treasure produced in some secret realms of the outer void.</p><p></p><p>It contained boundless sins and was most suitable to serve as a supplement for certain outer realm evil gods.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>That Lin Yuan would take the initiative to exchange for Sin Water.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of the Ancestral Demon Tree in this world had basically no impact on Lin Yuan's true body in the main world,</p><p></p><p>That was based on the premise of needing to use the origin of the Tianqing World to carry the path of martial arts evolution. If the foundation and strength of the Ancestral Demon Tree could be improved, that would naturally be even better.</p><p></p><p>"I have two secret techniques related to the world consciousness. Please take a look, Demon Brother." The giant snake consciousness projection sent out a mental fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>It transmitted the beginning of two secret techniques related to the world consciousness to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"These two secret techniques have their merits."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded and took out ten portions of demon seeds for the other party.</p><p></p><p>The secret techniques related to the world consciousness were related to one of Lin Yuan's schemes, or rather, goals.</p><p></p><p>The world consciousness was illusory and intangible. For the creatures within the world, it was basically untouchable.</p><p></p><p>But among the outer realm evil gods, the world consciousness was not a secret. Many outer realm evil gods who wanted to break through a world would be hindered by the world consciousness.</p><p></p><p>When the previous generation Ancestral Demon Tree wanted to descend into the Tianqing World,</p><p></p><p>Under the threat of subversion, the world consciousness did not hesitate to let the world sword appear,</p><p></p><p>Then it organized the Tianqing Alliance and concentrated all its power to resist the invasion of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>For countless tens of thousands of years,</p><p></p><p>The outer realm evil gods had a deep understanding of the world consciousness and even formed various secret techniques specifically targeting it.</p><p></p><p>"I have also collected a few secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>The huge eyeball projection spoke last.</p><p></p><p>The four outer realm evil gods completed the transaction with this, and they all looked very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Brother, you have already occupied this world, so why do you collect so many secret techniques related to the world consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>The giant snake consciousness projection asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The other two evil god consciousness projections, upon hearing this, also looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With the means of outer realm evil gods, as long as they descended into the world, it basically declared victory. Once merged into the vast origin of the world, it didn't matter what kind of world it was.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Consciousness and unconsciousness.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a bit curious."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually found an excuse to brush it off.</p><p></p><p>"Curious?"</p><p></p><p>The three projections of the foreign gods glanced at each other.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan was unwilling to say, they wouldn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>Foreign gods and foreign gods never inquired about each other's affairs in detail.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"Demon Brother, are you busy now?"</p><p></p><p>The giant eyeball projection suddenly spoke, "I have a good friend who wants to meet you."</p><p></p><p>"A good friend? What does he want to see me for?" Lin Yuan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing, a great thing." </p><p></p><p>The giant eyeball projection immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Another consciousness descended.</p><p></p><p>This consciousness projection was similar to a human form, but with sixteen arms.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Brother." The sixteen-armed god projection immediately greeted Lin Yuan warmly.</p><p></p><p>"This foreign god's strength is very powerful." Lin Yuan's expression slightly turned solemn. It was at least stronger than the other three foreign gods.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was still no match for the current Lin Yun.</p><p></p><p>After three hundred years of cultivation, relying on his heaven-defying comprehension, Lin Yuan's combat power had long surpassed the peak strength of the previous Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"The few of us discovered a secret realm in the void and want to invite Demon Brother to join. Rest assured, Demon Brother will get twenty percent of the final gains from that secret realm."</p><p></p><p>The sixteen-armed god projection said with a smile, "Demon Brother, I highly approve of your strength. That secret realm in the void is actually not difficult to occupy."</p><p></p><p>"Secret realm in the void."</p><p></p><p>The so-called secret realms in the void were some dangerous lands randomly born in the vast and boundless outer void.</p><p></p><p>These dangerous lands were likely to contain treasures, opportunities, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, when foreign gods encountered secret realms in the void, they could obtain many benefits.</p><p></p><p>The previous Ancestral Demon Tree had encountered many secret realms in the void. Some realm entrances couldn't be entered for a short time, so it sent out some subordinate demon trees to guard nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the secret realm in the void?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Flying in this direction, it will take about five hundred years." The sixteen-armed god immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very interested."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he had any doubts about the distribution of gains.</p><p></p><p>As a latecomer, being able to get twenty percent of the realm's income was already extremely good.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because of this that Lin Yuan felt something was off. If that secret realm in the void was really not difficult to attack, why invite him specifically?</p><p></p><p>Besides.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years of travel time was a bit unrealistic for the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The current world he was staying in only had less than two hundred years left. Lin Yuan didn't need to think about going to explore some secret realm in the void at all. He could just stay in the Tianqing World at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"When you collect relevant secret techniques or Sin Water next time, come find me again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan retracted his extended consciousness and returned to the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Instantly.</p><p></p><p>Only four lonely foreign god consciousnesses were left in the void.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Continue inviting?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's give up. I see Demon Brother is very alert. Let's switch to other gods."</p><p></p><p>The four god consciousnesses discussed for a while and then returned the way they came.</p><p></p><p>On top of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked into the distance at the four retreating god consciousnesses.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'm being targeted?" Although Lin Yuan didn't sense any malice from that sixteen-armed god consciousness towards him, this sudden invitation made Lin Yuan ponder a lot.</p><p></p><p>In the past three hundred years, Lin Yuan often traded with other gods. The "commodity" Demon Seeds were especially sought after by numerous gods.</p><p></p><p>Falling into the eyes of certain gods because of this was also normal.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether I'm being targeted."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I hide inside the Tianqing World and don't come out, who can do anything to me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shifted his mind to the few newly obtained secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"World Consciousness." Lin Yuan studied repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan was researching this type of secret technique was that he planned to try and see if he could replace the Tianqing World's consciousness with his own.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was to replace the Tianqing World's consciousness with the instinctive consciousness of the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, this idea was undoubtedly a fantasy. The world consciousness was so vast that even for foreign gods, it was far from possible to directly contend against the mighty world consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Let alone replace it.</p><p></p><p>The method foreign gods dealt with world consciousness was similar to boring insects, drilling into the vast world origin and slowly eroding it.</p><p></p><p>As for directly replacing the world consciousness, it was simply unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>However, this was under normal circumstances. The current Tianqing World's consciousness had already fallen into slumber. Plus, Lin Yuan possessed the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>It could influence the world consciousness to a certain extent in reverse.</p><p></p><p>If he used his heaven-defying comprehension and the numerous secret techniques related to world consciousness as a foundation to create a suitable replacement method, it might not be impossible.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Lin Yuan wanted to replace the Tianqing World's world consciousness was for a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The traversal function of the Myriad Worlds Gate, at the lowest level of random traversal, required consuming a wisp of world-breaking power each time.</p><p></p><p>If using world coordinates for precise traversal, it would consume ten wisps of world-breaking power.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was this world-breaking power consumed on? If a consciousness descended, it would perfectly integrate into the living beings of this world without revealing any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>During this period, there would also be no occurrences of being rejected by the world.</p><p></p><p>If it was really like this, if Lin Yuan used the instinctive consciousness of the Ancestral Demon Tree to replace the Tianqing World's consciousness,</p><p></p><p>And then completely opened up to Lin Yuan's consciousness,</p><p></p><p>Then the world-breaking power consumed when Lin Yuan descended to the Tianqing World again,</p><p></p><p>Would probably be pitifully little.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the entire Tianqing World would become Lin Yuan's back garden.</p><p></p><p>Descend whenever he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>"There are still one hundred and ninety years of stay time left."</p><p></p><p>"During this period, most of my energy will be focused on creating a secret technique to replace the world consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the comprehension of the core model of spatial laws, after comprehending over a thousand core spatial models, the difficulty of comprehending each subsequent spatial model would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>In one hundred and ninety years, he could comprehend at most a hundred or so core spatial law models.</p><p></p><p>The significance wasn't too great.</p><p></p><p>And continue to open up the subsequent stages of martial dao evolution? The current seventh stage chapter of martial dao had already been perfectly opened up.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not stepped into the eighth stage yet. If he chose to open up the eighth stage chapter, it would be a bit of a thankless task.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, he might as well put the remaining energy on the replacement consciousness method.</p><p></p><p>After all, such an opportunity might not be encountered even once in dozens of traversals.</p><p></p><p>Letting the world consciousness fall into slumber? The difficulty was too great, and not every world had world weapons like the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>Time silently flowed by. Unknowingly, another one hundred and eighty years passed.</p>

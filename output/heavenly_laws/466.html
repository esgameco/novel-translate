        <h1>Chapter 466</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 466 Widespread Reputation (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Irregular fissures that were profoundly and continuously emitting a hazy flow of air spanned silently across the firmament.</p><p></p><p>Even after observing and comprehending them for 500 years, Lin Yuan was still somewhat fascinated.</p><p></p><p>The orderly fluctuations that manifested from the depths of the fissures were extremely obscure, but they brought him a sense of gain and enlightenment every moment.</p><p></p><p>"In 500 years, I have devoted half my energy to comprehending the rules of space-time fusion. Now I have finally reached the peak of the Sixth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed contemplatively, "If it weren't for this Grade-A immortal cave, the time it would have taken me to reach the peak of the Sixth Realm would have been five or even ten times longer."</p><p></p><p>Before his eleventh spatial-temporal traversal, Lin Yuan's space-time comprehension was at the middle stage of the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent stages were the late Sixth Realm and the peak of the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was confident that he could reach the peak of the Sixth Realm within 2,000 to 5,000 years, which was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Even the ultimate Twelfth Realms in the main universe, which took countless years, found it extremely difficult to make further progress in the rules of space-time fusion, not even from the middle stage to the late stage.</p><p></p><p>This was based on the premise that the Twelfth Realm existences stood on the banks of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, Lin Yuan was still an Eleventh Realm being. If not for his extraordinary perceptive abilities, he wouldn't even have been able to enter the door to the Sixth Realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>And now, in just 500 years, he had traversed a path that would have taken the main universe 2,000 to 5,000 years to cross, which pleased him greatly.</p><p></p><p>This traversal only lasted a little over 2,000 years. If he could only raise his space-time comprehension to the peak of the Sixth Realm, it would be somewhat of a waste.</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Realm of space-time," Lin Yuan fell into deep thought. After reaching the peak of the Sixth Realm, the path before him led only to the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the information left by Emperor Xuan and the Patriarch of the Demonic Jade Tower, to have a chance of touching upon the Seventh Realm of space-time, one needed to reach the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm at the very least.</p><p></p><p>This was the minimum requirement, as there were many who, even at the peak of the Transcendent Dao Realm, remained stagnant at the peak of the Sixth Realm in their comprehension of the rules of space-time fusion.</p><p></p><p>"If I can reach the Seventh Realm, I will completely surpass those Twelfth Realm ultimates in the field of space-time fusion rules. Even if I'm still at the Eleventh Realm, I'll be able to easily preserve my life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It was just like the Mysterious Yellow Realm. Although its level was not high, the strongest Eleventh Realm beings wielding tribal weapons could easily break through it. However, the Mysterious Yellow Realm was deeply integrated into the deepest parts of the space-time of the main universe. The power of the Twelfth Realm ultimates could easily destroy the Mysterious Yellow Realm, but they couldn't even locate its specific coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Unless they possessed the ability to destroy the entire universe, the Twelfth Realm ultimates could only watch helplessly as the Mysterious Yellow Realm opened and closed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>It would be the same for Lin Yuan if he attained the Seventh Realm of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in terms of absolute power, he would still be far inferior to those Twelfth Realm ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But with the space-time comprehension of the Seventh Realm, Lin Yuan could easily make it so that those Twelfth Realm ultimates couldn't find his true self.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that crossing from the peak of the Sixth Realm to the Seventh Realm will require overcoming many bottlenecks and constraints," Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>"I still have 1,500 years to stay here, so I'll take it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, "Unfortunately, up to now, I still haven't found any direction regarding the Chaotic Rules."</p><p></p><p>Over the past 500 years, the other half of Lin Yuan's mental energy had been devoted to other aspects, such as perfecting the Eleventh Realm Martial Dao Scriptures, comprehending various other pillar-level fusion rules, and exploring the Chaotic Rules, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"The Source Realm of the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again looked up at the irregular fissure in the firmament above.</p><p></p><p>This time, however, Lin Yuan's gaze was not focused on sensing the fluctuations of the Dao rules emanating from it, but on the irregular fissure itself.</p><p></p><p>The irregular fissure was connected to the Source Realm of the Immortal Realm, which was why it had such pronounced rule fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Other Jade Immortals, when comprehending the irregular fissure, would only sense the awe-inspiring pressure of the heavens and earth emanating from within, and would not dare to have any other thoughts or insights.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals forcibly opened a "passage" to the Source Realm, the Jade Immortals who comprehended it would still be unable to deeply feel anything.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>With his space-time fusion rules reaching the peak of the Sixth Realm, Lin Yuan's gaze had already faintly transcended the irregular fissure, looking towards the vast Source Realm at the deepest part of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just by comprehending the rule fluctuations emanating from the Source Realm, it has brought me such great benefits in my rule comprehension. If I could directly enter the Source Realm to cultivate and comprehend, then..." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart raced. The Source Realm of any world was an absolute core, where one could observe the most fundamental aspects of the world.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm was roughly on par with the main universe in terms of level. If he could observe and examine the most fundamental aspects of the Immortal Realm, it would bring unimaginable benefits to the advancement of various rules.</p><p></p><p>"But the Source Realm of the Immortal Realm has long been occupied by the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals." Lin Yuan's gaze reached far and deep, sensing the aura of the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals within the Source Realm.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals could establish a passage between the Source Realm and the outside world meant that he was naturally able to enter the Source Realm.</p><p></p><p>Given the excellent cultivation environment of the Source Realm, as long as the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals was not a fool, he would surely reside there frequently.</p><p></p><p>While Lin Yuan's current strength could forcibly enter the Source Realm, he would undoubtedly be detected by the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan would be exposed to the gaze of the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals.</p><p></p><p>In the past 500 years, Lin Yuan's abilities in various aspects had progressed enough, but he still could not contend with a Twelfth Realm ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Especially this body that had descended into the Immortal Realm, which was not as refined as the flesh body in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can comprehend the Seventh Realm of space-time, I won't be found or discovered, even under the watchful eye of that Dao Ancestor, let alone entering the Source Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Realm of space-time would at least allow Lin Yuan to stand undefeated at the Transcendent Dao Realm. While the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals was a Twelfth Realm ultimate, his power would certainly not exceed the Transcendent Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Realm Martial Dao Scriptures have been mostly perfected."</p><p></p><p>In front of Lin Yuan, a series of texts appeared, which were the details of the Eleventh Realm Martial Dao Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Perfecting the Eleventh Realm Martial Dao Scriptures was not only to help Lin Yuan establish a path of martial dao evolution to propagate externally, but also to review and confirm his own path repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Only by thoroughly understanding and grasping oneself can one continue to move forward. A solid foundation is the key to an unlimited future.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can dispatch incarnations to spread the path of martial dao evolution on a small scale."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Immortal Realm was vast and boundless, with innumerable beings. Lin Yuan naturally would not give up on this land of Dao propagation.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he would be detected by the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals? Lin Yuan would only spread it on a small scale.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the boundless Immortal Realm, apart from the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Lian Body System, there also exist other cultivation systems, but they are far inferior to the mainstream Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts evolution, as long as it does not appear too special and eye-catching, not to mention attracting the attention of the Dao Ancestor, even the Jade Immortals would not pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan left a clone behind to continue contemplating the irregular cracks that connected to the Source, while his true body disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>As the top-tier cultivation cave mansion in the Cangwu Immortal City, the Grade-A Cave Mansion was divided into many areas. The place where Lin Yuan usually secluded himself to contemplate the irregular cracks was just one of his cultivation areas.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the cultivation area, there were many other areas, such as the reception area and the rest area.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure suddenly appeared on the main hall's throne.</p><p></p><p>"Master," a figure below immediately greeted Lin Yuan with the utmost respect. This figure was Yun Zhenzi, the Jade Immortal consciousness obtained from the purple jade slip in the inheritance of the late Wuxiong.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi perished in the ancient Immortal-Demon Great War thousands of years ago, leaving behind a method of resurrection. When Lin Yuan examined the jade slip, Yun Zhenzi's consciousness was activated and tried to seize Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious. Lin Yuan easily suppressed Yun Zhenzi and even borrowed his identity to take control of this Grade-A Cave Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan needed to maintain Yun Zhenzi's identity at all times, he did not completely erase Yun Zhenzi's consciousness. Instead, he reused it, helping Yun Zhenzi rebuild his physical body and making him serve Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As an experienced Jade Immortal, Yun Zhenzi had no choice but to obediently follow Lin Yuan's orders if he wanted to survive.</p><p></p><p>For the past five hundred years, Lin Yuan had been in seclusion most of the time, and Yun Zhenzi was responsible for handling various trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>For example, purchasing cultivation resources? The resources Yun Zhenzi had prepared for himself were all consumed by Lin Yuan more than four hundred years ago. To continue obtaining resources to maintain his cultivation, Yun Zhenzi could only trade and purchase them from the outside world, which Lin Yuan was too lazy to do himself.</p><p></p><p>"What has happened during this period?" Lin Yuan asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Among the many tasks Lin Yuan had instructed Yun Zhenzi to do was to keep an eye on the major events happening in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Yun Zhenzi immediately reported the various intelligence he had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"The manifestation of the Demonic Abyss is becoming more and more frequent. It seems that a new Immortal-Demon Great War is about to begin," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Every few hundred or thousand years, the consciousness of the Ancestor of the Demonic Abyss would partially revive, causing the demonic creatures in the depths of the Demonic Abyss to become restless and invade the Immortal Realm without hesitation. This was the origin of the Immortal-Demon Great War.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the Cangwu Immortal City and some other powers are preparing for the Immortal-Demon Great War," Yun Zhenzi said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He had perished in the previous Immortal-Demon Great War, so he was very concerned about this kind of war that affected the entire Immortal Realm. Countless Immortals had fallen in each Immortal-Demon Great War, and even Jade Immortals were not spared, let alone ordinary Jade Immortals like Yun Zhenzi.</p><p></p><p>"Master, a few days ago, people from the Nine Dragons Trading House came to request that you refine a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixirs for them," Yun Zhenzi said.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Revolutions Elixir," Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Revolutions Elixir was a supreme life-saving Immortal Elixir at the Golden Immortal level. No matter what kind of injury one suffered, as long as their true spirit still remained, consuming a single Nine Revolutions Elixir would instantly heal them. Even for Jade Immortals, the Nine Revolutions Elixir could cure most of their injuries.</p><p></p><p>For any power, the Nine Revolutions Elixir was a strategic Immortal Elixir, especially with the impending Immortal-Demon Great War.</p><p></p><p>During his five hundred years of cultivation seclusion, Lin Yuan had consumed countless cultivation resources. Where did these resources come from? Plunder?</p><p></p><p>The amount of cultivation resources Lin Yuan needed was too large. If he relied on plunder, it might not be a problem once or twice, but if he did it too many times, it would inevitably cause alarm among all the Jade Immortals and attract the attention of the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Before his strength became powerful enough to be unafraid of any obstruction, Lin Yuan could not do such a high-profile thing, so the way he obtained resources was through trading with other Jade Immortals or powers.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, Immortal Elixirs were undoubtedly the hard currency. From the common to the Jade Immortals, whether it was cultivation or other matters, they could not do without Immortal Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Yun Zhenzi was quite adept at the Elixir Refinement Dao, so Lin Yuan specifically studied Elixir Refinement for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>The essence of Elixir Refinement was the control of various subtle medicinal powers. With Lin Yuan's mental will at the Twelfth Realm, he was a natural Elixir Refining Master. Combined with his extraordinary comprehension, after just a few days of research, Lin Yuan's Elixir Refinement attainments had surpassed Yun Zhenzi, the Elixir Refining Master.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to his cultivation, Lin Yuan had Yun Zhenzi sell some of the Immortal Elixirs he had refined.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's mental will's control over subtle medicinal powers, both the quality and success rate of the Elixir Refinement were astonishingly high.</p><p></p><p>It was relying on the continuous refining and selling of Immortal Elixirs that supported Lin Yuan's terrifying cultivation consumption over the past five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, refining a rare Immortal Elixir could bring dozens or even hundreds of times the profit. This was much more efficient than plunder and pillage, and there was no risk involved.</p><p></p><p>Over the centuries, most of the Immortal Elixirs Lin Yuan had sold were done in secret. Only a few dozen times were they sold openly, but even so, it had already spread the reputation of Lin Yuan as an Elixir Refining Master.</p><p></p><p>"Refine a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixirs? How much reward does the Nine Dragons Trading House plan to give?" Lin Yuan asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>As a strategic Elixir, the Nine Revolutions Elixir was difficult to refine, and some of the main ingredients were extremely rare, but this was not something Lin Yuan needed to consider.</p><p></p><p>Since the Nine Dragons Trading House wanted Lin Yuan to refine a batch of Nine Revolutions Elixirs, they must have already prepared the materials.</p><p></p><p>As for the refining difficulty? It was nothing to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The key was whether the Nine Dragons Trading House could afford the price.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Immortal of the Nine Dragons Trading House wants to discuss the reward with the Master," Yun Zhenzi immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragons Trading House was a Jade Immortal-level power, with nine Dragon Clan Jade Immortals as its leaders, and it was well-known in the Thirty-Three Immortal Domains.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let him come and see me," Lin Yuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Yun Zhenzi immediately began to contact the Jade Immortal of the Nine Dragons Trading House.</p><p></p><p>In less than a moment, a majestic man wearing a golden scale robe with horns on his forehead appeared outside the cave mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Master Yun Zhenzi," this Jade Immortal of the Nine Dragons Trading House was very polite. Although Lin Yuan had not openly sold many Immortal Elixirs in the past few hundred years, the quality of each Elixir he had sold was very high, and the outside world unanimously believed that Yun Zhenzi had the ability to refine the Nine Revolutions Elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Dragon Lord," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Dragons Trading House had nine Dragon Clan Jade Immortal Lords, and the one before him was the Azure Dragon Lord. Among the nine Lords, the Azure Dragon Lord's strength was ranked in the top three, and he was extremely domineering in his external dealings.</p>

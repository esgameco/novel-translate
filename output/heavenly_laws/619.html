        <h1>Chapter 619</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around in all directions.</p><p></p><p>He saw that within the grand hall, various treasures were floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>These treasures were either rare and precious items, or weapons and armaments.</p><p></p><p>Each of these treasures was surrounded by the forces of space and time, suppressing the fluctuations of their own anomalies, lest they erupt into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Even the greatest of saints could not possibly possess so many treasures," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. Every item in the grand hall was no weaker than the Darksky Heart, all of them treasures at the level of the greatest saints.</p><p></p><p>Various rare and precious materials, as well as many peerless saint-level elixirs, were neatly arranged in the corners of the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>"That is only natural," the Spirit of the Mausoleum said with some self-satisfaction. "His Majesty is not to be compared to those peerless saints. With His Majesty's strength, He has long since explored the many perilous sites of the Chaotic Void, reaping abundant harvests."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void had many ancient sites, the most famous being the nine great sites like the Taiyuan Site. These nine great sites were all related to the Thirteenth-Tier Temporal Lifeforms. When Lin Yuan was still in his home universe, the "white paper" that could reduce dimensions had gushed forth from the depths of the Taiyuan Site.</p><p></p><p>These sites were filled with numerous dangers, but they also birthed countless opportunities. As long as one's strength was sufficient, exploring these sites would naturally yield bountiful rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Among these treasures, there are thirty-three weapons at the level of the greatest saints, and sixty-two rare and precious items of the same tier," the Spirit of the Mausoleum continued.</p><p></p><p>"If it were not for the fact that His Majesty had bestowed a large portion of the treasures upon many of His followers before attempting to break through to the Thirteenth Tier, there would have been even more."</p><p></p><p>Although the Mysterious Emperor had made a hasty decision to attempt the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Tier, He had also made extensive preparations.</p><p></p><p>In order to establish the Mysterious Yellow Realm, the Mysterious Emperor had engaged in fierce conflicts with many peerless saints.</p><p></p><p>While the Mysterious Emperor was still around, those peerless saints naturally did not dare to make any moves. However, if the Mysterious Emperor were to break through to the Thirteenth Tier and become trapped in the time loop for an extended period, the peerless saints who had enmity with Him would certainly move to settle the score with the Mysterious Yellow Lineage.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, before attempting the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Tier, the Mysterious Emperor had already dispersed many of the disciples and followers of the Mysterious Yellow Lineage.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan's gaze swept over each of the treasures in the grand hall, eventually settling on the high platform at the very top.</p><p></p><p>There, three weapons were placed: a fist-sized small seal, a golden battle armor, and a golden sword.</p><p></p><p>These three weapons gave Lin Yuan a different feeling compared to the others, as if there was a faint sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>"Those are the Mysterious Yellow Seal, the Mysterious Yellow Armor, and the Mysterious Yellow Sword, the personal weapons forged by His Majesty, and the three most powerful among all the weapons here," the Spirit of the Mausoleum spoke.</p><p></p><p>"These three weapons are naturally yours as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Mysterious Yellow Seal, the Mysterious Yellow Armor, and the Mysterious Yellow Sword. He had already learned from the Spirit of the Mysterious Yellow Realm that these were the Mysterious Emperor's primary battle weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Seal was a suppression-type weapon, and in the hands of the Mysterious Emperor, a single seal could cover the sky, with even the greatest of saints not daring to confront it head-on.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Armor, on the other hand, excelled in both physical and spiritual defense, as well as in the defense of the mind and will, truly an exceptional all-around defensive weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for the Mysterious Yellow Sword, it was the ultimate offensive weapon. In the hands of the Mysterious Emperor, this sword had slain the physical bodies and souls of more than one peerless saint, although that did not necessarily mean the complete destruction of those saints.</p><p></p><p>"These treasures are all given to me, just in case His Majesty manages to break free from the time loop in the future," Lin Yuan hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>The other treasures were one thing, but the Mysterious Yellow Seal, the Mysterious Yellow Armor, and the Mysterious Yellow Sword were the Mysterious Emperor's personal weapons, akin to Lin Yuan's Source Bell.</p><p></p><p>What was a personal weapon? It was a bond of life and death, equivalent to the closest of relationships.</p><p></p><p>"Tens of millions of universe cycles have passed, and His Majesty has still not broken free from the time loop," the Spirit of the Mausoleum shook its head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The earlier one managed to break free from the time loop, the greater the hope. After more than a hundred universe cycles, the hope would decrease significantly, and after more than a thousand universe cycles, there would be almost no hope left.</p><p></p><p>As for tens of millions of universe cycles? "Furthermore, if His Majesty were to truly break free from the time loop, He would be a Thirteenth-Tier Temporal Lifeform. Would He still care about these things?" the Spirit of the Mausoleum said.</p><p></p><p>"That's true," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if the Mysterious Emperor were to break free from the time loop in the future, as a Thirteenth-Tier Temporal Lifeform, He would likely not even pay attention to these treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall not hesitate to take them," Lin Yuan immediately began collecting the various treasures in the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of the Mausoleum watched silently, not trying to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Spirit of the Mausoleum hesitated for a moment before speaking again, "As for the priceless treasure that His Majesty left behind, suppressed by the time loop..."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of the Mausoleum extended its hand, and a Mysterious Yellow-colored pearl appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the treasure?" Lin Yuan's expression became solemn. He surmised that the priceless treasure the Mysterious Emperor had obtained at the end was most likely related to the Thirteenth-Tier Temporal Lifeform, otherwise it would not have required the power of the time loop to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"No, it is not," the Spirit of the Mausoleum shook its head.</p><p></p><p>"Not?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback. If this Mysterious Yellow pearl was not the treasure, then why did the Spirit of the Mausoleum specifically bring it out?</p><p></p><p>"But as long as you crush this pearl, you will be able to obtain that treasure," the Spirit of the Mausoleum said after a long silence.</p><p></p><p>This was the order the Mysterious Emperor had given before attempting the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Tier, as the "spirit" created by the Mysterious Emperor. The Spirit of the Mausoleum could not disobey any of the Mysterious Emperor's commands.</p><p></p><p>"Crush..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shatter it, and you can obtain that priceless treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious, and carefully examined the yellowish-black pearl.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Lin Yuan felt that this pearl was permeated with the power of time, but it was extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>"Correct." </p><p></p><p>The Spirit of the Mausoleum nodded, and then said, "However, I hope you don't crush it for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"That treasure is of great importance. Even His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor had to rely on breaking through the Thirteenth Realm, and then borrow the descending time cycle to temporarily suppress it. If you shatter it prematurely, it may be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit of the Mausoleum looked at Lin Yuan. "And personally, I, personally, do not wish for you to crush it so soon."</p><p></p><p>The order left behind by His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor was that when the heir arrives and inherits everything, he must immediately crush the yellowish-black pearl. But the Spirit of the Mausoleum knew what that meant, and instinctively did not want to do so.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could hear that the Spirit of the Mausoleum did not want this yellowish-black pearl to be crushed.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the reason, Lin Yuan had no intention of going against it. During this trip to the Mysterious Yellow Universe, he had already gained enough.</p><p></p><p>The many precious treasures outside the Mausoleum, as well as the numerous precious weapons within the Mausoleum, even the Mysterious Emperor's own main battle weapon, had all fallen into his hands.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>As for that priceless treasure obtained by the Mysterious Emperor? To have forced the Mysterious Emperor to break through the Thirteenth Realm prematurely, it must be of great importance. Even if the Spirit of the Mausoleum asked him to crush the yellowish-black pearl now, Lin Yuan would still carefully consider it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had to crush it, it would be after he had reached the Chaotic Realm, or perhaps not until he had cultivated to the peak of the Chaotic Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's foundation, as long as he cultivated to the peak of the Chaotic Realm, not to mention reaching the invincible Sage Realm, he would likely be close to it. After accumulating for a while, he would become the most powerful invincible Sage in the history of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, this Mausoleum is also a weapon. You can now refine it." The Spirit of the Mausoleum spoke. "After refining it, quickly leave the Mysterious Yellow Universe."</p><p></p><p>"Leave the Mysterious Yellow Universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely felt that since this Mausoleum had manifested, the collapsing speed of the deeper layers of the Mysterious Yellow Universe had begun to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Mysterious Yellow Universe, the Chaotic Venerable Ones had not left.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not dare to go in, they still wanted to wait a little longer outside.</p><p></p><p>To see when that mysterious Galactic Sage would come out.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the distant space began to silently emanate a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>This aura caused the Dao rules of the Chaotic Void to retreat and avoid, while forming a brand-new set of rules different from the Chaotic Void rules.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"I can no longer sense the fluctuations of the external rules."</p><p></p><p>"Why is there a brand-new rule fluctuation appearing?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be that a peerless Sage has appeared in the Void."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the many Chaotic Venerable Ones changed drastically. In the realm where a peerless Sage stands, they can form a rule domain world exclusive to themselves. Within this domain world, the peerless Sage can create rules that are beneficial to themselves.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the realm of the peerless Sage's rules, void traversal would be impossible. Of course, the rules set by the peerless Sage also bind themselves, so the enemy cannot traverse the void either.</p><p></p><p>Although there are such limitations, this ability to reverse the rules allows the strength of the peerless Sage to surpass that of the Chaotic Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Are those two?"</p><p></p><p>In the distorted space in the distance, the All-Seeing Eye and a few other special existences also sensed something and looked towards the distant space.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't they always in slumber?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I remember they had a grudge with His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"It's been over 30 million universes, and they still want to take revenge?"</p><p></p><p>The broken long sword spoke with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Most peerless Sages or even Chaotic Sages would eventually choose to break through to the Thirteenth Realm in the end.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a small number of peerless Sages who would not do so, and instead choose to pass the time through slumber.</p><p></p><p>"Not wanting to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, but instead choosing to take revenge?"</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye also looked from afar.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Chaotic Continent, the Star Tear Fragment World, Lin Yuan's Yin Spirit was sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Myriad Dao Pavilion is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and the Patriarch of the Myriad Dao Pavilion who was waiting outside appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Myriad Dao Pavilion's brow suddenly opened a single eye, the pupil a faint golden color, exuding a lofty aura.</p><p></p><p>"The All-Seeing Eye."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave, immediately realizing that the Patriarch of the Myriad Dao Pavilion before him had been possessed by the All-Seeing Eye, and what now appeared before him was the All-Seeing Eye.</p><p></p><p>"What business do you have with me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye personally coming to visit must mean that a major event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>"You should still be inside the Mysterious Yellow Universe, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and leave."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Two peerless Sages have rushed over there."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

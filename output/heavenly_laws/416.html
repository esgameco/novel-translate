        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The azure world.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the martial palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, the surrounding void subtly twisting and distorting. </p><p></p><p>His immense willpower permeated through the myriad layers of space.</p><p></p><p>Willpower was an extremely special force, transcending the physical body and soul, the core vessel of life itself.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization of the prime universe had already achieved a certain "quantification" of willpower. To break through from the 7th to the 8th level, one's willpower index had to reach 10,000 points.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, this was not absolute.</p><p></p><p>With a willpower index exceeding 10,000 points, one could still potentially fail the 8th level breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching 10,000 willpower points, there was a slim chance of successfully breaking through to the 8th level.</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, the stronger one's willpower, the greater its impact.</p><p></p><p>For instance, a life form with a willpower index of millions could crush those with merely 10,000 or 100,000 points with just a glance, without employing any power rules.</p><p></p><p>"After three hundred years of hunting those void creatures, is my current willpower index 800 million, 900 million, or 1 billion?"</p><p></p><p>Reading time: 10 seconds. Lin Yuan opened his eyes, surprisingly unable to accurately gauge his own willpower index.  </p><p></p><p>The main reason was that compared to three hundred years ago, his willpower had increased by leaps and bounds, dozens or even hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>Increasing one's strength and combat power by dozens or hundreds of times may not be difficult through major realm breakthroughs, obtaining powerful secret treasures, or awakening bloodline talents.</p><p></p><p>But willpower had no shortcuts.</p><p></p><p>Those special life forms in the prime universe who called themselves "ancient gods" had lived for immensely long eras, so their willpower was generally not weak, even if not in the millions, at least in the hundreds of millions.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because willpower was also reduced in the two-dimensional world that Lin Yuan could dominate those legendary 11th level perfected life forms.</p><p></p><p>But now? After three hundred years of hunting void creatures, Lin Yuan believed his willpower was no longer a shortcoming, but could even become an advantage once this sojourn ended.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had only gone through half of the six hundred year stay.</p><p></p><p>As long as no accidents occurred, Lin Yuan's willpower still had room for growth in the next three hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, the stronger my willpower, the more those void creatures will contribute to its growth. Now, only void creatures comparable to the 9th level Demon God Palace can bring a slight increase to my willpower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the void secret realm, killing any void creature could cause his willpower to soar tremendously.</p><p></p><p>"9th level void creatures are still quite rare. In these three hundred years, I've only killed a little over a hundred at that level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself: "And that void secret realm can be entered by other Demon Gods as well."</p><p></p><p>Over the past three hundred years, Lin Yuan's solar yuan spirit roaming the void secret realm had also discovered many powerful Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Gods capable of appearing in the void secret realm all started at the 8th level peak, and many were even 9th level Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>A 9th level Demon God was on par with an 11th level life form, and some special 9th level Demon Gods were as formidable as 4th or 5th rank 11th level Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>And all 9th level Demon Gods had only one goal - to follow in the footsteps of the legendary 10th level Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this void secret realm was opened by a certain 10th level Demon God, and those void creatures came from the boundless void outside, the gaps between different dimensions.</p><p></p><p>"The 10th level Demon God? It shouldn't be the ultimate existence, but slightly stronger than the 11th level perfection..." Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had also explored some traces of the 10th level Demon Gods within the void secret realm, gaining a rough understanding of their strength limits.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Gods of this world are quite peculiar, with extremely fast growth rates and formidable talents, but very weak in grasping rules, resulting in an exceedingly small number of 9th level Demon Gods," Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, there were a few 8th level Demon Gods in every void domain, but 9th level Demon Gods? Even millions of void domains might not produce one.</p><p></p><p>Only in void secret realms where many powerful Demon Gods gathered could one see some 9th level Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>The soaring of his willpower was just one of Lin Yuan's many gains from three hundred years of bitter cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Lin Yuan's lunar yuan spirit had roamed the boundless void, exploring numerous worlds, and had currently dominated thirty-two worlds.</p><p></p><p>Of these thirty-two worlds, eight were vaster than the Azure World, eleven were about the same size, and the remaining few were weaker.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had planted the seeds of the Primordial Demon Tree in all thirty-two worlds, slowly devouring them while spreading the martial cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>For a Demon God to take over a world required various means, as the world's will would resist fiercely. Even if unable to act directly, it would give birth to World Children, Destiny Children, and the like.</p><p></p><p>When the Primordial Demon Tree invaded the Azure World, it was not smooth sailing either, as the Azure Lord and the World Sword gave it quite a headache.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan did not need such troubles. With his status as the Azure World's Heavenly Dao, and his grasp of the world's essence, he could enter other worlds unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Once inside a world, its consciousness could only be manipulated by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If he did not wish to cause too much commotion and instead intended to gradually replace the world's will, taking more time, the number of worlds he currently dominated would likely be many times greater than thirty-two.</p><p></p><p>"Adding the denizens of the Azure World, the inhabitants of thirty-three worlds are now cultivating the martial path," Lin Yuan slowly closed his eyes, feeling a connection as the creator whenever a new martial cultivator emerged.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the vast boundless void, the radiance representing martial cultivators had already formed a region.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the martial cultivators I've created will one day change the situation in the boundless void, ending the Demon Gods' dominance from outside?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan inwardly pondered.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's descent, the Demon Gods from outside were the absolute rulers of this boundless void, while human cultivators were merely "appetizers" within their respective worlds.</p><p></p><p>Demon Gods devoured worlds, and the human cultivators living within only made this "food" taste better, used by the Demon Gods to whet their appetites.</p><p></p><p>Even World Children or Destiny Children born from the world itself could only put up a struggle against Demon Gods within that world, relying on the world itself.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial cultivation system gave the denizens of this world the possibility of resisting the Demon Gods from outside.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was currently invisible, as the strongest martial cultivator in the boundless void was only at the 5th level.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed very difficult to reach the 6th level of the Space-Time Fusion Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts shifted, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred years ago, his Space-Time Fusion Rules had crossed into the 3rd level.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and eighty years ago, the Space-Time Fusion Rules had crossed into the 4th level.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, the Space-Time Fusion Rules had crossed into the 5th level.</p><p></p><p>In the following two hundred years, Lin Yuan's Space-Time Fusion Rules had remained at the 5th level.</p><p></p><p>To reach the 6th level? At least for now, Lin Yuan saw no hope.</p><p></p><p>It took a hundred years for his Space-Time Fusion Rules to break through from the 2nd to the 5th level. Apart from Lin Yuan's own extraordinary comprehension, the insights into Space-Time Fusion Rules from the cluster of experts from various races also greatly aided him.</p><p></p><p>One should know that even for those unique, special life forms in the prime universe, advancing one level in the Space-Time Fusion Rules would take billions or tens of billions of years under ideal circumstances. Any bottlenecks would incur immeasurable time.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly but surely."</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't been that long yet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Having reached the 5th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules, the cluster of insights from various experts was no longer much help.</p><p></p><p>Because the upper limit of that cluster was the 5th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules.</p><p></p><p>To cross into the 6th level, he would have to rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>The 6th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules was normally the domain of the Paramount.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I chose the secret art 'Heavenly River' as a reward from the 5th floor of the Black Tower, allowing me to see the direction of the 6th level."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, trying to comprehend the 6th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules below the Paramount would take who knows how long."</p><p></p><p>Glimpses of the secret art 'Heavenly River' surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The reason the 6th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules belonged to the Paramount was because it involved the profundities of the river of time, which only the Paramount could transcend and observe the "shores" of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>This was the basis for crossing into the 6th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was still a life form within the river of time, unable to view the scenes on its "shores." Even if the nine Paramount of human civilization forcibly brought him to the shore, due to his life level, the scenes he could perceive would be extremely narrow and insignificant.</p><p></p><p>However, the secret art 'Heavenly River' expounded the profundities of the Space-Time Fusion Rules beyond the 6th level in another form, allowing Lin Yuan to sense their essence without needing to "go ashore."</p><p></p><p>Of course, even so, comprehending the 6th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules was no easy feat, requiring Lin Yuan's gradual exploration.</p><p></p><p>After all, the path he was treading had never been walked by any life form since the beginning of the prime universal era.</p><p></p><p>"With the 5th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules, my current peak combat strength should be comparable to a 5th rank 11th level expert?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>The 5th level of Space-Time Fusion Rules was the threshold of the 5th rank 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Currently, apart from his life level still being at the 10th level, Lin Yuan was no weaker than 11th level life forms in other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the 5th bodily divine ability "World," he could completely suppress 5th rank 11th level experts.</p><p></p><p>The external world condensed by the "World" divine ability, if self-detonated, could not be withstood even by 11th level perfection. But this was his ultimate trump card, not to be used unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Just the natural suppression from the external world would make even 5th rank 11th level experts suffer tremendously.</p><p></p><p>"The gains over these three hundred years have been astonishing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged. Three hundred years ago, before the 10th sojourn, his peak strength was merely at the 4th rank of the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>But now, his ordinary state could suppress the 5th rank, and using his trump card could kill 11th level perfection.</p><p></p><p>And this was just after three hundred years had passed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this degree of strength increase was based on Lin Yuan still being a 10th level life form, the difficulty unknown multiples higher than advancing from the 4th to the 6th rank of the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>...The void secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>After three hundred years of exploration, Lin Yuan's solar yuan spirit had probed deep into the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, whenever Lin Yuan acted, slaying void creatures, his reputation among the Demon Gods had grown immense, considered an extremely powerful 9th level Demon God.</p><p></p><p>The title given to Lin Yuan by many Demon Gods was "Solar Demon God."</p><p></p><p>Because whenever Lin Yuan's solar yuan spirit struck, it was with vast blazing flames incinerating everything, based on the solar yuan spirit's innate properties. If it were the lunar yuan spirit acting, it would be endless glacial cold freezing everything instead.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the lunar yuan spirit lacked other methods, but this was the most natural and powerful approach, closest to its own great way.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've encountered any 9th level void creatures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's solar yuan spirit walked in the upper void of the secret realm. When he had just entered the void secret realm, he would still be cautious, hiding within the myriad layers of space to avoid being discovered by powerful void creatures.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wished other void creatures would discover him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, 9th level void creatures are exceedingly rare. Not encountering them is normal," the Triad Void Domain Lord immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The Triad Void Domain Lord was the void domain where Lin Yuan's dominated Azure World was located.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan suppressed the Black Demon Lord and three other Demon Gods, the Triad Void Domain Lord learned of this.</p><p></p><p>Deducing that Lin Yuan was not to be provoked, the Triad Void Domain Lord kept other Demon Gods away from the region near the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and ninety years ago, the Triad Void Domain Lord could no longer resist, wanting to approach the vicinity of the Azure World to see what kind of existence had made the Black Demon Lord and three others disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Triad Void Domain Lord's intentions were good - it only wanted to observe from afar, absolutely not getting too close, and immediately retreating at any anomaly.</p><p></p><p>As a peak 8th level Demon God acting so cautiously, even ordinary 9th level Demon Gods would be powerless.</p><p></p><p>But the Triad Void Domain Lord encountered Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan's lunar yuan spirit had just returned, intending to take some Demon Tree seeds, only to come across the sneaking Triad Void Domain Lord and casually brought it back.</p><p></p><p>After soul searching and interrogation, Lin Yuan also learned that the Triad Void Domain Lord could enter the void secret realm and was very familiar with it, so he subjugated it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's subjugation of the Triad Void Domain Lord was not superficial, but the kind where a single thought could decide life or death.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Now, void creatures below the 9th level contributed negligibly to the growth of his willpower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's willpower was too powerful, even if not quite a million points, it was not far off. Further improvement would naturally be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Just as Lin Yuan and the Triad Void Domain Lord were aimlessly wandering the depths of the void secret realm,</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly erupted from an extremely distant place.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous rumbles - formidable fluctuations churned the void...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The ripples spread through space-time, sweeping out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"These fluctuations?"</p><p></p><p>"Are Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities battling? Or other beings of the same level from the void?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, able to sense the aura fluctuations of more than one Ninth Stage void being.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!!" The accompanying Lord of the Three Yin Realms trembled inwardly. </p><p></p><p>If not following behind Lin Yuan, with its strength it would be impossible to reach the depths of the void secret realm. Here, just by lingering for a while, one would inevitably encounter Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities.</p><p></p><p>Or Ninth Stage void beings.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan vanished from his spot, heading towards the source of the aura fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Master?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan leave, the Lord of the Three Yin Realms steeled itself and also rushed towards the source.</p><p></p><p>...This was a nearly billion-mile-large nest, originally hidden deep within overlapping space-times. But now discovered, the outer space-time labyrinth torn open, exposing the entire nest.</p><p></p><p>Strands of terrifying aura emanated. Outside the nest stood six towering figures. </p><p></p><p>And inside the nest, equally chilling auras lurked - nearly ten auras facing off against the six outer giants.</p><p></p><p>During the standoff, the two sides clashed across space-time, causing ripples that spread to the far distance.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the void beings inside this nest have all reached the Ninth Stage, and there are as many as nine of them - not easy to deal with."</p><p></p><p>One of the six giant outer figures, a horrific Demonic Divinity resembling an eight-armed octopus, sent out a psychic ripple.</p><p></p><p>"If we kill those nine Ninth Stage void beings, how much will it elevate our spiritual will?"</p><p></p><p>A grey snake-like Demonic Divinity hissed: "Eight-Armed ***, are you thinking of giving up?"</p><p></p><p>Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities addressed each other by their '***' titles.</p><p></p><p>For instance, this eight-armed octopus Demonic Divinity was called Eight-Armed ***, while the snake was Celestial Python ***.</p><p></p><p>"Give up?"</p><p>"Of course not!" Eight-Armed *** immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>Ninth Stage void beings were exceptionally rare - having finally encountered nine at once, it was a once-in-a-millennium opportunity that couldn't be given up.</p><p></p><p>"But what should we do now?"</p><p>Eight-Armed *** asked: "Charge straight into the nest? That's the void beings' lair - even if we join forces to attack, being on their home turf, forget hunting them, we might end up being the hunted."</p><p></p><p>In direct combat strength, Ninth Stage void beings were no weaker than Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was their lower intelligence compared to Demonic Divinities of the same level, which gave the latter an edge.</p><p></p><p>But it was just an edge - their strength gap was not large.</p><p></p><p>Originally outnumbered six to nine, Eight-Armed *** and Celestial Python *** were already at a disadvantage, let alone actively invading the enemy's lair. Most Seventh Stage Demonic Divinities couldn't maintain rationality, but Ninth Stage ones had powerful spiritual will without that flaw.</p><p></p><p>Each Ninth Stage Demonic Divinity would be considered a transcendent genius among humans.</p><p></p><p>"We can wait here," Celestial Python *** said. "The space-time ripples from this nest will inevitably attract other Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities. Once enough gather nearby, we can join forces and, when the numbers are sufficient, charge into the nest."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we six belong to the same alliance. Once the nest is breached, we should work together to eliminate the other Demonic Divinities."</p><p></p><p>The remaining Demonic Divinities nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>With just the six of them, invading the void beings' nest carried great risk.</p><p></p><p>But what about ten Demonic Divinities? Twenty? Then they could overwhelm the nest's inhabitants, and the six of them could temporarily join forces against the other Demonic Divinities that arrived.</p><p></p><p>Demonic Divinities did sometimes ally, but without full trust they remained wary of each other.</p><p></p><p>However, with proper preparation, these six could drive off the others for a short time and seize the chance to kill the nine void beings.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and more Demonic Divinities were drawn by the nest's aura.</p><p></p><p>At Celestial Python *** and Eight-Armed ***'s suggestion, the newcomers agreed to wait for more to arrive before attacking the nest together.</p><p></p><p>Anyone capable of becoming a Demonic Divinity wasn't foolish - they understood their individual strength was likely insufficient against the nine equal-level void beings in the nest.</p><p></p><p>Only by joining forces could they divide the spoils.</p><p></p><p>Of course, nine void beings wouldn't be enough for all the assembled Demonic Divinities, but that wasn't a concern yet. Their eyes glinted as they gazed at the distant, massive nest, thoughts unknown.</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough."</p><p>"There are already nineteen Demonic Divinities."</p><p>"Wait for one more, then we can launch the joint attack."</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python *** scanned around and spoke. Their initial plan was to gather twenty Demonic Divinities before invading the nest.</p><p></p><p>Twenty Demonic Divinities minus their six would be fourteen - not too many or too few.</p><p></p><p>More than fourteen introduced too many variables; even if the six allied, they couldn't be sure of driving off the extras, and might have to recruit them to share the void being spoils.  </p><p></p><p>Fewer than fourteen seemed insufficient against the nine void beings with home field advantage. If it dragged on and attracted even more Demonic Divinities while they battled the nest's inhabitants, the variables would increase further.</p><p></p><p>They might even get plucked like ripe fruit.</p><p></p><p>So twenty assembled Demonic Divinities was the perfect number - not more, not less.</p><p></p><p>Outside the nest, nineteen Demonic Divinity figures stood waiting for the twentieth to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python *** observed the nest interior while extending its senses to detect any approaching Demonic Divinities.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying aura like a looming sun rapidly neared its perception range, heading straight for them.</p><p></p><p>"Another Demonic Divinity is coming."</p><p>"Such a scorching aura? Who could it be?"</p><p>"The Demonic Divinities of the void secret realm are limited, who is this?"</p><p></p><p>The nineteen Demonic Divinities turned towards the rapidly approaching figure.  </p><p></p><p>Judging by its size, this figure was minuscule compared to their towering forms, like a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>But the Demonic Divinities present showed no disdain - the aura it released proved its identity. Though usually gargantuan, Demonic Divinities could also take smaller forms.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Sun ***."</p><p>"The Sun *** that emerged some three to five hundred years ago?"</p><p>"I've heard this *** is quite powerful and renowned among Ninth Stage Demonic Divinities."</p><p></p><p>Some immediately recognized Lin Yuan and quickly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"The Sun ***? Very good, with this *** joining us, our odds of breaching the nest will improve."</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python ***'s spirit rallied. If the Sun *** obeyed commands, it didn't mind letting him share the void being spoils for helping suppress them quickly.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swiftly arrived before the nest and glanced at the nineteen Demonic Divinity figures standing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, the void beings are the priority."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned his gaze towards the nest interior.</p><p></p><p>"Sun ***."</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python *** immediately transmitted: "I wonder if the Sun *** is interested in joining us? There are nine Ninth Stage void beings inside this nest - it will be difficult for the Sun *** alone..." It laid out the alliance plan and promised that as long as the Sun *** followed orders, he would get at least one void being in the end.</p><p></p><p>The other Demonic Divinities looked at Lin Yuan, ready to launch a joint attack on the nest if he agreed.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, to the disbelieving gazes of all the Demonic Divinities, Lin Yuan's form abruptly began swelling, becoming a million-mile-tall giant. He raised his right hand and reached straight into the nest's depths.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>Terrifying aura constantly shook - as the void beings' ancient lair, this nest was undoubtedly extremely dangerous. But with a single swipe from Lin Yuan, space-time churned and everything began to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Celestial Python ***, originally waiting for Lin Yuan's reply, fell silent. Seeing Lin Yuan's heaven-spanning million-mile-tall body and the overwhelming aura it radiated, it couldn't help but tremble inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Though a Demonic Divinity's strength wasn't directly tied to size, Lin Yuan's colossal million-mile form and the aura of a falling sky made Celestial Python ***'s scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with just one swipe, this massive nest began crumbling from the roots, further displaying Lin Yuan's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>The other Demonic Divinities were equally dumbstruck. They had painstakingly planned to gather twenty Demonic Divinities to have a chance at invading the void beings' nest, yet Lin Yuan breached it with one hand!</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>The void beings' nest continued collapsing as Lin Yuan's arm plunged deeper, only stopping at a certain point.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the entire nest seemed to erupt in fury, unleashing terrifying power straight at Lin Yuan's intruding arm. But a flash of profound yellow light dispelled it all into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>The nineteen Demonic Divinities watched in awe. The nest's earlier tremors clearly came from a full-power strike, yet the Sun *** had blocked it with ridiculous ease.</p><p></p><p>Just what level of strength did this Sun ***, who had only emerged three to five hundred years ago, possess? "So terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Demonic Divinities trembled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Swish swish.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, before the eyes of all the Demonic Divinities, Lin Yuan's arm retracted from the nest's depths, soon fully withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>It was then that they realized Lin Yuan's right hand now grasped two void beings.</p><p></p><p>The two struggled desperately, their auras no less than those present, but Lin Yuan's five fingers formed a space-time prison sealing them completely.</p><p></p><p>Then, Lin Yuan's fingers closed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The two void beings dissipated into nothingness, their formless power absorbed into Lin Yuan, elevating his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan's right hand plunged back into the nest.</p><p></p><p>When it reemerged, his five fingers held three more void beings.</p><p></p><p>Then he crushed them.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, six void beings died by Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>His right hand entered the nest again, and when it returned he grasped another three void beings.</p><p></p><p>Beings powerful enough to make Demonic Divinities wary were like chicks in Lin Yuan's grip, crushed with a simple squeeze.</p><p></p><p>"Is that a void being sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python *** immediately noticed one of the three void beings in Lin Yuan's hand had a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>A void being sovereign ruled over all other void beings and could command them.</p><p></p><p>Killing a sovereign would elevate one's spiritual will tremendously, equivalent to dozens of equal-level void beings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sovereign in Lin Yuan's grasp, the other Demonic Divinities' eyes turned red with greed. But recalling Lin Yuan's displayed power, none dared speak up, glancing repeatedly at Celestial Python ***.</p><p></p><p>"Sun ***."</p><p></p><p>Mustering courage, Celestial Python *** said: "This nest was our discovery... Ugh!!" Its words reverberated through space-time, but Lin Yuan was examining the Ninth Stage void being sovereign in his hand - the first he had seen.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Celestial Python ***'s inquiry, Lin Yuan looked its way.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>Celestial Python *** felt its scalp explode, Lin Yuan's gaze making its entire body feel scorched by terrifying spiritual will, like all-consuming celestial flames.</p><p></p><p>It quickly continued: "But since the Sun *** has arrived, the nest belongs to you. We'll withdraw at once, withdraw right away..." Before finishing, Celestial Python *** fled like a whipped dog.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the remaining eighteen Demonic Divinities swiftly retreated from Lin Yuan as well.</p><p></p><p>The nineteen had dared gather because their strength gap wasn't too wide, unable to defeat each other.  </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? With the ease he plucked out three to four Ninth Stage void beings, they had no doubt he could slay ordinary Demonic Divinities.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had hoped Celestial Python *** could negotiate on their behalf and get the Sun *** to at least share some common void beings, letting them get a taste.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Celestial Python ***'s reaction, these Demonic Divinities dared not linger.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't flee now, once the Sun *** finished with the void being sovereign, would he turn his attention to them? It wouldn't be pretty.</p>

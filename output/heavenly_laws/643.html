            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The supreme Immortal Lords of the six ancient great nations entered the precious land.</p><p></p><p>"Time reversal?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed a trace of temporal force flowing.</p><p></p><p>Without sufficient comprehension of space-time, he would be affected by this temporal force and return to a position a few breaths ago.</p><p></p><p>When this top-grade precious land first emerged, it was first discovered by the great Immortal Lords in the vicinity, but these great Immortal Lords could basically not even enter, let alone obtain the rare treasures produced within the precious land.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan crossed the temporal flow region and stepped into the precious land.</p><p></p><p>"Such a vast space-time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When the top-grade precious land first emerged, it was still connected to the source world, but as time passed, this connected state would gradually fade, manifesting as the space-time of the precious land constantly withering.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Black Jade's Nest, this top-grade precious land had emerged countless ages ago, and the space-time it was in had shrunk too much, so that the Extreme Cold Immortal Lord and the North Yin Immortal Lord could reach the core of the precious land in just two breaths.</p><p></p><p>It's just like an unripe fruit, still connected to the mother tree, equivalent to a part of the mother tree. But once the fruit matures and detaches from the mother tree, it becomes a simple fruit.</p><p></p><p>The precious land follows a similar principle.</p><p></p><p>"Red Lotus, Silver River, search in that direction."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Immortal Lord immediately instructed, arranging ten supreme Immortal Lords to disperse and search. Once they discover the 'core' of the precious land, they must immediately notify him and Guanglie.</p><p></p><p>Then the Crimson Flame Immortal Lord and the Guanglie Immortal Lord would personally go and refine it.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also felt that this arrangement was fine, and immediately followed the direction he needed to explore.</p><p></p><p>Since the 'core' of the precious land could be in any location, the search could only be done by slowly flying and searching. As for spatial traversal? It was too easy to overlook.</p><p></p><p>As for using domain-based methods to investigate? The precious land had just emerged and was still connected to the source world. Even Lin Yuan's divine ability 'World' could at most lock onto an area of a hundred billion miles around him, and anything further might be overlooked.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan's figure disappeared, heading in the direction arranged by the Crimson Flame Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"This top-grade precious land is indeed not simple, it seems to be even more substantial than the Black Jade's Nest?" Lin Yuan thought to himself, as he personally entered this top-grade precious land, he naturally had some comparisons.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>In an independent space.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Immortal Lord, the Eternal Sun Immortal Lord, and the other twelve supreme Immortal Lords participating in the precious land's contention, all had a clone left here to facilitate communication at any time.</p><p></p><p>"I have discovered a precious land core!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Red Lotus Immortal Lord suddenly opened his eyes and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"So fast?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Red Lotus Immortal Lord, having just entered the precious land, he had already discovered a 'core', which could only be said to be very lucky.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go there right now."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Immortal Lord immediately said.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the top-grade precious land, the Crimson Flame Immortal Lord, who had been standing still and commanding the situation, immediately headed towards the location of the Red Lotus Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the precious land 'core'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully investigated, "Hmm? It's a supreme Immortal Lord from the Dark Yin Ancient Nation?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, in the far left front, a supreme Immortal Lord from the Dark Yin Ancient Nation, whose route should partially overlap with Lin Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>That supreme Immortal Lord from the Dark Yin Ancient Nation briefly met Lin Yuan's gaze from afar, but did not linger, and continued to fly in the direction of his own exploration.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation and the Dark Yin Ancient Nation were constantly at war, this time they entered the precious land, the main goal was to refine the 'core'.</p><p></p><p>If there was no 'core', the two supreme Immortal Lords would not engage in combat, as that would only make the other ancient nation Immortal Lords happy.</p><p></p><p>"With the coverage range of my external world, I should have an advantage over the other supreme Immortal Lords." Lin Yuan thought to himself, he was only able to explore an area of a hundred billion miles around him.</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Lords would be suppressed even more.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't underestimate them either, they are all supreme Immortal Lords, and there are even many top-tier supreme Immortal Lords, who knows what techniques they have."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was not careless at all.</p><p></p><p>In another part of the precious land.</p><p></p><p>The twelve supreme Immortal Lords of the Great Spirit Ancient Nation also descended at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"You all leave a main combat body with me."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Prison Immortal Lord swept his gaze over the other eleven supreme Immortal Lords, "I have a secret technique that can slightly sense the aura of the precious land 'core'. Once I detect it, I will immediately rush over and release your main combat bodies to refine the precious land 'core', then I will rush to the next precious land 'core'."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The eleven supreme Immortal Lords of the Great Spirit Ancient Nation nodded, they had already formulated a plan to refine the precious land 'core' before coming, with the Spirit Prison Immortal Lord as the main force.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Prison Immortal Lord's Chaos Spirit Prison technique not only had extraordinary effects in restraining other supreme Immortal Lords, but could also remotely sense the precious land 'core'.</p><p></p><p>Although this sensing had many limitations, it was still far better than slowly flying and searching.</p><p></p><p>After handing over their main combat bodies to the Spirit Prison Immortal Lord, the eleven Immortal Lords of the Great Spirit Ancient Nation also headed in different directions to search.</p><p></p><p>Although this contention for the precious land was led by the Spirit Prison Immortal Lord, they also had to make preparations in multiple aspects, and could not place all their hopes on the Spirit Prison Immortal Lord alone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Prison Immortal Lord's expression suddenly changed, and he looked towards a certain location, taking a step and disappearing from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, I discovered a precious land core so quickly."</p><p></p><p>A supreme Immortal Lord from the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation, his expression excited as he looked at the illusory celestial pillar in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The illusory celestial pillar was fused into the core of the precious land, and could only be perceived by approaching a certain distance.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'll start trying to refine it." This supreme Immortal Lord from the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation, after informing the other eleven supreme Immortal Lords of the location of this core, immediately began attempting to refine it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The space-time began to distort slightly.</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Spirit Prison Immortal Lord appeared, overlooking the supreme Immortal Lord from the Thunder Roar Ancient Nation who was trying to refine it.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Prison?" </p><p></p><p>This Thunderclap Ancient Country Supreme Celestial immediately sensed the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial and angrily roared in a low voice, "This core treasure land belongs to my Thunderclap Ancient Country."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial looked down with a mocking expression on his face: "Just now it was yours, but now it's mine."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>the left eye of the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial rapidly began to expand and spread, forming a towering and all-encompassing prison that enveloped the Thunderclap Ancient Country Supreme Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Celestial of the Thunderclap Ancient Country struggled desperately, but it was futile as he was quickly drawn into the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's left eye.</p><p></p><p>"Confining you for a month will be more than enough."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial felt the struggling power of the Nether Prison and casually said.</p><p></p><p>Confining him for a month? Although the contest for the treasure land had lasted for two thousand years, the most critical stage was likely the initial few decades.</p><p></p><p>"Come out."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial immediately released several main combat bodies of the Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials, "I will start refining them now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>These Supreme Celestials felt energized, as they had just sensed the Thunderclap Ancient Country Supreme Celestial being completely overpowered and suppressed by the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's left eye prison.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>the core of this treasure land was refined by the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial, who had been continuously operating his perception secret art, made another discovery and disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Supreme Celestials, they remained guarding nearby.</p><p></p><p>Elsewhere,</p><p></p><p>the rapidly exploring Lin Yuan's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan appeared tens of billions of miles away, facing a illusory celestial pillar that was almost fused with the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>"The 'core' of the treasure land."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Crimson Lotus Supreme Celestial discovered the first treasure land core, the other five Supreme Celestials had also successively discovered treasure land cores.</p><p></p><p>The treasure land core in front of Lin Yuan should be the seventh one discovered by the Blazing Sun Ancient Country.</p><p></p><p>The moment he discovered this 'core' of the treasure land, Lin Yuan immediately contacted the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial and the Vast Blaze Supreme Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"I'll refine it myself first."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial and the Vast Blaze Supreme Celestial would need time to arrive, so Lin Yuan could completely refine a portion of it during this period, thus saving time for the full refinement.</p><p></p><p>Splashing sounds.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan immediately began to act.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yuan's expression changed, and he looked up at the high place.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a figure silently appear there, overlooking Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Supreme Celestial of the Blazing Sun Ancient Country?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's face. With the chaotic Nether Prison power he had evolved, as long as he did not encounter the Profound Void Supreme Celestial of the Great Desolate Ancient Country, he could imprison even the top Supreme Celestials for a while.</p><p></p><p>As for the Silver River Supreme Celestial? Although he was the first existence in the six ancient countries to have transformed the ancestor's bloodline into the Supreme Celestial realm, he was still far from being able to resist the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"Nether Prison Supreme Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became grave. The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's strength was definitely on par with the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial and the Vast Blaze Supreme Celestial, and his troublesomeness might even surpass them.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Sun Country's independent space.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial gone there?" The Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial looked at Lin Yuan, his brows furrowed, "Immediately withdraw from that treasure land core."</p><p></p><p>"Withdraw from the treasure land core?" Lin Yuan looked at the Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial, having just discovered a treasure land core, he was reluctant to just hand it over to the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial. "If you don't withdraw, you'll be trapped in the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's Nether Prison, and the losses for the Blazing Sun Ancient Country will only be greater."</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial said calmly. Although he was very unwilling to let go of the treasure land core, if they persisted, the losses for the Blazing Sun Ancient Country would not be limited to this treasure land core, even Lin Yuan could be dragged in.</p><p></p><p>"The Scarlet Flame Supreme Celestial wants me to withdraw."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial high above, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Enter my Nether Prison."</p><p></p><p>The Nether Prison Supreme Celestial looked down at Lin Yuan, and his right eye began to spread and expand, forming a towering and all-encompassing Nether Prison that instantly enveloped Lin Yuan and then drew him into the right eye.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing and imprisoning the Supreme Celestials of other ancient countries would only lead to greater losses for those countries, so the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial naturally would not give it up.</p><p></p><p>"You all quickly refine the edges of the celestial pillar, the core part is for me to refine."</p><p></p><p>After imprisoning the Silver River Supreme Celestial in his right Nether Prison, the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial waved his hand, and several more Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>These Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials looked at the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial, their spirits more vibrant than ever before. In just a short time, they had snatched two treasure land cores from the hands of other ancient countries, and if this continued, the number of cores refined by the Great Nether Ancient Country would definitely not be few.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>just as these Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials were about to go down and refine the illusory celestial pillar,</p><p></p><p>they suddenly noticed that the originally calm and indifferent Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's expression had abruptly changed, as if he could not control his own body and retreated a few steps, instinctively covering his right eye with his right hand.</p><p></p><p>"Nether Prison, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>The several Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials sensed that something was amiss and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>The only remaining left eye of the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial revealed an incredulous expression, and he looked at the several Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials, "Don't come over here."</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over?" </p><p></p><p>The several Great Nether Ancient Country Supreme Celestials looked at each other, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>However, what they didn't know was that on the surface of the right eye the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial was tightly covering, a faint red glow was starting to appear.</p><p></p><p>If this faint red glow was magnified a billion times, it would be revealed that this tiny red glow was like countless suns.</p><p></p><p>The red glow spread endlessly, instantly filling the surface of the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's eyeball.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's right eye, under the endless red glow, had become like a ball of fire.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>the Nether Prison Supreme Celestial's right eye directly exploded.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

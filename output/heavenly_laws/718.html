        <h1>Chapter 718</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his mind, the majestic Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the lowest threshold, a new world coordinate pattern slowly took shape.</p><p></p><p>"Is it an unknown dimensional space?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>When approaching an independent world, the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds would automatically capture its specific coordinates to allow Lin Yuan to travel and descend there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already witnessed this ability in his previous few travels.</p><p></p><p>For example, the worlds of Zhongtu Shenzhou, the Spirit Realm, and even the Immortal Realm were obtained this way.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived before that dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the vast and unrestrained Chaos Void, this dimensional space was much smaller.</p><p></p><p>It was probably only about one percent the size of the Chaos Void, likely not even having given birth to time-based lifeforms yet.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan tried to merge his consciousness into this dimensional space, he encountered fierce resistance.</p><p></p><p>The instincts of this dimensional space strongly rejected Lin Yuan. If he were to forcefully enter, it would cause the entire dimensional space to collapse directly.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder even beings as powerful as time-based lifeforms have such limited exploration of other dimensional spaces - they simply don't have the opportunity," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The operation of the grand laws and rules contained in each dimensional space was completely different. For time-based lifeforms, experiencing the operation of different grand laws and rules was a unique cultivation experience.</p><p></p><p>However, if time-based lifeforms wanted to explore other dimensional spaces? If it was a dimensional space the size of the Chaos Void, they simply couldn't explore it at all. The consciousness of the dimensional space itself was enough to suppress the vast majority of time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that dimensional spaces like the Chaos Void had even given birth to some time-based lifeforms of their own.</p><p></p><p>For the second Source World, the Lord of Heavenly Light was able to merge into it firstly because he chose the initial period when that Source World was newly created and its instinctive consciousness had not fully recovered, and secondly because no other time-based lifeforms had been born yet.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he succeeded only by paying a terrible price.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the trace of perfect aura contained within the Source World, that kind of behavior by the Lord of Heavenly Light would have been completely not worth it.</p><p></p><p>As for weaker dimensional spaces? Weaker dimensional spaces would contain correspondingly weaker grand laws and rules. And no matter how weak, the dimensional space itself would resist any invading lifeforms, time-based lifeforms included.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully invading and exploring would most likely result in the collapse of the dimensional space and the time-based lifeform itself suffering backlash and severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, 13th level time-based lifeforms both yearned for and felt helpless towards other dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the dimensional space before him.</p><p></p><p>Other time-based lifeforms facing this dimensional space would at most only be able to look at it from afar. Unless they were prepared for mutual destruction, they basically wouldn't have many options.</p><p></p><p>At most they could only explore the outer edges slightly, unable to delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>Since it had been recorded by the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>It meant Lin Yuan could descend into it perfectly through the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Descending into any world through the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds would result in perfect integration. Neither the instinctive consciousness of the dimensional space nor the consciousness of the inner world would detect anything.</p><p></p><p>"I can descend and explore it sometime when I have time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, then continued heading towards the location of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other time-based lifeforms, Lin Yuan had far too many choices when it came to dimensional spaces. Not to mention the "customized" travel of the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds, just the remaining 31 Source Worlds were enough for him to explore for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>This weak dimensional space that wasn't even one percent the size of the Chaos Void didn't appeal much to Lin Yuan right now.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body sat cross-legged, constantly monitoring the movements of his Taiji Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>After all, that Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower was related to whether he could advance his Chaos Taiji Dao to the third level before reaching the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>Decades passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had also observed more of his own future timelines.</p><p></p><p>He clearly saw that if he relied solely on himself, it would take 80,000 years to reach the third level of Chaos Taiji Dao before advancing to the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>But with the help of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, he could reach the third level of Chaos Taiji within 20,000 years.</p><p></p><p>"That dimensional space..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered the new dimensional space discovered by his Taiji Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the future timelines I've observed are not enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, realizing that the discovery of this dimensional space was completely unexpected - he hadn't seen it in any of the future timelines he'd observed.</p><p></p><p>This was also very normal.</p><p></p><p>In every moment, countless future timelines are produced, and each time node of every future timeline would in turn produce even more timelines.</p><p></p><p>Unless one was a 14th level perfect time-based lifeform who could perceive all timelines and understand past and future, even the most powerful time-based lifeforms would have moments of "miscalculation".</p><p></p><p>Let alone Lin Yuan who wasn't even a time-based lifeform yet - the future timelines he could observe were truly limited.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of variables outside the timelines was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reined in his thoughts. Over the past few decades, besides devoting part of his mind to observing his own future timelines, he had put more of his mental energy into cultivation, such as comprehending and cultivating the Chaos Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>As well as cultivating the sixth level of "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>This 13th level inheritance, ever since Lin Yuan</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After fully integrating the other two source worlds, it completely transcended the scope of the inheritance itself, and could even be said to have far exceeded the expectations of the creator of this inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the goal of "Infinite Void" was only the chaos void. Even if one reached the theoretical seventh level, it would only approach the level of a Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>But the ultimate goal of Lin Yuan's internal universe now was a perfect world. "Now I have completed 80% of the creation of the particle world, with only 20% left before I can fully create infinite sand-like particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>Vast numbers of microscopic particles were being created within Lin Yuan's body at every moment, giving birth to countless immense worlds, which were then reconstructed through the brand new "Infinite Void" inheritance.</p><p></p><p>For the second source world, it took Lin Yuan a full ten thousand years to complete the creation of infinite sand-like particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>While for the chaos void and the first source world, several decades to a hundred years was enough.</p><p></p><p>Resources were not lacking.</p><p></p><p>Plus the familiarity from recreating it once again.</p><p></p><p>As well as the understanding and insights into runes.</p><p></p><p>These allowed Lin Yuan to have no bottlenecks or confusion in creating his own infinite sand-like particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>"After completing the infinite sand-like particle worlds, plus reaching the sixth level of 'Infinite Void', and the third level of the Chaos Taiji Way..."</p><p></p><p>"When these three are all completed, that will be when I break through to the thirteenth level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan set goals for himself.</p><p></p><p>In the many future timelines he observed, only when these three were all achieved, entering the thirteenth level at his peak state, would he gain the greatest improvement.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the highest reaches of the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>This was a completely isolated space-time, where a towering figure sat cross-legged in slumber.</p><p></p><p>Though called slumber, it was actually cultivation. The cultivation methods of thirteenth level time beings were not limited to simple closed-door meditation.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>The eyelids of this towering figure twitched, and slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>"So many events throughout history, seas turn to mulberry fields in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>The towering figure was in a good mood, clearly having gained much from this slumber.</p><p></p><p>For time beings, even the slightest progress was extremely precious. Many time beings spun their wheels for countless ages without advancing.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see, how are those who are cultivating the inheritances I created doing during my slumber?"</p><p></p><p>The towering figure's thoughts stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, several special objects vanished from various parts of the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>These special objects included a crystal clear teardrop, a slowly beating heart, a star point emitting dazzling light, and so on.</p><p></p><p>They were all carriers of certain thirteenth level inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Six special objects appeared before the towering figure.</p><p></p><p>The thirteenth level inheritances within the special objects were all created by the towering figure, then casually spread out.</p><p></p><p>Each special object corresponded to a thirteenth level inheritance, representing the ultimate in some aspect.</p><p></p><p>For example, that crystal clear teardrop contained a thirteenth level inheritance called "Soul Illusion Realm", which pursued the ultimate in soul.</p><p></p><p>Then there was that slowly beating heart, whose inner inheritance was called "Infinite Body", pursuing the ultimate in physical form.</p><p></p><p>The star point emitting dazzling light was a thirteenth level inheritance pursuing the ultimate in mental will.</p><p></p><p>The other thirteenth level inheritances were similar, all pursuing the ultimate in some aspect.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure created these inheritances and spread them all out, intending to cultivate a thirteenth level time being.</p><p></p><p>In the mysterious dimensional interstices, thirteenth level time beings were like enormous behemoths, occupying large areas of space-time. Many time beings allied with each other to seize more benefits.</p><p></p><p>As for how to ally? Naturally close relationships were needed.</p><p></p><p>And the closest relationships? Obviously time beings from the same dimensional space were closest.</p><p></p><p>The more time beings born in the chaos void before the great destruction, the stronger their position would be when entering the dimensional interstices in the future.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the towering figure trying to cultivate thirteenth level beings, other time beings were also cultivating them, leaving behind many thirteenth level inheritances.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see which inheritance cultivators there were during my slumber."</p><p></p><p>The towering figure's gaze fell on each special object carrying an inheritance.</p><p></p><p>These special objects all recorded information on past inheritors. If the towering figure felt one was worth cultivating, and that inheritor had died...</p><p></p><p>Then he would take action to resurrect them.</p><p></p><p>Twelfth level beings break free from the river of time, their life imprints engraved in the chaos void. Only thirteenth level time beings can resurrect them.</p><p></p><p>"This one won't do."</p><p></p><p>The towering figure instantly browsed through the information recorded in the teardrop, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This thirteenth level inheritance representing the ultimate in soul produced inheritors with the most bizarre methods. Soul attacks were formless and intangible, even defense was impossible to know how to defend against.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure continued to look at the second, third special object.</p><p></p><p>Soon he had looked through the sixth special object.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Only now did the towering figure realize something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>He had spread out seven special objects, representing the ultimate in seven major aspects including mental will, soul, physical form, internal world, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Now only six of the seven special objects were here? The towering figure blinked, immediately realizing:</p><p></p><p>"Where did my gourd go?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 389</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The 'strange objects' inside the box had various shapes, including hammers, swords, armor and more. </p><p></p><p>More than a dozen 'strange objects' gathered together, even in this two-dimensional world that suppressed all laws, Lin Yuan could still sense an intense extraordinary aura pulsating.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the 'strange object' that caught Lin Yuan's eye was a 'tower-shaped' one. The aura fluctuations emanating from inside were somewhat similar to the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>"This 'tower-shaped' strange object should also contain an independent space inside, though smaller in size compared to my mirror."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The aura fluctuations revealed by the 'tower-shaped' object were slightly inferior to the silver mirror.</p><p></p><p>"But they haven't discovered the use of this object?" Lin Yuan glanced at Xuanyuan Duo in front of him.</p><p></p><p>If they could unleash the power of the tower-shaped object, they wouldn't need this box to hold more than a dozen strange objects. They could all be placed inside the independent space of the tower-shaped object, safe and inconspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered and understood why this was the case.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in order to develop the abilities of the silver mirror, he had focused his spiritual power on it for half a day.</p><p></p><p>He almost affected his own strength.</p><p></p><p>One must know that at that time, Lin Yuan was at the Nineteenth Realm of a Shaman Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Nineteenth Shaman Ancestor Realm was achieved by perfecting each previous realm before advancing to the next, finally reaching the nineteenth.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated to be equivalent to the Twenty-fifth Realm of a normal powerful cultivator from other races.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the minimum threshold to unleash the independent space inside the tower-shaped object was the Twenty-fifth Shaman Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the strongest evolver on the human civilization side, Xuanyuan Duo, was only barely at the Twentieth Shaman Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless she was willing to risk exhausting all of her spiritual power, she might be able to activate the independent space within the tower-shaped object.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanyuan Duo would not do such a thing, as the risk was too great.</p><p></p><p>If during this period, they were ambushed by other powerful cultivators, the human civilization could be eliminated prematurely, just like the Feather Race.</p><p></p><p>Most of the human civilization's evolvers were not like Lin Yuan, hiding in some inconspicuous corner.</p><p></p><p>They had established bases in the ancient capital, requiring powerful experts to guard at all times to prevent accidents.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can take these strange objects out, I can keep half of them," Lin Yuan looked at the strange objects, thinking quickly.</p><p></p><p>This was the promise made by the Supreme Expert Xia Qin, that he could take away half of the strange objects he brought out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan could also choose not to take the objects, and instead exchange them for corresponding merit points to redeem other precious resources collected by the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Currently, handing over twelve-star rare treasures and weapons was one of the few channels in the human civilization to obtain a large amount of merit points.</p><p></p><p>Because each twelve-star rare treasure or weapon had the potential to aid the entire human civilization, its value was naturally measured in merit points.</p><p></p><p>"There's also a strange armor object?" Lin Yuan looked at the grayish-blue armor in the box.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the strange inner armor Lin Yuan was wearing, this armor was obviously much larger and would definitely have higher defense than just the inner armor alone.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"The inner armor is enough for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave up the idea of wearing this armor, as it was too large and could affect his agility.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only a disadvantage in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>If they were in the outside world, the sizes of these strange objects could be adjusted at will. As long as he could refine them, he could change them according to his own desires.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take them then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated his silver mirror, directly moving the box in front of him into the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had mentioned the abilities of the silver mirror to the Supreme Expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the Supreme Expert decided to have him safeguard all the strange objects.</p><p></p><p>First, because of his strength.</p><p></p><p>Second, for convenience.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial fluctuations?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xuanyuan Duo was startled.</p><p></p><p>To cause spatial fluctuations in this two-dimensional world, even a perfect legendary eleventh-stage life form could not achieve it.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Blood Rain person possesses a strange object containing a complete space?" Xuanyuan Duo thought to herself, her expression becoming even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she guessed which legendary evolver of the human civilization this Blood Rain person was.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, the name 'Blood Rain' used by Lin Yuan was just a random alias to conceal his true identity.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Duo came from the Xuanyuan family, one of the strongest evolving families in the human civilization, established by the descendants of a Supreme Expert.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Duo basically knew all the eleventh-stage evolvers of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But she could not find any perfect legendary eleventh-stage evolver similar to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Could he be from that place?" Xuanyuan Duo's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan joined the human civilization evolvers, there was still one and a half months until the Celestial Gate opened.</p><p></p><p>But to be on the safe side, that afternoon, Lin Yuan led the human evolvers towards the summit of the Kunlun Mountains.</p><p></p><p>In previous openings of the Celestial Gate, it had always appeared above the summit of the Kunlun Mountains, the closest place to the Gate.</p><p></p><p>"The powerful experts of the human civilization have arrived."</p><p></p><p>"This time, the powerful experts of the human civilization in this two-dimensional world are not particularly impressive?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is the one leading them? I've never seen him before."</p><p></p><p>"Is he the mysterious expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Country?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would this mysterious expert gather with the human civilization?"  </p><p></p><p>"Could this mysterious expert be from the human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>On their way to the summit of the Kunlun Mountains, the powerful experts of other races also noticed the group of human evolvers. As the pinnacle race, they would be noticed no matter where they went.</p><p></p><p>And when these powerful experts saw that it was Lin Yuan leading the human evolvers, they were extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious expert from the Blood Rain Ancient Country had only acted once two hundred years ago, but his actions shook the world, and he is still listed among the nine great experts until now.</p><p></p><p>Originally, many powerful experts from other races had speculated about the identity of this mysterious expert.</p><p></p><p>The most likely possibility was that he was a unique special life form, similar to the 'Mother of the Tree Realm' or the 'Four Celestial Kings'.</p><p></p><p>But now, it turned out that this mysterious expert actually came from the human civilization?</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the human civilization!"</p><p></p><p>"Terrifying, the human civilization has such a powerful expert guarding them, yet there was not a single rumor about it before today?"</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible that he's not actually from the human civilization, perhaps he just cooperated with them."</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from various races discussed animatedly. Most of them had self-awareness and clearly understood that they had no hope of leaving this two-dimensional world. Their purpose in coming to the Kunlun Mountains was to catch a glimpse of the strongest life forms below the Supreme Experts in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Rain is not from our human civilization?" </p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Duo glanced at the powerful experts of other races and shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>From the tone used by the Supreme Expert when instructing her, Xuanyuan Duo could almost confirm that Lin Yuan was from the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If he was an outsider, the Supreme Expert would not have trusted him so much as to let her hand over all the strange objects directly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the realm, the Supreme Expert of the Stellar Alliance glanced at the Supreme Expert Xia Qin and quickly transmitted, "So this is the reason behind your human civilization's confidence?"</p><p></p><p>After the powerful experts of other races saw Lin Yuan leading the human evolvers to the summit of the Kunlun Mountains, they naturally spread this news. The Supreme Experts of the Stellar Alliance also learned about it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Expert Xia Qin looked at the Supreme Expert of the Stellar Alliance but remained silent.</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no need to conceal anything. Facing the imminent opening of the Celestial Gate, they had to gather all their strength.</p><p></p><p>That was why he had Lin Yuan join the human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he thought Xuanyuan Duo and the other human evolvers could provide great assistance to Lin Yuan. But at least when they were restraining the powerful experts of other forces, the human evolvers could take action to obstruct them.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen the battle videos of your human civilization's evolvers. As perfect eleventh-stage evolvers, to possess such strength is indeed rare. But for this Celestial Gate opening, if you want to compete with us special life forms, it's still a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Expert of the Stellar Alliance transmitted again.</p><p></p><p>He was telling the truth. In this two-dimensional world, the advantages of those powerful special life forms were too great.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see after the Celestial Gate opens," Supreme Expert Xia Qin shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Expert of the Stellar Alliance thought Lin Yuan was a perfect eleventh-stage evolver from the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, Lin Yuan had just entered the Tenth Realm not long ago.</p><p></p><p>In just over a hundred years, with the strength of the Tenth Realm, he had crushed special life forms like Tuoba Ancient God at the fifth level of the Eleventh Realm. Such talent and aptitude were unprecedented to Supreme Expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>For a perfect legendary eleventh-stage special life form like the Four Celestial Kings, if not for the aid of that Supreme weapon, they might not even be comparable to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the qualification. </p><p></p><p>Very soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought the human evolvers to the peak of the Tian Shan mountains. </p><p></p><p>The peak of the Tian Shan was vast and spacious. At this moment, at least one hundred thousand powerful experts from various races had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Deity Kings?" Lin Yuan immediately noticed the four-armed male sitting cross-legged in the center of the Tian Shan peak. </p><p></p><p>None of the powerful experts from various races dared to approach this four-armed male, which immediately caught Lin Yuan's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the supreme expert that Xia Qinzhi warned me to be cautious of? If I'm not confident, should I give up competing for this opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate and wait for the next opening?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the Four Deity Kings. In Xia Qinzhi's eyes, the Four Deity Kings themselves were not formidable, but the supreme weapon he brought in was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>A fully refined supreme weapon could potentially unleash power far exceeding the limits of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"His arms..." Lin Yuan's gaze lingered on the Four Deity Kings' four arms, which was where his supreme weapon had fused.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't seem that powerful. It's also possible that he's just concealing his aura and not using his full strength," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just like him now, as long as he didn't intentionally release his aura, other powerful experts wouldn't be able to sense anything.</p><p></p><p>The reason those experts were afraid of Lin Yuan was entirely due to his overwhelming victory in killing Tuoba Gushen two hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Let me observe further."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shifted his gaze away from the Four Deity Kings and turned his attention to the other powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a skinny old man who seemed to be burning like a flame, a three-meter-tall sturdy man, and four or five other experts caught Lin Yuan's eye.</p><p></p><p>According to the information he received, these were all eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms. Although they didn't carry a supreme weapon like the threatening Four Deity Kings, they were still formidable.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, these eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms were far beyond Lin Yuan's ability to match. However, in this two-dimensional world, anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>With the same starting point, as long as he had enough time, Lin Yuan was confident he could defeat even supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the Tian Shan peak, the Four Deity Kings opened his eyes, glanced around, and slightly frowned: "Too many."</p><p></p><p>Although the peak of the Tian Shan was vast, there were now over a hundred thousand powerful experts gathered, and the number was still increasing, which made the Four Deity Kings feel annoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Four Deity Kings, why don't we join forces and start a screening process?" The skinny old man who seemed to be burning like a flame spoke up, and the other few eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms also looked over.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's begin the screening," the Four Deity Kings nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a terrifying aura, with the Four Deity Kings as the center, swept out in all directions. At the same time, the other four or five eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms also released their own auras.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a tremendous pressure enveloped the entire peak of the Tian Shan, and all the powerful experts felt an overwhelming force pressing down on them.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"What are the Four Deity Kings trying to do?"</p><p>"Screening, the Four Deity Kings are screening us."</p><p>Some powerful experts immediately realized what was happening and looked displeased.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, under our pressure, only those who can endure for the time it takes to burn one incense stick will have the qualification to stand on the peak of the Tian Shan," the Four Deity Kings' cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, if he joined forces with the other eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms, they could easily slaughter all the powerful experts present.</p><p></p><p>However, doing so would inevitably offend the forces behind these experts.</p><p></p><p>After two to three hundred years of hunting, the surviving powerful experts had become smarter and would not carry treasures on them.</p><p></p><p>If it was for treasures, the Four Deity Kings wouldn't mind starting a slaughter, but slaughtering these experts now would bring no benefits.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Four Deity Kings and the other powerful experts chose to screen them instead.</p><p></p><p>"Endure for the time it takes to burn one incense stick?"</p><p>"I don't think I can even last ten breaths."</p><p>Some powerful experts' legs trembled, and they immediately retreated from the peak without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"After three hundred years of bitter cultivation, I finally reached the tenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm. I never expected that I wouldn't even have the qualification to observe the opening of the Heavenly Gate on this peak." This expert's expression was dejected. In the outside world, he was a tenth-level expert. He originally thought that falling into this two-dimensional world would be his opportunity since even eleventh-level lifeforms were now on the same starting point as him. He never expected the gap to still be so inconceivably vast.</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying is this pressure? What level has the Four Deity Kings cultivated to?"</p><p>A certain eleventh-level expert looked solemn. He was confident he could endure the pressure for the time it takes to burn one incense stick, but this was merely the pressure released by the Four Deity Kings.</p><p></p><p>If he was already struggling so much against the Four Deity Kings' pressure, how could he compete for the opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate when facing the Four Deity Kings' killing intent?</p><p></p><p>"The Four Deity Kings has at least cultivated to the thirtieth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm." A cold and aloof powerful expert stood there. He was a fifth-rank eleventh-level expert and could easily endure the Four Deity Kings' pressure for the time it takes to burn one incense stick.</p><p></p><p>However, based on the aura and pressure released by the Four Deity Kings and the other eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms, he could vaguely sense the Four Deity Kings' true strength.</p><p></p><p>On the human civilization's side, Lin Yuan stood calmly, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The Four Deity Kings and the other eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms joining forces to screen the experts did not cross Lin Yuan's bottom line.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was happy to witness this scene and observe the true strength of the Four Deity Kings and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Although he released his aura, he hasn't activated that supreme weapon yet," Lin Yuan gazed at the Four Deity Kings and thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let me wait and see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in no hurry. He wanted to see the Four Deity Kings use that supreme weapon before deciding whether to compete for this opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"You guys?" Lin Yuan glanced around. At this moment, apart from Xuanyuan Duo and others, the other human evolvers looked slightly strained.</p><p></p><p>They would probably have difficulty enduring for the time it takes to burn one incense stick.</p><p></p><p>Under the combined pressure from the Four Deity Kings and the other few eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms, powerful experts below the eighteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm could barely endure.</p><p></p><p>Especially Nalan, the Vice Pavilion Master, his face was flushed red. As a newly ascended eleventh-level evolver, he probably couldn't even last half an incense stick's time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be distracted." Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly, and he began to help share their burden.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xuanyuan Duo and the other evolvers looked much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Blood Rain," Xuanyuan Duo and the others expressed their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" At the center of the peak, the Four Deity Kings looked slightly surprised and glanced towards the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." The Four Deity Kings vaguely sensed that the pressure he released seemed to dissipate around the human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this was much more difficult than simply resisting his pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The evolver from the human civilization is not to be underestimated," the Four Deity Kings looked at Lin Yuan with interest but didn't dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>To him, Lin Yuan was at most on the same level as the skinny old man - an eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeform, posing no threat to him now.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the time it takes to burn one incense stick was almost up.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the number of powerful experts on the peak of the Tian Shan had plummeted from over a hundred thousand to less than three hundred.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority had been driven down to the mountainside, only able to view the peak from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Deity Kings is too overbearing."</p><p>"We're not even trying to approach the Heavenly Gate, yet he screened us like this?"</p><p>"If you think the Four Deity Kings is overbearing, you can go up and challenge him."</p><p>The many powerful experts driven off the peak showed resentment on their faces, but they didn't dare take any extreme actions.</p><p></p><p>If it was when they first descended into this two-dimensional world, they might have had a chance to threaten experts at the Four Deity Kings' level by joining forces.</p><p></p><p>But after three hundred years, experts like the Four Deity Kings had grown much stronger, far beyond what they could contend with through numerical advantage alone.</p><p></p><p>So the experts below the mountain peak could only resent the situation but didn't dare set foot on the peak again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the time it takes to burn one incense stick was up.</p><p></p><p>Only a little over a hundred powerful experts remained on the peak, all of them eleventh-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"It's much quieter now," the Four Deity Kings said with satisfaction, crossing his legs again.</p><p></p><p>The four or five eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms in the distance also nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even if they planned to join forces against the Four Deity Kings, the notion that 'the weak have no right to stand on the peak of the Tian Shan and await the opening of the Heavenly Gate with them' aligned with the Four Deity Kings' view.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, Xuanyuan Duo, and the other human evolvers also stood in place and waited.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly. Half a month went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>On this day, under the watchful eyes of all the powerful experts on the peak, a vast spatial ripple began to gather in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

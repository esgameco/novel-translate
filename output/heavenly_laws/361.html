        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 361 The Crimson Leviathan Sovereign: The Ninth Realm, This is the Ninth Realm! (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"My physical body and soul have exploded a thousandfold in power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully experienced the sense of control brought by his powerful physical body and soul. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was like an enormous celestial body. If he released his restraints, all matter within light years around would be reduced to dust and revolve around him.</p><p></p><p>"With just the strength of my physical body now, one punch would be enough to shatter through multiple layers of space," Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>The thousandfold amplification of Lin Yuan's physical body and soul was not based on an ordinary peak ninth realm foundation. It was a terrifying physical body foundation amplified over twenty times after being strengthened by the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the immense inner world within his body was constantly nurturing his physical body and soul with the power of worlds.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, his martial path cultivation system excelled at tempering the physical body.</p><p></p><p>In other words, before breaking through to the tenth realm, the strength of Lin Yuan's physical body was already hundreds or thousands of times that of ninth realm experts of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's only said that eighth realm experts can survive under ninth realm experts' hands, but never that ninth realm experts can survive under tenth realm experts' hands," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too huge.</p><p></p><p>Even if other tenth realm experts only received the infusion of the primordial cosmic essence, they were far superior to ninth realm lifeforms. Even special ninth realm experts had no ability to resist initial tenth realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"The higher the realm, the greater the gap between different levels. It's the same between the ninth and tenth realms, the tenth and eleventh realms, and the eleventh realm and the ultimate existences," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Especially the gap between the eleventh realm and the ultimate - it was the chasm of whether one could break free from the shackles of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Although in the cosmic starry sky, some extremely powerful and ancient eleventh realm lifeforms had the fortitude to make ultimate existences unwilling to take action against them, such as the "Mother of the Tree Realm."</p><p></p><p>However, this unwillingness to act did not mean those ancient powerful eleventh realm lifeforms could withstand the ultimate's methods, but rather that they had the hope of self-annihilating before the ultimate completely destroyed them, causing the ultimate existences to leave empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"Inner World"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan separated a strand of consciousness that manifested and descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the infusion of the infinite primordial cosmic essence, the apparent size of Lin Yuan's inner world did not change much.</p><p></p><p>But in all aspects of the world itself, significant metamorphoses had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, it was like the difference between the Central Plains of the mortal world and the spiritual realms.</p><p></p><p>An attack of the same power that could have created a valley spanning thousands of miles in the inner world at the ninth realm might now only cleave open a mountain of stone.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that after accepting the infusion of the primordial cosmic essence, my inner world has formed a connection with the primordial cosmic void, and is enhancing itself every moment," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>For example, even without Lin Yuan's intervention, the number of layers of space in his inner world was slowly expanding.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's inner world was completely independent and could slowly absorb the power of the primordial cosmic void.</p><p></p><p>Other tenth realm transcended beings would lag behind a bit, only able to absorb the power of the main cosmos, but it was estimated to be about the same as Lin Yuan's current state.</p><p></p><p>The layers of space were slowly expanding on their own, just at a much slower pace.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why tenth realm experts did not care about the number of layers of space in their inner worlds.</p><p></p><p>Because at the tenth realm level, the inner world would actively "synchronize" with the main cosmos (primordial cosmic void) and expand its layers of space on its own.</p><p></p><p>Some extremely ancient tenth realm lifeforms had numbers of layers of space in their inner worlds reaching tens of billions.</p><p></p><p>In such cases, the reason why some ninth realm experts actively opened more layers of space was in order to receive more infusion of the cosmic essence.</p><p></p><p>A ninth realm expert at the boundary of tens of millions of layers who broke through to the tenth realm would tear open a gap of millions of miles to receive the cosmic essence infusion.</p><p></p><p>While special ninth realm experts who opened billions of layers of space would tear open a gap of two to three hundred million miles when breaking through to the tenth realm.</p><p></p><p>Assuming the breakthrough time was maintained at 333 seconds, the amount of infused primordial cosmic essence received would be vastly different.</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest benefit of opening more layers of space at the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had opened 23 billion plus layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The apparent size of his inner world also exceeded 200 million miles.</p><p></p><p>The combination of factors resulted in him tearing open a gap of 12 light-years.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the infusion of primordial cosmic essence he received was incalculable, causing his power increase to far exceed expectations.</p><p></p><p>"My true combat strength now is probably equivalent to three to five Black Star Sovereigns," Lin Yuan evaluated himself objectively.</p><p></p><p>The Black Star Sovereign was a veteran top-tier tenth realm expert who had comprehended two pillar-level fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had not yet comprehended a single pillar-level rule, the power he commanded was too formidable. If a Black Star Sovereign truly faced Lin Yuan, the result could only be -</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's casual strike, even if it only grazed or touched a Black Star Sovereign, would cause them to cough up blood and be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"Elemental Body"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of this physical body divine ability from the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In battles between tenth realm experts, the main deciding factor was the strength of their fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>And fusion rules were still rules, which the Elemental Body was a natural counter against.</p><p></p><p>After getting somewhat familiar with the changes to himself, Lin Yuan's mind stirred and two great Primordial Souls appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>During the infusion of the primordial cosmic essence, these two Primordial Souls also benefited and gained an increase in power not much weaker than the main body.</p><p></p><p>"You go to the major alien battlefield," Lin Yuan looked towards the Solar Primordial Soul.</p><p></p><p>Continued...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the tenth level, Lin Yuan naturally planned to go to a large alien battlefield. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention other reasons, at least the speed of accumulating realm-breaking source power there would far exceed that of a medium alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the tenth level, the last bit of threat that a large alien battlefield posed to Lin Yuan would gradually disappear. As long as the strongest aliens did not take action against him, he could be unafraid.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, five years went by. </p><p></p><p>Under the operations of ultimate existences like the Summer Qin Strongest, the news of Lin Yuan breaking through to the tenth level was also officially made public.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it was not made public any longer, the outside world would speculate whether the Galactic Star Master had crossed into the tenth level, given the strength Lin Yuan displayed in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, breaking through to the tenth level would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth level, Lord Lin Yuan has entered the tenth level?"</p><p></p><p>"A tenth level cultivator in less than two hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"Our Cangluan Star has actually given birth to such an existence as Lord Lin Yuan."</p><p></p><p>After years of development, Cangluan Star was not much inferior to the main stars of some star systems. But upon learning that Lin Yuan had become a tenth level cultivator, they still went wild with joy.</p><p></p><p>Many young citizens of Cangluan Star did not know at all what a tenth level cultivator meant, but they were extremely excited that such a great person had emerged from their home planet.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted leisurely with the Black Star Master, the Liuli Star Master, and a few other tenth level alphas. </p><p></p><p>This was also the biggest difference from his previous breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Tenth level cultivators had already set half a foot at the peak below the Strongest level.</p><p></p><p>They could receive the primordial offerings of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>This was an unprecedented great opportunity, even the most shockingly talented cultivators could experience it at most two or three times in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although it had been five years since he crossed into the tenth level, the feeling of the primordial essence of chaotic void infusing him still made Lin Yuan quite addicted.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of everything about himself going through frenzied enhancement under the primordial infusion was very addictive.  </p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Black Star Master's face.</p><p></p><p>The Liuli Star Master beside him also had a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>If they were only willing to befriend and get close to the Galactic Star Master before he crossed into the tenth level because of his potential, then at this moment, the Galactic Star Master had broken through to the tenth level, standing at the same level as them.</p><p></p><p>With the Galactic Star Master's talents and qualities, it was only a matter of time before he cultivated to the alpha level.</p><p></p><p>Those major forces in the outside world estimated that at most in a few thousand years, human civilization would produce another alpha-level tenth level expert.</p><p></p><p>What the Black Star Master and Liuli Star Master did not know was that Lin Yuan's current strength had already surpassed the alpha level of the tenth level. A few thousand years? Lin Yuan would probably have crossed into the eleventh level long ago.</p><p></p><p>In the Purple Cloud Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The great peak master of the Red Kui lineage sat in the main hall, with various information flashing on the light screen before him, mostly about the Galactic Star Master crossing into the tenth level.</p><p></p><p>"My little junior brother has become a tenth level." The great peak master stroked his nose and shook his head, "I remember when I crossed into the eighth level before my little junior brother."</p><p></p><p>"Now I'm still stuck in the early eighth level, but my little junior brother has already reached the tenth level?"</p><p></p><p>The great senior brother felt a sense of suffocation.  </p><p></p><p>That little guy who needed his protection to even break through to the sixth level back then had now grown into a pillar of human civilization? And would continue to grow in the future?</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that I had a good relationship with my little junior brother back then," the great senior brother smiled.</p><p></p><p>After stepping into the eighth level and presiding over a star domain, the surrounding star masters all tried to get on good terms with him, naturally relying on the face of the Galactic Star Master.</p><p></p><p>Wanyang Saint Son looked at the news in front of him, his mentality had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>"The thirteenth peak master has reached the tenth level." Wanyang Saint Son massaged his forehead. The thirteenth peak master, who he had set as his goal, had now grown into a mighty figure that even his own teacher had to look up to?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>As an unmatched eighth level expert, Wanyang Saint Son could not even look up to a tenth level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"But no matter how monstrous the thirteenth peak master is, what can he do? Back then in the arena competition, he lost to me." Wanyang Saint Son thought smugly to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just this one thing alone gave Wanyang Saint Son bragging rights for the rest of his life, even Wanyang Saint Master could only watch.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another two years passed.</p><p></p><p>In the Red Kui Star Domain, on the Red Kui main star.</p><p></p><p>A vast spatial fluctuation began to permeate, and outside the main star, an enormous star sea kui slowly roamed between layer after layer of space.  </p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>This star sea kui began to rapidly shrink, turning into an old man wearing a red long robe.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth level, this is the ninth level!!" </p><p></p><p>The Red Kui Star Master cried tears of joy, extremely excited, silently feeling the power from the many spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>After over a hundred years of secluded cultivation, he finally took that step and entered the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty million years, I, Red Kui, have also crossed into the ninth level."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kui Star Master shed tears, with the star sea kui's attunement to space, having just stepped into the ninth level, he had already opened nearly a thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"Now before my disciple, I can finally raise my head."</p><p></p><p>The Red Kui Star Master restrained his aura. After Lin Yuan crossed into the ninth level, he, the master, was still at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>This put a lot of pressure on the Red Kui Star Master. Although it was not uncommon in human civilization for disciples to surpass their masters, the Red Kui Star Master still wanted to save face.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Red Kui Star Master had entered the ninth level, he had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Red Kui Star Master's consciousness began to connect to the virtual world, intending to announce his successful breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>And also learn what had happened in human civilization during the hundred years he was in secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, upon learning about it, the Red Kui Star Master was instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

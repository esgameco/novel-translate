        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In front of the enormous scroll, the half-meter-tall old man was somewhat dazed. </p><p></p><p>He could freely control everything in the two-dimensional world within the scroll. The entire two-dimensional world was like his own body, with every detail vividly present.</p><p></p><p>As for the myriad powerful experts who had fallen into the two-dimensional world? In the eyes of the half-meter-tall old man, they also had no secrets, as he could see through them with a single glance. </p><p></p><p>However, it was precisely because of this that the half-meter-tall old man was increasingly surprised. His gaze penetrated through the entire two-dimensional world, constantly observing Lin Yuan standing before the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I just wanted to watch for another ten thousand years to see what kind of performance this little fellow would have after breaking through the thirtieth world limit," the half-meter-tall old man thought silently.</p><p></p><p>It had only been over three hundred years since Lin Yuan's descent, yet he had already broken through the thirtieth world limit, leaving the half-meter-tall old man somewhat uncertain.</p><p></p><p>According to his idea, as long as Lin Yuan could continue to break through the thirtieth limit within the next ten thousand years, it would be enough.</p><p></p><p>The higher the world limit, the greater the difficulty of breaking through it. The first thirty world limits were completely different from the latter thirty world limits.</p><p></p><p>That's why the half-meter-tall old man had specifically left ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I had overestimated enough. One thousand three hundred years to break through sixty world limits. I didn't expect this little fellow to far exceed my expectations. In just ten thousand years, he actually broke through ninety-nine world limits?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man steadied his mind. In other words, in the ten thousand three hundred years since Lin Yuan's descent, he had broken through a total of one hundred and twenty-nine world limits.</p><p></p><p>"Even for a twelfth-stage life form that has transcended the constraints of the river of time, falling into this low-dimensional space, it shouldn't be possible to consecutively break through so many world limits in just over ten thousand years, right?"</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man still found it hard to believe. Even if the twelfth-stage life forms fell into the low-dimensional space, they could still employ some extraordinary means to accelerate their cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>But even so, to reach Lin Yuan's current level would probably require tens of thousands or even millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Is he really just a life form within the river of time?" The half-meter-tall old man repeatedly confirmed. Life forms below the twelfth stage were also called life forms within the river of time, meaning they needed to be bound by the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Even in the chaos of the void, life forms within the river of time and life forms outside the river of time were completely different. The latter were far superior to the former in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>This was determined by the nature of life itself. Life forms within the river of time had their perceptions and senses limited by the river of time, extremely limited and narrow.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the twelfth-stage life forms outside the river of time could see and experience things that were immensely vast and boundless.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly terrifying." The half-meter-tall old man confirmed that Lin Yuan was still deeply trapped within the river of time, his expression one of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed that Lin Yuan was currently displaying was the strongest of all life forms within the river of time since the creation of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>And he had opened up a cliff-like gap from the second-strongest.</p><p></p><p>Even among the many powerful life forms outside the river of time, Lin Yuan's cultivation speed was unbelievably fast.</p><p></p><p>"No need to continue observing."</p><p></p><p>"Let him come in directly."</p><p></p><p>The half-meter-tall old man glanced at the rapidly manifesting Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to observe, the half-meter-tall old man was even worried that Lin Yuan would continue to break through more world limits and eventually break out of the suppression of the two-dimensional world and leave.</p><p></p><p>Although this possibility was almost zero, something that was absolutely impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>But previously, the half-meter-tall old man had also never imagined that Lin Yuan could break through so many world limits within ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Celestial Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the Heavenly Gate, gazing at the rapidly manifesting gate, his heart slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>Everything he had done in the two-dimensional world for tens of thousands of years was for this moment, for pushing open the gate before him.</p><p></p><p>Only by pushing open the Heavenly Gate could he have a chance to leave this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Only by leaving this two-dimensional world could he avoid fundamental losses and preserve this Sun Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Only by leaving this two-dimensional world could the many wondrous treasures Lin Yuan had obtained truly unleash their value.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Gate gradually manifested, it also stirred the minds of the other powerful experts from the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>These powerful experts, although in a competitive relationship with Lin Yuan, especially the Four Celestial Kings and other eleventh-stage perfected life forms who had lived under Lin Yuan's shadow for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts from the myriad races sincerely hoped that Lin Yuan could push open the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Only if Lin Yuan pushed open the Heavenly Gate would it mean that the gate could be pushed open, giving them a chance as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after Lin Yuan pushed open the gate and left the two-dimensional world, the opportunity for the Four Celestial Kings and other eleventh-stage perfected life forms would truly arrive.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan didn't leave, no powerful expert in this two-dimensional world could compete with him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Four Celestial Kings had quite a bit of confidence, wanting to properly challenge Lin Yuan this time.</p><p></p><p>But a mere sidelong glance from Lin Yuan brought them back to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Bloodrain."</p><p></p><p>On the side of human civilization, Xuanyuan Du and the other eleventh-stage evolved humans from human civilization looked at Lin Yuan standing before the Heavenly Gate with full anticipation.</p><p></p><p>During these tens of thousands of years, they hadn't even seen each other, but that didn't stop everyone from pinning their hopes on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>One supreme expert after another closely watched the "scroll" hanging in the distant starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is about to open."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully it can be pushed open this time?"</p><p></p><p>The many supreme experts rapidly communicated. Although there weren't many powerful experts from the myriad races still alive in the two-dimensional world, they were basically the true elites or even foundations of various great races and forces.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts of human civilization suddenly erupted with terrifying auras, wildly stirring the space-time fluctuations within tens of millions of light-years around them.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"Human civilization? They've activated a race-protecting weapon?"</p><p></p><p>"The cost of activating a race-protecting weapon is not low. What are the humans trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"What are they trying to do? Naturally, it's to protect that 'Bloodrain', isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts' thought processes were incredibly fast. They immediately understood the reason for the nine supreme experts' actions.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could push open the Heavenly Gate this time and escape the two-dimensional world to return to the main universe, he would inevitably be exposed before the many supreme experts present.</p><p></p><p>And given Lin Yuan's astonishing performance in the two-dimensional world, some supreme experts might not be able to control themselves and directly attack to kill him, such as the Insect Empress, the Celestial Feather Progenitors, and other ultimate existences. If they had the opportunity, they would definitely seize it to attack as well.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, to go to such great lengths for a mere life form within the river of time. The supreme experts of human civilization are quite something."</p><p></p><p>"Going to great lengths? If you had a descendant like that 'Bloodrain', you would probably do even more than what human civilization is doing now."</p><p></p><p>The many supreme experts communicated with each other, but they had no objections or rejection towards the actions of the nine supreme experts like Xia Qin. They even voluntarily retreated a distance, showing their sincerity.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that after Lin Yuan escaped the constraints of the two-dimensional world and returned to the main world, even if his clone died, there would be no fundamental loss, so killing him didn't have much meaning.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, they also had clansmen trapped in the two-dimensional world. After Lin Yuan left, the other powerful experts from the myriad races would also successively push open the Heavenly Gate and leave.</p><p></p><p>If they attacked Lin Yuan now, when their clansmen left the two-dimensional world, would the nine supreme experts of human civilization let it go?</p><p></p><p>Rather than killing a thousand enemies while losing eight hundred themselves, it was better for both sides to take a step back.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was only the thought of the vast majority of ultimate existences. The few Celestial Feather Progenitors didn't think this way.</p><p></p><p>Because the powerful Celestial Feather experts who had fallen into the two-dimensional world had been eliminated from the very beginning, with no possibility of leaving.</p><p></p><p>But relying solely on the few Celestial Feather Progenitors, they couldn't shake the nine supreme experts of human civilization who had activated their race-protecting weapon.</p><p></p><p>"No suspicion has been aroused."</p><p></p><p>Supreme expert Xia Qin and the other eight supreme experts exchanged glances, slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the aura of the human civilization's race-protecting weapon still permeated half of the "scroll". Even supreme experts couldn't see through the race-protecting weapon to sense the aura of the human "Bloodrain" who had escaped the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xia Qin and the other supreme experts did this was only partially guessed by the ultimate existences present.</p><p></p><p>As for the real reason, it was to conceal Lin Yuan's true identity.</p><p></p><p>If the many ultimate existences realized that the human "Bloodrain" who had escaped the two-dimensional world was merely a tenth-stage life form, then all the ultimate existences present would probably have the idea of taking action.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Celestial Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the Heavenly Gate, gazing at the rapidly manifesting gate, his heart slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>Everything he had done in this two-dimensional world for tens of thousands of years was for this moment, for pushing open the gate before him.</p><p></p><p>Only by pushing open the Heavenly Gate did he have a chance to leave this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Only by leaving this two-dimensional world could he avoid fundamental losses and preserve this Sun Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Only by leaving this two-dimensional world could the many wondrous treasures Lin Yuan had obtained truly unleash their value.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Gate gradually manifested, it also stirred the minds of the other powerful experts from the myriad races...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Just kidding, with the body of a tenth-order life form, I can easily crush and overwhelm the four Celestial Kings who are only eleventh-order perfected legendary life forms." </p><p></p><p>Even the nine strongest experts of human civilization were somewhat frightened, believing that if other forces produced such a monstrous being, they would also take action to kill it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the many ultimate existences did not think along those lines at all, only assuming that the nine strongest experts of human civilization were simply protecting that 'Blood Rain'.</p><p></p><p>This idea was not wrong either. If Lin Yuan had not taken the initiative to inform the nine strongest experts of human civilization, they would have regarded that 'Blood Rain' as some eleventh-order perfected legendary life form.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world. </p><p></p><p>The peak of the Tianshan Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood silently in front of the Heavenly Gate, which was gradually materializing from virtual to real.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate fully manifested itself.</p><p></p><p>The rich fluctuations of spatial power surged outward like ripples in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in front of the Heavenly Gate, but did not immediately try to push it open. Instead, his mind flashed back to the events of the past ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The ten thousand years was absolutely the longest period of time Lin Yuan had experienced since he called himself an Evolver.</p><p></p><p>Even though only a hundred years had passed in the main universe, the ten thousand years in the two-dimensional world were still real.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only needed to recall slightly, and everything that happened in the past ten thousand years appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I still can't push it open this time, I will wait until the next ten thousand years, or the ten thousand years after that."</p><p></p><p>Before even trying to push open the Heavenly Gate, Lin Yuan had already prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>After all, the last time the Heavenly Gate opened, Lin Yuan had exhausted all his efforts but could not budge the gate at all.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength had now increased tremendously,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had no confidence whether he could finally push open the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and gently placed his hands on the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The tightly closed Heavenly Gate was actually slowly pushed open.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned. He had only placed his hands on the Heavenly Gate without exerting any force, yet the gate was pushed open?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even had the feeling that even if an ordinary person stood in front of the Heavenly Gate instead of him, they could still easily push it open.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind wavered. Ten thousand years ago, he had used his physical divine ability 'Reinforcement' but still could not budge the Heavenly Gate at all.</p><p></p><p>Now, he only needed to place his hands on it, and it easily opened.</p><p></p><p>Such a stark contrast made Lin Yuan speculate:</p><p></p><p>Whether the Heavenly Gate could be pushed open or not had nothing to do with one's own strength, but depended on whether the 'Heavenly Gate' was willing to be pushed open or not?</p><p></p><p>Here, the 'Heavenly Gate' was just a general term, not referring to the gate in front of him, but perhaps some other existence?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, the many powerful experts from various races immediately erupted in excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate, the Heavenly Gate has been pushed open!"</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, the Heavenly Gate must be able to be pushed open. Last time it couldn't be pushed open was just an accident."</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts from various races discussed excitedly. Even though the Heavenly Gate could be opened, most of them still could not enter it themselves.</p><p></p><p>But at least they could have the wondrous items they obtained brought out by the powerful experts who entered the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Even if those experts took away most of it, it was still better than having it remain in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' eyes regained confidence.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan here, they had no chance of entering the Heavenly Gate this time. But next time, after Lin Yuan left, who in the entire two-dimensional world could compete with them for the next opportunity to enter the Heavenly Gate?</p><p></p><p>In front of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not immediately step through.</p><p></p><p>The vastly different difficulties in pushing open the Heavenly Gate the two times made Lin Yuan have other thoughts about what was inside.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've pushed it open already."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Lin Yuan finally looked back at the excited human Evolvers, then raised his right foot and stepped through.</p><p></p><p>If this two-dimensional world was truly governed by some will that could easily change the difficulty of pushing open the Heavenly Gate, then whether Lin Yuan entered or not made no difference.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at present, the Heavenly Gate was Lin Yuan's only hope of leaving, so no matter how wary he was, he had to go in.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped through the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Then the materialized Heavenly Gate began to slowly close and dissipate into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The surging spatial power fluctuations at the peak of the Tianshan Mountains quickly calmed down, as if they had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan pushed open the Heavenly Gate,</p><p></p><p>The nine strongest experts of human civilization like Xia Qin immediately stood on guard, activating their race-subjugating weapons. The moment Lin Yuan appeared, he would be enveloped by the might of these weapons.</p><p></p><p>Other ultimate existences could not sense Lin Yuan's specific aura through the race-subjugating weapons.</p><p></p><p>If the biggest secret about Blood Rain was also kept.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the auras of the nine strongest experts of human civilization spreading out, the other ultimate existences also cooperated very well, voluntarily withdrawing their perception and only focusing on the 'blank paper' itself.</p><p></p><p>As time passed,</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin and the other nine strongest experts of human civilization immediately sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Because until the Heavenly Gate closed again and dissipated into nothingness, they did not detect the slightest spatial fluctuation outside the painting, let alone find any trace of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's that 'Blood Rain'?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't he enter the Heavenly Gate? Why hasn't he appeared yet?"</p><p></p><p>Not only were the nine strongest experts of human civilization puzzled, but the other ultimate existences on the scene also noticed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Gate manifested from the two-dimensional world within the blank paper stirred up spatial fluctuations, wasn't that a spatial passage to transmit to the outside world?"</p><p></p><p>"If not transmitting to the outside world, then where could it transmit to?"</p><p></p><p>The many powerful experts frowned, wondering whether Lin Yuan could successfully leave the two-dimensional world or not. This was not only a matter for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It was also a matter for the many powerful experts from various races who had not yet left the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan entered the Heavenly Gate but did not return to the main universe, didn't that mean that later when the Heavenly Gate opened again, the other powerful experts from various races who pushed it open still would not be able to return to the main universe?</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, where did that 'Blood Rain' go after entering the Heavenly Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes Xia Qin, if he hasn't escaped the confines of the two-dimensional world, then where does that Heavenly Gate lead?"</p><p></p><p>An ultimate existence looked towards Xia Qin and immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Blood Rain came from human civilization, so Xia Qin should be able to contact his true main body.</p><p></p><p>Thus confirming the latest situation of the Blood Rain who had now entered the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>This was something all the ultimate existences on the scene urgently wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>"What's there to urge?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin frowned and glanced at the other ultimate existences, but did not immediately try to contact Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know where the Heavenly Gate led,</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin speculated that it must be an extremely important place.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan needed to focus his mental energy to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Contacting and disturbing Lin Yuan now would not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin believed that as long as Lin Yuan recovered, he would take the initiative to find him.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan stepped through the Heavenly Gate, he only felt his spiritual will rapidly elevate, regaining the support of the spatial dimension and ascending from two-dimensional to three-dimensional.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan also felt more clearly that he was separating from a certain world, a boundless giant painting containing a vast and boundless world, and he was now rapidly separating from this giant painting.</p><p></p><p>"So that was the two-dimensional world I fell into?" Lin Yuan immediately realized that the giant painting was the two-dimensional world that had trapped him for over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of descending dimensions, the feeling of ascending dimensions." Lin Yuan felt it was quite strange. When he was absorbed into the painting, he didn't have time to experience what it felt like to descend dimensions.</p><p></p><p>But now, breaking free from the giant painting and becoming a normal complete life form again, he understood the feeling clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing it for a while, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he realized that although he had escaped the two-dimensional world, he had not returned to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. This was a vast space, with a boundless hazy mist in the distance. The only conspicuous thing was the giant painting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan also noticed the old man sitting in front of the giant painting. Compared to the painting, this old man was extremely 'tiny', only half a meter tall, which was why Lin Yuan had subconsciously overlooked him.</p><p></p><p>And just as Lin Yuan was observing this half-meter-tall old man, the old man was also looking at Lin Yuan with a strange gaze, scrutinizing him over and over again.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

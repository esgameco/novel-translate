            <p>Chapter 248 Ten Years (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The other four invincible Eighth Stage experts, upon seeing this, immediately realized that the Insectoid Race definitely knew more critical intelligence or had deeper schemes.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Starlord, in our race's ranking list of geniuses under the human race's Long Live, is ranked seventh," the Insectoid Nest Phantom said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>"Seventh?" The five invincible Eighth Stage experts were shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>For a paramount race like the Insectoid Race, the definition of genius was extremely strict. The genius list made for human civilization considered various aspects.</p><p></p><p>For the Galaxy Starlord to rank seventh, he must be terrifying in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>You should know that if it was just an Eighth Stage under a hundred years old, it would be difficult to reach this ranking.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Starlord's growth speed is too fast." The Insectoid Nest Phantom did not explain much further.</p><p></p><p>Although the Insectoid Race did not have a virtual world or the three ultimate intelligent goddesses, they had the top-level divination masters.</p><p></p><p>Through the convergence of various information and intelligence, they inferred the Galaxy Starlord's potential, which was not inferior to the descendants of those supreme experts and human evolutionaries who obtained special inheritances.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they ranked him seventh.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those divination masters of the Insectoid Race did not know that the martial dao evolutionary path was created by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Expert Xia Qin clearly knew this matter and directly stated that Lin Yuan's talent could rank in the top twenty or top ten in the history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>This was a historical ranking of humans, while the list made by the Insectoid Race was only a ranking of this generation under Long Live.</p><p></p><p>The two were completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>If the Insectoid Race obtained Supreme Expert Xia Qin's evaluation of Lin Yuan, they would probably disregard the tacit understanding again and use higher-level means to strangle Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The possibility of the seventh-ranked human evolutionary genius of the current generation becoming a supreme expert was minuscule.</p><p></p><p>But for a genius ranked in the top twenty or top ten in human history, the possibility of becoming a supreme expert was much greater.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization would not allow other paramount races to have one more supreme expert, and the Insectoid Race was equally unwilling to see human civilization have one more supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even Supreme Expert Xia Qin misjudged Lin Yuan's talent.</p><p></p><p>In Xia Qin's view, Lin Yuan obtained an inheritance from forces outside the main world, so he knew about the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>And that inheritance from forces outside the main world must include a large amount of cultivation resources and even fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way was the current Lin Yuan created.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, from becoming an evolutionary to entering the Galaxy Star Domain, apart from the Myriad Worlds Gate, Lin Yuan had never obtained any unknown fortuitous encounters.</p><p></p><p>"For this assassination, I want you to thoroughly kill that Galaxy Starlord, making him unable to resurrect." The Insectoid Nest Phantom emitted mental fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Thoroughly kill?" The five invincible Eighth Stage experts looked at each other, their expressions revealing helplessness.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's identity and strength, the one currently guarding the Galaxy Main Star was most likely his avatar.</p><p></p><p>His true body was probably in an extremely safe place.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint efforts of the five of them, the Galaxy Starlord definitely could not resist, but to thoroughly kill him, including killing his true body, was almost impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Lin Yuan was also at the Eighth Stage, at the same realm as them.</p><p></p><p>Some special techniques, such as the Curse Killing Art, would not work at all.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even thoroughly kill him, let alone make him unable to resurrect.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured." The Insectoid Nest Phantom's thoughts moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>A cubic container appeared.</p><p></p><p>The cube was transparent, and one could vaguely see mist swirling inside.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Memory Poison," the Insectoid Nest Phantom said through mental fluctuations. "You five, work together to control that avatar of the Galaxy Starlord, and then inject this Memory Poison into his body."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the rest."</p><p></p><p>"Memory Poison?" The five invincible Eighth Stage experts were shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Memory Poison was a very special treasure that could destroy and distort living beings at the memory level.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that with the Avatar Technique, the memories of the true body and avatar were shared. If Memory Poison was injected into the avatar, the true body's memories would also be contaminated and distorted.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if a supreme expert took action to reverse the flow and resurrect again, it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>This achieved the purpose of "resurrection".</p><p></p><p>It's just that no matter which time period one returned to, the moment the dead living being resurrected, it would synchronize with the universe and receive all the memory information before its death.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if a supreme expert went back to a more distant past and retrieved a living being whose memories had not yet been contaminated, when this living being returned to the universe and synchronized its memories, it would still be contaminated again.</p><p></p><p>"To deal with a mere human Eighth Stage, even if he's a super genius, you're using a Memory Poison..." one of the invincible Eighth Stage experts said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Memory Poison was extremely precious. It required a supreme expert to painstakingly create it at a certain cost.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Insectoid Race's foundation, they probably didn't have many Memory Poisons.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they are ranked in the top ten on the list made by our race, they are qualified to use Memory Poison," the Insectoid Nest Phantom said.</p><p></p><p>"However, with the Galaxy Starlord's potential, he must have been bestowed with life-saving items. You five must go all out and give him no chance."</p><p></p><p>The Insectoid Nest Phantom warned.</p><p></p><p>Although Memory Poison was terrifying, it only targeted memories.</p><p></p><p>Other powers, even if only a trace, could destroy Memory Poison.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, only if the five invincible Eighth Stage experts completely subdued the Galaxy Starlord and cut off any resistance from him could they use Memory Poison.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Heart of Thunder."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly integrated the Eight-Star Top-Grade Cosmic Treasure he exchanged for 12,000 Cosmic Crystals into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>Strands of purple lightning began to fill the vast inner world with a radius of over 2 million miles.</p><p></p><p>The purple lightning was filled with a sense of destruction, but it also exuded vigorous vitality, making the entire inner world suddenly much more real.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Heart of Thunder."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the changes in his inner world, a satisfied expression appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>A Cosmic Treasure like the Heart of Thunder was obviously superior to a Cosmic Treasure like the "Primordial Flame".</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from their value.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I should be considered in the first sequence below the invincible Eighth Stage," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that until now, I'm still a step away from comprehending the Yin Rule."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in his inner world, his thoughts surging.</p><p></p><p>From the Fourth Stage, Lin Yuan had begun to comprehend the Yin and Yang Rules.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, in the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and even the current Eighth Stage, the Yang Rule had always been far ahead.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since Yin and Yang formed a complementary Taiji in the first place, even if the comprehension of the Yin Rule was a bit weaker, it had no impact on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the Yin Rule...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rules of the moon are much more complex than the rules of the sun.</p><p></p><p>Even with a complete understanding of the rules of the sun, after the moon and sun undergo the Taiji transformation, it is still not possible to quickly comprehend the rules of the moon.</p><p></p><p>"No rush."</p><p></p><p>"I can feel it's coming soon."</p><p></p><p>"At the fastest, it will take a few years; at the slowest, over a decade."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had an idea in his heart.</p><p></p><p>For other evolvers to comprehend the rules of the moon, they need to break through countless bottlenecks and shackles.</p><p></p><p>But he has the sun rule conversion, so there are almost no bottlenecks or shackles, and it's not an exaggeration to say it's a smooth journey.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit-Suppressing Pearl"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at this life-saving item bestowed by the Almighty Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit-Suppressing Pearl guards the mind and will, encompassing one's own memories.</p><p></p><p>The Almighty Xia Qin's intention was that even if an Almighty made a move, the Spirit-Suppressing Pearl could block it for a moment, providing Lin Yuan with an opportunity to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't mean that the Spirit-Suppressing Pearl will only activate when an Almighty attacks.</p><p></p><p>Any attack or means that threatens Lin Yuan's mind, will, and memory will be blocked by the Spirit-Suppressing Pearl.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the inner demons of the Heart Demon Tribulation are not included.</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how long has passed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My body hasn't collapsed?"</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan obtained from the mysterious gourd,</p><p></p><p>the prerequisite for completely absorbing the liquid in the gourd is that the physical body must remain intact until the end.</p><p></p><p>In the past, who knows how many times Lin Yuan's physical body constantly turned to dust, and finally returned by relying on the "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood" divine ability.</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body has persevered.</p><p></p><p>"It has indeed increased by 3.33 times."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed his physical body and the world within his body, and came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>His current inner world is vast and boundless, nearly 2.7 million li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>This is because during this period, Lin Yuan comprehended more spatial models, causing the basic size of his inner world to exceed 800,000 li.</p><p></p><p>Then, after expanding by 3.33 times, he finally has an inner world nearly 2.7 million li in size.</p><p></p><p>"With just my inner world now, I'm more than enough to crush ordinary peak Eighth Stage experts."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The inner world of a normal peak Eighth Stage expert is probably around 400,000 li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>400,000 li in diameter?</p><p></p><p>2.7 million li in diameter?</p><p></p><p>It's not just crushing them.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, continue."</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the orange-yellow liquid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he looked at the gray-red gourd in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The gray-red gourd can condense seven kinds of liquids, divided by color into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has completely absorbed the scarlet red liquid.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan immediately reached out, grasped the gray-red gourd, and turned the gourd mouth downward.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because of Lin Yuan's right hand's contact with it, the originally gray-red gourd still slowly changed.</p><p></p><p>The red color began to fade, replaced by yellow.</p><p></p><p>Gray-yellow gourd.</p><p></p><p>Drip.</p><p></p><p>A drop of orange-yellow liquid condensed at the mouth of the gourd.</p><p></p><p>"So beautiful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at that drop of orange-yellow liquid, vaguely feeling that there was a miniature universe inside.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a moment,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly swallowed that drop of orange-yellow liquid.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The orange-yellow liquid turned into flames and quickly spread throughout Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan's body turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths,</p><p></p><p>the Rebirth from a Drop of Blood divine ability activated, and Lin Yuan returned from the ashes.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was a bit dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"The improvement was too great, causing me to be unable to bear it?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need an inner world of at least 5 million li in diameter to withstand the enhancement from the orange-yellow liquid."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Unlike improving the inner world by comprehending spatial laws,</p><p></p><p>the enhancement from the liquids in the mysterious gourd is a forced improvement, breaking some limits and shackles to enhance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan must have a certain foundation to withstand a sufficiently large improvement.</p><p></p><p>"A 5 million li inner world is not difficult for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart. After the transformation from the scarlet red liquid, a 5 million li inner world was equivalent to a 1.5 million li inner world for other evolvers.</p><p></p><p>It was far from reaching the upper limit of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galactic Main Star,</p><p></p><p>Five figures were hidden in the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>"This planet, after undergoing B-grade transformation, can block us for a few breaths even if we make a move,"</p><p></p><p>the leading Eighth Stage Invincible spoke.</p><p></p><p>These few breaths might be enough to cause the Galactic Star Lord to notice something amiss and directly self-destruct his avatar.</p><p></p><p>Once that happens, the mission of the five Eighth Stage Invincibles would end in failure.</p><p></p><p>Although they wouldn't be punished by the Insect Race, those treasure rewards obviously had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>The second Eighth Stage Invincible frowned.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Star Lord was inside the planet. Although he was still billions of li away from them, for Eighth Stage Invincibles, a single teleportation would bring them there, not much different from being right in front of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the B-grade transformed Galactic Main Star had the ability to block teleportation. They could at most teleport to outside the planet.</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the Galactic Star Lord comes out on his own."</p><p></p><p>The leading Eighth Stage Invincible continued, "We only have one chance. Once the Galactic Star Lord notices, it's considered a failure."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>the four Eighth Stage Invincibles nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Star Lord's strength was indeed not as good as any of them.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Star Lord didn't need to confront them either. As long as he successfully self-destructs his avatar, he can render the five of them helpless.</p><p></p><p>Although the Galactic Star Lord is not old, he's not a fool either. After realizing that five Eighth Stage Invincibles are surrounding and trying to kill him, he can definitely deduce that they have grasped some means that can affect his true body.</p><p></p><p>If it was just killing an avatar, how could it be possible to mobilize five Eighth Stage Invincibles?</p><p></p><p>In the peripheral star domains, after Eighth Stage Invincibles assassinate someone, they are most likely able to escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>But in the rear of human civilization, let alone Eighth Stage Invincibles, even Ninth Stage powerhouses, as long as they dare to expose their traces, are doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>But what is the identity of Eighth Stage Invincibles?</p><p></p><p>Five of them mobilized at once? Even apex races wouldn't waste resources like this. The only possibility is that they intend to kill both the avatar and the true body.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there's only one chance."</p><p></p><p>"We must seize it."</p><p></p><p>The five Eighth Stage Invincibles looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They immediately began to wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Galactic Star Lord hasn't discovered them lying in ambush outside,</p><p></p><p>sooner or later, he will come out one day.</p><p></p><p>At that time, their opportunity will come.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the hearts of the five Eighth Stage Invincibles became slightly fervent.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mission goes smoothly, with the Insect Race's rewards,</p><p></p><p>perhaps they can take that step.</p><p></p><p>Just like that,</p><p></p><p>the five Eighth Stage Invincibles waited outside the Galactic Main Star for ten years.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please take a moment to share our website on Facebook.

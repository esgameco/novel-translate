        <h1>Chapter 656</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group of Celestial Sovereigns saw Lin Yuan sitting cross-legged under the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River," the Crimson Flame Celestial Sovereign immediately called out.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Silver River Celestial Sovereign," the other ordinary peak Celestial Sovereigns like the Scarlet Lotus Celestial Sovereign said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>There are differences even among Celestial Sovereigns, especially the strongest Celestial Sovereigns, who are at the pinnacle of the Celestial Sovereign realm. The vast majority of Celestial Sovereigns cannot even approach them.</p><p></p><p>To become the strongest Celestial Sovereign, one must first be a top-tier peak Celestial Sovereign, which already eliminates 99% of Celestial Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, one must cultivate a 13th-tier inherited technique, not just learn it, but truly cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>But is it easy to cultivate a 13th-tier inherited technique? Involving the power of the 13th tier, in addition to numerous threshold conditions, there are also many hidden risks and dangers.</p><p></p><p>Early contact with the power of the 13th tier is both a blessing and a curse.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan opened his eyes, looking at the many Celestial Sovereigns and smiled, "This giant core celestial pillar can also be considered a regained treasure."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Flame Celestial Sovereign looked at the majestic giant core celestial pillar, a smile appearing on his face. Currently, the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom had occupied and refined 52 core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>Adding this giant core celestial pillar, the total would be 62.</p><p></p><p>Although it still falls short of the 72 pillars of the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom, it has surpassed the Savage Ancient Kingdom, ranking second among the six major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"With the Silver River Celestial Sovereign, the possibility of my Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom contending for this treasure land has increased greatly," Crimson Flame Celestial Sovereign said with emotion.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Lin Yuan's sudden appearance, the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom would have definitely allied with the other ancient kingdoms to fight against the Great Abyss, regardless of victory or defeat, they would have had to go through intense battles.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Relying on Lin Yuan's strength, the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom has risen to the same level as the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom, looking down on the struggles of the other four ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure if I can ultimately seize this treasure land," Lin Yuan said. At least for now, his strength is not enough to completely overwhelm all the peak Celestial Sovereigns within the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom and the other five major ancient kingdoms unite, the Void Celestial Sovereign and many other top-tier peak Celestial Sovereigns can still pose a threat to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, with the Silver River Celestial Sovereign here, whether we can seize this treasure land is no longer important," Crimson Flame Celestial Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom has given birth to the strongest Celestial Sovereign? The significance and impact are far-reaching. At least until this strongest Celestial Sovereign breaks through to above the 13th tier, the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom will have an advantage over the other ancient kingdoms, except for the Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"It's still better to seize it," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Seizing this treasure land not only allows them to obtain a large amount of rare treasures produced by this type of treasure land, but also earns them a huge amount of merit from the ancient kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is quite eager for the many rare inherited techniques and treasures stored in the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom's treasury, unlike the other Celestial Sovereigns who have accumulated a great deal of merit over many years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is still too young, even though his strength is extraordinary, his merit is not much.</p><p></p><p>So this time, Lin Yuan plans to try his best to seize this treasure land, because the merit gained would be substantial, and the experience would be far shorter than a full-scale war.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's definitely better to seize it."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Crimson Flame Celestial Sovereign's face. Who doesn't want to seize the treasure land? Although they haven't figured out the true use of that golden mist, it must be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>In a certain area of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The twelve peak Celestial Sovereigns of the Yin Ancient Kingdom had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"In this battle for the treasure land, the Yin Ancient Kingdom currently only occupies 38 core celestial pillars, ranking sixth," Soulless Yin Celestial Sovereign looked at the other eleven peak Celestial Sovereigns of the Yin Ancient Kingdom and shook his head, "And the emergence of the Silver River Celestial Sovereign, the strongest Celestial Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The other eleven peak Celestial Sovereigns remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Yin Ancient Kingdom's hope of ultimately seizing this treasure land is extremely slim, one could even say it's almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>The ancient kingdoms ranked in the top three or even top four have the chance to contend for it, but ranked sixth? Unless the Yin Ancient Kingdom also has a hidden monster like the Silver River Celestial Sovereign, there is no hope.</p><p></p><p>"Ah," Earth Yin Celestial Sovereign sighed.</p><p></p><p>This treasure land contains more than 300 core celestial pillars, absolutely the most top-tier among all first-class treasure lands.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Yin Ancient Kingdom did not pay enough attention, and the peak Celestial Sovereigns they sent in are not strong enough overall, otherwise they would not have only occupied and refined 38 core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"So I plan to trade these 38 core celestial pillars," Soulless Yin Celestial Sovereign expressed his idea.</p><p></p><p>Since they have determined that there is no hope of seizing the treasure land, they might as well minimize the losses and try to gain some benefits.</p><p></p><p>The 38 core celestial pillars occupied and refined by the Yin Ancient Kingdom, although ranked sixth, as long as any of the top five ancient kingdoms obtain these core celestial pillars from the Yin Ancient Kingdom, their ranking will surely rise rapidly, with the hope of becoming number one.</p><p></p><p>"Soulless Yin, who do you plan to trade with?" Earth Yin Celestial Sovereign asked, he was not at all surprised by Soulless Yin Celestial Sovereign's decision.</p><p></p><p>The core celestial pillars in the treasure land can only be used this way to maximize their value. If they don't trade them out, when the final result of the battle comes, they will have to withdraw empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Abyss Ancient Kingdom and the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom, I suppose," Soulless Yin Celestial Sovereign thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Great Abyss and the Scorching Sun are the most likely to seize this treasure land, after all, they have the strongest Celestial Sovereign-level existences backing them up.</p><p></p><p>They are also the most eager to obtain the core celestial pillars occupied by the Yin Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Occupying the core celestial pillar of the ancient nation, even if they themselves could not obtain it, they would not allow the other party to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Sovereign nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You must cut it down ruthlessly."</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>"That is natural."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>In front of a core celestial pillar, the Nocturnal Sovereign's form silently condensed, and he said to the many Great Subduing Celestial Sovereigns guarding this place: "I want to see the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>"See the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Feather Celestial Sovereign looked at the Nocturnal Sovereign and began to contact the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign saw the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Nocturnal?"</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign glanced at the Nocturnal Sovereign and casually said, "What brings you to see me?"</p><p></p><p>"I intend to occupy the thirty-eight core celestial pillars of the Alchemy in my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation and trade with you, the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign." The Nocturnal Sovereign said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Trade?"</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign looked at the Nocturnal Sovereign: "You've given up so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"With you, the Subduing Void, here, my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation has no hope of seizing this precious land." The Nocturnal Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want." The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign went straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Subduing Ancient Nation still has the advantage at the moment, with those thirty-eight core celestial pillars from the Arcane Yin Ancient Nation, the chances of success would definitely be greater.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty percent."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign looked at the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign: "If your Great Subduing Ancient Nation seizes this precious land, for ten billion years, fifty percent of the rare treasures produced by this land shall belong to my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>"Fifty percent of the rare treasures produced over ten billion years?"</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign sneered: "Your Arcane Yin Ancient Nation has such a big mouth, just relying on thirty-eight core celestial pillars, you want fifty percent?"</p><p></p><p>"It's only fifty percent of the treasures produced over ten billion years, not much." </p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>At their level, ordinary treasures and rarities have little significance, and only the rarities produced by this newly born precious land can attract their attention.</p><p></p><p>The Arcane Yin Ancient Nation has no confidence in seizing the land itself, so it has such a plan.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty percent is too much, only one percent, and it's only the rare treasures produced within a million years." The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>"That's too little." The Nocturnal Sovereign immediately shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Or you can propose other conditions." The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign said: "My Great Subduing Ancient Nation occupies so many precious lands, you can consider taking fifty percent of the rare treasures produced over ten billion years from other precious lands."</p><p></p><p>"It has to be this land."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign frowned: "The ten billion years cannot be changed, the fifty percent of the rare treasures can be reduced a bit, two percent, two percent is my bottom line."</p><p></p><p>"Two percent?"</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign looked at the Nocturnal Sovereign, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>A manifestation of the Nocturnal Sovereign</p><p></p><p>also descended in front of the giant core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign also saw Lin Yuan, and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Nocturnal Celestial Sovereign." Lin Yuan looked at the Nocturnal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"This time I've come to complete a trade with your Blazing Sun Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign said: "My Arcane Yin Ancient Nation has occupied and refined a total of thirty-eight core celestial pillars, I wonder how much these thirty-eight core celestial pillars are worth?"</p><p></p><p>Although his other manifestation was negotiating with the Subduing Void Celestial Sovereign, in such a trade, the one who offers the higher price will definitely get it, so let's see which side can offer a higher price.</p><p></p><p>"What are the conditions?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Eighty percent."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan: "If the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation seizes this precious land, eighty percent of the rare treasures produced by this land over a hundred billion years shall belong to my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, your Blazing Sun Ancient Nation must also send me two first-class precious lands of my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Great Subduing Ancient Nation, the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation must be much more eager to obtain these thirty-eight core celestial pillars from the Arcane Yin Ancient Nation, so the Nocturnal Sovereign must have more room to bargain.</p><p></p><p>"That's too much."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned at the Nocturnal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the two first-class precious lands.</p><p></p><p>Eighty percent of the rare treasures produced over a hundred billion years? Doesn't that mean that Lin Yuan will not be able to obtain much of the rare treasures produced by this precious land over a hundred billion years?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this condition is acceptable to the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation, after all, a hundred billion years is not a long time, but for Lin Yuan? How long has it been since he set foot on the path of evolution? A hundred billion years? Such a long period of time, even if Lin Yuan has not yet entered the Thirteenth Realm, he will be trapped in a time loop, and by then, no matter how many precious land rarities, they will be meaningless to him.</p><p></p><p>"Not much."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign smiled at Lin Yuan: "The Great Subduing Ancient Nation has already agreed to my conditions."</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Celestial Sovereign, you should understand that once these thirty-eight core celestial pillars of my Arcane Yin Ancient Nation fall into the hands of the Great Subduing Ancient Nation, the hope of your Blazing Sun Ancient Nation seizing this precious land will be greatly diminished."</p><p></p><p>"And with the relationship between that Thunderous Ancient Nation and the Great Subduing Ancient Nation, the core celestial pillars of the Thunderous Ancient Nation will eventually also fall into the hands of the Great Subduing Ancient Nation."</p><p></p><p>"You need to think it through carefully."</p><p></p><p>The Nocturnal Sovereign looked at Lin Yuan, with an air of 'I'm considering this for you'.</p><p></p><p>"Are you threatening me?" Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"There is no threat, it's all based on willingness." The Nocturnal Sovereign's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

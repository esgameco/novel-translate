            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 419 Child of the Void (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Space and time were both twisting and distorting, the aura of the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being was in chaos and plummeting.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was still frantically fleeing in the direction away from the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>As the perfected demon god supreme being adept at "intelligence",</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being was not outstanding in direct combat,</p><p></p><p>But it had put in a lot of effort into the skill of fleeing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, disregarding everything, it triggered the power of space-time,</p><p></p><p>And in an instant, it crossed "hundreds of millions of light years".</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Martial Ancestor?"  </p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being was shaken beyond comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Originally,</p><p></p><p>The Yin Realm Lord was already so powerful that it was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>In the vast boundless void, there were only so many perfected demon god supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a Yin Realm Lord more powerful than a normal perfected demon god supreme being appeared?</p><p></p><p>But now,</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being realized -</p><p></p><p>The overwhelmingly powerful Yin Realm Lord, whom numerous perfected demon god supreme beings were helpless against,</p><p></p><p>Was merely a pawn placed on the board.</p><p></p><p>The true Supreme Being was controlling everything behind the scenes, driving everything forward.</p><p></p><p>The one shaking the foundations of all demon gods in the boundless void</p><p></p><p>Was the Martial Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Just a glimpse from afar caused the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being to suffer no small backlash.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being had no doubt that if its true form entered, it was very likely to be completely trapped.</p><p></p><p>And to achieve this, a ninth stage perfected demon god supreme being was far from capable.</p><p></p><p>"The legendary tenth stage demon god? No, if it was the tenth stage, why would it need to hide behind the scenes? It must be an existence infinitely close to the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's thoughts raced rapidly, and it relaxed slightly.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't a tenth stage existence, then there was still a chance to turn things around.</p><p></p><p>Currently,</p><p></p><p>The only confirmed tenth stage existence was the creator who opened the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>That great being who single-handedly confined countless void creatures from the dimensional crevices outside the void, turning them into nourishment for numerous demon gods.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately,</p><p></p><p>After that creator opened the boundless void, it completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Countless demon god supreme beings in later generations were essentially following in that creator's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>"To strangle martial arts, the Yin Realm Lord is secondary, the main target is the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's heart grew heavy. "I must join forces with all the perfected demon god supreme beings, and even awaken that one."</p><p></p><p>To deal with the Yin Realm Lord, the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being believed ten or twenty perfected demon god supreme beings would be enough.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being felt that even if all the perfected demon god supreme beings were summoned, there was no guarantee of victory.</p><p></p><p>If necessary,</p><p></p><p>It could only awaken that one.</p><p></p><p>And "that one"</p><p></p><p>Was the strongest supreme being who inherited the Void Secret Realm after the disappearance of the creator who opened the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Presiding over the entire Void Secret Realm, this strongest supreme being could almost unleash the power of the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>At least in the boundless void, unless that creator returned, it would be invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>After dozens of breaths, the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>After fleeing for so long, it should have arrived at another familiar void domain.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the void environment the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being was in seemed to have not changed at all.</p><p></p><p>The vast void was as if it had never moved.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's expression turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being returned to that "azure" world again.</p><p></p><p>Reappearing in the deepest part of the Martial Hall, before that figure which filled it with immense dread and terror.</p><p></p><p>Only this time, the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being did not come as an avatar, but with its true form.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>Before the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being could react, its consciousness rapidly plunged into darkness.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Martial Hall,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged,</p><p></p><p>Observing the unconscious Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being not far away.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>When the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being split off an avatar to infiltrate the Azure World,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already detected it, but he did not stop or attack at the time.</p><p></p><p>He was locking onto the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's true main body.</p><p></p><p>It was only when that avatar approached the Martial Hall and kept probing that</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally confirmed the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's true body, and by grasping the fusion rules of space-time, he activated the divine ability "World" to silently move it into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being desperately fled, thinking it had escaped billions of light years in just dozens of breaths, but in reality it was all within Lin Yuan's inner world.</p><p></p><p>The diameter of Lin Yuan's inner world was only a little over two billion li.</p><p></p><p>But with layer upon layer of spatial expansions, forming a space-time labyrinth, the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being could never escape no matter if it fled for decades, centuries or millennia.</p><p></p><p>"It actually managed to find this place?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was quite astonished. The Primordial Yin Soul roamed the boundless void, occupying world after world, spreading martial arts, but it did not mention the origin of martial arts or Lin Yuan, the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>As for the flourishing of martial arts in the Azure World over the past tens of millions of years,</p><p></p><p>Compared to the entire boundless void, it was too insignificant.</p><p></p><p>With the protection and concealment of the Progenitor Demonic Tree, martial arts was limited only within the Azure World, making it difficult to draw the attention of those perfected demon god supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"Still unable to leave no trace."</p><p></p><p>As martial arts spread, being found by those perfected demon god supreme beings at this place was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had never intended to completely conceal himself, but was merely delaying, to buy himself more time to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"With my current mind consciousness, combined with illusion techniques, I can completely make this perfected demon god supreme being fall into a deep slumber."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Through the causal connection, Lin Yuan could sense that the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being had a "clone" or similar life-preserving method in a distant location.</p><p></p><p>That place should be in the deeper levels of the Void Secret Realm, where even Lin Yuan's Solar Primordial Soul could not forcibly enter.</p><p></p><p>Directly killing this true form of the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being would not resolve the issue of its "clone".</p><p></p><p>But making the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's true form completely fall into a deep slumber, with the true form and clone sharing memories, meant the clone would also fall into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was prepared for his existence and the Azure World to be discovered, the later the better.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's mind consciousness was very strong, even stronger than Lin Yuan's, but its application of mind consciousness was rather crude.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine paramount experts of the main human world, the Butterfly Paramount was most adept at illusions, with illusions as the foundation of her ultimate existence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long comprehended the path of the Butterfly's evolution, grasping many illusion techniques, making the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being completely fall into a deep slumber was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look at your memories..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan used his own vast mind consciousness to construct a realistic "illusion" for the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being, causing it to be immersed within, and if he wished, he could also browse the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's own memories through the "illusion".</p><p></p><p>A moment later,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>"The boundless void...the missing creator of the Void Secret Realm...and the Child of the Void, or the Void Supreme Being?"</p><p></p><p>Through browsing the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's memories, Lin Yuan's understanding of the entire boundless void instantly reached a terrifying level, as the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being knew too many secrets, which were now all revealed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Supreme Being?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Void Supreme Being was the current ruler of the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The creator who opened the Void Secret Realm was the only known tenth stage demon god in the boundless void, opening the Void Secret Realm and bestowing infinite blessings upon later demon gods.</p><p></p><p>As for the Void Supreme Being, also called the Child of the Void, it was the existence that took over the Void Secret Realm after the disappearance of its creator.</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void itself was not a tenth stage demon god, but by relying on the Void Secret Realm, it could unleash power almost reaching the tenth stage, making it the strongest demon god in the vast boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned slightly grave as he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, if the other party relied on the Void Secret Realm's layered spaces and home field advantage, even if Lin Yuan revealed all his trump cards, he would be unable to kill it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he used the divine ability "World", as long as the other party hid within the Void Secret Realm, it would be futile.</p><p></p><p>The entire Void Secret Realm could also be considered a vast world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Void Secret Realm's area of influence was truly too vast, even capable of affecting the entire boundless void.</p><p></p><p>"According to the Heavenly Wisdom Supreme Being's memories, that Void Supreme Being spends most of its time in deep slumber, profoundly comprehending the origin of the Void Secret Realm, hoping to use this to cross into the tenth stage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>For that Void Supreme Being,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Within the boundless void, everything was within the palm of his hand. His sole pursuit was to become the second person to open the secret realm of the void, to become a stage ten evil deity. </p><p></p><p>'Not a small number of treasures.'</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually took out the many treasures of the Tian Zhi True Lord. </p><p></p><p>After a cursory inventory, he stored them all within a certain place in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>He planned to wait until the traversal was complete, then use the primordial power to return to the origin, and merge into the origin bell.</p><p></p><p>Indirectly bringing them back to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>'Continue comprehending the secret law 'Heavenly River', I can feel that the time to comprehend the six-realm rule of space-time fusion is not far off.'</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes, and ripples completely composed of space-time once again began to undulate on his body surface, forming the vast 'Heavenly River'.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing True Lord and more than a dozen other perfected evil deity true lords gathered together.</p><p></p><p>'Why hasn't Tian Zhi responded for so long?' The Eastern Wing True Lord's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Following Tian Zhi True Lord's instructions, he had gathered the other perfected evil deity true lords, intending to deal with that newly emerged Lord of Yin.</p><p></p><p>Now that everything was prepared, Tian Zhi True Lord could no longer be contacted?</p><p></p><p>This gave the Eastern Wing True Lord a headache.  </p><p></p><p>According to the original plan, when encircling and killing that Lord of Yin, Tian Zhi True Lord had to command and strategize.</p><p></p><p>Only with Tian Zhi True Lord's calculations and arrangements could they suppress that Lord of Yin at the smallest cost.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if more than a dozen perfected evil deity true lords attacked recklessly, even if the Lord of Yin was foolish, he would know to flee in advance. In the vast boundless void, if the Lord of Yin was determined to escape, it could devolve into a protracted war.</p><p></p><p>After all, once the situation became drawn-out, all sorts of accidents could occur.</p><p></p><p>'Perhaps Tian Zhi was delayed by something.'</p><p></p><p>One of the nearby perfected evil deity true lords spoke up.</p><p></p><p>His name was the Divine Eye True Lord, and he had eighteen eyes. Normally only one eye would be open.</p><p></p><p>If all eighteen eyes opened at once, that was the Divine Eye True Lord's strongest state, a life-or-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>In the vast eons of the boundless void, the Divine Eye True Lord had never had all eighteen eyes open simultaneously. Perfected evil deity true lords almost never fought to the death among themselves.</p><p></p><p>'Delayed by something?' </p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing True Lord's brow knitted tighter. Based on his understanding of Tian Zhi True Lord, this possibility was very small.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what matter could delay Tian Zhi True Lord to the point that he couldn't even respond? No matter how big the issue, did it really take so much effort that he couldn't spare a moment to inform the Eastern Wing True Lord?</p><p></p><p>'Let's just wait a bit longer then.'</p><p></p><p>Although the Eastern Wing True Lord didn't believe Tian Zhi True Lord was delayed by something, since he was currently uncontactable, that was the only possibility.</p><p></p><p>'The last time Tian Zhi True Lord contacted me, he said he had found traces of the origin of martial arts.'  </p><p></p><p>'He may have been delayed in searching for the origin of martial arts.'</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing True Lord speculated inwardly. From start to finish, he had never anticipated Tian Zhi True Lord encountering any accidents.</p><p></p><p>Tian Zhi True Lord was a perfected evil deity true lord with extremely powerful self-preservation abilities. Who could kill Tian Zhi True Lord without him being aware?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tian Zhi True Lord had a 'clone' placed in the deepest area of the void secret realm to preserve his life. If Tian Zhi True Lord truly encountered an accident, the clone could contact him.</p><p></p><p>'Then let's wait a bit longer.'</p><p></p><p>The Divine Eye True Lord and the other true lords looked at each other.  </p><p></p><p>Without Tian Zhi True Lord leading them, the more than a dozen perfected evil deity true lords did not have full confidence in encircling and killing that Lord of Yin.</p><p></p><p>And if they failed, the consequences would be severe, facing the Lord of Yin's full retaliation.</p><p></p><p>'Let's wait.'</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wing True Lord nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this point, besides waiting, there was no better option.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed."</p>

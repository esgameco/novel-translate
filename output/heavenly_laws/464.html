        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 464 The Conflict Between Immortals and Demons (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The spiritual world is boundless and infinite.</p><p></p><p>This is the realm of the spiritual will of life.</p><p></p><p>It can be extremely small or extremely vast, depending on the strength of one's spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual world of ordinary mortals may only be as narrow as a thatched hut.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the spiritual will, the more boundless the corresponding spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness that rushed into Lin Yuan's spiritual world with great excitement did not immediately perceive the boundless spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>His attention was completely focused on the towering figure sitting cross-legged in the center of the spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the spiritual will?" </p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness stared blankly.</p><p></p><p>As a former Eleventh-Rank Jade Immortal, even though his true body had perished, his memories and experiences remained. His spiritual will had not weakened much.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, compared to the massive entity in the distance, there was no comparison at all.</p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness had interacted with many Immortals at the same level, and their spiritual wills were on the same level, even if there were differences, they would not be too great.</p><p></p><p>To be able to cultivate to the Jade Immortal realm, the spiritual will would basically not be too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Am I trying to possess the Dao Ancestor?" </p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness couldn't help but have this thought. Such a terrifying spiritual will could not possibly belong to a Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Only the supreme Dao Ancestor of the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms of the Immortal World could possess such a level of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will opened his eyes and looked down at the insignificant jade immortal consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual world, one can only rely on the strength of one's own will, similar to the reflection of the essence of life in the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will index reached over 3,330,000 points, which would be considered powerful even at the Twelfth-Rank ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>It was naturally incomparable to a mere Eleventh-Rank Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the moment Lin Yuan touched that purple jade slip, he had already sensed the problem. The jade immortal will surged up and spread along the spiritual sense that reached out.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could have stopped it at that time.</p><p></p><p>But when he realized that this jade immortal consciousness was targeting his spiritual consciousness, or more precisely, his spiritual will, Lin Yuan had no intention of stopping it.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual world was Lin Yuan's home field, and with his spiritual will strength, even if a Twelfth-Rank Dao Ancestor's spiritual will descended, it would likely be in vain.</p><p></p><p>This jade immortal consciousness invading Lin Yuan's spiritual world was like a piece of meat jumping onto the chopping board, and Lin Yuan naturally would not refuse.</p><p></p><p>After all, the jade immortal consciousness came from a Jade Immortal, and Lin Yuan's current strength had not recovered much. He still needed to use some methods to deal with such a consciousness.</p><p></p><p>While in the Immortal World, Lin Yuan did not intend to reveal his true spiritual will strength, lest it be detected by the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But once the other party fell into his spiritual world, there would be no such hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>"No, you are not the Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness gradually reacted after a brief moment of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He had heard the Dao Ancestor lecture before and could distinguish the Dao Ancestor's aura, but the aura emanating from Lin Yuan's spiritual will was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if Lin Yuan were the Dao Ancestor, would he allow him to enter the spiritual world? With the Dao Ancestor's formidable power, a single thought could have reduced him to ashes.</p><p></p><p>However, before the jade immortal consciousness could think further, everything began to fade into darkness.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that I'm not very familiar with the Immortal World," Lin Yuan smiled and casually suppressed the jade immortal consciousness, then began to browse through its memories.</p><p></p><p>Although he had just received the memories of the original body 'Gao Wou' and 'Wu Xiang Yan', these two were only Tribulation Crossing experts. Their understanding of the deeper and higher-level information and intelligence of the Immortal World was limited.</p><p></p><p>But this jade immortal consciousness was different. As an Eleventh-Rank Jade Immortal, he was already considered a top expert in this Immortal World.</p><p></p><p>Examining this jade immortal consciousness's memories would be of great help to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After dozens of breaths, Lin Yuan had thoroughly reviewed the memories of the jade immortal consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal World? The Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The memories of the original body 'Gao Wou' already contained a lot of information about the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts of the Demon Abyss were the mortal enemies of all Immortals. Any Immortal who encountered demonic beasts would have to exert their full strength to annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>And in the memories of the jade immortal consciousness, he had a more concrete understanding of the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Abyss was the other side of the Immortal World, the resting place of the Demon Abyss Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The endless demonic beasts were nothing more than the condensation of the demonic qi emanated by the slumbering Demon Abyss Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal World and the Demon Abyss were in constant conflict. Every few million to tens of millions of years, the Demon Abyss Ancestor would awaken a portion of its consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the demonic beasts from the depths of the Demon Abyss would frantically invade the Immortal World, and many Golden Immortals and Jade Immortals would exert their full strength to fight against the demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The jade immortal consciousness was named 'Yunzhen Zi', and his true body perished in the Immortal-Demon Great War nine million years ago.</p><p></p><p>However, for an expert at the Jade Immortal level, even when he was alive, he had prepared many life-saving and resurrection methods.</p><p></p><p>The revival consciousness in the purple jade slip was one of them. Once touched, the inner consciousness would be activated and take over the life form that touched the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Yunzhen Zi had deliberately prepared various resources from low to high, hoping that after successfully occupying a body, he could quickly recover to his peak period.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he chose the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>"The most terrifying aspect of demonic beasts is not their strength, but the pollution."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave. Even Jade Immortals, when fighting against demonic beasts at the same level, would still face the risk of being polluted.</p><p></p><p>This pollution referred to the pollution of memories and spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Yunzhen Zi had not only set up the purple jade slip as a resurrection method. He had also refined many life ponds and life stones, so that his consciousness would revive on them the moment his true body perished.</p><p></p><p>But the revived consciousness was all entangled by the pollution carried by the demonic beasts. Only this purple jade slip, isolated from the inside and outside, isolated from memories and causality, and could not be actively revived, barely escaped the pollution.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Abyss Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. With his level of perception, he had long since sensed the Twelfth-Rank existence deep within the Demon Abyss, he just didn't expect it to be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"As for the pollution of demonic beasts, it shouldn't pose any threat to me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The so-called pollution was not something he could not resist, but a matter of whether his spiritual will was strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual consciousness was obviously strong enough. Not only the pollution of demonic beasts, even the pollution of the Demon Abyss Ancestor, Lin Yuan could easily withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I was planning to find a random place to cultivate in seclusion, but it seems there is no need for that now."</p><p></p><p>After organizing Jade Immortal Yunzhen Zi's memories, Lin Yuan quickly thought.</p><p></p><p>Yunzhen Zi, as a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jade Immortal, in the thirty-three immortal realms, there are numerous cave dwellings in the major immortal cities.</p><p></p><p>The closest one is the 'Cangwu' immortal city, which has a top-grade cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>The top-grade cave dwelling is the highest-level one in the Cangwu immortal city. Not only is it secure, but the fluctuations of the rules are also very obvious, which is greatly beneficial for comprehending the Dao of the rules.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan has the Jade Immortal consciousness of Yun Zhenzi, it is equivalent to Yun Zhenzi himself. As long as he is willing, he can take over that top-grade cave dwelling at any time.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the top-grade cave dwelling will be reclaimed after Yun Zhenzi's demise?</p><p></p><p>In fact, the ownership of each immortal city's cave dwelling belongs to the immortal city. Even Yun Zhenzi, as the purchaser, only has the ownership of that cave dwelling for ten billion years.</p><p></p><p>After ten billion years, the cave dwelling will be reclaimed.</p><p></p><p>And it has not even been two million years since Yun Zhenzi purchased that top-grade cave dwelling, so there is still a long way to go before the ten billion years are up.</p><p></p><p>The major immortal cities of the thirty-three immortal realms are under the command of the Dao Ancestor, and their authority is undoubtedly unquestionable. There will be no premature reclamation of the cave dwellings.</p><p></p><p>After all, the existence that can purchase a top-grade cave dwelling is at least a supreme Golden Immortal, and most of them are Jade Immortals. The premature reclamation of the cave dwellings of such powerful beings would pose too great a hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>Other Golden Immortals and Jade Immortals are all watching. If you reclaim the cave dwelling of a certain supreme Golden Immortal today, will you reclaim mine tomorrow?</p><p></p><p>"Cangwu Immortal City?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>That was the location of the Cangwu Immortal City, one of the fifteen major immortal cities in the Xuantian Immortal Realm. It was the place that the original "Gao Wuyou" had always dreamed of residing in.</p><p></p><p>The Cangwu Immortal City is not only safe, but unlike the outside, there is no risk of encountering demonic beasts at any time. The cultivation environment is also extremely abundant.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's not a cave dwelling, just being on the streets of the Cangwu Immortal City, one can feel the sufficiently dense fluctuations of the Dao of the rules.</p><p></p><p>However, the unfortunate thing is that unless one owns a fixed cave dwelling in the Cangwu Immortal City, a certain fee will be charged for every day spent there.</p><p></p><p>A year or two may not be much, but as immortals, a closed-door cultivation can last for thousands or even tens of thousands of years, causing even Tribulation Crossing experts to not dare to stay in the Cangwu Immortal City for long.</p><p></p><p>And purchasing a cave dwelling? It is a huge expense, even the lowest-grade Ding-level cave dwelling is far beyond the affordability of Tribulation Crossing experts.</p><p></p><p>When Yun Zhenzi originally purchased the top-grade cave dwelling in the Cangwu Immortal City, he had indeed suffered a great deal.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenzi's strength, even among Jade Immortals, was considered powerful. If he had not been surrounded and attacked by more than ten demonic beasts of the same level, he would not have died and fallen.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the resurrection method Yun Zhenzi left behind was able to withstand the demonic pollution. Unfortunately, he encountered the unreasonable existence of Lin Yuan, otherwise he would have already successfully 'resurrected' by now.</p><p></p><p>"First, I will refine the spiritual body, and then let the spiritual body go to the Cangwu Immortal City to see if I can take over that top-grade cave dwelling."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart. The benefits of the top-grade cave dwelling for comprehending the rules are deeply imprinted in Yun Zhenzi's memories, otherwise he would not have spent a large sum of money to purchase it.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan's stay in the immortal realm is limited, so he naturally wants to choose the best cultivation environment as much as possible, so that he can spend more time preparing for the final assault.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, half a month had gone by.</p><p></p><p>"The sun and the moon have emerged."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and two illusory figures gradually materialized and emerged from his body.</p><p></p><p>They were Lin Yuan's Yin and Yang spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Lin Yuan forcibly transformed the immortal Dao foundation of the original body into a martial Dao foundation, directly condensing the two great spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>With the two spiritual bodies out, Lin Yuan became much more convenient, no longer needing to do everything himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's mental will can easily condense incarnations, incarnations are different from spiritual body clones, and their true nature can be easily seen through.</p><p></p><p>"You, take the Jade Immortal consciousness of Yun Zhenzi and go to the Cangwu Immortal City."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Yang spiritual body and instructed.</p><p></p><p>The reason for letting the Yang spiritual body go to the Cangwu Immortal City is for the sake of safety.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yun Zhenzi has been dead for nearly ten million years. Who knows if his cave dwelling is still there? Even if it is still there, will there be any other unexpected situations when taking over that cave dwelling?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the probability of such an event happening is very small. The reputation of the immortal city is unquestionable, and it is not just facing Yun Zhenzi alone.</p><p></p><p>But it is always better to consider the worst-case scenario.</p><p></p><p>If the Yang spiritual body goes to the Cangwu Immortal City, even if an extreme situation occurs, the loss for Lin Yuan would only be a spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>If everything goes smoothly, the Yang spiritual body will take control of that top-grade cave dwelling, and the significant rule fluctuations of the cave dwelling will also be sensed by the true body.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, letting the spiritual body go to the Cangwu Immortal City is the most prudent approach.</p><p></p><p>If it fails, it's no big deal. If it succeeds, he can gain a top-grade cave dwelling that can accelerate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze, the Yang spiritual body silently disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"So the Cangwu Immortal City is over there?"</p><p></p><p>In the high sky, the Yang spiritual body of Lin Yuan kept shuttling through the void towards the direction of the Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's understanding and comprehension of the spatial rules, the Cangwu Immortal City, which the original "Gao Wuyou" would have taken years or even decades to reach, appeared within his field of vision after just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"So that is the Cangwu Immortal City?" Lin Yuan stopped his void traversal and gazed at the boundless and majestic immortal city in the distance.</p><p></p><p>This immortal city seemed like an endless world. The height of the city walls reached hundreds of billions or even trillions of miles, and an ancient and mysterious aura permeated the air. Even powerful Jade Immortals would reveal a sense of awe when facing the immortal city.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that each of the thirty-three immortal cities was opened up by the Dao Ancestor. The Dao Ancestor, out of compassion for all beings, has connected every immortal city to the source of the immortal realm, so as long as one is in the immortal city, they can feel the dense fluctuations of the Dao of the rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why countless immortals yearn to reside in the immortal cities - the benefits to their cultivation are truly immense.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flew towards the Cangwu Immortal City, soon arriving at the East City Gate.</p><p></p><p>"Rule fluctuations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smoothly entered the Cangwu Immortal City and immediately felt the rule fluctuations that were completely different from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"This level of rule fluctuations can rival some of the cultivation holy land secret realms in the main universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>This was just the outer city. </p><p></p><p>If it was the inner city, or even the cave dwelling district, the top-grade cave dwelling,</p><p></p><p>the rule fluctuations displayed would be even more obvious.</p><p></p><p>"However, the entire immortal city is shrouded in countless killing formations. Once these killing formations are activated, even the peak-period Yun Zhenzi would be unable to withstand them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also sensed the aura of the countless formations operating in the Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the immortal city's cave dwelling district first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts and no longer dwelled on it.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many killing formations there were in the immortal city, they posed no threat to him. </p><p></p><p>It was just a spiritual body, without carrying any resources or treasures.</p>

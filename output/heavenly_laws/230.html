            <p>Chapter 230 Eighth Level (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many merit points this intelligence is worth."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a bit of anticipation in his heart. Ever since tasting the many privileges and treatment of a seventh-level citizen, Lin Yuan wanted to be promoted to an eighth-level citizen as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>In the entire An'nan Star Alliance, there was only one eighth-level citizen in this era, and that was the Star Alliance Council Chairman.</p><p></p><p>Faced with an eighth-level citizen, even existences like the Chiyan Star Lord and Jiulong Star Lord, who were invincible at the eighth level, had to show respect.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that it was extremely difficult for a sixth-level citizen to be promoted to a seventh-level citizen, and it was even more like a chasm between heaven and earth for a seventh-level citizen to be promoted to an eighth-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>At least the Chiyan Star Lord had killed countless powerful alien races, but still hadn't accumulated enough merit points to be promoted to an eighth-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>Even many of the evolution scholars who had opened up a complete eighth-level evolution path were not eighth-level citizens.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was clear that the intelligence he mentioned could not fill up the merit points needed for him to be promoted to an eighth-level citizen.</p><p></p><p>But it could more or less reduce the difficulty of being promoted to an eighth-level citizen in the future.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came again.</p><p></p><p>"Respected seventh-level citizen Lin Yuan, the intelligence you mentioned has been judged to be worth 1.5 million merit points. Do you want to issue it now?"</p><p></p><p>"1.5 million merit points?" A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan created the seventh-level chapter of martial arts, he only obtained 3 million merit points. Now, just a piece of intelligence was worth half of the seventh-level chapter of martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Issue it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>You should know that the intelligence he mentioned sounded like it was helping the evolution of human civilization to find another way to comprehend that torso.</p><p></p><p>But it was just how it sounded.</p><p></p><p>How many evolvers could actually do it?</p><p></p><p>Comprehending 3,333 evolution paths sounded daunting. For almost all evolvers, the difficulty of this method was much greater than directly cultivating a certain evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom judged that this piece of intelligence was worth 1.5 million merit points, which had already exceeded Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>It was just like the evolution path. If an evolution path was rated as ninth level, tenth level or even higher, its value would naturally be immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>But if the premise of "unable to cultivate" was added before this evolution path, then its value would inevitably plummet. The intelligence provided by Lin Yuan was like this. At least at this stage, no evolver could comprehend 3,333 evolution paths.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could do it in the future, it would be something that would happen after a long time.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan agreed, a thought suddenly came to his mind.</p><p></p><p>"However, if it's just cultivating a certain evolution path, perfecting and making up for it, and walking to the end, even the strongest can do it. In theory, the strongest should have already condensed the Demon Jade mark and know about the method I mentioned."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan guessed in his heart that the strongest were such existences. At the height they were at, it wasn't difficult to just perfect and make up for a wrong evolution path.</p><p></p><p>According to the difficulty of becoming an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Tower, the test for the strongest should be higher, or as long as the strongest joined the Demon Jade Tower, they wouldn't start as ordinary members.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened the current star map of the human civilization's territory.</p><p></p><p>"The star domain that Senior Brother chose to guard is located at the southeastern edge of the human civilization's territory, where it connects with other powerful races."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long learned from his Senior Brother where the star domain he was about to go and guard was located.</p><p></p><p>The newly opened star domains of human civilization were not like the Chiyan Star Domain, which had been managed for hundreds of thousands of years and was basically considered a safe haven with no danger.</p><p></p><p>The star domains at the edge of the territory, due to just being opened up, coupled with bordering alien races, and many places within the territory not being completely cleared out.</p><p></p><p>For example, some special living races that were entrenched, or some cosmic secret realms, etc.</p><p></p><p>These were all waiting for the Star Lords to go and deal with.</p><p></p><p>Newly advanced eighth-level evolvers needed to guard the star domain for 500 years, not to enjoy blessings, but to really fight for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"The place Senior Brother chose is not bad. At least it doesn't border any top races."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that it was quite safe to just border a few powerful races, as powerful races basically didn't dare to be enemies with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Let alone take action against a Star Lord. If they took action today, the old nest of this powerful race would be flattened by human civilization tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>But top races were different.</p><p></p><p>Of course, normally speaking, the few top races of human civilization restrained each other quite a bit. The movement at the alien battlefield last time was because the Insect Race wanted a supreme evolution path.</p><p></p><p>So they nearly flipped the table. A supreme evolution path of a supreme being who had already fallen could give birth to a supreme being, and a supreme being could completely change the overall situation of the current alliance of many top races.</p><p></p><p>The Insect Race naturally didn't care about anything else.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Insect Race Alliance was still cleared out by human civilization afterwards, with many powerful races in the alliance suffering heavy losses, and the Black Abyss Race's own old nest was even decimated by a tenth.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the birth of a supreme being, the Insect Race and other top races dared to turn against human civilization, but in other aspects, there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>Although they mutually infiltrated each other and assassinated the geniuses of the other race, overall, they all restrained themselves to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had communicated with his Senior Brother many times, which seemed to be out of concern, but was actually for himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was now only a step away from the eighth level, and his mental will index had soared to over 9,800 since condensing the Demon Jade mark.</p><p></p><p>He was very close to the threshold of 10,000 points.</p><p></p><p>As long as his mental will index reached 10,000 points, Lin Yuan would be able to directly step into the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my true body will go to guard the star domain, my Yin spirit will stay on the alien battlefield to comprehend the permanent spatial rift, and my Yang spirit will stay on the main star of Chiyan, leaving behind a drop of essence blood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The true body had the strongest strength, and what was needed to guard the star domain was the ability to sweep away all combat power.</p><p></p><p>Even if something unexpected happened and the true body was destroyed, with the divine ability "Rebirth from a Drop of Blood", that drop of essence blood left on the main star of Chiyan could quickly grow and "return" in the most perfect form.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to use the method of the Yin and Yang spirits deriving a physical body at all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in order to reduce losses, the true body going to guard the star domain definitely couldn't bring any precious treasures. Otherwise, if he died and lost the treasures, Lin Yuan would still feel distressed.</p><p></p><p>The physical body could be reborn, but the treasures couldn't come back.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>According to the data of the human civilization alliance, the death rate of newly advanced eighth-level evolvers going to guard the edge star domains was very low.</p><p></p><p>This was the case for ordinary eighth-level evolvers.</p><p></p><p>Let alone Lin Yuan, who could already do it at the seventh level.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Enough to crush most Eighth Stage experts. Once he advanced to the Eighth Stage, his combat power would undergo another major transformation. By then, he estimated that he could stand shoulder to shoulder with those Eighth Stage peak extreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Inside a tavern.</p><p></p><p>This tavern was only open to Evolvers above the Seventh Stage, and was a place for higher-level human civilization Evolvers to interact.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was sitting in the corner, chatting with Gao Wufeng.</p><p></p><p>Some time ago, Gao Wufeng nearly went astray while cultivating the evolutionary path he comprehended from that torso, and was suppressed in time by his teacher, Ninth Sword Star Lord. He had barely recovered recently.</p><p></p><p>"I finally understand why you, Thirteenth Peak Lord, did not cultivate the evolutionary path within that torso back then. It turns out you were taking the second approach."</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the Goddess of Wisdom announced again that in addition to directly cultivating, there was another way to comprehend a certain number of evolutionary paths from that torso.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom specifically emphasized that this method was extremely difficult, so it was not announced at first, and only selected some genius Evolvers for "testing".</p><p></p><p>Now that it had been confirmed there were no major issues, it was announced to the public.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom had considered it quite thoroughly. This way, it helped conceal Lin Yuan's identity.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Thirteenth Peak Lord, you can't casually reveal such secrets to outsiders." Gao Wufeng immediately expressed his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"But this method is too outrageous. Comprehending a certain number of evolutionary paths? Under that kind of mental pressure, it's already difficult to barely maintain sanity, let alone comprehend one evolutionary path after another."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng shook his head, his tone revealing helplessness. </p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>This method was extremely safe.</p><p></p><p>At least one's own mental strength would not be affected by the wrong evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>But it was basically impossible to achieve. Without cultivating the comprehended evolutionary paths, one would continuously suffer mental suppression.</p><p></p><p>This suppression did not go from weak to strong, but came according to the Evolver's mental strength.</p><p></p><p>Even if your Mental Strength Index reached 20,000 points, under that mental pressure, it would also quickly reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>Then, it depended on one's own perseverance.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan comprehended that torso, his Mental Strength Index was just over 7,000 points. After comprehending for a few years, it was almost approaching 10,000 points.</p><p></p><p>Under the seemingly endless mental pressure, it was also a kind of tempering for one's own mental strength.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't comprehend that many either."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. The evolutionary paths contained within that torso - he still hadn't seen the end of them even now. He had only comprehended over 3,000 types, which was just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth Peak Lord, you're being humble again."</p><p></p><p>Gao Wufeng looked at Lin Yuan with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also pondering in his heart. How many types? To be able to say those words, it meant that at the very least, the evolutionary paths Thirteenth Peak Lord comprehended must be five or six types, maybe even close to ten?</p><p></p><p>After chatting with Gao Wufeng for a while.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess of Wisdom actually made the second method public?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With just a little thought, Lin Yuan understood. Even if this method was made public, so what?</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't revealed how many types of evolutionary paths needed to be comprehended to reach the goal, even if those alien race powerhouses knew about it, it was meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, the goal was very important. If you didn't know exactly how many types of evolutionary paths you comprehended, those alien race powerhouses basically couldn't persist.</p><p></p><p>After all, the mental pressure from that torso was an extreme torment. When in a poor state, the speed of comprehension would greatly decrease.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had also stumbled upon it by accident. He originally had no intention of comprehending the ultimate evolutionary path, but merely wanted to temper his mental strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the blessing of his heaven-defying comprehension, he quickly comprehended 3,333 types and finally condensed the Demon Jade Imprint, enlightening to everything.</p><p></p><p>Others? They could hardly persist.</p><p></p><p>"Continue comprehending."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged and he looked up again at that torso under the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was now an ordinary member of the Demon Jade Pavilion, since there were ordinary members, there were also core and even higher-level members.</p><p></p><p>If he continued to comprehend more evolutionary paths, could he gain a promotion in status within the Demon Jade Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, comprehending the evolutionary paths within the torso was very beneficial to Lin Yuan. After analysis, he could integrate their essence into himself.</p><p></p><p>And he could also continue to enhance his own mental strength.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to kill three birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Lin Yuan was unwilling to give up.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan advanced to the Eighth Stage soon, he would not give up here.</p><p></p><p>Just like that.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed himself in comprehension again.</p><p></p><p>One day, two days.</p><p></p><p>One month, two months.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a year passed.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>Under the endless mental pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Persevere, persevere."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still persisting.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing how long had passed, it seemed as if he had crossed into some kind of shackle.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mental strength began to undergo a transformation. Originally, Lin Yuan's mental strength was only an illusory thing, but now, it actually emitted a deep glow, as if it was a tangible entity.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light breath.</p><p></p><p>Just now in that instant, he almost couldn't hold on.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't give up in the end.</p><p></p><p>"My current mental strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed that compared to before, his mental strength had definitely increased by a big margin. It was an important step from illusory to real.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how much my Mental Strength Index is now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan disconnected from the virtual world and rested for half a day in reality.</p><p></p><p>In the most perfect state, he entered his personal space.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom, I request to measure my Mental Strength Index."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly connected to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Seventh Level Citizen Lin Yuan, without using any physical or spiritual power, just relying on your own mental strength, impact your surroundings."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom's solemn and cold voice came.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did as instructed. The immense mental pressure swept the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, even the air distorted.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Seventh Level Citizen Lin Yuan, after testing, your current Mental Strength Index is roughly around 11,200."</p><p></p><p>"So much more?" Lin Yuan's spirit was lifted.</p><p></p><p>A Mental Strength Index of 10,000 was a threshold, determining if one could smoothly pass the Heartdemon Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, after reaching 10,000, the difficulty of increasing the Mental Strength Index would skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan now reaching a Mental Strength Index of over 11,000 was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As a Seventh Stage Evolver, raising the Mental Strength Index to this level - there probably weren't many in the history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Mental Strength Index exceeding 10,000."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged and he made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Everything is ready, directly begin the breakthrough to Eighth Stage."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 725</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan, who caused all this, did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>After bestowing many dimensional treasures and precious objects, he did not continue to intervene.</p><p></p><p>How those dimensional treasures and rarities were exchanged, and how many merit points were needed, was all left for the three goddesses to determine.</p><p></p><p>After the human civilization group left their home universe, Lin Yuan intervened several times to "upgrade" the three goddesses.</p><p></p><p>Now the computing power of the three goddesses is so strong that it's estimated even supreme saints cannot compare.</p><p></p><p>As for the stance of the three goddesses, Lin Yuan never changed it - they all stand on the side of the human civilization group.</p><p></p><p>"Parents."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep, seeing through the chaotic void everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong, the married couple, had already been arranged by Lin Yuan to be in one of the thirty-three posterior universes.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three posterior universes were the strongest stronghold Lin Yuan left for the human civilization group, which could only be exited but not entered.</p><p></p><p>With the protection of the universe spirit in the posterior universe, it could be said that Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong were absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>As for the lifespan limit below the 12th level of life?</p><p></p><p>If relying purely on resources to stack up, the limit would be the peak of the 11th level.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, the strength of the physical body, the soul and will, and even the comprehension of rules could all be enhanced through external forces.</p><p></p><p>But from the 11th level to the 12th level? It required an extremely firm will to make the ultimate leap, and only success could cross into the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>Failure meant death, and would be backlashed by the river of time in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>However, the possibility of Lin Yuan's parents making the ultimate leap to cross into the 12th level was not very high.</p><p></p><p>This was also determined by Lin Yuan through observing future timelines.</p><p></p><p>However, extending the lifespan limit did not necessarily have to rely on crossing into the 12th level.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the lifespan limit for life at the 11th level and below was because their own life's fundamental imprint was branded within the current universe's river of time.</p><p></p><p>If the universe entered a great destruction, and the river of time withered and collapsed along with it, any life's fundamental imprint would collapse as well.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was at the 11th level, his physical body and soul were perfect as he wished, and his lifespan had no end, but he would still die and fall with the universe's great destruction.</p><p></p><p>But what if the universe would not enter a great destruction? So.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long ago transferred his parents' life's fundamental imprints into the river of time of the posterior universe they were in.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three posterior universes were Lin Yuan's labor of love, and there was no so-called great destruction or great rebirth, coexisting with this chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong's life's fundamental imprints branded within the posterior universe's river of time, naturally there was no lifespan limit.</p><p></p><p>This was also something Lin Yuan did specially for his own parents.</p><p></p><p>That posterior universe, vast and endless, after being transformed by human civilization, had all kinds of entertainment methods, enough for Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong to live happily forever.</p><p></p><p>Splitting off a trace of his consciousness to descend into the posterior universe to accompany his parents.</p><p></p><p>More of Lin Yuan's consciousness continued to look towards the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan observed deeply, the essence of the chaotic void was revealed bit by bit before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That is..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw in the deepest part of the chaotic void, where it was the end of all time and space, wisps of time force permeated, forming cyclic regions completely composed of time.</p><p></p><p>"The time loops that all those who attempted to break through to the 13th level in the past fell into?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, these cyclic regions completely composed of time, even he could not see through them, permeated with the supreme rule aura of endless dimensions and planes.</p><p></p><p>No matter which dimensional space or planar world, as long as one attempted to break through to the 13th level, they would definitely fall into a time loop, obviously this was an iron law set by the supreme rules.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, each time loop was sheltered and protected by the supreme rules.</p><p></p><p>"Too many."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked with one glance, numerous time loop regions were spread out, but almost all the time loop regions had fallen into complete silence, obviously those Chaos Realm masters inside had no hope of breaking free.</p><p></p><p>"Master of the Demon Jade Tower"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards a certain time loop near the deep region, following the faint karmic sensing, confirming this time loop belonged to the Master of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Once an invincible great saint who swept across the chaotic void for an era.</p><p></p><p>The time loop region occupied by the Master of the Demon Jade Tower was much larger than the surrounding time loop regions.</p><p></p><p>Even among Chaos Realm masters, there were differences in strength, such as ordinary great saints, supreme great saints, invincible great saints, and so on.</p><p></p><p>This was reflected not only in strength, but even more so in the time loop region occupied when attempting to break through to the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the power, naturally the larger and wider the time loop region occupied.</p><p></p><p>"There should be no hope of normal breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a Chaos Realm master falls into a time loop, naturally the faster the breakthrough the better.</p><p></p><p>It's best to break through within one universe era, quickly in several hundred to a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The longer the time drags on, the lower the possibility of breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The era when the Master of the Demon Jade Tower was from was separated from now by long universe eras, basically there was no possibility of breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the 13th level, I can try to break the time loop where the Master of the Demon Jade Tower is," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>13th level time life forms cannot peek into everything inside the time loops, but they can forcibly break them.</p><p></p><p>It's just that there is a price to pay, and no time life form is willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had karmic ties with the Master of the Demon Jade Tower, and had received quite a few benefits left by him.</p><p></p><p>If the price of breaking the time loop was not too great, Lin Yuan was willing to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after the time loop is broken by external force, even if the life inside regains freedom, it loses the possibility of becoming a 13th level life form.</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Mysterious Emperor, he forcibly broke the loop, completely perished, and waited until becoming a time life form to resurrect together with his dao companion," Lin Yuan thought far ahead.</p><p></p><p>13th level life forms have the ability to resurrect 12th level life forms, as long as they once existed, they can all be 'resurrected'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to observe the deepest time loop regions of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The innermost area had basically fallen into complete silence, with no value for observation.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze mainly lingered on the outer regions, which were also the time loops that Chaos Realm masters had fallen into when attempting to break through to the 13th level in recent eras.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This time loop region?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully looked at one of the regions, this region was even larger than the one occupied by the Master of the Demon Jade Tower, obviously also a Chaos Realm master with invincible great saint level strength.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of time force constantly stirred up ripples, obviously the life inside this time loop region was struggling violently.</p><p></p><p>"There is hope of breaking through the time loop."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, he was sensing with his own Lord rank, and his conclusion was much more accurate than other time life forms.</p><p></p><p>"The master of this time loop..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed the karmic sensing, and in the instant he looked towards this time loop, he produced karmic ties with the master trapped in this time loop</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Great Sage Luohou?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan muttered softly. The moment he uttered this name, the karmic connection deepened, and Lin Yuan immediately began observing along this Great Sage's timeline.</p><p></p><p>Past timeline.</p><p>Present timeline. </p><p>Future timeline.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to have such a karmic connection with this Great Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan 'saw' that Great Sage Luohou had once asked two peerless Great Sages to investigate the deaths of Great Sage Jiufeng and Great Sage Shadow Demon. Those two Great Sages eventually traced it to the Milky Way Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they were casually erased by Lin Yuan as an opportunity to establish his authority.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lin Yuan's name as the Invincible Great Sage spread completely.</p><p></p><p>In the past timeline Lin Yuan saw, Great Sage Luohou, upon witnessing his strength, became disheartened and gave up on the title of 'Invincible Great Sage' that he had always pursued, directly challenging the 13th level instead.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sage Luohou greatly desired the title of Invincible Great Sage. The 13th level inheritance he cultivated required enduring endless torment, but he still completed it, all because he wanted to become the Invincible Great Sage."</p><p></p><p>By observing Great Sage Luohou's past, Lin Yuan understood where the other's obsession lay.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Luohou had even gone into seclusion for universe eras to practice that 13th level inheritance, outlasting the previous Invincible Great Sage, before finally succeeding.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Great Sage Luohou did not aspire to reach the 13th level, but strongly desired to become the Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>"Giving up the obsession of becoming the Invincible Great Sage opened a door to becoming a time lifeform?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite emotional.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even Great Sage Luohou himself had not sensed this point.</p><p></p><p>He gave up on becoming the Invincible Great Sage completely because he believed he was no match for Lin Yuan and could not defeat him. Even if he crushed other peerless Great Sages, he still could not become the Invincible Great Sage.</p><p></p><p>This led to a change in his mindset, letting go of what he once wanted, bringing hope for breaking through the time cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Obsession?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, "Obsession has a big impact on breaking through the time cycle. Emperor Xuanhuang was unable to accept the test set by the time cycle precisely because he couldn't let go of his obsession with reviving his dao partner."</p><p></p><p>It was because Great Sage Luohou let go of his own obsession that he now has hope of breaking through the time cycle and becoming a time lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The same obsession, two choices, neither right nor wrong, yet leading to different results.</p><p></p><p>Of course, so-called obsessions only affect the time cycle, they are not absolute.</p><p></p><p>Great Sage Luohou's accumulation was certainly sufficient, evident from the fact that the area of time cycle he occupied was larger than that of the Master of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, Great Sage Luohou surpassed the Master of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient accumulation and foundation as a prerequisite, the choice regarding obsession becomes very important.</p><p></p><p>In a certain space within the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>'Lord Mo Xu' and six other 13th level time lifeforms gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way is becoming increasingly unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>The time lifeform in black armor spoke in an amazed tone. Not only were they unable to observe Lin Yuan at the timeline level, but as time passed, Lin Yuan gave them an increasingly terrifying feeling.</p><p></p><p>"It's right that we can't fathom him."</p><p></p><p>The snake-bodied time lifeform with a human head shook his head and said, "This is an existence destined to become a Time Lord. I even wonder if it's a scheme from some Time Lord, or simply a reincarnation?"</p><p></p><p>If not for being a Time Lord himself, how could his future timeline show him destined to become a Time Lord?</p><p></p><p>"A Time Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The other time lifeforms' expressions became slightly solemn, then puzzled: "But why would a Time Lord reincarnate into our dimensional space?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Chaos Void is a top-tier dimensional space, it's not worth a Time Lord abandoning everything to reincarnate here.</p><p></p><p>The cost would be too great.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of whether it's a Time Lord's reincarnation, the Milky Way is a time lifeform from our Chaos Void," said Lord Mo Xu, glancing at the six time lifeforms with a smile. "We all come from the same dimensional space, so our relationship will be very close."</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>The six time lifeforms nodded in succession.</p><p></p><p>No matter Lin Yuan's background or schemes, as long as they remember he's from the Chaos Void, that's enough.</p><p></p><p>Countless dimensional realms have given birth to time lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>And the closest relationships among time lifeforms are naturally those from the same dimensional space.</p><p></p><p>Same hometown, naturally closer relationship.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how are the plans in the 'Heavenly River' dimension progressing?" Lord Mo Xu looked towards the six time lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The 'Heavenly River' dimension is an incredibly vast yet chaotic dimensional space that doesn't reject foreign time lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The seven time lifeforms from the Chaos Void had entered the Heavenly River dimension early on, forming an alliance there to compete with other time lifeforms, occupying a large territory and influence.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the Heart of the Heavenly River born this time will definitely be ours," said the snake-bodied time lifeform with a human head. "Those major forces have all obtained the Heart of the Heavenly River before, they won't interfere or obstruct us."</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Heavenly River is a treasure nurtured by the Heavenly River dimension over countless years. Refining it allows one to directly experience the operation of the dimension's fundamental rules.</p><p></p><p>Time lifeforms are interested in various dimensional spaces for the purpose of experiencing the unique operation of their fundamental rules.</p><p></p><p>Although time lifeforms can slowly sense the operation of fundamental rules after entering a dimensional space, how could that compare to directly refining the Heart of the Heavenly River?</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lord Mo Xu nodded.</p><p></p><p>With the Heart of the Heavenly River, all seven of them could more deeply experience the operational essence of the Heavenly River dimension, which would also greatly benefit their own accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Time lifeforms have infinitely long lifespans. Accumulating bit by bit, they will eventually have a day of approaching and touching the realm of Time Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Thus, when the Milky Way reaches the 13th level, we will have a gift of sufficient weight to present," said Lord Mo Xu, looking at the other six time lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Heavenly River holds enough attraction for time lifeforms, its value far exceeding that of the ten-thousand-meter Nightmare Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Lord Mo Xu and the other six time lifeforms had competed with time lifeforms from other forces for long ages, finally gaining this opportunity to possibly obtain the Heart of the Heavenly River.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued observing the deepest time cycle region of the Chaos Void for a while.</p><p></p><p>Then he withdrew this part of his consciousness, preparing to continue comprehending the Yin-Yang Twin Flower.</p><p></p><p>"The third source world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly. Deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds were coordinates for thirty-three source worlds.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan had only explored the second source world. The reason for not continuing to explore the remaining thirty-one source worlds was that they posed life-threatening dangers to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But now that Lin Yuan's strength was sufficient, he could first observe and prepare for how to explore after reaching the 13th level.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan immediately sank his consciousness into the depths of his mind, looking towards that majestic and grand Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

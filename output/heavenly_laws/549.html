        <h1>Chapter 549</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Even though it carried countless citizens of human civilization and a large number of alien life forms, there were still vast areas left empty.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's internal universe was built on the foundation of the thirteenth-level inheritance "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>Its profound depth was unimaginable - as long as there was enough space, it could basically accommodate anything.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>Dozens of twelfth-level aliens appeared in a corner, their faces showing wild joy.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way's supreme being, the Milky Way's supreme being is willing to shelter me?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Milky Way's supreme being is merciful. I finally have hope of surviving this great destruction calamity."</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can survive, what does it matter to completely submit to the Milky Way's supreme being?"</p><p></p><p>When all the twelfth-level aliens realized they had been taken into Lin Yuan's internal universe, they were initially extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>They had some contact with the great destruction calamity and knew its terror. They were absolutely certain that relying on themselves alone, it would be impossible to survive it.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, death and perishing was almost inevitable. </p><p></p><p>Unable to survive the great destruction calamity, they could only be forced to remain in the universe, and would eventually be annihilated along with the complete destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>This was the fate of all twelfth-level powerhouses who could not pass through the great destruction calamity.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Milky Way's supreme being was willing to take them into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>With the protection of the Milky Way's supreme being, their hope of surviving the great destruction calamity naturally increased enormously.</p><p></p><p>However, when the many twelfth-level aliens saw their surroundings clearly, they were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"How did you get in here too?"</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way's supreme being is willing to protect you as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone came in?"</p><p></p><p>All the twelfth-level aliens were somewhat dazed. They suddenly discovered that all the twelfth-level powerhouses in the universe besides human civilization had been taken into the Milky Way supreme being's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this point, many twelfth-level aliens could no longer laugh.</p><p></p><p>They roughly calculated that the Milky Way supreme being's internal universe now carried close to eighty twelfth-level life forms, plus countless citizens of human civilization, as well as a large number of aliens who had completely sold themselves to human civilization. Finally, the internal universes of many twelfth-level powerhouses themselves also carried a large number of life forms.</p><p></p><p>If calculated this way, it was equivalent to the Milky Way supreme being single-handedly taking all the life in this universe, including twelfth-level life forms, into his internal universe, and then carrying them through the great destruction calamity.</p><p></p><p>All the twelfth-level aliens were somewhat dazed. Carrying so many life forms together to pass through the great destruction calamity, what terrifying tribulations would they face?</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-level aliens could not imagine, and did not dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>In the great destruction of the universe, normally all life would die along with the destruction, and then become the driving force for the start of the next universe era.</p><p></p><p>Twelfth-level powerhouses were the exception, having a slim chance of survival. As long as they could endure the great destruction calamity, they could survive.</p><p></p><p>But this chance of survival was also relative - the more life forms a twelfth-level powerhouse carried, the more slim this chance became.</p><p></p><p>Now the Milky Way supreme being was directly carrying all the life of the entire universe. How could the origin consciousness tolerate this?</p><p></p><p>Losing countless lives to become the driving force, after the great destruction of the universe, the time to start the next universe era would become extremely long.</p><p></p><p>"Can the Milky Way supreme being survive the great destruction of the universe?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. Carrying so many life forms, he will likely face the full force suppression and backlash of the entire universe."</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way supreme being... is he so confident?"</p><p></p><p>All the twelfth-level aliens were very nervous. Now they were essentially tied together with the Milky Way supreme being. If the Milky Way supreme being did not survive the great destruction calamity, they would also inevitably die, with no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"You Tianyu race, after fighting with human civilization for so many years, with enmity as deep as the sea, you have the nerve to beg the Milky Way supreme being for protection?"</p><p></p><p>A twelfth-level alien glanced at the several ultimates of the Tianyu race and said with slight dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>If the several ultimates of the Tianyu race had not come in, the pressure faced by the Milky Way supreme being in the great destruction calamity might be a little less, and the possibility of surviving might be a little greater.</p><p></p><p>"And the Insect race, weren't you in a fight to the death with humans? Why did you come in too? Where is the Insect race's toughness?"</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-level aliens all looked at each other with some displeasure. This was related to whether they could survive.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"No need to argue."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ultimate of the Starry Sky Alliance spoke up. He glanced at all the twelfth-level aliens, "Do you really think the Milky Way supreme being cares about the great destruction calamity?"</p><p></p><p>At these words.</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-level aliens were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Starry Sky Alliance ultimate's meaning was that the Milky Way supreme being did not care about the great destruction calamity? The twelfth-level aliens present did not have the means of the two ultimates of the Calamity race to know in advance that Lin Yuan's strength was very close to, or could even challenge, the Chaos Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Their understanding of the Milky Way supreme being was still stuck on the fact that he could not overcome the peak Trailblazer realm defensive treasure.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, the Milky Way supreme being at most had Sovereign realm strength. And a Sovereign? Under the full force suppression of the universe's origin consciousness, they were not much stronger than the Trailblazer realm.</p><p></p><p>"You think I'm wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The Starry Sky Alliance ultimate smiled and continued, "Haven't you noticed by now what difference there is between the Milky Way supreme being's internal universe and ours?"</p><p></p><p>"Difference?"</p><p></p><p>Some twelfth-level aliens reacted. In fact, some twelfth-level aliens had realized something was off as soon as they were taken in here. The Milky Way supreme being's internal universe was too stable? But they were immediately distracted by other twelfth-level aliens.</p><p></p><p>Now prompted by the Starry Sky Alliance ultimate, they all began to observe the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>However, as they observed, the minds of the many twelfth-level aliens began to tremble involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The internal universes of twelfth-level life forms, with their many rules operating, depended entirely on themselves.</p><p></p><p>Simply put.</p><p></p><p>Whatever rules a twelfth-level life form had comprehended, only those rules could operate in their internal universe.</p><p></p><p>But now, in the view of all the twelfth-level aliens, the rules operating in the surrounding space-time could almost be described as vast as the sea, and the profundity of each rule made every twelfth-level alien unable to see its limits.</p><p></p><p>Especially the two pillar rules of time and space, which were so vast and mighty, like heavenly pillars supporting the universe. Even the twelfth-level aliens were like ants in front of these two 'heavenly pillars'.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way supreme being's internal universe?"</p><p></p><p>All the twelfth-level aliens' scalps tingled. They had never seen an internal universe with such complex rules operating. How many rules had been comprehended to achieve this?</p><p></p><p>And besides the infinite rules operating in support, the many twelfth-level aliens vaguely sensed that the fundamental nature of this internal universe was also unimaginably profound.</p><p></p><p>Even they found it difficult to traverse long distances through the void in this universe. In the main universe, a twelfth-level being could casually strike and tear open a permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>But here? Forget a permanent spatial rift, even just a spatial rift would require considerable effort from the twelfth-level aliens.</p><p></p><p>"The Milky Way supreme being's internal universe..."</p><p></p><p>Some twelfth-level aliens' throats went dry. They didn't know why, but they vaguely felt that this internal universe was even vaster and more boundless than the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Outside the home universe.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign and Snake Demon Sovereign, these two powerful Sovereigns, stared blankly at the distant universe, or more accurately, at the sight of that majestic giant taking large strides towards the outside of the universe despite countless calamities blocking the way.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Blood Blessing Sovereign's whole body was trembling. The scene before his eyes was too inconceivable. Wasn't it said that the life in the universe was at most at the peak Trailblazer realm? What was this colossal giant that reached to the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign was not sure what level of strength that majestic giant possessed, but he was certainly no match, far from being a match.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do, Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign's dozens of subordinates were originally stationed in arranged areas, just waiting for the twelfth-level life forms from inside the universe to escape, and then move in to intercept and suppress them.</p><p></p><p>They had done this many times before, basically without any mishaps. Even if they were very unlucky and encountered a peak Trailblazer realm being that was rare to see even in hundreds or thousands of universe eras, they had sufficient countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was at the peak Trailblazer realm, and they had been fighting in the chaos void for years. Their combat experience and fighting techniques were definitely superior to the peak Trailblazer realm beings inside the universe, absolutely.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>That majestic giant - were they supposed to take action against such an existence?</p><p></p><p>The minds of the dozens of peak Trailblazer realm subordinates trembled. Forget taking action, they didn't even dare to have such a thought.</p><p></p><p>The impact of the majestic giant on them was too great. If it weren't for Blood Blessing Sovereign's usually high prestige, these subordinates...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they probably would have scattered and fled directly.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign steadied himself and immediately transmitted an order: "Come back, all of you come back to me." At this moment, Blood Blessing Sovereign's only thought was to get away from this place, away from that towering giant.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of subordinates, as if granted amnesty, all rushed towards Blood Blessing Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Snake Demon Sovereign also immediately ordered his subordinates to retreat, while he himself drove the floating island to quickly escape.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Destruction Tribulation is divided into fire tribulation, thunder tribulation, wind tribulation, and water tribulation. These four tribulations don't represent basic rules, but the most core powers of the universe," Lin Yuan casually took a step towards the edge of the universe, "However, these tribulations are just ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Over the past three hundred years, Lin Yuan had used the endless resources sent from the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent to cultivate the "Xuanhuang Body" to the twelfth level of Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of physical strength, Lin Yuan was already very close to a Chaos Venerable. Combined with his internal universe comparable to a Chaos Venerable, as well as various innate divine abilities and other means.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the universe's origin consciousness which was rather rigid in its use of power, even a true Chaos Venerable would find it difficult to stop Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In an all-out battle, Lin Yuan might not be a match for a Chaos Venerable, but the opponent wouldn't be able to detain him either.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could step into the Sovereign realm, achieving another qualitative leap in his life essence, he might even be able to suppress ordinary Chaos Venerables.</p><p></p><p>If he could further cultivate "Infinite Void" to the second level, his overall combat power would probably approach that of a Chaos Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>With a splash, Lin Yuan took his final step, completely breaking free from the obstruction of the universe's origin consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Freedom."</p><p></p><p>A thought vaguely surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind. Within the universe, under its protection, even when exploring the chaos void in avatar form, there was still a sense of constraint.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had completely broken free from the universe, a sense of freedom immediately welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned around and glanced at the nearby universe.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had left the universe at the last moment, striving to absorb the breaking power for as long as possible, by the time he arrived in the chaos void, the universe's great destruction was basically in its final stages, with large areas of space collapsing and disintegrating.</p><p></p><p>"This universe will probably take more time to start its next cosmic era," Lin Yuan vaguely sensed the weakening of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>Having lost countless lives and powerful beings as driving force, after the great destruction, the universe's origin consciousness would have a greatly extended sleep time to gather enough energy to start a new cosmic era.</p><p></p><p>However, this didn't cause any harm to the universe itself. The universe was nurtured by the chaos void and protected by its rules. Even a peerless Great Saint couldn't cause any actual damage to the universe itself, at most they could only hasten the arrival of the great destruction.</p><p></p><p>The universe's great destruction was a disaster, an apocalypse for the beings within the universe.</p><p></p><p>But for the universe itself, it was as simple as "taking a nap" to rest.</p><p></p><p>It's just that because of Lin Yuan, his home universe's "nap" this time would be a bit longer.</p><p></p><p>Inside the home universe.</p><p></p><p>Infinite destructive forces filled the space, and an ordinary wooden house floated among them.</p><p></p><p>Any trace of destructive force was enough to annihilate a Sovereign realm powerhouse. The power unleashed by countless destructive forces stacked together had thoroughly reached the Chaos realm.</p><p></p><p>But all the destructive forces were silently neutralized and absorbed upon contact with this ordinary wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Milky Way's strongest left?"</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful, how did he cultivate such a huge true form?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that before his reincarnation, the Milky Way's strongest was a peerless Great Saint specializing in physical cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Two voices could be faintly heard conversing inside the wooden house. They belonged to the two Ultimates of the Tribulation Race.</p><p></p><p>"Even the most terrifying destruction tribulation couldn't shake the Milky Way's strongest, not even delay him. I even suspect that with the Milky Way's strongest's power, if he forcibly stayed in the universe, he could endure until the next cosmic era."</p><p></p><p>The voices in the wooden house were discussing, revealing deep incredulity.</p><p></p><p>Relying on physical body alone to resist endless great destruction tribulations, what concept was this?</p><p></p><p>"The universe is about to completely collapse, we should also enter dormancy," after chatting for a while, the two Tribulation Race Ultimates noticed the surrounding space getting smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's time to enter dormancy."</p><p></p><p>The other Tribulation Race Ultimate nodded. They had experienced more than one great destruction and were very familiar with what would happen next.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when we'll see the Milky Way's strongest again?"</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Race Ultimate who spoke first let his thoughts wander. He sighed and said, "I have a feeling that by the time we hear the Milky Way's strongest's name again, he might already be the Milky Way Great Saint, renowned throughout the chaos void?"</p><p></p><p>"Renowned throughout the chaos void?"</p><p></p><p>The other Tribulation Race Ultimate agreed. Ordinary Chaos Venerables, or even Chaos Great Saints, couldn't achieve this. To be renowned throughout the chaos void, only those peerless Great Saints could do it.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the universe about to completely collapse.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, an avatar of Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the universe collapsed, the area of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was also rapidly shrinking, finally maintaining only a few hundred meters in size.</p><p></p><p>Before the universe's great destruction arrived, Lin Yuan had specially left an avatar in this Xuanhuang Secret Realm, aiming to use it as a lifesaving measure.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm isolated causality and spacetime. Even if his true self completely perished in the chaos void, the avatar in the secret realm could revive using lifesaving methods.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, many treasures that couldn't be exposed were also here, such as that drop of 'Time Blood' and so on.</p><p></p><p>At present, Lin Yuan couldn't think of any place safer than the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Origin World? The safety of the Origin World was relative to the powerhouses in the chaos void, but the Origin World itself also had dangers, such as the various Marquises and Kings, as well as that Eternal Blazing Sun hanging high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Placing treasures in the Origin World would certainly prevent powerhouses from the chaos void from seizing them, even twelve-level time lifeforms were no exception, but the powerhouses inside the Origin World didn't have this restriction.</p><p></p><p>The 'Time Blood' formed by refining a miraculous lifeform that the Magic Jade Tower Master had hunted at the cost of endless effort, was a supreme treasure even in the Origin World, enough to make a group of King-level Celestial Venerables fight over it.</p><p></p><p>Placing the 'Time Blood' in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was not only safe, but it was also simple for Lin Yuan to retrieve it.</p><p></p><p>He only needed to control a being within the universe and have them throw the Time Blood into a permanent space rift.</p><p></p><p>The Time Blood was not a life form, so there were no restrictions on it leaving the universe.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I no longer have the concept of a home universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self stood outside the universe, quietly watching his home universe complete its final journey.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly sensed the breaking power accumulated during the universe's great destruction, and a smile immediately appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>One million four hundred and thirty-six thousand eight hundred and twelve strands of breaking power.</p><p></p><p>This was the total amount of breaking power Lin Yuan had gained from the start of the universe's great destruction until he entered the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>"So much."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was delighted. Possessing such a large amount of breaking power gave Lin Yuan great confidence. At least in the future, when using breaking power, he wouldn't need to be stingy or hesitant.</p><p></p><p>When he first traversed and descended to the Origin World, Lin Yuan had carefully considered whether to save the original Yuyan, spending a hundred strands of breaking power.</p><p></p><p>If it were now, there would naturally be no need to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems that being outside the universe doesn't allow one to absorb the breaking power from a collapsing universe?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Until leaving the universe, the breaking power was still rapidly increasing, but after completely stepping into the chaos void, the accumulation of breaking power suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that the current universe had not yet completely collapsed, theoretically there should still be breaking power dissipating, at most the amount would decrease, but it shouldn't completely disappear.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. If the prerequisite for greatly accumulating breaking power was to enter the universe? Replicating this prerequisite would be quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned his surroundings, his perception beginning to spread and expand, discovering two auras carefully speeding away in the distance, several million light-years away.</p><p></p><p>"Two little ones?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards those two auras carefully distancing themselves, which were a black ship and a floating island respectively.</p><p></p><p>The black ship and the floating island were both hundreds of thousands to millions of miles in size, vast and huge.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the current Lin Yuan, they were indeed just little ones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

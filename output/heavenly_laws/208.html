            <p>Chapter 208: The Lonely Alliance Leader Infiltrating the Enemy's Ranks (Happy New Year)</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree was extremely agitated. </p><p></p><p>It was frustrating to watch helplessly as the Demonic God Battlefield it had created gradually collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Primordial Demon Tree, recreating a new Demonic God Battlefield would require a huge price and thousands or tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was gone. </p><p></p><p>With the loss of the Demonic God Battlefield, coupled with the large amount of essence given to Lin Yuan, the current Primordial Demon Tree was like a gambler who had lost all his chips.</p><p></p><p>If it couldn't descend into the Tianqing World to make up for the losses, it would suffer a complete defeat this time, and it was unknown if it could ever recover in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, what happened?" Lin Yuan pretended to know nothing and asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the eyes of the Primordial Demon Tree, he was still struggling to survive in the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>Even with the large amount of essence sent by the Primordial Demon Tree, what kind of place was the Tianqing World?</p><p></p><p>As long as he dared to expose any traces, he would attract countless powerful beings to surround and attack him, and might even draw the attention of the Tianqing Alliance Leader who wielded the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has been greatly diminished, allowing your Tianqing Alliance Leader to take advantage of the situation. Now he has basically occupied the battlefield," the Primordial Demon Tree didn't elaborate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it asked directly, "I've given you so much essence over the years, why is your growth still so slow?"</p><p></p><p>It was very apparent that the Primordial Demon Tree was somewhat dissatisfied with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, the demonic essence it had invested in Lin Yuan was probably enough to create several sixth-stage demon trees.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were differences in the absorption of essence between different demon tree offshoots, with the worst aptitude, it should have grown to the fifth stage by now.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I'm too useless. I've been hunted down by Beast Kings several times, seriously injured to the point of near death, and could only use the essence bestowed by the Ancestor to heal," Lin Yuan had long prepared an answer and quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>This reason was flawless. In the Black Mist Mountains, there were a large number of ferocious beasts, fierce beasts, and even Beast Kings.</p><p></p><p>During Lin Yuan's growth, it was inevitable that he would be noticed, as the evil aura of a demon tree was difficult to conceal.</p><p></p><p>Encountering a sixth-stage Beast King, Lin Yuan still couldn't resist. Once entangled, it would attract more Beast Kings, and the situation would become even more dire.</p><p></p><p>So he could only be hunted.</p><p></p><p>"Using my essence to heal..." The Primordial Demon Tree's heart was bleeding. If Lin Yuan absorbed the essence to enhance himself, then that essence could still return after being devoured by it.</p><p></p><p>But using it to heal...</p><p></p><p>"But Ancestor, I have now grown to the peak of the fourth stage, just a little short of advancing to the fifth stage," Lin Yuan said again.</p><p></p><p>"Peak of the fourth stage?" The Primordial Demon Tree's mood improved slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was also the only good news it had heard so far.</p><p></p><p>"About how long will it take to grow to the fifth stage?" the Primordial Demon Tree inquired.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan grew to the fifth stage, his life essence would be strong enough to open up a stable spatial passage.</p><p></p><p>"It should be possible within five years," Lin Yuan thought for a moment before answering.</p><p></p><p>Five years was too short for a foreign life form like a demon tree.</p><p></p><p>"No, no." "Five years is too long."</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree shook its head.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't a matter of time, but rather based on the current situation on the Demonic God Battlefield. In five years, it was estimated that many powerful beings would return to the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>After all, the war had ended.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if Lin Yuan opened up a spatial passage, there would still be risks after it descended.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, I'll send you some more essence, and you forcibly break through, striving to grow to the fifth stage within a year."</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree examined itself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, its own essence was only 70% of its peak state. </p><p></p><p>Even so, it still painfully took out 20% of its essence and sent it all to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Demon Tree's view, Lin Yuan was its only hope. As long as Lin Yuan could grow to the fifth stage, even if not all of its investment could be recovered, at least most of it could be.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor... Ancestor, this is too much." Lin Yuan sensed the essence sent by the Primordial Demon Tree this time and was overjoyed in his heart, but his tone was somewhat concerned as he asked, "Ancestor suddenly losing so much essence, will there be any impact?"</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Demon Tree said with pain.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the impact was huge. A Primordial Demon Tree with only 50% essence, if it saw the Tianqing Alliance Leader wielding the World Sword now, it would probably run far away.</p><p></p><p>But as long as it could descend into the Tianqing World, everything would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Primordial Demon Tree was weaker, it was still a foreign evil god. As long as it could enter the world, it could use a certain secret technique and innate ability to merge into the vast ocean of the world's essence.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the essence of the entire Tianqing World would be its meal.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the use of the secret technique's innate ability required time, but the Primordial Demon Tree believed that it would definitely catch the many powerful beings of the Tianqing World off guard, and they wouldn't have time to stop it.</p><p></p><p>"Then rest assured, Ancestor, I will definitely complete the Ancestor's task," Lin Yuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the spatial passage is established, I will definitely reward you well," the Primordial Demon Tree didn't forget to 'make promises' even now.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan severed the connection with the Primordial Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"It should be very weak now," Lin Yuan secretly judged. The essence power bestowed by the Primordial Demon Tree just now was almost comparable to nearly half of what it had bestowed in the past combined.</p><p></p><p>Losing so much essence at once, even if Lin Yuan used his feet to think, he knew that the Primordial Demon Tree's condition was very poor.</p><p></p><p>It was just relying on him to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>The huge Demonic God Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader overlooked it. Without the Primordial Demon Tree's intervention, the Demonic God Battlefield quickly collapsed more than half, and finally turned to ashes completely. </p><p></p><p>"We won."</p><p></p><p>"We finally won."</p><p></p><p>"We defeated the foreign evil god."</p><p></p><p>"We protected our homeland world."</p><p></p><p>Four hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The war that lasted for a full four hundred years had finally come to an end.</p><p></p><p>"Duan Lang, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go home, back to where we used to live."</p><p></p><p>Ayan beside him said in a delighted tone.</p><p></p><p>"Go home..."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Demonic God Battlefield has been destroyed,"</p><p></p><p>"That foreign evil god is still alive."</p><p></p><p>"I must leave the World Sword here to prevent that evil god from making a comeback."</p><p></p><p>The Tianqing Alliance Leader said somewhat reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>As the user of the World Sword, the Tianqing Alliance Leader was too clear about the power of this weapon.</p><p></p><p>Normally, such a weapon shouldn't have appeared at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if it emerged, it had a huge impact on the world consciousness of the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>But the threat of the foreign evil god to the Tianqing World was too great.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Tianqing Alliance Leader became the user of the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>Without the World Sword, the Tianqing Alliance Leader would have little resistance against that foreign evil god.</p><p></p><p>But relying on the World Sword, he was able to fight back and forth with the Primordial Demon Tree. </p><p></p><p>"Leaving the World Sword here?"</p><p></p><p>Ayan was stunned and looked at the Tianqing Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"The World Sword is the condensed form of the Heavenly Dao's consciousness. Only by placing it here can we block all the means of that foreign evil god."</p><p></p><p>"Ayan, you and the others retreat back into the world first. After I secure the World Sword, I will join you."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>Ayan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then she turned and left.</p><p></p><p>After Ayan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance looked at the floating World Sword in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Old partner, we have to part ways."</p><p></p><p>"But as soon as you detect any abnormalities, you must inform me promptly."</p><p></p><p>Although he could not keep the World Sword by his side, after so many years together, the leader of the Tianqing Alliance had already refined a part of the World Sword.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was willing, he could sense the World Sword at any time and even summon it back.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The World Sword turned into a beam of light, imprinted outside the world.</p><p></p><p>"I should go back too."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance sighed.</p><p></p><p>He also flew towards the Tianqing World.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the edge of the Tianqing World, twelve vice alliance leaders, four holy beast kings, thirty-three protectors, one hundred and fifty-six elders, and ninety-three demon beast kings were all standing there.</p><p></p><p>They were all waiting for him with full anticipation and excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone..."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance suddenly felt a surge of emotions, "Let's go home together."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance led his subordinates, riding on the golden light path, flying towards the depths of the world.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, countless living beings in the Tianqing World were worshipping them. As the legendary figures who saved a world, the leader of the Tianqing Alliance really enjoyed this feeling.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was passing by the Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>This vice alliance leader was a 7th stage powerhouse, specializing in scouting techniques. In the past 400 years of war, if it weren't for his multiple actions to locate the position of the foreign evil god, the casualties would have been much more severe.</p><p></p><p>"Black Mist Mountain Range..."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance looked down.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what exactly is down there."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance sneered coldly, showing no fear.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancestral Demon Tree, the foreign evil god, was repelled by him. Some strange aura within the world was nothing.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for passing by coincidentally, plus the vice alliance leader he valued discovered this aura.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance probably wouldn't even spare an extra glance.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"We listen to the alliance leader."</p><p></p><p>"What dogshit aura, how dare it leak when we pass by, it deserves to die."</p><p></p><p>The many powerhouses echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go down together."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance nodded, then led a group of subordinates flying towards the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>According to that vice alliance leader just now, the location of the abnormal aura was right at the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As they got closer and closer to the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range, the leader of the Tianqing Alliance frowned more and more.</p><p></p><p>Because he vaguely felt that the aura at the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range was a bit strange, even similar to the aura of that foreign evil god.</p><p></p><p>This was a big deal.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The originally relaxed look disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance also instructed his many subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance brought his subordinates to the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>This was a valley, surrounded by a faint evil and ancient aura.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the valley stood an ancient tree, with countless black vines hanging down.</p><p></p><p>"Foreign evil god?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had dealt with the Ancestral Demon Tree for many years and immediately recognized that the ancient tree in front of him was exceptionally similar to the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a foreign evil god."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>He was very familiar with the Ancestral Demon Tree. It was precisely because of this that he confirmed that the ancient tree in front of him was not that brutal and violent foreign evil god.</p><p></p><p>"It's an offshoot of the foreign evil god..."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that the oversight from a hundred or two hundred years ago would allow you to survive until now?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance immediately breathed a sigh of relief, and a hint of killing intent appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred years ago, the Ancestral Demon Tree paid a heavy price to pry open the world barrier of the Tianqing World and scattered hundreds of thousands of demon seeds into the world.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance also knew about this matter and even had people focus on dealing with it, striving to eliminate all the demon seeds.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, a demon seed still survived and grew to this extent.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the leader of the Tianqing Alliance sorted out the causes and consequences.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that even your ancestor was repelled by me, what are you..."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance was cold-hearted, staring at the swaying ancient tree in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in his eyes, Lin Yuan was doomed. Leading so many powerhouses, plus himself, a peak 7th stage existence, even if it was the real Ancestral Demon Tree, it could still resist for a while.</p><p></p><p>As for an insignificant offshoot demon tree?</p><p></p><p>"Vice Alliance Leader Fang, you make the move and personally eliminate this remnant of the evil god."</p><p></p><p>Vice Alliance Leader Fang was the alliance leader who discovered the abnormal aura in the Black Mist Mountain Range just now. With 7th stage strength, he was naturally far from enough to confront the Ancestral Demon Tree.</p><p></p><p>But it was just a trivial offshoot...</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the leader of the Tianqing Alliance, there would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"Make a move?"</p><p></p><p>Vice Alliance Leader Fang was silent for a while. He looked at the leader of the Tianqing Alliance, then at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, under the incredulous gaze of the leader of the Tianqing Alliance, Vice Alliance Leader Fang bowed slightly towards Lin Yuan and said, "Master, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>The entire scene was instantly plunged into a strange atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The pupils of the leader of the Tianqing Alliance suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that his most trusted subordinate would actually call an evil god's remnant "master"?</p><p></p><p>"Fang Zhengqing, how dare you?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance was furious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his thoughts were rapidly fluctuating, and the scenes that happened along the way flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zhengqing discovered the abnormal aura at the deepest part of the Black Mist Mountain Range, then led them, a group of people, to this place. Finally, Fang Zhengqing called that evil god's remnant "master".</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>Fang Zhengqing leading them here was premeditated.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone retreat."</p><p></p><p>"There's an ambush!!!"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance deduced everything, his expression greatly changed, and he was about to let the other subordinates stay away from this place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Ayan, who was standing behind the leader of the Tianqing Alliance, his confidante, gently raised her right hand and pressed it on the back of the leader of the Tianqing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance's expression greatly changed.</p><p></p><p>His aura was visibly weakening at a rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance abruptly turned around and looked at Ayan, "Ayan, you?"</p><p></p><p>He never dreamed that his beloved woman would give him such a fatal blow.</p><p></p><p>"Ayan can't be trusted either."</p><p></p><p>"You guys hurry..."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance forcibly suppressed his injuries, wanting to soar into the sky and escape with the rest of his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The many subordinates protected by the leader of the Tianqing Alliance took a step forward in unison, turned around and surrounded the leader of the Tianqing Alliance, condensing their aura and suppressing downward.</p><p></p><p>"You too?"</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Tianqing Alliance looked at his many subordinates, and a brief confusion and shock appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>As well as an overwhelming sense of unfamiliarity.</p>

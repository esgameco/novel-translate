            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 459 Ninety Years (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan, why is everyone now saying that the Galactic Overlord is the most powerful being in the entire universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Shou Cheng couldn't help but ask, "Is this Galactic Overlord you, Xiao Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's ascension to the Eighth Realm and becoming the Galactic Overlord was naturally known to Lin Shou Cheng.</p><p></p><p>But now, the rumors and discussions about the Galactic Overlord outside were simply too much.</p><p></p><p>It even made Lin Shou Cheng somewhat lacking in self-confidence, as the descriptions of the Galactic Overlord in those rumors were so incredible, such as single-handedly wiping out the forces of other peak civilizations at the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Was this really something his son could accomplish?</p><p></p><p>The Insect Queen Mother was an existence that rivaled the human pinnacle experts.</p><p></p><p>"It should be me," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>His parents had never been too concerned about the major events on the internet, but his actions on the super-large battlefield were so incredible that the news was not only spreading crazily among human civilization, but also among other races.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that it was too legendary.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you are too amazing," Lin Yi beside him said with great admiration.</p><p></p><p>Compared to her parents, Lin Yi had a deeper understanding of this matter, which was clearly reflected in the fact that even the Eleventh Realm elder of the Xia family had started to treat her with extreme courtesy.</p><p></p><p>After all, when she had just married into the Xia family, Lin Yi had barely seen that Eleventh Realm elder of the Xia family a few times.</p><p></p><p>As the top family of human civilization, the Xia family was too large, and if she wasn't the sister of the Galactic Overlord, Lin Yi estimated that she wouldn't even be able to live on the Xia family's main star.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In just this period of time, the Eleventh Realm elder of the Xia family had summoned Lin Yi dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>Although not explicitly stated, the words and actions of that Eleventh Realm elder were all about the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that even the Myriad Transformation Queen Mother didn't dare to trouble your brother," Lin Yi said, having heard more rumors than Lin Shou Cheng's couple.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Transformation Queen Mother." Lin Yuan glanced at Lin Yi. "The Queen Mother didn't trouble me because I have a human pinnacle expert."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had reached the pinnacle of the Eleventh Realm, he estimated that many of the current Twelfth Realm ultimates would be crushed by him.</p><p></p><p>But to say that the Myriad Transformation Queen Mother didn't dare to trouble him was a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very clear about the gap between himself and the Twelfth Realm ultimates. Although his rule comprehension, spiritual will, and other aspects had entered the Twelfth Realm realm, compared to the true ultimates, he was still like a vast chasm.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>"If I cultivate the 'Mysterious Yellow Body' to the Eleventh Realm perfection, with my physical body on par with the Twelfth Realm, along with my rule comprehension, spiritual will, the gap with the ultimates will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was calmly thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>With all three aspects at the Twelfth Realm realm, Lin Yuan could be considered a slightly smaller Twelfth Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan didn't have much confidence in his physical body reaching the Twelfth Realm realm.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the resources required for the "Mysterious Yellow Body" were too exaggerated, but the more than 600 pinnacle weapons had temporarily relieved Lin Yuan of any resource worries.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the 11 peak civilizations were willing to pay a premium to get back their pinnacle weapons, allowing Lin Yuan to earn abundantly.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the tens of thousands of Eleventh Realm aliens he had killed, their physical, spiritual, and essence energies could also drive the cultivation of Lin Yuan's "Mysterious Yellow Body".</p><p></p><p>"So far, the prices offered by those peak civilizations should still be able to be raised further," Lin Yuan thought about the many Twelfth Realm ultimates that Xia Qin's pinnacle expert had brought.</p><p></p><p>After all, Twelfth Realm weapons were 'hard currency', their value more stable than even universe crystals, and Lin Yuan was not worried about not being able to sell them.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan, is that battlefield still dangerous now?" Mother Lu Qiong asked beside him, as she was more concerned about Lin Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, when Lin Yuan had mentioned entering the super-large battlefield, Lu Qiong had never imagined that there would be so many strong experts there, tens of thousands at the Eleventh Realm?</p><p></p><p>"It's not that dangerous now," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Most of those alien experts have already withdrawn."</p><p></p><p>"The battlefield now only has our human evolutions left."</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the constraints of the war rules, which required occupying the Victory Altar for a hundred years, the human civilization's evolutions could have already withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>But even following the rules, there was no problem, a hundred years was just ninety years left, counting the ten years that had already passed.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lu Qiong let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"After this battlefield matter is over, I plan to return to Cang Lan Star for a visit," Lin Yuan said, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>With the end of the super-large war and human civilization gaining the dominant position, Lin Yuan no longer had much to do, his main task being to prepare for the assault on the Twelfth Realm, and he estimated he would make the eleventh trip through the portal.</p><p></p><p>During that time, he would return to Cang Lan Star, the star he had lived on when he was weak, which would also help make his own state of mind more complete.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll quickly go tell Administrator Sung Wu Yang about this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Shou Cheng's eyes lit up, as Sung Wu Yang the Administrator had asked him more than once, and if the Galactic Overlord returned to Cang Lan Star, he must go through him to make the proper arrangements to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"This matter doesn't need to be spread outside," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Shou Cheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Next, Lin Yuan chatted with his parents and family members for a while, then disconnected from the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Prime.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, glancing at the direction of the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Although the super-large-scale war has not yet ended, it has basically taken shape, with many peak ethnic group forces withdrawing, and it will naturally end after a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many meritorious points I have gained from this super-large-scale war."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a somewhat expectant expression, as the human civilization had deliberately lowered the difficulty of obtaining meritorious points to motivate many 11th-stage evolved beings to go to the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>On the super-large-scale battlefield, Lin Yuan had killed tens of thousands of 11th-stage alien clones, and the sheer number made up for it.</p><p></p><p>This alone was a huge amount of meritorious points.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan influenced the situation of the entire super-large-scale alien battlefield, leading the human civilization to gain the dominance of the war, all of which could be judged by a large amount of meritorious points.</p><p></p><p>"Upgrading from a 9th-level citizen to a 10th-level citizen requires 50 billion meritorious points. After this war ends, I estimate that I will have enough meritorious points."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, and according to his estimate, this super-large-scale war would have brought him over 50 billion meritorious points, with the exact value needing to be calculated by the three goddesses.</p><p></p><p>"10th-level citizen."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>In the 2 million years of galactic history, the human civilization has not yet produced a single 10th-level citizen. The existing 10th-level citizens were all citizens who had made great contributions during the long dormant years of the human civilization before the galactic era.</p><p></p><p>Super-large-scale Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still sitting in the depths of the altar.</p><p></p><p>【Your innate talent is extraordinary, observing the spatio-temporal structure of the war, and your understanding of space-time is gradually improving.】</p><p></p><p>Many enlightened insights surged in Lin Yuan's mind, and his understanding in the field of space-time was rapidly improving.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This spatio-temporal imprint is from that 12th-stage ultimate being of the Jie Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to analyze the super-large-scale battlefield, and the methods of the various peak ethnic group 12th-stage ultimate beings were constantly revealed. By observing and comprehending the super-large-scale battlefield, Lin Yuan began to have a certain understanding of those 12th-stage ultimate beings of the major peak ethnic groups.</p><p></p><p>For example, the ancestors of the Tianyu Clan were filled with endless light, but there was also profound darkness hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"The Jie Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed the traces left by the Jie Clan's ultimate being, which were vaguely related to the repulsion of the cosmic starry sky, but also integrated into it, giving Lin Yuan a feeling similar to the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Jie Clan is not simple."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The 12th-stage ultimate beings in the universe were not clear about the specific difficulty of surviving from the previous cosmic era to the next.</p><p></p><p>But as the master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Lin Yuan knew what this meant.</p><p></p><p>If the Jie Clan really came from the previous cosmic era and crossed the great calamity of the universe with the entire clan, the true origin of this clan would be deeply thought-provoking.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Prime.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was cultivating and comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>After entering the 11th stage, Lin Yuan's understanding of the rules had once again entered a period of rapid advancement, and many pillar-level fused rules had entered the 12th stage realm.</p><p></p><p>"The 11th Stage of the Martial Dao"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan frowned and pondered, allocating part of his energy to perfecting the 11th Stage of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The 11th Stage of the Martial Dao was the last stage before the breakthrough to the ultimate, so it was very important. After all, the next step would be the 12th stage ultimate.</p><p></p><p>It could also be said that it was not important, because as long as a martial cultivator completed the journey from the 1st stage to the 10th stage, the 11th stage would be a natural progression.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was carefully refining the 11th Stage of the Martial Dao,</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>Disappeared from the Star Master's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Milky Way Prime, the figure of Nalan Deputy Tower Master appeared.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, Lin Yuan also appeared in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Master." Nalan Deputy Tower Master greeted Lin Yuan with slight reverence.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be so formal between us." Lin Yuan waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>"But there should still be some rules." Nalan Deputy Tower Master immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"I've come to bring the first batch of resources from those peak ethnic groups to the Milky Way Star Master." Nalan Deputy Tower Master took out a spatial ring and handed it to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The first batch of resources?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>During the negotiations with those 12th-stage ultimate beings of the peak ethnic groups, the two sides had basically reached an agreement on some of the most powerful weapons, and Lin Yuan could return the weapons as soon as the resources arrived.</p><p></p><p>"It must have been tiring to make the trip."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at Nalan Deputy Tower Master and said.</p><p></p><p>The specific details of the transaction were definitely handled by the people from the Summer Dusk Evolution Tower.</p><p></p><p>Returned to the Star Master's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to count the numerous resources in the spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>The space inside the ring was a world of thousands of millions of miles, filled with densely packed resources, all of which could promote the cultivation of the "Xuanhuang Physique".</p><p></p><p>"With this batch of resources..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was joyful, and he immediately began to devour the cultivation resources in the ring, absorbing them through the cultivation method of the "Xuanhuang Physique".</p><p></p><p>In this way,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's main focus was on comprehending various rules and perfecting the 11th Stage of the Martial Dao. The remaining energy was spent on cultivating the "Xuanhuang Physique" and other secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, ninety years had passed.</p>

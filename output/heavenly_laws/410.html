            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Above the vast canopy of the sky.</p><p></p><p>Two incomparably enormous outer demons, with half their bodies already squeezed into the realm outside the Azure World. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were both somewhat trembling. As demons that fed on worlds, their senses were exceptionally keen.</p><p></p><p>But now they had a sense of impending catastrophic death threat.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that they withdrew without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had already stepped halfway into the world, forcibly retreating would lead to a direct collision between themselves and the world's barrier.</p><p></p><p>Causing minor injuries, but they did not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>"That demonic tree actually still had such a terrifying trump card hidden?"</p><p></p><p>The two outer demons were equally perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Even without confirming the nature of that threat, but as long as it came from within the Azure World, they knew it must be related to the Primordial Demonic Tree without needing to think about it.</p><p></p><p>And this made the two outer demons even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>If the Primordial Demonic Tree had such a powerful trump card, why not use it earlier? </p><p></p><p>Why wait until now, when even the Azure World's barrier had been torn apart?</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Numerous outer demons were also paying attention to the invaded Azure World.</p><p></p><p>In just a few tens of thousands of years, the Azure World's source had soared tenfold, naturally making many outer demons covetous.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the Azure World had already caught the eye of the Black Demon Palace's Lord.</p><p></p><p>And the Black Demon Palace Lord, over a hundred thousand years ago in a secret void realm, had gained an important opportunity.</p><p></p><p>His strength had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>He had already become the strongest demon in this region.</p><p></p><p>Since the Black Demon Palace Lord had set his sights on the Azure World, these demons, no matter how envious, did not dare intervene.</p><p></p><p>"It's unknown what secrets lie within that world."</p><p></p><p>"That demonic guy, not even listening to the Black Demon Palace Lord's orders, insisting on staying in the world, now look what's happened."</p><p></p><p>The outer demons mocked from afar, especially when they saw the two demons guarding outside the world were about to descend with their true forms, as if they had seen the end of that Demonic Tree.</p><p></p><p>However, not long after, some outer demons noticed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Why are 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' fleeing outwards?"</p><p></p><p>'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' were under the command of the Black Demon Palace Lord, tasked with taking over the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Originally when the demons saw 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' about to descend into the world with their true forms, they thought the situation was settled.</p><p></p><p>But now, they saw 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles', who were desperately trying to squeeze into the world, fleeing outwards as if facing some ancient beast, desperately retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, what variable has occurred?"</p><p></p><p>"Does that Demonic Tree still have some trump card?"  </p><p></p><p>"Indeed, for a world's source to soar tenfold, there must be some secret."</p><p></p><p>Most of the outer demons, though mad, were not stupid and had normal thinking abilities, immediately guessing the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Let's watch."</p><p></p><p>"Right, we'll just watch."</p><p></p><p>The outer demons were unconcerned, fearing the Black Demon Palace Lord, but also happy to see 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' suffer a setback.</p><p></p><p>Since it didn't concern them, if the invasion encountered an unexpected variable, the demons were content to just watch the show.</p><p></p><p>Within the Azure World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure hovered in the air, and within his gaze, the endless demonic puppets turned to dust and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>These demonic puppets were formed from the demons' power. Just as demons could devour worlds, worlds could also devour demons.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to demons with independent consciousness, the world consciousness could not directly retaliate.</p><p></p><p>It could only indirectly resist through manifesting 'Children of the World' and 'Children of Fate'.</p><p></p><p>But now, under Lin Yuan's control, after all the demonic puppets were annihilated, the remnant power was fully devoured by the world's source.</p><p></p><p>"This fleshly body..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly. The fleshly body he was possessing was nourished and condensed from the Azure World's boundless source.</p><p></p><p>Not only was its foundation unfathomably profound, within the world, it could command all power.</p><p></p><p>"Want to leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the two outer demons desperately trying to squeeze out, and with a thought, the Azure World's force manifested as sharp spatial blades, directly slicing towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The first to be hit was 'Myriad Tentacles'. Having squeezed more than half its body into the world, if sliced in two, only the smaller half outside could escape.</p><p></p><p>Although this injury would not be fatal for an outer demon, it was unknown how long it would take to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Lord, lend your power."</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' unhesitatingly took out a statue - a monster with eighteen arms, its mere statue form exuding an aura that could drive countless beings into madness and depravity.</p><p></p><p>This was the trump card bestowed by the Black Demon Palace Lord, which could only be used three times.</p><p></p><p>Having already used it once when invading the Azure World, two chances remained.</p><p></p><p>Given the Black Demon Palace Lord's character, once bestowed, he would not take it back.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as they took over the Azure World with minimal cost, this statue would be theirs.</p><p></p><p>According to 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles' plan, they would at most activate the statue once, keeping the remaining two chances for future critical moments.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' sensed immense dread, naturally not daring to hold back at all.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the Black Demon Palace Lord's power?"</p><p></p><p>After fully receiving the Primordial Demonic Tree's memories, Lin Yuan naturally recognized it.</p><p></p><p>It was by relying on this statue that these two outer demons could severely injure the Primordial Demonic Tree, even tearing apart the Azure World's barrier to ravage the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."  </p><p></p><p>"Probably close to the tenth stage of power."</p><p></p><p>Through the statue, Lin Yuan roughly gauged the Black Demon Palace Lord's strength.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that tens of millions of years ago, during the Primordial Demonic Tree's prime, it was only at the seventh stage. For the Black Demon Palace Lord to have nearly tenth stage power, no wonder he could awe the other demons.</p><p></p><p>But to the current Lin Yuan, it was naturally far from enough to take seriously.</p><p></p><p>In terms of life stage, Lin Yuan was also at the ninth stage peak.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan's ninth stage peak was completely different from a normal ninth stage peak. When necessary, he could even unleash eleventh stage power.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan was not facing the Black Demon Palace Lord's true form, but merely a statue formed from his power.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Black mist emanated from the statue before 'Myriad Tentacles'.</p><p></p><p>The boundless black mist rapidly enveloped an area of tens of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"Break."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the void. Compared to the two enormous outer demons, he seemed insignificant as a speck of dust. But as he raised his right hand and pointed with his index finger, the terrifying statue's boundless black mist rapidly dissipated. Even the statue itself shook, cracks spreading across its surface before it fell.</p><p></p><p>Without the statue's protection,</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' was exposed again.</p><p></p><p>"This? The power statue bestowed by the Lord, directly shattered? I still had one activation chance left unused."</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' could not believe it. The Black Demon Palace Lord's strength was unquestionable, and the power statue he left behind could sweep aside many outer demons.</p><p></p><p>But now, the statue it had pinned its hopes on was as fragile as paper.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, space rippled, and the statue appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't held back, that previous strike could have pulverized this statue. But Lin Yuan wanted to borrow this statue to get a glimpse of the Black Demon Palace Lord.</p><p></p><p>Not because he took the Black Demon Palace Lord seriously, but he was quite curious about the various abilities, talents, and inherent nature possessed by a demon of such a level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules of cause and effect, he could easily lock onto the Black Demon Palace Lord's specific location through this statue.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was 'Demon Eye' or 'Myriad Tentacles',</p><p></p><p>they were both acting on the Black Demon Palace Lord's orders to invade the Azure World. Lin Yuan would not let the mastermind behind the scenes go.</p><p></p><p>Shua shua.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the statue, Lin Yuan looked towards the stunned 'Myriad Tentacles' and pointed with one finger again.</p><p></p><p>Shua shua.</p><p></p><p>Without the statue's protection, 'Myriad Tentacles' was completely exposed to the might of Lin Yuan's finger strike. In an instant, nine-tenths of 'Myriad Tentacles' body evaporated, the terrifying power advancing to suppress its core.</p><p></p><p>"How are you so strong?"</p><p></p><p>'Myriad Tentacles' trembled inwardly. With each movement, it had completely lost the ability to resist. This level of strength, this level of strength even the Black Demon Palace Lord...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Sect Master, is that all there is to it? </p><p></p><p>Even in the eyes of the 'Myriad Tentacles', the powerful Black Magic Sect Master seemed somewhat inferior compared to Lin Yuan at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>An existence like the Black Magic Sect Master, could it be created just like that? Weren't they all forged through devouring countless worlds, and even myriad foreign demonic gods?</p><p></p><p>But before the 'Myriad Tentacles' could react, its core was suppressed, its consciousness quickly fell into slumber, and it ended up in Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the core of that demonic god?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the misty form in front of him, observing it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"I'll study it later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately stored away the mist.</p><p></p><p>He didn't kill the 'Myriad Tentacles' because he wanted to thoroughly study this foreign demonic god.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan lacked the strength to replace even a primordial demonic tree, which took him a great deal of effort. Now that he had descended into the Boundless Void again, he naturally wouldn't miss this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, Lin Yuan studied the physical constructs, spiritual essences, and especially the innate abilities of powerful beings from various races.</p><p></p><p>Under many conditions, Lin Yuan was able to develop the most complete tenth stage of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>And in the Boundless Void, those foreign demonic gods that devoured worlds as food were no less significant to Lin Yuan than the special lifeforms in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>These foreign demonic gods possessed all kinds of bizarre abilities, which would likely greatly benefit Lin Yuan's comprehension of the fusion rules in this Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>On this descent, Lin Yuan had two goals.</p><p></p><p>One was to comprehend as many fusion rules as possible, especially the fifth realm of space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>The second was to explore the Boundless Void and those foreign demonic gods.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan captured the 'Myriad Tentacles' alive for the sake of the second goal.</p><p></p><p>The Black Magic Sect Master's statue was struck down, and immediately after, the 'Myriad Tentacles' was suppressed and fell into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to take a long time, but in reality, it was exceptionally brief, lasting no more than a single breath.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the massive eyeball 'Demon Eye' was completely stunned, a true sense of fear welling up within it.</p><p></p><p>The 'Myriad Tentacles', whose strength was on the same level as its own, was gone just like that? Even the statue bestowed by the Sect Master failed to stop it.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't such a powerful being reveal itself earlier?"</p><p></p><p>The massive eyeball 'Demon Eye' suddenly felt a sense of grievance.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it thought taking over the Azure Heaven World would be an easy task, especially with the power of the statue bestowed by the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>If it didn't want to expend too much effort, the Azure Heaven World would have been in their hands long ago.</p><p></p><p>But now, this inconceivable existence named Lin Yuan had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Run."</p><p></p><p>The massive eyeball 'Demon Eye' sensed that the tiny figure who had subdued the 'Myriad Tentacles' was slowly turning its gaze towards it, and its scalp immediately went numb.</p><p></p><p>"Sever it."</p><p></p><p>The massive eyeball 'Demon Eye' unhesitatingly abandoned the part of its body that was inside the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>It transferred its consciousness entirely to the remaining body outside the world, then frantically fled into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning half its body was certainly a tragic cost, and it didn't know how long it would take to recover.</p><p></p><p>But following the precedent of the 'Myriad Tentacles', if 'Demon Eye' didn't do this, it estimated its entire body would be left behind.</p><p></p><p>Escaping with half its body was far better than complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>From start to finish, the massive eyeball 'Demon Eye' never considered resisting or fighting to the death.</p><p></p><p>It was completely meaningless. Didn't the 'Myriad Tentacles' resist?</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>Many foreign demonic gods were watching the situation in the Azure Heaven World with the attitude of spectators.</p><p></p><p>However, when they saw the 'Myriad Tentacles' massive body rapidly disintegrate, its most primordial power devoured by the Azure Heaven World, and its aura almost disappear, they widened their eyes in shock.</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>What was going on with the 'Myriad Tentacles'?</p><p></p><p>Had it fallen?</p><p></p><p>Or was it suppressed?</p><p></p><p>The many foreign demonic gods did enjoy seeing variables occur in the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, they never expected such an extreme, such an exaggerated variable.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the foreign demonic gods, so-called variables were just obstacles that would make things difficult for 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles', forcing them to pay a greater price to take over the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>As for being killed in return or suppressed, no demonic god dared to think that.</p><p></p><p>Because the possibility was too low.</p><p></p><p>The 'Myriad Tentacles' and 'Demon Eye' were two foreign demonic gods holding trump cards bestowed by the Black Magic Sect Master. Who could kill them in return? Who could suppress them?</p><p></p><p>"Demon Eye?"</p><p></p><p>The obliteration of the 'Myriad Tentacles' startled the many foreign demonic gods, and they quickly turned their gaze towards the 'Demon Eye' not far away.</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all the foreign demonic gods, the half-body of 'Demon Eye' trapped inside the world unhesitatingly abandoned that half, and the remaining half of the massive eyeball fled like a stray dog, frantically escaping from the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>Before the many foreign demonic gods could react, a giant hand stretched out from within the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>The hand spanned millions of miles and easily captured the fleeing 'half eyeball', then swiftly pulled it back into the Azure Heaven World.</p><p></p><p>Puff, puff, puff.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the two massive cracks on the Azure Heaven World's barrier rapidly healed and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>All the observing foreign demonic gods fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined such a reversal could occur.</p><p></p><p>Within the Azure Heaven World, there was a mysterious existence that single-handedly suppressed the 'Myriad Tentacles' and 'Demon Eye' - two foreign demonic gods holding trump cards bestowed by the Black Magic Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Especially that final scene they witnessed - the 'Demon Eye', which had abandoned half its body thinking it could escape with its life, had not even had a chance to catch its breath before that boundless giant hand ruthlessly dragged it back.</p><p></p><p>"What... what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"What existence is inside that world?"</p><p></p><p>The foreign demonic gods trembled, gazing at the Azure Heaven World with a shudder of horror.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of such foreign demonic gods, any world was a delicacy, food to be devoured. But now, the Azure Heaven World made their scalps go numb, making them wish they could immediately flee far away.</p><p></p><p>"All troubles have been resolved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually suppressed the 'Demon Eye' and stored it away, then observed the Azure Heaven World again to ensure there were no 'fish slipping through the net'.</p><p></p><p>After confirming several times, Lin Yuan turned and returned to the Canopy Continent, back to the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess Qing Yao immediately respectfully bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Situated at the highest point of the Azure Heaven World, the High Priestess Qing Yao had witnessed the entire scene clearly. The two incomparably formidable foreign demonic gods were like chickens awaiting slaughter before Lin Yuan, unable to even resist before being easily suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This scene shook Qing Yao's soul. Only then did she realize the true nature of the Martial Ancestor worshipped day and night by the denizens of the Azure Heaven World for tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>"I need to seclude myself for a while. Do not disturb me unless there is an urgent matter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said briefly, then directly entered the Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The great doors of the hall slowly closed.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>The High Priestess Qing Yao's voice trembled, then she turned to gaze down at the countless martial cultivators and living beings, murmuring to herself, "We have survived."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Hall, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Before him floated two misty forms - the life cores of 'Demon Eye' and 'Myriad Tentacles'.</p><p></p><p>"These two demonic gods..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spiritual will was immensely powerful, easily refining these two life cores and gaining complete access to all their memories.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was 'Demon Eye' or 'Myriad Tentacles', most of their memories consisted of rampant, frenzied states - roaming the Boundless Void, battling and devouring other foreign demonic gods, discovering worlds and attempting to invade and devour them.</p><p></p><p>Until they encountered the Black Magic Sect Master and realized they were powerless to resist, so they chose to submit.</p><p></p><p>"Their powers are somewhat interesting, though."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan studied them carefully.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative as he stored the two misty forms away again.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, although this fleshly body of mine is innately powerful, with profound foundations and perfectly compatible with the Martial Dao, it has not embarked on the path of martial evolution?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>It was like a person born with divine power but never learned any martial arts or techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the path of martial evolution with this fleshly body would surely allow me to deeply explore its potential once more and even give birth to a fifth bodily divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes shone with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

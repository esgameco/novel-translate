        <h1>Chapter 480</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 480 Source World (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Myriad Realms stood majestic and grand, towering in the deepest recesses of Lin Yuan's mind, seemingly unchanging and eternally existent.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just a projection of the true Gate of the Myriad Realms, it gave Lin Yuan a sense of transcendence far beyond the Twelfth Realm, as if even the mighty Xuan Emperor and the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master were but dust before it.</p><p></p><p>This was not a comparison of physical size, but a deeper, more fundamental contrast.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's previous speculation that the Gate of the Myriad Realms was a treasure of the Perfect Time-Life Realm was based on this.</p><p></p><p>"Now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was grave as he carefully observed the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>After his Temporal and Spatial Enlightenment reached the Seventh Realm, the space and time he perceived was completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>And now, the feeling Lin Yuan got from the Gate of the Myriad Realms had also changed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not that the Gate of the Myriad Realms had changed, for it had remained the same since the beginning. It was just that Lin Yuan's realm had risen, allowing him to see more of the essential information of the Gate of the Myriad Realms, which gave him the impression that it had changed.</p><p></p><p>"New world coordinates have appeared?" Lin Yuan thought to himself, as dozens of world coordinates were faintly emerging from the depths of the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, there were thirty-three world coordinates.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-three world coordinates seemed to have been engraved in the Gate of the Myriad Realms long ago, only now being noticed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-three worlds?" Lin Yuan observed carefully, and soon received information about these thirty-three worlds.</p><p></p><p>"These thirty-three worlds, are they all Source Worlds? Thirty-three Source Worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful. The information about these thirty-three Source Worlds was not abundant, and it was possible that his realm was still not high enough to perceive more.</p><p></p><p>"Source Worlds? What realm of worlds are those?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious. For world coordinates to be engraved in the deepest part of the Gate of the Myriad Realms, they were clearly not simple - at least the Main Universe or even the Chaotic Void did not have the ability to engrave their own coordinates in the depths of the Gate.</p><p></p><p>"But this is good news for me."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. At his current realm, he was only one step away from the Twelfth Realm, and the world options he could traverse and descend upon were already very few.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad realms and endless dimensional planes, there were countless worlds, but the vast majority were low or middle-level worlds. Worlds of the Immortal Realm or Main Universe level were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Once he traversed through the Gate of the Myriad Realms and descended upon a low-level world, Lin Yuan would find it very difficult to adapt. The restrictions of low-level worlds were great, and he might not even be able to cultivate to the realm of Condensing Flesh Spiritual Abilities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Flesh Spiritual Abilities originated from bloodlines, and the Flesh Spiritual Abilities of low-level worlds, even if cultivated, would be far inferior to the top-tier ones like "Rending the Heavens" and "World".</p><p></p><p>This was why Lin Yuan had not engaged in large-scale blind and random traversals.</p><p></p><p>A hundred or a thousand random traversals might not be as helpful as a single high-quality one.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after the Eleventh Traversal was completed, Lin Yuan's next traversal would have to be a "customized" one.</p><p></p><p>But "customized" traversals consumed too much Realm-Shattering Source Energy, starting at hundreds of strands, and the more Lin Yuan customized, the more the consumption would skyrocket, possibly reaching thousands of strands to create a world he was satisfied with.</p><p></p><p>As for these thirty-three Source Worlds? At least in terms of realm, they would not be lower than the Main Universe, and Lin Yuan's descent upon them would not be subject to any suppression.</p><p></p><p>The rules of operation between different world dimensions varied, and long-term residence in a single world dimension would only allow one to experience the same set of rules.</p><p></p><p>But the rules of operation between worlds of the same realm but different dimensions had significant differences, and the help to cultivation from comprehending them was undoubtedly great.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why those close to the Perfect Time-Life explored other dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>It was not only to explore the unknown, but also to witness the rules of operation in different dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could even bring about a breakthrough in the Dao they cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"If I cannot comprehend the Chaotic Rules during this Immortal Realm journey, I can try these Source World coordinates." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he was still unsure whether he could comprehend the Chaotic Rules.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend the Chaotic Rules at the Eleventh Realm was too difficult. If it were not for the fact that comprehending the Chaotic Rules would greatly benefit his ultimate breakthrough, Lin Yuan would not have undertaken this arduous and unrewarding task.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's transcendent comprehension abilities, as long as he could cross into the Twelfth Realm, even if only at the Dao Realm, the difficulty of comprehending the Chaotic Rules would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-three Source Worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, with most of his mental focus on observing the thirty-three new Source World coordinates that had appeared in the depths of the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Among the thirty-three coordinates, Lin Yuan could only clearly see the first three, while the remaining thirty were extremely blurred, only confirming that they were world coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan diverted a thread of his spiritual consciousness to try and explore the first Source World coordinate through the power of the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>This thread of Lin Yuan's spiritual consciousness seemed to have experienced a long spatial-temporal passage, finally descending upon a supreme spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>What greeted his eyes was a vast continent that filled the heavens and earth. This continent was truly colossal, and outside the continent floated countless 'asteroid' worlds.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's field of vision, even the smallest of these asteroid worlds dwarfed the Main Universe in grandeur.</p><p></p><p>"Time flow ratio..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan paused briefly to confirm the time flow ratio between this Source World and the Main Universe, and the thread of spiritual consciousness he had sent began to collapse and disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred to one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, while three hundred years had passed in the Main Universe, only one year had elapsed in that Source World.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's previous experience of descending upon other dimensional worlds, the higher the realm of the world, the slower the time flow ratio.</p><p></p><p>The time flow ratio of three hundred to one between the Main Universe and that Source World indicated that the latter's world realm was higher than the Main Universe.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lin Yuan had discovered a world realm higher than the Main Universe, as even the Immortal Realm was only barely on par with the Main Universe, and was actually inferior to it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the next Source World." Lin Yuan turned his gaze to the second Source World coordinate.</p><p></p><p>Among the thirty-three Source World coordinates, Lin Yuan could only clearly see the first three.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to use a thread of spiritual consciousness to descend upon the world corresponding to this Source World coordinate, he received a warning from the innate power of the Gate of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>That Source World was special, and reckless approach would result in a certain degree of discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it then." Lin Yuan immediately abandoned the idea.</p><p></p><p>He had explored the second Source World out of pure curiosity, but since the Gate of the Myriad Realms had issued a warning, he decided not to proceed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, there was no thought of descending or shuttling.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was still the first source world coordinate ahead.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan really descended and shuttled, he would definitely prioritize the first source world.</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Cangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Many Jade Immortals from the thirty-three immortal realms rushed over quickly.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that this Immortal-Demon War ended prematurely because of Master Yunzhenzi?"</p><p></p><p>An elderly top-tier Jade Immortal stopped outside the immortal city, looking at the other rushing Jade Immortals and said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"This Master Yunzhenzi took action and resolved the six Demon Monarch Emperors and the endless demons. Not only did the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss not pursue the matter, but he also actively ordered all the demons to withdraw from the Demon Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the surrounding Jade Immortals, although they had already heard such rumors, still found it inconceivable, even though they did not know the truth.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss? That was a Dao Ancestor-level powerhouse who had confronted the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao for countless years. In the past Immortal-Demon Great Wars, countless immortals had fallen at the hands of the demons.</p><p></p><p>Such an extremely cruel and peerless powerhouse, actually being so friendly in the face of Master Yunzhenzi?</p><p></p><p>"I have a good relationship with the city lord of Cangwu Immortal City," another short-statured Jade Immortal spoke up at this time. "Master Yunzhenzi is not only a great Elixir Master, but also the self-proclaimed Ancestor of the Martial Dao, who has been spreading the Martial Dao cultivation system."</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Martial Dao? Martial Dao cultivation system?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortals looked at each other, as they had never heard of such a cultivation system before. However, since it could give birth to a powerhouse like Master Yunzhenzi, it was obviously not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Martial Dao? Could it be that he intends to stand on par with the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss?" a Jade Immortal couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, even if not as strong as the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, is probably not far behind," the other Jade Immortals thought to themselves.</p><p></p><p>Since he dares to call himself the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, he must have already considered the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>None of them who had cultivated to the Jade Immortal realm were fools, let alone Master Yunzhenzi.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have the confidence and strength, he wouldn't have dared to call himself the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, that would be courting death.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if we can see the Ancestor of the Martial Dao this time," the Jade Immortals discussed.</p><p></p><p>They had not hesitated to cross one immortal realm after another to come to the Cangwu Immortal City, with the purpose of paying their respects to the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The great Dao has different paths but the same destination. Whether it's the Martial Dao or the Immortal Dao, at the level of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao and the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, they have a broad and profound understanding. A single word from them could make them suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Ancestor of the Martial Dao did not guide them, just being able to see such an existence would be excellent.</p><p></p><p>After all, most Jade Immortals would not see the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao for millions or even tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Jade Immortals were patiently waiting outside the city...</p><p></p><p>The city lord of Cangwu Immortal City flew out and looked at the Jade Immortals, saying, "Fellow Daoists, the Martial Ancestor is willing to see you."</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the Jade Immortals who had come from afar were startled.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the purpose of their hurried arrival to see the Martial Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>It's just that without the Martial Ancestor's consent, they didn't dare to enter the Cangwu Immortal City on their own, so they could only wait outside.</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the guidance of the city lord of Cangwu Immortal City, the first batch of Jade Immortals entered the immortal city, arrived at the cave dwelling area, and saw a young man sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p>"Greetings to the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Even though they were just looking from a distance, all the Jade Immortals were trembling in their hearts, as they could not feel the specific aura of the Martial Ancestor at all.</p><p></p><p>Before seeing the Martial Ancestor, they had already imagined many scenes in their minds, such as the Martial Ancestor's aura being so powerful and terrifying that it could collapse space and time.</p><p></p><p>But when they finally saw the Martial Ancestor, they found that they could not perceive the Martial Ancestor's strength at all.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked at the Jade Immortals with a slight smile. "Next, I will explain to you what the Martial Dao is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's willingness to see these Jade Immortals was not out of pure kindness, but to prepare for the propagation of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The dissemination of the Martial Dao is important, not only at the grassroots level, but also among the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortals present were basically the top powerhouses in the immortal world. Although they cultivated the Immortal Dao cultivation system, they all had a large number of disciples and descendants, and were the leaders of various factions.</p><p></p><p>If these Jade Immortals recognized the potential and strength of the Martial Dao, even if they themselves did not switch to cultivating the Martial Dao, their descendants and disciples would definitely consider the Martial Dao as an option when choosing a cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Lin Yuan's goal would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was not without hidden dangers, as it might arouse the resentment of the top-tier powerhouses, but Lin Yuan had already made an agreement with the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss, so the propagation of the Martial Dao was perfectly normal.</p><p></p><p>"Explain the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is going to give a sermon, isn't he?"</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of the Jade Immortals scattered. Before the Martial Ancestor, the beings in the immortal world had only heard one existence give a sermon, and that was the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>What is giving a sermon? It is to expound one's own Dao and let the heavens and earth know one's Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Immortals' thoughts rose and fell, but soon they no longer had the energy to think about these things, because as Lin Yuan expounded the essence of the Martial Dao, all the Jade Immortals quickly became immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the immortal world, the rules of the great Dao were easily manifested here.</p><p></p><p>Several figures gathered in this place, they were the direct disciples of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, and had the qualification to reside in the source land.</p><p></p><p>The source land of the immortal world was the safest place, even if the outside world was in turmoil and the Demon Monarch Emperors were rampant, it would not affect this place.</p><p></p><p>"What a big mouth, daring to call himself the Ancestor of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, our master is the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao. Calling himself the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, is he trying to stand on par with our master?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this Yunzhenzi resolved six Demon Monarch Emperors with a wave of his hand, but it's still just a rumor. Even if it's true, does he think he can compare to our master?"</p><p></p><p>The direct disciples of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao quickly exchanged words, their tone extremely resentful.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had a profound impact on the thirty-three immortal realms. Some Jade Immortals felt that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao was not much weaker than the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, and went to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>Some Jade Immortals were just observing.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Jade Immortals, led by the lineage of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, considered the Ancestor of the Martial Dao to be nothing more than a clown.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a rumor that the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss had retreated because of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, and had actively withdrawn the countless demons that had invaded the immortal world, it had not been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>These direct disciples of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao simply did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>"How presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll summon that Yunzhenzi and let him come here to apologize."</p><p></p><p>The senior disciple of the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao lineage stood up, intending to announce it to the thirty-three immortal realms in the name of the Dao Ancestor lineage.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, no one is allowed to commit any acts of transgression against the Ancestor of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>A thin, robed old man appeared, his gaze profound, his aura affecting the surrounding rules. This was the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As a twelfth-rank life form, how incredibly fast was the thought process of the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy? </p><p></p><p>In just an instant, he deduced the many possible reasons why Lin Yuan was inquiring about the twentieth realm of the Shaman Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The most plausible reason was that Lin Yuan had already reached the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor. </p><p></p><p>For someone at the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor, it was only natural to want to know the profundities of the twentieth realm.</p><p></p><p>But this possibility seemed too far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>The nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor? In the current two-dimensional world, even those legendary perfected eleventh-rank life forms were divided on whether anyone had reached this level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was merely a tenth-rank life form. Even if he was extraordinarily gifted, surely there were limits?</p><p></p><p>Apart from this possible reason, the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy deduced many other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>For instance, perhaps Lin Yuan wanted to see further ahead, to gain a general understanding of the twentieth realm of the Shaman Ancestor, or he was simply asking out of curiosity, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"What realm of the Shaman Ancestor are you currently at?" The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy fell silent for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world within the white paper could block the perception of even a Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy could not discern Lin Yuan's current realm.</p><p></p><p>"Right now..." Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, not concealing the truth, "I'm at the nineteenth realm."</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Supremacy of his own race, Lin Yuan would choose to conceal transcendent opportunities like the Door to All Realms and the Mysterious Gourd, which surpassed the twelfth rank. But there was no need to conceal anything else.</p><p></p><p>As for the realms of power within the two-dimensional world, he could only gain guidance from the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy by accurately revealing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan greatly admired the Supremacies. Any life form capable of becoming a Supremacy was undoubtedly a being of great perseverance. Mere talent and innate gifts were not enough to reach the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>"Truly the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor?" The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy looked at Lin Yuan, even though he had already anticipated this.</p><p></p><p>But when Lin Yuan said it himself, the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy was still somewhat shaken.</p><p></p><p>The nine Supremacies had joined forces, using the 'Virtual Realm' to recreate the two-dimensional world and descend into it, spending nearly a hundred years deducing the general cultivation methods from the first to the sixteenth realms of the Shaman Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Yet Lin Yuan, by himself, had already crossed into the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, the 'two-dimensional world' that the nine human Supremacies had descended into was merely a forced recreation by the Virtual Realm, with only one-tenth or one-twentieth of the similarity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cultivation methods deduced by the nine Supremacies were not limited to any particular life form but could be popularized to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>In terms of difficulty, they were undoubtedly higher than the cultivation methods explored by the powerful beings within the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But they were Supremacies! Ultimate existences! Twelfth-rank life forms!</p><p></p><p>The vision and insight of Supremacies far surpassed those of eleventh-rank life forms, let alone Lin Yuan, who was only a tenth-rank being.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, it was understandable for those legendary perfected eleventh-rank life forms to reach the eighteenth or nineteenth realms of the Shaman Ancestor through their own exploration. But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"You..." The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy sighed. "You really gave me a fright."</p><p></p><p>Originally, when one of Lin Yuan's avatars fell into the two-dimensional world, the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy was extremely worried, fearing it would affect Lin Yuan's hope of reaching the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>The nine human Supremacies had joined forces, mobilizing the Virtual Realm to recreate the two-dimensional world, at no small cost.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy had insisted on doing so, concerned that Lin Yuan's avatar might be crippled in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy's worries were completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan truly possessed the strength of the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor, he must have benefited greatly from that two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"I only just managed to cross into the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor not long ago," Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago?"</p><p></p><p>"Just barely managed?"</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"If you could cultivate to the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor in such a short time, our human civilization wouldn't need to actively seek out the Stellar Alliance."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy's face.</p><p></p><p>"Seek out the Stellar Alliance?" Lin Yuan was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Alliance was a union of various special life forms across the cosmos, on par with the pinnacle race alliances like the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"If we don't seek the Stellar Alliance's help, it will be difficult to bring out those wondrous objects from the two-dimensional world," the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy explained. "Currently, the four Celestial Kings of the Stellar Alliance are the life forms most likely to pass through the Celestial Gate and return to the cosmic universe."</p><p></p><p>"The wondrous objects obtained by the evolutionary beings of our human civilization in the two-dimensional world can only be brought out with the help of the four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>The value of those wondrous objects could only be fully realized once they were taken out of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>However, the evolutionary beings of the human civilization did not perform impressively within the two-dimensional world. At least based on the current situation, they could not compete with powerful beings like the four Celestial Kings for a spot to enter the Celestial Gate.</p><p></p><p>But now that the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy learned of Lin Yuan's strength, a glimmer of hope arose within him.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's current realm, even if he was still no match for the four Celestial Kings, he could set his sights on the next or the one after that opening of the Celestial Gate.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeking help from the Stellar Alliance, seeking help from the four Celestial Kings, would inevitably require paying a greater price, as it would be a request.</p><p></p><p>But the human civilization had no other choice. In the two-dimensional world, the advantages of special life forms were infinitely amplified.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just the human civilization; even pinnacle races like the Insect Race and the Feathered Race were unable to compete with special life forms like the Stellar Alliance in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you manage to pass through the Celestial Gate and leave the two-dimensional world in the future, bringing out those wondrous objects of our human civilization, you won't be doing it for free. For each wondrous object, based on its value, you'll be given fifty percent."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Merely bringing out the wondrous objects would earn Lin Yuan fifty percent of their value, which seemed exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>But one had to understand that if the wondrous objects were not brought out, the human civilization would gain nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this fifty percent value was not being given to the Stellar Alliance but to one of their own. The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy was more than willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>It was like receiving a free gift.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if I'll be able to enter the Celestial Gate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan expressed some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"With your cultivation speed, as long as you avoid the four Celestial Kings and focus your efforts on the second or third opening of the Celestial Gate, there is still great hope."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy said.</p><p></p><p>"Avoid the four Celestial Kings?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred. The four Celestial Kings' reputation for might was immense, whether in the two-dimensional world or the main cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that supreme weapon of the four Celestial Kings is perfectly suited for them. Even if your realm is higher and your strength greater, your overall combat power would still be inferior."</p><p></p><p>"With your potential and cultivation speed, there's no need to compete with the four Celestial Kings. The risk is too great."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yuan's thoughts aligned with the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy's.</p><p></p><p>Unless he had absolute confidence, Lin Yuan would not take the risk of competing for the first opening of the Celestial Gate.</p><p></p><p>Time was on Lin Yuan's side. The longer the time, the greater the advantage his extraordinary comprehension would bring.</p><p></p><p>In just over a hundred years, Lin Yuan was about to catch up to those legendary perfected eleventh-rank life forms. Give him another ten thousand years, and even Lin Yuan himself didn't know what level he might reach.</p><p></p><p>"By the way..."</p><p></p><p>"Since you've already reached the nineteenth realm of the Shaman Ancestor, the cultivation methods we deduced don't hold much significance for you. However, you could try comprehending the essence of the power captured by the 'Virtual Realm' in recreating the two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy said. The essence of power captured through the 'Virtual Realm' was the foundation upon which the nine Supremacies had deduced the cultivation methods of the Shaman Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Originally, even if that essence of power were placed before tenth or eleventh-rank life forms, they would not be able to comprehend much from it.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Lin Yuan's performance, the Xia Qinzhi Supremacy had a different perspective.</p><p></p><p>After all, it wouldn't cause any harm to let Lin Yuan try comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of power?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>While in the two-dimensional world, comprehending the essence of power from that realm was slow due to the world's inherent suppression.</p><p></p><p>But out here, without the limitations of the two-dimensional world, comprehending that essence of power would undoubtedly yield great gains.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your true self is in the main galaxy, right? I'll have Feather guide a strand of the 'Virtual Realm's' essence of power for you to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qinzhi Supremacy said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Supremacy," Lin Yuan expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>For the peerless Feather Supremacy to run an errand like this, it was likely an honor that few in the history of the human civilization had received.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic universe, a mysterious 'scroll' slowly unfurled...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Dozens of majestic figures stood towering nearby. </p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, how about it? Have you considered it?" </p><p></p><p>A gigantic figure, tens of billions of miles tall, transmitted his voice to the supreme being Xia Qin, "Your human civilization still has a decent relationship with my Stellar Alliance. This time, with the opening of the heavenly gate in the two-dimensional world, as long as you're willing to share sixty percent of the strange treasures, I'll have the Four Celestial Kings bring out the strange treasures found by the human evolutionary beings."</p><p></p><p>"This deal is very profitable. For dealing with the Insect Race and the Feathered Race, I demand seventy percent or even eighty percent of the strange treasures."</p><p></p><p>The gigantic figure looked at the supreme being Xia Qin. He was a twelfth-level life form of the Stellar Alliance, leading countless special lifeforms to contend against the several apex racial forces.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it," the supreme being Xia Qin said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Think about it?" The gigantic figure was slightly stunned. "Xia Qin, you weren't like this before."</p><p></p><p>The gigantic figure was a bit puzzled. Not long ago, he had discussed this with the supreme being Xia Qin, who was quite enthusiastic then.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The gigantic figure clearly sensed the change.</p><p></p><p>"Your asking price is too high," said the supreme being Xia Qin, aware of Lin Yuan's true strength, feeling very confident, and was just stalling the other party.</p><p></p><p>"If the price is too high, we can negotiate," the gigantic figure immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me think about it," the supreme being Xia Qin said again, bringing the topic back to square one.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, think about it," the gigantic figure didn't say more. "But time is limited. By then, it won't be as little as sixty percent of the strange treasures."</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, the aura of the strange treasures was concealed to the extreme. Even the powerful Four Celestial Kings could only sense them by getting close and using various methods.</p><p></p><p>So as long as the human evolutionary beings scattered and hid the strange treasures they harvested in secluded locations, even if the Four Celestial Kings slaughtered all the human evolutionary beings, they wouldn't be able to obtain the strange treasures.</p><p></p><p>Outside the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>A virtual aura condensed, forming the figure of the supreme being Feather Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>"This little guy actually cultivated to the nineteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm?" The supreme being Feather Butterfly looked towards the distant main star of the galaxy, still thinking about what the supreme being Xia Qin had told him.</p><p></p><p>"How did he cultivate so quickly? Without the profound insight of an eleventh-level life form into power, how could he have such a rapid cultivation speed?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme being Feather Butterfly was amazed, but then a smile appeared on his face. "But this is good too. At least in that two-dimensional world, my human civilization also has a peak-level expert."</p><p></p><p>With a thought of "Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth," a wisp of illusory power traversed countless light-years and descended onto the main star of the galaxy, or more precisely, into the Celestial Lord Palace on the star.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Celestial Lord Palace, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a wisp of illusory power condensed.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan swiftly opened his eyes. "This is the power of the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth, the fortifying weapon of my human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>The Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth was said to be able to replicate anything, even the myriad rules of the universe. Combined with the 'Realm Beyond the World,' it allowed the tenth-level evolutionary beings of the human civilization to greatly accelerate their cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>It was said that one of the nine supreme beings of the human civilization, Feather Butterfly, was on the supreme evolutionary path derived from the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth originated from the greatest opportunity in the history of the human civilization, before their long period of hibernation, when countless treasures and legacies rained down into the universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of illusory power swirled and condensed, vaguely revealing the full appearance of a miniature two-dimensional world before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the true appearance of that two-dimensional world?" Lin Yuan observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan's solar spirit fell into that two-dimensional world, it was difficult for him to fully experience the entirety of it.</p><p></p><p>It was like being in the mountains, surrounded by deep clouds, unaware of the overall terrain - an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan had a concrete concept of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the essential nature of the power in the two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, while his solar spirit within the two-dimensional world sensed the true aura, reflecting against his direct perception of the entire two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>[With your heavenly comprehension, you gradually accumulate insights from sensing the power of this mystical world.]</p><p></p><p>Compared to the supreme beings of the human civilization who could only sense the overall aura of the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had his spirit avatar present within it.</p><p></p><p>By comparing the two, the gains he received were far greater than those of the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>"No, wait..."</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel that the two-dimensional world replicated by the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth is incomplete, as if it's only a part of it?" Lin Yuan was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>With his solar spirit present in the real two-dimensional world for comparison, Lin Yuan immediately realized that the two-dimensional world replicated by the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth seemed flawed.</p><p></p><p>This made it hard for Lin Yuan to believe.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth to be unable to fully replicate the profound depths of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>The supreme being Xia Qin had specifically told Lin Yuan that the similarity between the two-dimensional world replicated by the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth and the real one was only about ten to twenty percent.</p><p></p><p>But similarity and completeness were two different matters.</p><p></p><p>For example, if one wanted to replicate a famous painting, the details and brushwork of the replica might be far inferior to the original.</p><p></p><p>But at least in terms of size and dimensions, the replica should not differ much from the real painting.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, the two-dimensional world replicated by the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth seemed much smaller than the real one.</p><p></p><p>"Two possibilities," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"One, my perception is wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Two, there are even vaster hidden spaces within the two-dimensional world that the Virtual Realm Heaven and Earth cannot detect, and thus cannot replicate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up towards a certain direction, where the 'white paper' had eventually stopped - the area around which any matter would spontaneously reduce its dimensions. If not stopped by a supreme being, it might turn one percent of this universe into a painting.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"What secrets are hidden in that two-dimensional world, and how is that related to me?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, Lin Yuan stopped thinking about it. His most urgent task now was to increase his strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Then, when the heavenly gate opened, he would defeat the other competitors and leave the two-dimensional world to return to the main universe.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, while sensing the essence of heaven and earth, Lin Yuan took out the silver mirror and gently caressed it.</p><p></p><p>"How do I use this mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined it carefully. According to the information he obtained, before the ancient god Tuo Ba Gu acquired this mirror, its previous owner was likely a powerful being from the Ice Race.</p><p></p><p>That Ice Race expert had the mirror for decades and may have researched some of its uses.</p><p></p><p>However, after being killed by Tuo Ba Gu, their true self went into secluded cultivation, so even if Lin Yuan concealed his identity to contact them, he couldn't reach them.</p><p></p><p>"If blood doesn't work, let me try spiritual power." Lin Yuan carefully extended a wisp of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Within the two-dimensional world, although all supernatural powers were suppressed, spiritual power was the most fundamental force of life, transcending physical body and blood essence.</p><p></p><p>Even in this two-dimensional world, the existence of spiritual power was still allowed.</p><p></p><p>However, like other supernatural powers, spiritual power was also greatly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, at the nineteenth level of the Shaman Ancestor realm, could condense a considerable amount of spiritual power, giving him the confidence to expend some on the mirror.</p><p></p><p>For other powerful beings, losing even a sliver of spiritual power might cause adverse effects like a decline in state and a significant decrease in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"This mirror is absorbing my spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's spirit was invigorated. When his spiritual power touched the mirror's surface, he felt a slight suction force.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to expend some spiritual power in an attempt to figure out the use of the silver mirror...</p><p></p><p>Cha Ran Gu appeared outside, wanting to see Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Lin Yuan put away the silver mirror and said.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Cha Ran Gu respectfully addressed him.</p><p></p><p>"What's the big matter?" Lin Yuan looked at Cha Ran Gu. Before entering seclusion, he had instructed him not to disturb unless it was something major.</p><p></p><p>"The royal family of the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom wishes to see you, Master," Cha Ran Gu quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"The royal family of the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom?" Lin Yuan shook his head. "Not interested."</p><p></p><p>If it was when he had just descended, Lin Yuan might have been wary of the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom's royalty.</p><p></p><p>But now? Not just the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom's royalty, even if the royalties of all twelve ancient kingdoms combined, Lin Yuan wouldn't frown.</p><p></p><p>"The royal family of the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom says they have a precious treasure to offer," Cha Ran Gu added.</p><p></p><p>"A precious treasure?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

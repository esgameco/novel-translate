        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At least it was a rare treasure at the level of the twelve celestial ranks. </p><p></p><p>Only existences surpassing the eleventh rank could withstand the rules of this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze compass must have appeared in this two-dimensional world a very, very long time ago. Was it left behind from the past?" Lin Yuan guessed.</p><p></p><p>The two-dimensional world he was currently in had its essence as a 'white paper', ejected from the extremely distant ruins of the Great Primordial Chaos outside the universe. </p><p></p><p>Traversing the vast expanse of the chaotic void, it eventually squeezed into the human civilization's universe.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown what places this 'white paper' had passed through, or how many powerful beings and treasures it had absorbed, just as it absorbed lives like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>But one thing could be confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Only twelfth-rank lifeforms that had transcended the river of time could escape being flattened into two dimensions.</p><p></p><p>As for twelfth-rank treasures and mystical weapons, if they had no master to control them, once they completely fell into the two-dimensional world, they might, like the bronze compass before him, have their divine might concealed, with only a faint mysterious aura circulating.</p><p></p><p>Even for a supreme expert, if they did not resist, allowing themselves to be absorbed into the two-dimensional world by the 'white paper', their strength would likely be suppressed to a similar degree.</p><p></p><p>"This bronze compass? Is it a twelfth-rank rare treasure? It might even be a supreme weapon?" Lin Yuan could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, twelfth-rank rare treasures were extremely precious, especially supreme weapons, which embodied the foundations of the peak races.</p><p></p><p>Wielding a supreme weapon could unleash attacks of the supreme level, and the permanent spatial rifts on small and medium-sized alien battlefields were created this way.</p><p></p><p>So far, the only opportunity Lin Yuan had to come into contact with a twelfth-rank rare treasure weapon was when he passed through the fifth floor of the Black Tower in the Demon Jade Space.  </p><p></p><p>As a ninth-rank comprehender of the rules of time, Lin Yuan's reward for passing the Black Tower's fifth floor included several twelfth-rank treasures and rarities from which he could choose one.</p><p></p><p>Even so, until now Lin Yuan had not made a decision, because this opportunity was too precious.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>A bronze compass that was quite possibly a supreme weapon had appeared so easily before him?</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan thought this bronze compass was likely a supreme weapon was that it did not form naturally. </p><p></p><p>It was clearly man-made, otherwise it could not have taken the distinct shape of a compass.</p><p></p><p>And a supreme weapon was often refined from a number of, or even dozens of, twelfth-rank rare treasures as raw materials.</p><p></p><p>"If I can successfully leave this world, wouldn't that mean I can take this bronze compass out with me?" Lin Yuan's heart raced with excitement.</p><p></p><p>This was a twelfth-rank rare treasure or weapon! Inside this two-dimensional world, it seemed ordinary, with only a faint mysterious aura circulating.</p><p></p><p>But once out of the two-dimensional world and in the main universe, it would be a rare treasure or weapon of infinite divine might.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, the supreme experts of humanity and other peak races almost went to war over that extraterrestrial aurora.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine how precious a treasure of this level is.</p><p></p><p>"Not just this bronze compass, the blood rain tea tree from the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom should also be a twelfth-rank rare treasure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>If just some tea leaves had a slight mysterious aura, then the blood rain tea tree that was their source must be an existence no less than the bronze compass.</p><p></p><p>"Do the powerful experts of the races know about this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wondered silently. At least he had not heard about it from Vice Patriarch Nalan.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's acquisition of this bronze compass was also extremely accidental. Even if the powerful experts had similar experiences, they would definitely keep it secret.</p><p></p><p>As for the national treasures of the ancient kingdoms, like the blood rain tea tree of the Blood Rain Ancient Kingdom, currently the strongest among the powerful experts was just the Shaman Emperor, and no one had reached the Shaman Patriarch level yet.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, they could not directly challenge the authority of the ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan speculated that this day would not be too far off.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, there would be many powerful experts of the races becoming Shaman Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Some eleventh-rank lifeforms might even forcibly surpass Shaman Patriarchs by a large margin through their mastery of power.</p><p></p><p>At that time, twelfth-rank rare treasures like this bronze compass would definitely not be able to stay hidden.</p><p></p><p>"In this two-dimensional world, there should be no shortage of twelfth-rank rare treasures and marvels," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just the twelve ancient kingdoms alone each had their own national treasures, not to mention those scattered in various places, like this bronze compass in Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"At least for now, I've obtained one."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't think too much about the other twelfth-rank rare treasures and marvels.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his full attention was focused on the bronze compass before him.</p><p></p><p>"Using this compass requires blood?" Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative, as he had noticed blood stains on it when he first discovered the compass.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and squeezed out more than ten drops of blood onto the compass.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the bronze needle suspended in the center of the compass began rapidly spinning.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the needle stopped.</p><p></p><p>An information prompt appeared in Lin Yuan's mind:</p><p></p><p>"No danger detected currently."</p><p></p><p>"Detect danger?" Lin Yuan pondered. "This compass..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Can it capture impending dangers, and thereby point out a path to survival?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived at this conclusion, not solely based on the information conveyed by the compass itself, but also from the past performance of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves.</p><p></p><p>The outside world determined that the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves had an astonishing intuition, often able to leave before formidable opponents arrived that they could not withstand. </p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan had thought this intuition of the Cloud Mountain Eighteen Thieves was just that - intuition. But now seeing this bronze compass, it seems their intuition must have come from this compass.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. Although the use of the bronze compass was not a direct combat treasure that enhanced fighting ability, the ability to detect impending danger in advance was still a rare skill.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this ability basically aligned with the main goal Lin Yuan had set after falling into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>With his heavenly comprehension, Lin Yuan's upper limit in this world would far exceed those eleventh-stage lifeforms. Given enough time, he would eventually sweep through this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>And before that, being able to detect dangers in advance to secure time for growth was of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>"This compass should be a foreknowledge-type precious weapon," Lin Yuan thought silently. Foreknowing impending dangers was just the ability suppressed by the two-dimensional world. If freed from the constraints of this world, the full power of the bronze compass would likely involve foresight into all kinds of future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Such treasures were unheard of in human civilization and even the main universe for Lin Yuan. But he had heard of them in the Xuanhuang Secret Territory and the Magic Jade Realm. </p><p></p><p>Starting from the twelfth stage, the ultimate goal of existences was to metamorphose into perfect time beings. Perfect time beings existed in the past, present and future, able to easily see any timeline from start to finish if they wished.</p><p></p><p>These foreknowledge-type precious weapons were products replicating a tiny ability of perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and five years went by in a blink. Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his inner energy and blood surging like an ocean, the surrounding temperature rising rapidly that ordinary Shaman King-level experts couldn't even approach.</p><p></p><p>"After spending five years, I've finally opened up a Shaman Emperor-level cultivation method and successfully crossed into the Shaman Emperor realm," Lin Yuan restrained his aura with satisfaction. "The Shaman Emperor cultivation method I deduced with my heavenly comprehension surpasses all Shaman Emperors of this world."</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the current Lin Yuan, though a Shaman Emperor, was directly an invincible Shaman Emperor. Even the peak eleventh-stage lifeforms that fell into this world could not defeat Lin Yuan within the Shaman Emperor domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had lingered in the Shaman King realm for over a decade, ultimately crossing into Shaman Emperor after nearly exhausting every potential of the Shaman King realm.</p><p></p><p>"However, to create my own Shaman Ancestor cultivation method next, it's best to take a look at the Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods recorded in the Twelve Ancient Nations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. In this world, the founding ancestor of each of the Twelve Ancient Nations was a Shaman Ancestor, and the Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods they passed down became the foundation of those nations' royal families.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's heavenly comprehension, he could create his own Shaman Ancestor cultivation method even without referencing those methods. But it would undoubtedly take much more time.</p><p></p><p>The Shaman Ancestor cultivation methods were essentially the explorations and insights of the Shaman Ancestors into the fundamental nature of this world.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan to browse those methods was akin to standing on the shoulders of past experts, greatly benefiting his path to comprehending his own Shaman Ancestor method - at the very least, saving him a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>"Now my strength is invincible at the Shaman Emperor level, on par with Shaman Ancestors," Lin Yuan clearly positioned himself.</p><p></p><p>Purely in terms of combat power, he was no weaker than any native Shaman Ancestor in history. Of course, the Shaman Ancestors here referred to the native ones, excluding those experts from the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>Some peak eleventh-stage special lifeforms from the main universe would definitely be stronger than the past native Shaman Ancestors after crossing into the Shaman Ancestor realm, by virtue of their mastery over their power.</p><p></p><p>But for those peak eleventh-stage special lifeforms, once they became Shaman Ancestors, their subsequent cultivation speed would plummet drastically, as there was no path forward.</p><p></p><p>"Now, quite a few experts from the myriad races have successively become Shaman Ancestors," Lin Yuan recalled the information he had learned over these years.</p><p></p><p>Those experts followed the cultivation system of this world, so their speed was extremely fast with no bottlenecks, since their true bodies' realms were right there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension was too high - he had embarked on his own path at the Shaman King realm, even creating his own Shaman Emperor cultivation method. So in terms of pure cultivation speed, he was definitely inferior to those experts.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had no worries. Now that he was a Shaman Emperor on par with Shaman Ancestors, when he crossed into the Shaman Ancestor realm, he would likely directly reach the level of the strongest eleventh-stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe, Lin Yuan's strength was far from being an opponent to those peak eleventh-stage lifeforms, with a gulf as vast as heaven and earth between them.</p><p></p><p>But this two-dimensional world seemed tailor-made for Lin Yuan. Given enough time, those peak eleventh-stage lifeforms could never catch up to him, no matter how fast they galloped.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

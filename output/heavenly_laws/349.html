        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 349: The River of Time (5,000 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"The full view of the River of Time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi sitting on the throne. </p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, sections of the universe, the vast power of time swept over everything like a great river.</p><p></p><p>All things and beings were within the River of Time. Except for Supreme Beings who could transcend the River of Time, any life form had to experience the "scouring" of the River of Time. </p><p></p><p>Here, "scouring" referred to the limit of one's lifespan. Even existences that comprehended the rules of time could only temporarily leap out of the River of Time, but would eventually fall back in and still age and die.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had always thought the River of Time was just a conceptual metaphor. But now the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi said he would take him to see the full view of the River of Time?</p><p></p><p>This left Lin Yuan somewhat astonished. </p><p></p><p>The River of Time? It has a full view?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone's understanding of the rules of time is different. My comprehension of the time rules may not apply to you."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll take you to see the River of Time with your own eyes. What insights you gain will depend on yourself."</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could respond,</p><p></p><p>He felt a strand of his spiritual will instantly break free from some shackle and arrive at a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the main universe anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, Lin Yuan had attained a high level of comprehension of the time rules. He was absolutely certain that this mysterious space he had arrived in was distinctly different from the main universe, like a little fish leaving the river. This strand of spiritual will could no longer sense any fluctuations of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around with difficulty and saw countless "currents" surging below.</p><p></p><p>These "currents" were condensed from extremely pure temporal forces, vast and mighty, flowing from the past towards the future, as if nothing could stop them.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the River of Time?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shaken to the core. Vaguely, he could see different "fish" swimming in the depths of the river.</p><p></p><p>Some of the "fish" were huge, almost spanning half the width of the river, while others were tiny, barely perceptible.</p><p></p><p>But all of the "fish" were within Lin Yuan's observation, yet they were completely oblivious to his gaze.</p><p></p><p>It was like a two-dimensional painting world unable to detect the observation of life outside the painting. The "fish" in the river were the same.</p><p></p><p>"The River of Time."</p><p></p><p>"This is the River of Time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was immensely excited as he feverishly observed the scenes before him.</p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying. Observing the River of Time causes your comprehension of the time rules to increase at an astonishing speed.]</p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying. Observing the River of Time causes your comprehension of the time rules to increase at an astonishing speed.]  </p><p></p><p>[Your innate aptitude is heaven-defying. Observing the River of Time causes your comprehension of the time rules to increase at an astonishing speed.]</p><p></p><p>Compared to the time rules in the miniature universe, this River of Time was inconceivably more vast, encompassing countless lives.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to look further into the River of Time and saw that occasionally a few "big fish" would leap out of the surging surface.</p><p></p><p>Those "big fish" only maintained their position above the surface for a few fleeting moments before falling back down, far from matching Lin Yuan's vantage point for observing this River of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Those 'big fish' should be existences that have comprehended the time rules. They can temporarily leap out of the water, but only temporarily."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>After observing the past of the River of Time for a while, Lin Yuan turned his gaze towards the direction the river flowed, which was the future.</p><p></p><p>"Can't see clearly." Lin Yuan did not feel any surprise.</p><p></p><p>The past is set, the future is uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Every moment could branch into different futures.</p><p></p><p>Even Supreme Beings who could swim upstream to the past could not flow downstream into the distant future.</p><p></p><p>If a Supreme Being dared to do so, they would most likely get lost in the endless timelines, never able to return to the present space-time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued observing the River of Time.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw the towering figure standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was standing on the bank of the River of Time, sheltered by this towering figure.</p><p></p><p>And this towering figure was none other than the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the level of a Supreme Being, one could not transcend the River of Time to reach the "riverbank" - this was an iron law, just like how lives that had perished in the past would be utterly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>To break this iron law, even Supreme Beings had to pay a price.</p><p></p><p>For a Supreme Being to resurrect a life that had died in the past, they had to withstand the backlash from the universe.</p><p></p><p>Now, for Xia Qinzhi to bring him to the "riverbank", he would certainly have to pay a similar price.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that the price Xia Qinzhi needed to pay might be far more severe than the backlash from resurrecting a few eleventh-tier experts.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why had he never heard of Supreme Beings being able to bring others to transcend the River of Time? He knew that Supreme Beings could resurrect the dead, and at least cultivators of some ability had heard of this.</p><p></p><p>But bringing others to transcend the River of Time? This was the first time Lin Yuan had witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>This only showed that for even a Supreme Being to do this, they needed to carefully consider it over and over again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued observing everything about the River of Time, his gaze turning towards other positions on the "riverbank".</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan saw another towering figure. This one was burly and powerful, its mere presence exuding boundless strength that could crush all opposition - the pinnacle of power.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Being Gu Li?" Although Lin Yuan had never seen this Supreme Being of human civilization in person, he had a strong feeling that this towering, muscular figure was indeed the Supreme Being Gu Li.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this imposing figure seemed to have noticed Lin Yuan's gaze, lowering its head to meet his eyes, revealing a hint of benevolence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze continued into the distance.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the towering figures of the Supreme Beings of human civilization appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Beings Yu Die, Xu Shen, and so on.</p><p></p><p>All the Supreme Beings' figures on the banks of the River of Time were immensely imposing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan saw the tenth Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>This Supreme Being was not from human civilization, shrouded in a dark, hazy mist. Lin Yuan had barely observed it for an instant before it noticed him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>A faint, cold snort rang out. Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, but at that moment, the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi who was sheltering Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and the cold snort completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"That Supreme Being harbors great malice towards me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not dare continue observing and could only turn his gaze towards other positions as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The towering figure shrouded in dark mist stood on the bank of the River of Time, glaring coldly into the distance at the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to pay such a price to forcibly bring an insect that has not even comprehended the time rules out of the River of Time - utterly foolish." This towering figure thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Such an act required a horrific price to pay.</p><p></p><p>Almost every moment was comparable to the backlash from resurrecting dozens or hundreds of eleventh-tier experts.</p><p></p><p>For Xia Qinzhi to do this was to risk being unable to maintain his peak combat strength for a long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Human civilization." The towering figure's thoughts wavered.</p><p></p><p>The rise of human civilization could be considered the fastest among all peak races.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was the unity among its people. Even Supreme Beings would unhesitatingly pay certain prices to help gifted descendants of their race.</p><p></p><p>Was it worth it?</p><p></p><p>For most Supreme Beings, their race was secondary - only their own self mattered.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strand of spiritual will continued gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he also saw one towering figure after another symbolizing Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>Some of these imposing figures paid no heed to Lin Yuan's gaze, some revealed a benevolent intent, but most were displeased, though all were blocked by the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi.</p><p></p><p>In the process of constant observation, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the time rules was increasing at a terrifying speed. This was the River of Time, the most direct manifestation of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>Normally, any life qualified to overlook the River of Time would have already comprehended the time rules. Those unqualified to transcend the River of Time could not comprehend the time rules either.</p><p></p><p>Yet here he was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>From the novel 69shu8.com:</p><p></p><p>However, with the help of the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi, Lin Yuan managed to break through this iron law.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough, you should go back now."</p><p></p><p>The words of the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi rang out, and Lin Yuan felt this strand of spiritual will rapidly starting to dissipate. </p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>At the main star of the galaxy, Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his emotions unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that he had just witnessed the entire panorama of the river of time from the perspective of a ninth-stage life form, temporarily breaking free from the shackles of the river of time? This was an unprecedented great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"I even saw the true forms of many Supreme Beings?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. All this time, he was never clear what kind of existences the Supreme Beings truly were. Even with scenes of Supreme Beings battling each other on the grand battlefield, Lin Yuan could only vaguely make out their struggles, unable to comprehend the lofty realms their contests involved.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi sounded a bit weak when he let me return," Lin Yuan did not know what price Xia Qinzhi had paid to help him transcend the river of time.</p><p></p><p>But just from that slightly weary tone, it was clear the cost was not small.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if I can cross into the realm of Supreme Beings." Lin Yuan reminisced about the unprecedented feeling of freedom from breaking the shackles of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Even comprehending the legendary Chaos Rules would only greatly aid in becoming a Supreme Being.</p><p></p><p>Whether he could ultimately make that final step was another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>The birth of every Supreme Being was not a certainty.</p><p></p><p>"My current comprehension of the Time Rules..." Lin Yuan carefully sensed the changes within himself.</p><p></p><p>Having visited the "shore" of the river of time, Lin Yuan gained an entirely new understanding of the Time Rules, vastly different from his past comprehension. Only a life form that had personally witnessed the full river of time could possibly gain such an understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Time..."</p><p></p><p>"Is so wonderful..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stretched out his hands, gently stirring up the strands of temporal fluctuations, forming ripples in the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too far now from fully comprehending the Time Rules," Lin Yuan let out a light breath, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>In theory, before fully comprehending the Time Rules, no cultivator would dare claim they could definitely achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Because the Time Rules were too vast - without reaching that step, no one could be certain of success.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. Having witnessed the full river of time, he had concrete knowledge of its past and future.</p><p></p><p>So his comprehension of the Time Rules was far clearer than any other cultivator studying them.</p><p></p><p>He knew his current position and roughly where the end point lay.</p><p></p><p>"Fully comprehend the Time Rules at the ninth stage, allowing my inner world to become 'independent'. Then at the tenth stage breakthrough, accept the primal infusion of the Chaos Void..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts rose and fell.</p><p></p><p>The reason Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi paid a price to help Lin Yuan break free of the river of time was to give him a push in comprehending the Time Rules.</p><p></p><p>His goal was for Lin Yuan to fully comprehend the Time Rules before reaching the tenth stage, thereby allowing the primal essence of the Chaos Void to fuse into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>For a Supreme Being to attach such importance to this, Lin Yuan felt increasingly eager.</p><p></p><p>"The urgent task now is to fully comprehend the Time Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. Since the Supreme Being Xia Qinzhi had given him this push, if he still could not fully comprehend the Time Rules at the ninth stage, Lin Yuan would truly feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"At my current speed of comprehending the Time Rules, I can likely fully grasp them within thirty years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself, gaining an extremely precise understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty years at most."</p><p></p><p>For any ninth or tenth stage cultivator, thirty years was practically nothing. For Lin Yuan to be able to fully comprehend the Time Rules in such a short period was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that before witnessing the full river of time, Lin Yuan had already prepared himself to comprehend the Time Rules at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the Solar Primordial Spirit was cultivating the 'Stride of Space-Time', one of the three great Dharma protections of the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's primordial spirit avatars each had different roles. Currently, the main primordial spirit was focused on comprehending the Time Rules, while the other two primordial spirits studied various secret techniques and paths of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not have the two primordial spirits join the main one in comprehending the Time Rules together - Lin Yuan had tried that before, but it did not prove very useful and did not significantly increase efficiency.</p><p></p><p>With the main primordial spirit comprehending the Time Rules and the other two studying secret techniques and cultivation paths, they could mutually trigger insights in each other.</p><p></p><p>For example, by cultivating the 'Stride of Space-Time', he would often gain insights into the fundamental nature of the Time Rules, feeding back into his comprehension of them.</p><p></p><p>Likewise, the deeper he understood the essence of the Time Rules, the more it could promote insights into cultivating the 'Stride of Space-Time'.</p><p></p><p>"After witnessing the full river of time, my comprehension of this secret technique has deepened further," Lin Yuan took a step, instantly appearing at the other end of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, his expression one of new realization.</p><p></p><p>The 'Stride of Space-Time' dealt with both space and time in its name, naturally involving the Time Rules.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the reason the 'Stride of Space-Time' allowed Lin Yuan to traverse trillions of light-years in a single step was through the application of the Time Rules. The power unleashed from fusing space and time exceeded Lin Yuan's imagination.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, a six-armed figure sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>As the consciousness of the secret realm, everything happening within did not escape his grasp. However, Lin Yuan had now refined the realm's core, holding power over his life and death.</p><p></p><p>"How has the master made such tremendous progress in his mastery of the 'Stride of Space-Time'?" The six-armed figure watched Lin Yuan repeatedly appear throughout the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, eyes wide in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>He clearly sensed that when Lin Yuan traversed vast distances, it was not through his authority within the secret realm, but by operating the 'Stride of Space-Time' to teleport.</p><p></p><p>But this was too inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>To reach this level of the 'Stride of Space-Time', one would practically have to fully comprehend the Time Rules.</p><p></p><p>Yet this new master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was only at the ninth stage of life!</p><p></p><p>For a ninth stage life form to be so close to fully grasping the Time Rules...</p><p></p><p>How would those tenth and eleventh stage cultivators feel about that?</p><p></p><p>It was one thing for Lin Yuan to make rapid progress in the 'Xuanhuang Strike' technique.</p><p></p><p>Some people were just talented in certain secret techniques. But the 'Stride of Space-Time'?</p><p></p><p>To deeply master this, it relied entirely on true comprehension of the rules, without any shortcuts.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty once said that the earlier one comprehends the Time Rules, the better. To fully grasp them at the tenth stage is already an extremely rare genius in the Chaos Void."</p><p></p><p>"But looking at the master's current level of comprehension, he may very well fully understand the Time Rules at the ninth stage."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure suddenly recalled some words the Xuanhuang Emperor had once said.</p><p></p><p>According to the Xuanhuang Emperor, apart from certain inborn time-based lifeforms, for a post-natal cultivator to fully grasp the Time Rules at the tenth stage was already extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>As for the ninth stage? The six-armed figure had never heard the Emperor mention such a possibility, not knowing if it was impossible or if even the Emperor had never predicted it.</p><p></p><p>At the main galaxy star, Lin Yuan held a miniature universe, constantly comprehending the Time Rules operating within.</p><p></p><p>The Time Rules within this miniature universe were far from forming a full river of time, only a relatively complete segment of the rules.</p><p></p><p>However, it still allowed Lin Yuan to greatly reduce the difficulty of comprehending the Time Rules.</p><p></p><p>"Within this miniature universe, all the rules, including the Time Rules and Space Rules, have formed a stable balance. This is the most precious point."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed every detail of the miniature universe, silently thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was about to continue comparing the Time Rules within the miniature universe to his own understanding...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not stop cultivating, but split off a strand of spiritual sense to connect to the virtual world.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 659</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the profound foundation of Lin Yuan, crossing from the Sovereign Realm into the Chaotic Realm does not involve any difficulty or obstacles.</p><p></p><p>The reason he waited until now is simply because he wanted to allow himself to grow to the utmost limits in all aspects, so that the enhancement he would gain upon entering the Chaotic Realm would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>"Direct breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not hesitate. The moment he reached the pinnacle of perfection, he began the essential transformation and enhancement of his life.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Lin Yuan's spiritual will started to roar, as if breaking through a certain bottleneck and constraint.</p><p></p><p>His physical body and vitality began to undergo frenzied enhancement.</p><p></p><p>His soul and will also started to surge rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The universe within his body likewise began to undergo rapid metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>Everything was undergoing substantial enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this, Lin Yuan's previous breakthroughs, such as mastering the third layer of the "Infinite Void" and evolving the path of Chaotic Force, only provided him with enhancements in certain aspects or areas of focus.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was experiencing an all-round enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This enhancement was not just from the Sovereign Realm to the Chaotic Realm, but a direct advancement from the Sovereign Realm to the perfected Chaotic Realm. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already evolved the path of Chaotic Force, and upon entering the Chaotic Realm, he directly reached the perfected level without needing any further tempering or cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds.</p><p></p><p>The universe within his body was boundless.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan chose to break through to the Chaotic Realm, the universe within him expanded once again. The Dao rules, laws, and spacetime grew increasingly close to perfection, approaching the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Gourd trembled, and the Red-Robed Girl standing beside him observed the changes in the universe within intently.</p><p></p><p>"He has finally entered the Chaotic Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Girl heaved a heavy sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not crossed into the Chaotic Realm, she might have even doubted her own perceptions.</p><p></p><p>Which Sovereign Realm expert could punch through such a large piece of Eternal Refined Gold and directly possess the invincible Sage-Emperor combat power? The Red-Robed Girl had witnessed Lin Yuan's growth from the initial Twelve Realms to this point, and was quite clear about his growth rate and combat prowess at each level of attainment.</p><p></p><p>"If the Sovereign Realm already possesses the invincible Sage-Emperor combat power, how powerful would he be at the Chaotic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Even the well-versed Red-Robed Girl couldn't help but feel anticipation. Although the invincible Sage-Emperors of the Chaotic Void had no opportunity to compete against each other, there were still differences in their strengths.</p><p></p><p>Other than the inheritors of the "Infinite Void" cultivation lineage, the Red-Robed Girl was not clear about the other Sage-Emperors. Normally, mastering the fifth layer of the "Infinite Void" would grant one the invincible Sage-Emperor combat power. </p><p></p><p>Mastering the sixth layer would also make one a Sage-Emperor, but their strength would be significantly greater than the fifth layer.</p><p></p><p>"If all goes well, this should be the mightiest Sage-Emperor of the 'Infinite Void' lineage, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Girl thought to herself. She could sense that the universe within Lin Yuan's body had already reached a level comparable to the sixth layer of the "Infinite Void".</p><p></p><p>In reality, Lin Yuan's cultivation in the "Infinite Void" was still only at the third layer, with the fourth and fifth layers still remaining.</p><p></p><p>There was still so much room for him to improve.</p><p></p><p>"Those unformed special realms?"</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Girl's gaze turned to certain special nodes within the universe, which were the small-scale special realms that had been evolved from the root sources.</p><p></p><p>With the enhancement of the universe within, these small special realms were also undergoing rapid metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>"The Timeless Beings high above, they specially created these special realms and occasionally cast their gaze down upon them, not out of boredom."</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Girl thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>From the lofty heights of the Timeless Beings, they would not pay much attention to matters below the Thirteen Realms. They would not even care much about the legacies they had left behind, but they were quite "concerned" about the numerous special realms.</p><p></p><p>The Red-Robed Girl could be certain that if any special realm were to be completely destroyed, it would almost certainly draw the attention of the Timeless Beings behind it, or even lead to their direct descent.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Galactic Chaotic Continent, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged. This breakthrough was far more tranquil compared to his previous path-opening entry into the Sovereign Realm, with hardly any noticeable disturbances or phenomena.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of his essential life, the enhancements in all aspects, were all completed silently.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Chaotic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, and the Chaotic Void in his vision underwent further changes. The essence of spacetime, the fundamental workings of the Dao, were all thoroughly comprehended and understood.</p><p></p><p>The elevation of his essential life had made his vision completely renewed, as if he had ascended from a small hilltop to the peak of a towering mountain, overlooking all the smaller peaks below.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed upon this world that birthed countless lives. Even for the peerless Sage-Emperors, the Chaotic Void was boundless and unfathomable, impossible to traverse in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that the Chaotic Void did have boundaries, though he was not yet clear on where exactly those boundaries lay.</p><p></p><p>"It is so immensely vast."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lin Yuan had such a clear perception of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze fell upon certain nodes within the Chaotic Void, where other worlds and realms were faintly discernible.</p><p></p><p>"Those nodes must be the special realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, "The Thirteen Realm Beings specially created these special realms and occasionally cast their gaze upon them, likely because these special realms are meant to address certain flaws and vulnerabilities within the Chaotic Void."</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level of attainment, even though he was still far from the Thirteen Realm Beings, he could perceive many underlying principles. He had a vague understanding of the purpose of those special realms.</p><p></p><p>Even the vast Chaotic Void was not truly perfect, and still had certain defects.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these flaws were not fatal, but they did exist. Over the course of millions or tens of millions of cosmic eras, their cumulative impact could gradually grow, potentially leading the Chaotic Void towards a great cataclysm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to maintain the eternal operation of the Chaotic Void, the Thirteen Realm Beings had created these special realms, sealing them at key nodes to eliminate those hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>This action was beneficial not only to the Chaotic Void, but also to the Thirteen Realm Beings themselves, allowing them to enhance certain aspects of their foundations.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder when I used the Heavenly Void Cauldron to observe the future timelines, the moment I completely destroyed a special realm, a Timeless Being immediately descended."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Normally, even invincible Sage-Emperors would be unable to destroy those special realms. Lives below the Thirteen Realms simply could not demolish them.</p><p></p><p>However, with Lin Yuan's terrifying power, combined with the unleashed might of the Thirteen Realm weapon, the Heavenly Void Cauldron, that special realm was instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"But from this perspective, the Thirteen Realm Beings are not invincible either. At least the future timelines they observe are not comprehensive. If they could truly see through all timelines, I would never have had the chance to destroy that special realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mused.</p><p></p><p>Every moment spawns countless timelines, and the Thirteen Realm Beings can only observe a portion of them. Perhaps the Timeless Being behind that special realm did not witness the timeline where Lin Yuan destroyed it.</p><p></p><p>"My universe within should also have certain flaws and vulnerabilities, just like the Chaotic Void. Fusing the root sources to establish small-scale special realms would indeed greatly benefit my inner universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded. The Red-Robed Girl was right in advising him to fuse the root sources.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go out and explore."</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing the changes within himself, Lin Yuan slowly rose to his feet.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In an instant, Lin Yuan departed the Galactic Chaotic Continent, appearing thousands or even tens of thousands of void domains away.</p><p></p><p>Another step, and thousands or tens of thousands more void domains were left behind.</p><p></p><p>Even for Chaotic Sage-Emperors, crossing a single void domain would require a significant amount of time, ranging from years to decades to centuries.</p><p></p><p>Crossing thousands or tens of thousands of void domains? That would likely take tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Peerless Sage-Emperors could be a few times faster, but that was about the limit.</p><p></p><p>Yet for Lin Yuan, each step...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, thousands and tens of thousands of void domains were traversed, the speed was inconceivably fast.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>After taking three or four steps, Lin Yuan suddenly stopped and looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>At that position, Lin Yuan sensed two causal origins related to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenixes, if you want to die, don't drag me down with you."</p><p></p><p>The black and red powers collided violently, and the Demon Sage looked angrily at the Nine Phoenixes Sage who was entangling him.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Galactic Sage had killed his and the Nine Phoenixes Sage's main battle bodies in the Xuanhuang Universe, the Demon Sage had realized that the Galactic Sage was very dissatisfied with him.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, he was dissatisfied with both him and the Nine Phoenixes, otherwise why didn't he accept the conditions proposed by the two Sages and directly strike to kill them?</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the reason, offending a powerhouse like the Galactic Sage naturally made the Demon Sage extremely apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the Nine Phoenixes Sage recklessly continued to entangle him, even actively releasing her aura. From that moment on, the Demon Sage realized that the Nine Phoenixes Sage was seeking death, wanting to actively draw the Galactic Sage's attention and have him come to pursue them.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage chose to flee far away from the vicinity of the Xuanhuang Universe, and in these years, he had briefly traversed vast void domains by relying on some temporal and spatial vortexes in the chaotic void, and now he was already nearly a hundred thousand void domains away from the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Demon Sage feel a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>A distance of nearly a hundred thousand void domains, not to mention Chaos Sages, even if it was an Unparalleled Sage, it would take a lot of time to traverse.</p><p></p><p>"Nine Phoenixes, I know you want to lure the Galactic Sage, but it's obvious that the Galactic Sage hasn't come after us."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Whether the Galactic Sage comes or not, I will keep entangling you." The Nine Phoenixes Sage was determined.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, in that place outside the Xuanhuang Universe, she had seen the hope of crossing into the Thirteenth Realm, so the Nine Phoenixes Sage chose to cease hostilities with the Demon Sage. After all, as long as she could cross into the Thirteenth Realm, her brother, sister, and many other clan members could be revived.</p><p></p><p>Killing the Demon Sage could not revive her clan members, but crossing into the Thirteenth Realm could.</p><p></p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, the Nine Phoenixes Sage prioritized the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's meaningless." The Demon Sage coldly looked at the Nine Phoenixes Sage: "I am a Sage, and you are also a Sage. What can you do by entangling me? Even if someone as powerful as the Galactic Sage can only kill my main battle body, it is impossible to completely destroy me."</p><p></p><p>Every Chaos Sage had secretly laid countless backup plans, and ordinary invincible Sages could not completely kill a Chaos Sage.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Demon Sage felt apprehensive after realizing the Galactic Sage's ill intentions was that he was afraid of becoming a target that everyone wanted to attack.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Galactic Sage could not kill him, but he could make the Demon Sage's life very difficult.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage, upon hearing this, did not respond.</p><p></p><p>She just continued to entangle the Demon Sage on her own.</p><p></p><p>"Fool."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage was annoyed, but also a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of void domains away.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was profound as he looked at the entanglement between the Demon Sage and the Nine Phoenixes Sage.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to encounter them here?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts spread out.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Xuanhuang Universe, Lin Yuan had sensed the Nine Phoenixes Sage and the Demon Sage engaging in an unrestrained confrontation again.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Lin Yuan did have the intention to pursue and kill them, but in the end, he gave up.</p><p></p><p>One reason was that during his journey in the Xuanhuang Universe, Lin Yuan had gained a lot, obtaining the Heavenly Void Cauldron, a Thirteenth Realm weapon, and he didn't want any complications.</p><p></p><p>The other reason was that even if he pursued and killed the Demon Sage and the Nine Phoenixes Sage, they would not truly die, as they could "revive" through their backup plans, so the significance would not be that great.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan didn't pay much attention to it at the time.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After entering the Chaos Realm, Lin Yuan's strength was still not as strong as the Xuan Emperor, who had stepped into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the Nine Phoenixes Sage and the Demon Sage were not Unparalleled Sages, but only newly ascended Sages. Since the Xuan Emperor could completely slay Unparalleled Sages, Lin Yuan could also try to completely kill the Nine Phoenixes Sage and the Demon Sage, who were newly ascended Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let's settle this karmic relationship."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step and disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>The black and red auras collided.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage and the Demon Sage, who were originally chasing and fleeing, suddenly felt the surrounding space-time change, and an overwhelming pressure descended upon them.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage's expression was apprehensive, as this pressure had already surpassed the one exerted by the Galactic Sage earlier.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage was also highly alert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared out of thin air, silently looking at the two Chaos Sages.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage was stunned, as he had not sensed even a trace of the Galactic Sage's causal origin.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Demon Sage, the Nine Phoenixes Sage was not as fearful.</p><p></p><p>At least if they fell into the Galactic Sage's hands, both she and the Demon Sage would not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, I don't know when I offended you, but I am willing to make amends, to pay any price to make amends."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage immediately said, as although this physical body would not truly die, continuing like this was not a good situation. Being at odds with a powerhouse like the Galactic Sage made the Demon Sage feel like he could not take a single step.</p><p></p><p>"Make amends?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Demon Sage and smiled slightly, "No need."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Demon Sage felt his vision start to blur.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sage's scalp tingled, and in that instant, he realized that all the causal things related to him were starting to disappear, including those backup plans.</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to die completely?"</p><p></p><p>This thought suddenly arose in the Demon Sage's mind, and he immediately began to struggle, trying to break free and reincarnate with a shred of his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>But immediately afterwards, the Demon Sage's entire spiritual will completely collapsed, and all his physical body, soul, and related causal things disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Completely dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly, just now he had exerted his full strength, instantly locking onto all the causal things related to the Demon Sage and annihilating them simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Sage."</p><p></p><p>Next to him, the Nine Phoenixes Sage's expression was dazed. The Demon Sage's demise did not surprise her.</p><p></p><p>Given the strength the Galactic Sage had displayed in the Xuanhuang Universe, killing the two ordinary Sages was normal.</p><p></p><p>But what shocked the Nine Phoenixes Sage was that after the Demon Sage's death, there was no trace of any causal origin left.</p><p></p><p>With the enmity and causal relationship between her and the Demon Sage, as long as the Demon Sage was still alive, she should have been able to sense his causal origin.</p><p></p><p>Causal relationships can be obscured or blurred, but as long as they exist, they can be sensed.</p><p></p><p>However, now? The Nine Phoenixes Sage truly felt the Demon Sage's causal thread disappear and vanish without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This could only mean two things:</p><p></p><p>One, the Demon Sage had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Two, the Demon Sage had given up everything and reincarnated.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sage, the Demon Sage..."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage had no fear, but instead immediately looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"He's already completely dead."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Nine Phoenixes Sage, and also locked onto all the causal things related to her, only needing a thought to completely destroy her.</p><p></p><p>"Dead, he's dead, haha haha haha, good, it's good that he's dead!"</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage suddenly burst into manic laughter. The scene she had dreamed of was now actually happening.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Galactic Sage."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Phoenixes Sage's expression gradually calmed down, with a touch of detachment and relief. "I don't need the Galactic Sage to do it now."</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the Nine Phoenixes Sage began to burn.</p><p></p><p>Her physical body, soul, and spiritual will all started to burn.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Nine Phoenixes Sage herself, but all the causal things related to her survival also began to burn.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, sister, I'm coming to keep you company."</p><p></p><p>In the flames containing infinite vitality, the Nine Phoenixes Sage walked towards complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

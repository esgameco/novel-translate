            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 445 Chance Encounter (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Outside the massive battlefield. </p><p></p><p>Numerous ultimate twelfth-level existences were also paying close attention to every detail happening within the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the first mighty one to reach the core battlefield area is from my Tianyu Race!"</p><p></p><p>"Being the first to arrive doesn't mean gaining an advantage."  </p><p></p><p>"The core battlefield area is vast. There is no significant difference between the first and the last to arrive."</p><p></p><p>Many of the twelfth-level ultimate existences discussed and conversed with each other.</p><p></p><p>The core battlefield area was the true stage of this massive battlefield. Only eleventh-level experts who entered the core battlefield area could be considered officially participating in this clash between the pinnacle universal forces.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? That Galactic Primordial from the human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"He didn't enter the space-time channel but sat down over there instead?"</p><p></p><p>"No, how is the Galactic Primordial's strength so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan began slaughtering many alien eleventh-level experts, the expressions of the twelfth-level ultimate existences gradually changed.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because the alien eleventh-levels killed by Lin Yuan were overly important, but rather this newly promoted eleventh-level Galactic Primordial unexpectedly possessed such strength?</p><p></p><p>"Your human civilization has paid no small price to cultivate this Galactic Primordial."</p><p></p><p>"I reckon it consumed quite a bit of the primal essence from that 'Illusory Universe' realm. Otherwise, how could the Galactic Primordial attain such a high level of space-time comprehension in such a short time?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the space-time primal essence fluctuations replicated by the Illusory Universe realm are ultimately different from those naturally formed in the cosmos. Aren't you afraid that by forcing the Galactic Primordial's growth like this, his foundations will be unstable in the end?"</p><p></p><p>The various twelfth-level ultimate existences sneered one after another. This entire massive battlefield, strictly speaking, was a huge twelfth-level weapon that could block the perceptions of the most powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>After all, at the life level of the most powerful, even a single malicious thought or killing intent could affect the eleventh-level experts.</p><p></p><p>To ensure relative fairness in the massive battlefield, the most powerful beings could not directly extend their perceptions into the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But even without extending their perceptions, just by observing from afar, the twelfth-level ultimates could roughly sense that the Galactic Primordial's realm of space-time comprehension was not low at all.</p><p></p><p>The various pinnacle forces had carefully collected all the information about the Galactic Primordial.</p><p></p><p>It hadn't taken him long at all to cross into the eleventh level, yet under such circumstances, he possessed such terrifying space-time comprehension. There was only one explanation.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization must have specially created a "world beyond" for the Galactic Primordial, then used the "Illusory Universe" to replicate the rules of the cosmic vast expanse, and finally slowed down the flow of time, allowing the Galactic Primordial to experience an extremely long period of time in that "world beyond."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supreme Being coldly snorted and secretly transmitted his voice to the Butterfly Supreme Being: "Butterfly, did you really do this?"</p><p></p><p>"To comprehend space-time fluctuations, it's best to comprehend them fully within the cosmos itself. Replicating them with the Illusory Universe realm, for a talent like the Galactic Primordial, has its drawbacks."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supreme Being also felt that doing so was somewhat inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Given the talents and qualities Lin Yuan had displayed, there was no need to rush like this.</p><p></p><p>"I have never used the Illusory Universe realm for the Galactic Primordial." The Butterfly Supreme Being immediately transmitted a denial: "The Illusory Universe realm is our race's fortified weapon. Although I refine and keep it, don't you all know whenever it's used?"</p><p></p><p>"Not used?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supreme Being exchanged glances with several other Supreme Beings.</p><p></p><p>Not used?</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the origin of space-time in the virtual realm, how was the Galaxy Lord able to achieve such a profound understanding of space-time?</p><p></p><p>The virtual world. </p><p></p><p>A personal space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in a recliner, savoring the fine wine in front of him. </p><p></p><p>Besides cultivation, Lin Yuan often came to the virtual world to relax.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's vast spiritual will, it was effortless for him to allocate a sliver of his spiritual will to descend into the virtual world and indulge himself while his main consciousness focused on myriad other tasks.</p><p></p><p>"Monstrous, too monstrous."</p><p></p><p>Sitting opposite on another recliner was Vice-Tower Master Nalan, who couldn't help but express astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Information about the massive battlefield was constantly circulating among the eleventh-rank experts. Lin Yuan had slain the Demonic Tribe's Mingche and the colossal Stony Life Form.</p><p></p><p>Since their true selves were still alive, they naturally wouldn't conceal their encounters.</p><p></p><p>Especially Mingche of the Demonic Tribe, in order to justify losing such a powerful weapon, he not only didn't belittle the Galaxy Lord but even greatly exaggerated the Galaxy Lord's strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the Galaxy Lord was formidable enough, then losing a supreme weapon to him seemed more reasonable, right?</p><p></p><p>"Did you enter the core region of the battlefield?" Lin Yuan casually asked.</p><p></p><p>"I was quite lucky. The peripheral region I descended into had over thirty eleventh-rank experts from the Human Civilization Alliance," said Vice-Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>Over thirty eleventh-rank experts from the Human Civilization Alliance, by joining forces, could completely monopolize some of the quotas to the space-time path.</p><p></p><p>All the eleventh-rank experts of the Human Civilization Alliance in that region could safely enter the core battlefield region.</p><p></p><p>Such was the advantage of unity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in the region where Lin Yuan was, the dozens of special life forms like the colossal Stony Life Form had planned to do the same, even temporarily driving back the Demonic Tribe's Mingche, who wielded a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, they encountered Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Numerical superiority could indeed provide a huge advantage in some situations, like the Insectoid Tribe's "Insect Sea Tactic" based on this principle.</p><p></p><p>However, when the disparity in strength was too great, numerical advantage became less useful.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way..."</p><p></p><p>"I heard something," Vice-Tower Master Nalan said in a low voice, as if recalling something. "The strongest eleventh-ranks from the Insectoid Tribe, Feather Winged Tribe and others who entered the battlefield intend to join forces to encircle and kill you."</p><p></p><p>The battle prowess displayed by Lin Yuan had become a thorn in the side of the eleventh-ranks from those tribes, hence the idea to encircle and kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Encircle and kill me?" Lin Yuan's interest was piqued.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't ask for more.</p><p></p><p>When suppressing the colossal Stony Life Form, Mingche of the Demonic Tribe and other alien eleventh-ranks, Lin Yuan had deliberately restrained his strength as much as possible, precisely for this moment.</p><p></p><p>If back then, Lin Yuan had resolved all those alien eleventh-ranks in an overwhelmingly dominating manner, even Mingche who wielded a supreme weapon wouldn't have lasted more than a few breaths...</p><p></p><p>How could the strongest eleventh-ranks from the Insectoid Tribe, Feather Winged Tribe and others have dared to come and encircle him?</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't even have had the chance to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"You must be very careful," Vice-Tower Master Nalan said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Although aware of Lin Yuan's formidable battle achievements, facing the strongest eleventh-ranks from the paramount tribes and forces, he still hoped Lin Yuan would be as cautious as possible.</p><p></p><p>Those strongest eleventh-ranks likely didn't rely solely on their own strength, but probably carried trump cards from the ultimate existences behind them. The Feather Winged Tribe's Feather Winged Meng had even brought his tribe's fortifying weapon.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The power of tribal weapons can surpass that of supreme weapons. For a peak tribal force that has existed for billions of years, they may have collected and forged dozens or even hundreds of supreme weapons. </p><p></p><p>For example, the cosmic aurora from a few hundred years ago was the main material for forging supreme weapons. A complete cosmic aurora is estimated to be enough to forge seven or eight supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>But tribal weapons? Even if they obtained that once-in-a-cosmic opportunity from the human civilization that descended from outside the universe, the weapons that could be called tribal weapons would not exceed ten.</p><p></p><p>Other peak tribal forces would have even fewer.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although very confident, Lin Yuan was no fool and naturally knew how formidable tribal weapons were.</p><p></p><p>The super large battlefield. </p><p>The core region battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Through the path of space-time, Lin Yuan descended here.</p><p></p><p>"The space-time suppression has surged again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around at the boundless expanse of the heavens and earth before him.  </p><p></p><p>"With my current level of space-time comprehension, the maximum displacement distance is probably a few light-years, but the consumption would be huge."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Moving a few light-years at a step was very slow, but this was a super large battlefield carefully constructed by supreme beings, where even those at the eleventh level could only travel by flight under the space-time suppression.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan could still perform spatial displacement, his personal consumption began to increase dramatically.</p><p></p><p>His six-fold comprehension of space-time allowed him to forcibly pry open the spatial rules of the super large battlefield, but Lin Yuan was not a supreme being. Even with the means to pry it open, he lacked the corresponding profound power to do so.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just fly slowly then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan abandoned the idea of rushing by displacement.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to expend so much effort on that.</p><p></p><p>When he encountered enemies, he could then perform spatial maneuvers to pursue and kill them, which would be most cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>"The location chosen by the human civilization alliance's eleventh-level experts to establish their war base is in that direction."</p><p></p><p>As the supreme commander of the human civilization alliance on this battlefield, Lin Yuan was privy to much classified information, including the location of the war base.</p><p></p><p>The war base was the grand headquarters established on this battlefield by a peak tribal force.  </p><p></p><p>The war base was not only crucial for this war, but would serve as the foundation for expanding in subsequent wars.</p><p></p><p>"I'll head to the war base first." Lin Yuan changed direction and flew towards a certain location.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several days went by.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan flew rapidly, his vast perception radiating out from himself as the center for millions and tens of millions of miles in all directions.</p><p></p><p>On this super large battlefield under heavy space-time suppression, not only was spatial displacement restricted, but the range of perception was also severely limited.</p><p></p><p>If in the cosmic starry sky, Lin Yuan's perception could encompass hundreds of light-years in an instant. But on this super large battlefield, it could only slowly cover millions and tens of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? There are fluctuations of combat millions of miles to the front right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something, his gaze turning towards the front right.</p><p></p><p>Although the core region battlefield was vast, experts from different tribal forces would occasionally encounter each other.  </p><p></p><p>If the experts belonged to hostile forces when they met, a battle was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he rushed towards the source of the combat fluctuations.  </p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Yuan clearly sensed those engaged in battle.</p><p></p><p>"Nine at the eleventh level, five against four?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly raised his brows. "And there's also a familiar face?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 508</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the ancient and chaotic Dalu continent, one of the nine great cities was Mingchuan City.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was sitting cross-legged in the "inn room", which could be better described as a vast world with no visible end.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient and chaotic Dalu continent, the "inn" signifies safety and undisturbed rest. Therefore, the rental price is extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan paid ten Chaos Stones to obtain the ten-year residency rights for this "room".</p><p></p><p>Ten years is an extremely short period in the Chaos Void. Many ancient Twelfth-Realm beings can sleep for far more than ten years.</p><p></p><p>However, in the time flow of the Chaos Void and the universe, ten years in the Chaos Void is equivalent to three thousand years in the universe.</p><p></p><p>By the time the lease expires, if everything goes smoothly, Lin Yuan estimates that he would have already advanced to the Twelfth Realm, at which point he can continuously dispatch avatars to come and go as he pleases, whether to change inns or explore other regions.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Void." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the vast and profound Dao principles governing the operation of the Chaos Void. Compared to the Dao principles within the universe, those of the Chaos Void are even more lofty and profound.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan had this avatar settle in the ancient Dalu continent was primarily to thoroughly comprehend the operating Dao principles of the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>"How marvelous!" Lin Yuan couldn't help but immerse himself in contemplation. Even though this was just an avatar, as long as it contained Lin Yuan's spiritual will, it possessed an extraordinary innate talent. At this moment, as it continued to gain insights, brilliant inspirations rapidly collided in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's vision suddenly soared, arriving at another realm where a vast river of time flowed.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the time river of the Chaos Void?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately realized. Just as the universe had a time river that was the ultimate destination for all life below the Twelfth Realm, the Chaos Void naturally also had its own time river.</p><p></p><p>While the Chaos Void contained many Twelfth-Realm beings, there were even more life forms below the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"How magnificent!" Lin Yuan couldn't help but exclaim inwardly. Compared to the time river of the universe, the time river of the Chaos Void was unimaginably more vast and grand. If the time river of the universe was likened to a tributary, then the time river of the Chaos Void would be the main river channel, with the time rivers of various universes branching out from it, like the veins of a leaf.</p><p></p><p>The main river channel of the Chaos Void's time river was vast and majestic, akin to the main vein of the leaf, while the countless minute tributaries flowing through various universes were like the fine veins.</p><p></p><p>"Time and space." Lin Yuan continued observing the main channel of the time river, where even the slightest ripple contained the imprints of the essences of countless Eleventh-Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what it would be like if I were to find myself in the main channel of the time river." Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered. With his current level of being, he could barely contain himself in the tributary time rivers. But the main channel of the Chaos Void's time river, which was the source of time for the entire Chaos Void, could easily accommodate the existence of beings far surpassing the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Void was boundless and unfathomable. While it did not contain monstrous prodigies who had comprehended the Chaos Dao at the Eleventh Realm, the upper limits of the Eleventh Realm in the Chaos Void far exceeded those within the universe.</p><p></p><p>The direct disciples of the Chaos Venerable, the legitimate heirs of the Chaos Sages, and the awe-inspiring beings born directly from the Chaos Void, whose levels rivaled the universe - so many legends and wonders existed within the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>In the central region of the ancient Dalu continent, the sharp black mountain slightly trembled. This black mountain was actually the lone horn of a Chaos Dragon Beast, a being whose combat prowess nearly rivaled the Chaos Realm, and who had long ago submitted to the Ancient Dalu Venerable, with its true form slumbering deep within the Chaos Dalu.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" The Chaos Dragon Beast opened its azure eyes, revealing a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>As a life form directly nurtured by the Chaos Void, the Chaos Dragon Beast could be considered a semi-Wondrous Being, with a trace of time bloodline flowing within it.</p><p></p><p>All Twelfth-Realm beings, whether they were at the Dao-Sundering Realm, the Sovereign Realm, or the Chaos Realm, had the ultimate goal of transforming into perfect Time Beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, becoming a perfect Time Being was an extremely distant goal. Even for the peak and complete Chaos Sages, their first step would be to transform into Time Beings, which meant crossing into the Thirteenth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thirteenth-Realm Time Beings, while unable to control the past, present, and future as freely as perfect Time Beings, who could perceive and transcend numerous timelines, still possessed some of the characteristics of perfect Time Beings. They could use their own existence as an anchor to observe the future.</p><p></p><p>The future was uncertain, with countless timelines. Thirteenth-Realm Time Beings had the ability to preemptively observe certain timelines and see many futures related to themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Dragon Beast was only near the level of the Chaos Realm in terms of combat power, but its actual realm was at the peak of the Sovereign Realm. It possessed a "precognitive" instinct due to the trace of time bloodline within it.</p><p></p><p>This "precognitive" instinct was far inferior to the timeline observation abilities of Thirteenth-Realm Time Beings. It could only sense impending crises, without knowing the specifics of what the crisis was, when it would occur, or where it would come from.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this ability was extremely formidable. It had helped the Ancient Dalu Venerable avoid many troubles.</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry and tell the Ancient Dalu," the Chaos Dragon Beast thought, immediately shrinking its form to ten meters tall and rushing towards the deeper regions of the Chaos Dalu.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest underground, a towering and robust figure sat, with swirling and intertwined Chaos Qi emanating from its body with each breath, as if it contained an entire universe within.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Dalu, Ancient Dalu," the Chaos Dragon Beast arrived and called out.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The massive figure of the Ancient Dalu Venerable opened his eyes, looking at his companion with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Although the outside world believed the Chaos Dragon Beast had submitted to the Ancient Dalu Venerable, in reality, their positions were equal, not a master-servant relationship.</p><p></p><p>"I sense a great crisis, a very grave crisis," the Chaos Dragon Beast immediately relayed the impending crisis it had "precognized".</p><p></p><p>"A crisis?" The Ancient Dalu Venerable's heart slightly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the crises sensed by the Chaos Dragon Beast would occur within the next ten thousand years. But he had no intention of leaving the Chaos Dalu within that time frame, nor did he plan to send the Chaos Dragon Beast away.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even while they remained in the Chaos Dalu, which was the Ancient Dalu Venerable's own domain and sanctuary, a crisis could still arise? The Chaos Dalu was the Ancient Dalu Venerable's personal cultivation ground, where even a few fellow Chaos Venerables would be powerless against him, let alone his own formidable strength combined with the Chaos Dragon Beast, which was nearly on par with the Chaos Realm. So what kind of crisis could they possibly face?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What kind of crisis?</p><p></p><p>Elder Gumingzun's thoughts were racing.</p><p></p><p>He trusted his companions and did not think there was any problem with their 'precognitive' abilities. In the vast chaotic void, there were not many crises that could threaten the Chaos Lords, let alone the Chaos Lord hiding in his own old nest.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to hurry about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"At least there is still time to slow it down."</p><p></p><p>Elder Gumingzun fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The 'crisis' foreseen by the Chaos Dragon Beast mostly occurred within the range of ten thousand to a hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>As for within a thousand years, a hundred years, or even ten years? Very rarely.</p><p></p><p>If the crisis really arrived so quickly, there would be no point in preparing for it.</p><p></p><p>"What level of crisis is it?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Gumingzun asked again.</p><p></p><p>This question was crucial. If it was a life-and-death crisis, he would immediately take all his belongings and flee without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>As for the Chaos Continent and the many powerful beings on it? Before his own life was at stake, Elder Gumingzun would not care about them.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a life-and-death crisis, but I feel I may at least be seriously injured," the Chaos Dragon Beast said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Not a life-and-death crisis?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Gumingzun calmed down. As long as it was not a life-and-death crisis, he was still unwilling to abandon everything and flee.</p><p></p><p>This Chaos Continent had cost him a lot of effort, and the countless lives in the vast chaotic void used it as a trading place, generating huge profits every day, which made Elder Gumingzun reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I'll contact my friends now to see if there's any major event happening in this area of the chaotic void." Elder Gumingzun immediately began contacting his friends.</p><p></p><p>Those who could become his friends were all Chaos Lords, with extremely keen grasp of intelligence and information.</p><p></p><p>Most crises did not appear out of thin air, but had certain precursors. As long as they had enough intelligence, they could deduce the source of the crisis and how to face it.</p><p></p><p>Virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yuan." His parents had been waiting for a long time, and his sister Lin Yi also stood up as soon as she saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Is that news true?" Mother Lu Qiong asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The news about the Galaxy Lord suppressing the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan had long been circulating in the human civilization domain.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lu Qiong and Lin Shou Cheng thought it was just a rumor. Their son was indeed excellent, but to the point of suppressing an existence comparable to the Strongest, that was simply a fairy tale.</p><p></p><p>But as the news became more and more credible, and the virtual world network did not refute the matter, coupled with the more accurate information obtained by Lin Yi from the Xia family, Lu Qiong and Lin Shou Cheng realized that this news might be true.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, did you really suppress the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan?" Lin Yi couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Because of this matter, the current Xia family patriarch had directly abdicated, and now the Xia family patriarch was actually her husband.</p><p></p><p>"It's not exactly suppressing." Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If the time factor was disregarded, Lin Yuan could not really defeat the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Even if he unleashed all his trump cards, such as the divine abilities of 'World' and 'Rip the Sky', he could only make the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan feel troubled. Due to the gap in the comprehension of the space-time fusion rule, the opponent could not lock onto Lin Yuan's position at all and could only passively take the beating.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's view, what was called suppressing was to completely crush the opponent, even without relying on the comprehension of the space-time fusion rule, he could still press the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan and beat him, that would be true suppressing.</p><p></p><p>"It's not exactly suppressing." Lin Yi's eyelids twitched.</p><p></p><p>So he did fight with the Ancestor of the Tian Yu Clan, a supreme existence, under the deep starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of majestic figures gathered here.</p><p></p><p>If a hundred years ago, the encirclement and suppression of the Galaxy Lord only involved one Twelfth-Order participant from the various peak clan forces.</p><p></p><p>But now, in the cosmic starry sky, except for the nine Strongest of the human civilization, most of the Twelfth-Order Ultimates had all appeared here.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years ago, in the eyes of many Twelfth-Order Ultimates, the Galaxy Lord was just a troublesome little guy.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had become an existence equal to them, and unlike many Twelfth-Order Ultimates, the Galaxy Lord still had great potential for advancement.</p><p></p><p>As long as he broke through to the Ultimate, he could once again achieve a massive transformation and enhancement of his forces.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"How do we contain the Galaxy Lord?"</p><p></p><p>A Twelfth-Order Ultimate spoke, and at this moment they no longer had the slightest intention of exterminating the Galaxy Lord, because they could not.</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua has already contacted the two Ultimates of the Jie Clan."</p><p></p><p>"If we can persuade them, we may still have a chance to resist the Galaxy Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Yuu Clan Ultimate slowly said.</p><p></p><p>The two Ultimates of the Jie Clan were at the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm. If they were willing to target the human civilization and the Galaxy Lord, the situation might not be as bad as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Galaxy Lord had the strength of the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm after entering the Twelfth-Order, facing the two Parting the Dao Realm Ultimates of the Jie Clan, even if these two Parting the Dao Realm Ultimates could not normally take action, they would at least be wary.</p><p></p><p>Plus the dozens of Twelfth-Order Ultimates here, theoretically speaking, the human civilization still had enemies in the future and could not become the sole dominant force.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no matter how one looked at it, the human civilization becoming the strongest force in the universe, surpassing the ancient Cosmic Clan and the Jie Clan, was now inevitable. The various peak clan forces that could once fight with the human civilization could only rely on banding together to continue to stalemate with the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there are also the Ultimates of the Jie Clan."</p><p></p><p>The many Twelfth-Order Ultimates present were slightly stirred.</p><p></p><p>As one of the top ten peak clan forces in the universe, the Jie Clan would surely not allow the human civilization to expand recklessly, otherwise it would also affect the Jie Clan's own development.</p><p></p><p>Although the Jie Clan's Ultimates had previously withdrawn from the encirclement and suppression of the Galaxy Lord, in the eyes of many Twelfth-Order Ultimates, it should have been because the Jie Clan disdained to deal with an Eleventh-Order life.</p><p></p><p>But the situation was different now. If the Jie Clan still did not take any action, they would eventually be suppressed by the human civilization in the future.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, at this moment, the peak clan forces such as the Tian Yu Clan, the Insect Clan, and the Jie Clan were all on the same side, jointly resisting the upcoming expansion of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>While the many Twelfth-Order Ultimates were waiting, the figure of Wanhua the Empress Mother solidified, obviously having returned from the Jie Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua, how is it? What did the two Ultimates of the Jie Clan say?"</p><p></p><p>"That's great, if there are any conditions, just put them forward, we'll try our best to satisfy them."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth-Order Ultimates immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua, how did the negotiations go?" The Yuu Clan Ultimate also asked.</p><p></p><p>Wanhua the Empress Mother looked at the expectant gazes of the many Twelfth-Order Ultimates, but fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

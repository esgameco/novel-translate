            <p>Chapter 245: The Inconceivable Gourd (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Even consciousness cannot penetrate this gourd..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn as he carefully observed this gray gourd that was only the size of a palm. </p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, many materials are extremely hard and difficult to destroy, but few can block the penetration of an Evolver's consciousness power.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness power, more difficult to detect than the power of the world and the power of the soul, is a derivative of the will of the mind.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current mental will index, unless it was an eighth-level treasure or rarity, he should be able to probe it clearly, if not in every detail, then at least getting a general idea.</p><p></p><p>"An eighth-level treasure or rarity?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked the surface of the gray gourd. It felt cold, with almost no resistance, like the texture of some high-end alloy.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly was it formed?"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Lin Yuan couldn't quite tell whether the gray gourd was man-made or originally like this.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom, do you know what this gourd is?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan decisively connected to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>As one of the three ultimate intelligent goddesses of human civilization, the Goddess of Wisdom has recorded almost all known materials of mankind.</p><p></p><p>Treasures or rarities, as long as they have been uploaded by human Evolvers, they are all recorded by the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when in doubt, consult the Goddess.</p><p></p><p>This is not just a saying in human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Galaxy Star Lord, there are no similar items to this object in the database."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom came through.</p><p></p><p>"No similar items?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Goddess of Wisdom only performed a preliminary scan. To conduct a more in-depth "appraisal", the gray gourd needs to be sent to the Central Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Lin Yuan's will power cannot penetrate it doesn't mean human civilization is incapable of doing so.</p><p></p><p>It's just thatâ€”</p><p></p><p>Even if it was only a preliminary scan, it is extremely rare for the Goddess of Wisdom to give an evaluation of no similar items.</p><p></p><p>In the over two million years of Star Ocean history, have the countless human Evolvers not seen anything?</p><p></p><p>Yet the result given by the Goddess of Wisdom is no.</p><p></p><p>"Baby, this must be a treasure."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged as he looked at the gray gourd in front of him.</p><p></p><p>For normal items, even if the Goddess of Wisdom hasn't seen them before, she would definitely have information on similar objects.</p><p></p><p>"I obtained this gray gourd from an alien lone wanderer?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to recall. The original owner of the gray gourd was a seventh-level alien lone wanderer.</p><p></p><p>Compared to special lifeforms, alien lone wanderers prefer to travel around the universe. Over time, they basically collect many strange items.</p><p></p><p>This gray gourd was placed in that seventh-level alien lone wanderer's space ring, together with other miscellaneous items of unknown origin.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, that seventh-level alien lone wanderer also did not discover the uniqueness of this gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he only sensed that this gray gourd was very hard and could block the probing of will power.</p><p></p><p>Those alien lone wanderers don't have the "appraisal" means of the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, the appearance of an extra hard object is not strange.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lin Yuan also didn't pay much attention to this gray gourd, thinking that it might be worth a few cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Hard?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see how hard you are."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gripped the gray gourd and began to squeeze hard.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying force began to subtly affect the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the physical divine ability Lin Yuan awakened is called "Moving Mountains", known as the divine ability of strength.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current eighth-level martial dao physique, under the blessing of the divine ability "Moving Mountains", he can easily crush a high-level living planet.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary eighth-level Evolvers also cannot withstand such a squeeze.</p><p></p><p>This is the suppression brought about by absolute strength. Among the nine supreme powerhouses of human civilization, one of them is the ultimate of the path of strength laws. With a raise of a hand or a stamp of a foot, pure strength tears apart billions of miles of space in the main world.</p><p></p><p>That supreme powerhouse of ultimate strength, along with the supreme powerhouse Xia Qin, are known as the two supreme powerhouses with the strongest killing power in the Human Civilization Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It still resisted?"</p><p></p><p>After exerting full force for a while, Lin Yuan let go and found that not even a slight mark was left on the surface of the gray gourd. His expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>Even the eighth-level armor he was wearing would have to leave some traces after squeezing so hard, right?</p><p></p><p>This is still considering that eighth-level armor belongs to defensive weapons, but this gray gourd obviously has no connection with defense. Its degree of hardness even surpasses eighth-level armor?</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Bringing the gray gourd, he entered his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>Now, his inner world has reached a size of over 700,000 miles, incorporating three cosmic rarities. Coupled with Lin Yuan's own comprehension of laws, it is getting closer and closer to the real world.</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tossed the gray gourd in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the world power of the inner world surged and swept the gray gourd away.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying world power, as if to reopen heaven and earth, destroyed the gray gourd from all angles.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how Lin Yuan mobilized the world power, that gray gourd remained unmoved, constantly sinking and floating under the pressure of the surging world power.</p><p></p><p>"Even world power is helpless against it?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face turned solemn. In the inner world, the strength he can exert is not much inferior to an eighth-level invincible who has grasped a certain cosmic power.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he still could not shake that gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan even had a feeling that even if he became an eighth-level invincible in the future and advanced to the ninth level, he would still be helpless against this gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>"This gourd..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll study it for a while longer."</p><p></p><p>"If I still can't figure it out, I'll directly give it to the Goddess of Wisdom in exchange for rewards."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that even if this gray gourd was really some incredible treasure, if he couldn't use it, it was equivalent to waste, just like its previous owner who ultimately lost it to him.</p><p></p><p>A bird in the forest is not as good as a bird in the hand.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just the fact that this gray gourd can withstand the crushing of his world power, it can probably be exchanged for quite a few rewards, probably worth one or two cosmic rarities.</p><p></p><p>In the next few days, whenever Lin Yuan had time, he tried various methods.</p><p></p><p>Since hardness didn't work, Lin Yuan tried softness.</p><p></p><p>For example, using his own soul power to approach the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>But it was useless.</p><p></p><p>He also tried placing the gray gourd into the primal sea of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Some treasures, such as primal essence gold, are extremely eager for the primal power of the world.</p><p></p><p>But it was still useless.</p><p></p><p>The precious primal power of the world could not touch the gray gourd at all.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Lin Yuan finally gave up.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I have no fate with you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the gray gourd, his expression a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this gray gourd concealed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A great secret.</p><p></p><p>But it was unclear how to unlock it.</p><p></p><p>Having a treasure trove but unable to enter it.</p><p></p><p>This feeling left Lin Yuan's mind in a complex state.</p><p></p><p>"Should I try dripping blood?" </p><p></p><p>The thought suddenly crossed Lin Yuan's mind, without much hope.</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'blood recognition' method was a very backward means.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Human Alliance or other alien races, there was no shortage of body-snatching. Many evolved beings, in order to start at a higher point, even cultivated replica bodies infused with special life bloodlines for their descendants.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>The physical body was not fixed.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline was also not fixed.</p><p></p><p>The soul and spiritual will were the fundamentals.</p><p></p><p>The blood recognition method was limited to bloodlines and had been eliminated by human civilization countless years ago.</p><p></p><p>The recognition methods were basically based on the soul, determined by the spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no other way. It was just a casual attempt.</p><p></p><p>Even if it still didn't work, it wouldn't be surprising.</p><p></p><p>Phew.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light breath.</p><p></p><p>Then he raised his right hand and squeezed out a drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current physical strength, if he didn't intentionally squeeze it out, the blood would not actively flow out at all.</p><p></p><p>Drip.</p><p></p><p>A drop of extremely viscous blood fell on the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Due to the physical divine ability 'Blood Rebirth'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had absolute control over every drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far apart, he could sense its specific situation.</p><p></p><p>The blood dripped onto the surface of the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actually lost perception of this drop of blood in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>The drop of blood that fell on the surface of the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>It actually quickly merged into the gourd.</p><p></p><p>"So it requires dripping blood?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up as he carefully observed the changes in the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>A slight fluctuation began to emanate from within the gray gourd.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan sensed the slight fluctuation, his mind separated from his body, as if arriving in a boundless crimson sea.</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline contains the power of rebirth, meeting the conditions for unlocking."</p><p></p><p>In a daze, a mental fluctuation reached Lin Yuan's ears, and its meaning was easily understood.</p><p></p><p>After a long time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>"This gourd?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined the gray gourd in front of him again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the color of the gray gourd was beginning to change.</p><p></p><p>It was no longer dull gray, but had more crimson.</p><p></p><p>Through the brief contact just now, Lin Yuan knew that a special liquid was brewing inside the gourd.</p><p></p><p>This special liquid had an incredible effect on the metamorphosis of life, but the side effects were extremely large. Only those with 'rebirth power' in their bloodline could try to absorb this liquid.</p><p></p><p>"Rebirth power?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be referring to my physical divine ability 'Blood Rebirth'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as long as one reached the seventh-stage evolution, even if the physical body was shattered, as long as the soul remained, it could still recover.</p><p></p><p>What was blood rebirth? The blood here did not refer to a drop of blood, but as long as there was a thread of life essence, one could continuously be reborn with it.</p><p></p><p>Blood was just the 'medium' that carried the essence of life.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of metamorphosis requires this prerequisite?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was a little amazed. Up until now, Lin Yuan had not seen a second evolved being with a similar 'blood rebirth' method.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan's physical divine ability did not come from the main world, but from the Zhongtu God Continent.</p><p></p><p>It was only because Lin Yuan had comprehended this divine ability in the Zhongtu God Continent world and condensed the divine ability imprint that he 'brought it back' to the main world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what the effect is."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan picked up the gourd, gently shook it, and then turned the gourd mouth downward.</p><p></p><p>After the gourd's confirmation, Lin Yuan already had the initial qualification to use it. After a moment, a drop of liquid condensed from the downward-facing gourd mouth.</p><p></p><p>The liquid was crystal clear, appearing crimson, as if it contained a crimson sea.</p><p></p><p>"It's so beautiful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at this drop of liquid, his mind beginning to be intoxicated. Just by looking at it, it seemed as if this drop of liquid contained an entire universe of stars.</p><p></p><p>"According to the information I obtained, I just need to drink it directly?"</p><p></p><p>His consciousness returned to the outside world, and the gray gourd mixed with crimson also returned to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>That drop of crimson liquid was still condensed on the gourd mouth.</p><p></p><p>"The liquid inside the gourd is divided into seven colors according to levels: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple."</p><p></p><p>"Only by completely absorbing the crimson liquid and thoroughly transforming the physical body will the second color liquid appear."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try it."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, a drop of blood floated out of Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>According to the information obtained from the gourd, absorbing the liquid required taking on great risks.</p><p></p><p>With a drop of blood outside, even if something really happened, he could quickly be reborn.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had also left blood on the Chihu main star, it was too far away.</p><p></p><p>"Begin."</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to feel his physical body burning like a flame.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood were burning, internal organs were burning, bones were burning, everything was burning.</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>Under the physical divine ability 'Blood Rebirth', everything that Lin Yuan burned was rapidly recovering.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, the burning power of that drop of crimson liquid and Lin Yuan's rebirth power began to enter a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's physical body could no longer endure and suddenly turned into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the crimson liquid disappeared, and the scattered 'flying ashes' quickly began to be reborn, instantly condensing into Lin Yuan's form.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan could comment.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked to find that after his rebirth, the circulation of qi and blood in his physical body had actually doubled in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>It was doubled.</p><p></p><p>Not a ten percent increase.</p><p></p><p>Even a ten percent increase would be extremely incredible.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current level, both his physical body and soul were approaching the limit. To undergo further metamorphosis and evolution, he could only break through the existing realm.</p><p></p><p>Or consume some precious cosmic treasures.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the improvement gained was not too great, at most a few percent. As for doubling... Lin Yuan didn't even dare to think about it.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the physical body that has improved."</p><p></p><p>"The inner world..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression revealed shock, and his mind quickly entered his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The inner world was vast and mighty.</p><p></p><p>The inner world, which originally had a radius of only 700,000 miles, had now surged to a radius of 1.5 million miles.</p><p></p><p>The power of the world circulated as if the sky was collapsing and the earth was splitting. The sun formed by the cosmic treasure 'Primordial Flame' under the firmament had now 'shrunk' a lot, apparently not keeping up with the expansion of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>"My inner world? It has also doubled?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan murmured, somewhat in disbelief.</p>

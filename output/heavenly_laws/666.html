        <h1>Chapter 666</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've been here," the woman in the emerald green dress said, smiling as she looked out at the vast city in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Her name was Fu Yingtian, one of the oldest Celestial Emperors of the ancient Fuguogu Kingdom. This time, she had come to the capital of the Lienyang Kingdom to represent the Fuguogu Kingdom in negotiations with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, the core royal family member who first excavated the bloodline of the Ancestor to the Celestial Emperor level," Fu Yingtian thought, her mind flashing with information about the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, she had watched the recorded images of the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River countless times, especially the battle where he had overwhelmed numerous peak Celestial Emperors in the Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>"I must lower my stance when negotiating with the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River," Fu Yingtian reminded herself.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest Celestial Emperor of the Fuguogu Kingdom, she would usually have a sense of superiority when facing other ancient kingdom's top experts of the same level. This was the pride of being the first descendant of the Ancestor in this world, and the strongest Celestial Emperor of the Fuguogu Kingdom was also slightly stronger than the strongest Celestial Emperors of other ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>But when facing the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River? Fu Yingtian was no fool, and naturally dared not have any arrogance.</p><p></p><p>The moment the strongest Celestial Emperor of the Fuguogu Kingdom, Fu Yingtian, entered the capital, the Emperor of the ancient Lienyang Kingdom in the depths of the palace sensed her arrival.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the ancient Lienyang Kingdom was a precious treasure, forged by the Ancestor of Lienyang, and the life force of anyone entering the capital would be monitored, especially the strongest Celestial Emperors of the major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Yingtian, it's just an avatar, no threat. She should be going to find the Silver River," the Lienyang Emperor glanced and did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>In the past one or two hundred years, the experts of the five major ancient kingdoms had often come to the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, trying to negotiate and trade. As for the content of the negotiations and trades, it was naturally to redeem the foundation-destroying weapons of their own kingdoms, as these foundation-destroying weapons could be used, but could not be allowed to fall into the hands of outsiders.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the attitude of these strongest Celestial Emperors," the Lienyang Emperor smiled. In the past, how arrogant were the strongest Celestial Emperors of the major ancient kingdoms? Even when facing him, the Emperor of an ancient kingdom, they were not very impressed.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>In the Silver River Manor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked outside the manor, where a woman in an emerald green dress was standing and smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Yingtian?" Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he summoned her in.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest Celestial Emperor of the Fuguogu Kingdom, Lin Yuan naturally would not ignore her.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial thing was that Fu Yingtian had come to bring him treasures.</p><p></p><p>"I have long heard of the name of the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River," Fu Yingtian smiled, carefully examining Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>She knew that the current Silver River Celestial Emperor was just an avatar, but from the avatar, she could still perceive some information and get a sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>"This Silver River Celestial Emperor, the avatar he has condensed is so real, it even brings me a sense of threat," Fu Yingtian was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"What brings Fu Yingtian here?" Lin Yuan sat down facing Fu Yingtian and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>As for Fu Yingtian's purpose, Lin Yuan had some guesses, but he still asked.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Emperor of the Silver River is awe-inspiring in the Treasure Land, even the Celestial Emperor of the Fuguogu has fallen," Fu Yingtian sighed, "I suppose some of the foundation-destroying weapons of my Fuguogu Kingdom have fallen into your hands, the Celestial Emperor of the Silver River."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there are some, not only from your Fuguogu Kingdom," Lin Yuan looked at Fu Yingtian.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Fu Yingtian sighed inwardly, realizing that this time she would probably have to pay a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mentioned other ancient kingdoms, implying that other ancient kingdom's experts had already come to negotiate, and in this situation, with the conditions offered by these ancient kingdom experts for comparison, it would probably not be easy for her to get back the foundation-destroying weapons of her kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll be direct."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yingtian had no intention of beating around the bush, and looked directly at Lin Yuan: "The foundation-destroying weapons of my Fuguogu Kingdom cannot be allowed to circulate outside. Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, name your price, what would it take to get those foundation-destroying weapons back."</p><p></p><p>"To get those foundation-destroying weapons back..." Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Those foundation-destroying weapons are useless to you, only the experts of my Fuguogu Kingdom can activate them," Fu Yingtian couldn't help but remind him.</p><p></p><p>"I indeed cannot activate them," Lin Yuan nodded, "but I can collect them, after all, there can't be too many Fuguogu foundation-destroying weapons circulating outside, right?"</p><p></p><p>With these words spoken,</p><p></p><p>Fu Yingtian's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what she feared the most.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Emperor of the Silver River, state your conditions," Fu Yingtian said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at her with a smile: "I want a hundred jin of Dragon Abyss Blood."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yingtian heard this and her expression turned unsightly: "Dragon Abyss Blood produced in the Dragon Abyss Valley?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I want a hundred jin of it," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Abyss Valley was a top-tier treasure land controlled by the Fuguogu Kingdom. It was said that this was the place where the first life in this world had perished, and its blood had soaked the Dragon Abyss, with the lives within the Dragon Abyss Valley all containing Dragon Abyss Blood to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Abyss Blood had many effects, almost involving various aspects, able to nourish the physical body and nourish the soul, and was considered the top rare treasure of the six major ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>However, the lives with Dragon Abyss Blood flowing in their bodies could only survive and reproduce within the Dragon Abyss Valley. Once they left the Dragon Abyss Valley, the Dragon Abyss Blood in their bodies would degenerate and disappear.</p><p></p><p>This is why the output of Dragon Abyss Blood was extremely low. It was unknown how many Dragon Abyss Valley lives one would have to extract from to refine even a drop of Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even I can only get a drop of the Dragon Abyss Blood once every hundred billion years. You're directly asking for a hundred catties?" Fuxing Exalted Immortal couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>As the mightiest Exalted Immortal, he enjoyed many privileges in the Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom, and many special resources could be directly allocated, including the Dragon Abyss Blood.</p><p></p><p>But the amount of Dragon Abyss Blood allocated to Fuxing Exalted Immortal was too little, only a single drop? It should be known that the Dragon Abyss Blood is not heavy, its weight is about the same as ordinary blood. A drop of Dragon Abyss Blood is too light in weight.</p><p></p><p>"The foundational killing techniques of your Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom are not comparable to the Dragon Abyss Blood," Lin Yuan said. "Can you give a little less?"</p><p></p><p>Fuxing Exalted Immortal's true body and the other mightiest Exalted Immortals of the Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom communicated, and finally he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred catties of Dragon Abyss Blood is useful to me, I can't do with less," Lin Yuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Fuxing Exalted Immortal fell silent, and Lin Yuan didn't urge him, knowing that he should be communicating with the other mightiest Exalted Immortals of the Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Abyss Blood, as a first-class treasure trove controlled by the Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom, its output of Dragon Abyss Blood hardly circulates in the other five ancient kingdoms, and is basically all consumed internally. Lin Yuan had also heard of its preciousness, so he proposed such a condition.</p><p></p><p>"No problem with a hundred catties of Dragon Abyss Blood, but I have another condition," after a long while, Fuxing Exalted Immortal looked at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>Delighted in his heart that the request was agreed to, Lin Yuan immediately said, "Please go on."</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the foundational killing techniques, all the other treasures, weapons, and rare items of our Great Fuxing Ancient Kingdom's supreme Exalted Immortals, as well as those golden mists, must all be returned to me."</p><p></p><p>Fuxing Exalted Immortal said.</p><p></p><p>"You want those golden mists back?" Lin Yuan clearly understood Fuxing Exalted Immortal's purpose.</p><p></p><p>Those weapons and equipment together are not worth a drop of Dragon Abyss Blood, yet Fuxing Exalted Immortal specifically wanted them back, it was very likely for the sake of the golden mists.</p><p></p><p>As rare treasures produced by the newly born treasure trove, the golden mists were of high value, even though their specific effects and uses had not been fully explored yet.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan didn't hesitate much and directly agreed.</p><p></p><p>Now that he controlled the entire treasure trove, the golden mists were in endless supply, he didn't lack that little bit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan also intended to let some of the golden mists circulate out, so as to utilize the power of the other ancient kingdoms to discover the uses of the golden mists.</p><p></p><p>This behavior could also increase the value of the golden mists, and the desire of many Exalted Immortals for the golden mists.</p><p></p><p>"Then the deal is done."</p><p></p><p>Fuxing Exalted Immortal nodded, "I will wait for the Silver River Exalted Immortal outside the treasure trove, and present the hundred catties of Dragon Abyss Blood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body was still inside the treasure trove, in order to complete the transaction, he had to wait until the contention was over and Lin Yuan came out, after all, only then could he get back the foundational killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Inside the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was still comprehending the source world origin exposed in the irregular fissures, this kind of origin had a limited time of exposure, only ten thousand years, so Lin Yuan naturally cherished it greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Has the contention for the treasure trove ended?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to have sensed something, and a clone departed.</p><p></p><p>At the exit of the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Exalted Immortals like Chiyan and Guanglie from the Brilliant Yang Ancient Kingdom had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years had passed, and now the contention for the treasure trove had ended, as for the ownership of the treasure trove? It was naturally without any suspense.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Exalted Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Exalted Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lin Yuan appear, the supreme Exalted Immortals immediately greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Go out then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, and at the same time stepped out of the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>The eleven supreme Exalted Immortals of the Brilliant Yang Ancient Kingdom also followed and stepped out.</p><p></p><p>Outside the treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>There was already a group of Exalted Immortals waiting, from various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>These Exalted Immortals from the other ancient kingdoms saw Lin Yuan come out, and immediately stepped forward one by one, holding the rare treasures they had agreed on, exchanging them for the foundational killing techniques and other spoils that Lin Yuan had obtained from the various ancient kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The transaction was completed.</p><p></p><p>These Exalted Immortals also successively departed.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Exalted Immortal, this treasure trove now belongs to you, of course, nominally it belongs to the Brilliant Yang Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a figure flew over, smiling at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the issue of the treasure trove, he had already discussed it with the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Exalted Immortal, then we'll head back now."</p><p></p><p>Chiyan Exalted Immortal and the other supreme Exalted Immortals of the Brilliant Yang Ancient Kingdom looked at Lin Yuan and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Now that the treasure trove belonged to Lin Yuan to guard, these supreme Exalted Immortals naturally had to return to the imperial capital to report.</p><p></p><p>"Good, if there's anything, you can find me in the imperial capital."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded. He had left a clone in the imperial capital, as for his true body, it would still be guarding this treasure trove, at least within ten thousand years, as he could closely observe the operation of the source world origin during that time, he would not leave.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Chiyan Exalted Immortal and many other supreme Exalted Immortals left one by one.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched them leave from afar, but in his heart, he was pondering.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how much credit I will get for this contention over the treasure trove."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite covetous of the many inheritances in the Brilliant Yang Ancient Kingdom's treasury, especially the opportunity to possess the ancestor.</p><p></p><p>That was to possess a thirteenth-tier being, to observe every detail from the perspective of time and life, how precious was that?</p><p></p><p>"Continue to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, and the clone directly dissipated, his mind immersed again in observing the operation of the source world origin.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can you do a little bit of everything?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Ancestor of the Martial Dao speak these words in an incredibly calm tone, Zhang Tianshi fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Even the most powerful evolutionary paths have their own areas of focus, and the strongest cultivators are no exception. Yet, the Ancestor of the Martial Dao can do a little bit of everything? Although he said "a little bit", Zhang Tianshi dared not truly believe it was just "a little bit".</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao is stronger than the nine supreme cultivators of human civilization in certain aspects?</p><p></p><p>If it were any other cultivator, no matter how old the information, Zhang Tianshi would have considered this a joke.</p><p></p><p>Stronger than the supreme cultivators? The nine supreme cultivators of human civilization not only stand at the pinnacle of human civilization, but also at the pinnacle of all the tribes in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>To be stronger than the supreme cultivators, isn't that just nonsense? But the Ancestor of the Martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tianshi had a vague feeling that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao was not lying.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Martial Dao evolutionary path has not yet reached the twelfth-stage supreme cultivation path, but is already ranked fifth among human civilization, has already revealed many things.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually answered a few of Zhang Tianshi's doubts, and then ended the "call" with him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan personally met with Zhang Tianshi, solely because the latter was the first to break through to the eighth stage of the Martial Dao evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>It was completely out of pity for future cultivators.</p><p></p><p>On the savage planet.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tianshi disconnected from the virtual world, his expression wistful.</p><p></p><p>In the brief exchange with the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, Zhang Tianshi felt that his understanding of the Martial Dao and many other evolutionary paths had undergone a tremendous change.</p><p></p><p>This change was a transformation that came from a bird's-eye view, a significant leap in Zhang Tianshi's comprehension of the essence of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Ancestor of the Martial Dao," Zhang Tianshi calmed himself, and in his heart, he wanted to say one more thing.</p><p></p><p>That is - </p><p></p><p>The supreme cultivators are not much after all.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard the rumor that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao's true identity is the Galactic Lord," Zhang Tianshi thought about the rumors that had been circulating within human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Galactic Lord being the founder of the Martial Dao has been widely spread.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization authorities have not stopped this rumor, and the Ancestor of the Martial Dao himself has not come out to refute it.</p><p></p><p>This has caused the credibility of this rumor to grow higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>Given the Ancestor of the Martial Dao's status in human civilization, if there were any false rumors, the human civilization authorities would certainly have stepped in to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>But that did not happen.</p><p></p><p>Although the human civilization authorities have not confirmed it either.</p><p></p><p>But sometimes silence is a form of acknowledgment, and the Ancestor of the Martial Dao is no exception.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Lord." Zhang Tianshi swallowed, the growth trajectory of the Galactic Lord from birth to the present can be clearly traced.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator genius, not even a thousand years old, has no connection to the founder of the Martial Dao evolutionary path, yet the two are the same person.</p><p></p><p>"The eighth stage of the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>The details that the Ancestor of the Martial Dao had just mentioned kept flashing in Zhang Tianshi's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Tianshi felt that the path from the eighth stage of the Martial Dao to the ninth stage was clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>This is due to the high-level guidance of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao, as well as Zhang Tianshi's own accumulation over the past thousands of years, which has now been ignited under the Ancestor's prompting.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to start cultivating in seclusion right now."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tianshi immediately closed his eyes, intending to continue his seclusion cultivation for hundreds or thousands of years, fully digesting the guidance of the Ancestor of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>In front of the naturally formed cosmic black hole.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's solar divine soul was sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>The black hole is a special celestial body within the universe, and the space-time black hole is formed by the collision of countless black holes, leading to the collapse of space-time, forming a vast cosmic phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Even an eleventh-stage perfected cultivator would appear extremely insignificant in the face of the massive space-time black hole, and the slightest mistake could result in being sucked into it.</p><p></p><p>Many eleventh-stage perfected ancient gods have established various space-time black hole secret techniques based on the naturally formed space-time black holes in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest among them can only possess one-millionth or one-ten-millionth of the power of a true space-time black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time black hole?" Lin Yuan carefully observed the space-time black hole in front of him. Time and space are inherently one, but they can also repel each other.</p><p></p><p>The space-time black hole is an example of this, where the ultimate repulsion and collision of time and space leads to the formation of the space-time black hole, and the resulting shockwaves are close to the twelfth-stage level.</p><p></p><p>"If I can truly comprehend the space-time black hole in front of me, even if I don't reach the peak of the seventh realm, I won't be too far off."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The unconscious, unguided collision of time and space alone can unleash power close to the twelfth-stage level. Once under human control, the effects that can be produced are unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Lin Yuan gradually stopped his contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Now that his true body and main spirit have reached the pinnacle in all aspects, the assault on the ultimate is imminent. He can come back to contemplate the space-time black hole after breaking through to the twelfth-stage.</p><p></p><p>In the gloomy palace.</p><p></p><p>Nine days have passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen twelfth-stage ultimate cultivators descended once again.</p><p></p><p>"Nine days have passed."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Fan, have you locked onto the location of the Galactic Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, have you locked onto it? Time is of the essence, the Galactic Lord can attempt the breakthrough to the ultimate at any moment."</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-stage ultimate cultivators spoke with a sense of urgency in their voices.</p><p></p><p>Once the Galactic Lord decides to attempt the breakthrough to the ultimate, they will no longer have the opportunity to intervene.</p><p></p><p>If the Galactic Lord breaks through to the ultimate, the nine supreme cultivators of human civilization will undoubtedly set up a complex space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At first, they had no idea where the Milky Way Star Lord was rushing towards the ultimate. After some time passed, the Milky Way Star Lord made the ultimate leap, and they could only watch helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The complete 11th-tier ultimate leap would cause everything to jump out of the river of time, during which it would be subject to the backlash of the river of time and even the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, this backlash is also a form of protection, ensuring that apart from the backlash, there will be no other external forces interfering with the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>Although the 12th-tier ultimates have completely broken free from the constraints of the river of time, breaking free from the constraints of the river of time does not mean they can confront the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, it's almost time."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, frowned deeply. His true body, deep within the Chaotic Tribe's territory, had been kowtowing to the Milky Way Star Lord's phantom for nine full days.</p><p></p><p>Each time he kowtowed during these nine days, his karmic connection with the Milky Way Star Lord deepened significantly. At this moment, after nine days of kowtowing, Fan Hou's karmic connection with the Milky Way Star Lord far exceeded the karmic connection between the closest of kin.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this karmic connection was formed through the nine days of kowtowing, and it could only last for a short time. Moreover, the price Fan Hou paid during these nine days was terrifying, and it would take tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of years for him to fully recover.</p><p></p><p>"I, a mighty 12th-tier being, have paid such a heavy price just to lock down your location. I should be proud of myself," the Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, thought to himself as he took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The price he had paid was far beyond what would be required to fight against other 12th-tier ultimates.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the peak tribal forces like the Prison Tribe promising not to attack the Chaotic Tribe in the long years to come, and the threat posed by the Milky Way Star Lord, he would never have done this.</p><p></p><p>In the Gloomy Grand Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, looked at the other 12th-tier ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's inter-continental ultimate, Fan Hou, spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Milky Way Star Lord, no matter how much karmic treasure you have to protect you, what does it matter?"</p><p></p><p>The 12th-tier ultimates had smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"How many avatars and manifestations does the Milky Way Star Lord have out there in the universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Prison Tribe's ultimate immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the Milky Way Star Lord has a total of 143 avatars and manifestations distributed throughout the universe," the Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, closed his eyes and sensed it carefully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his karmic connection with Lin Yuan was at its strongest. Even with so many layers of separation, he could still lock onto Lin Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>"143 avatars and manifestations."</p><p></p><p>The Prison Tribe's ultimate and the other 12th-tier ultimates looked at each other in bewilderment. The Milky Way Star Lord had released so many avatars and manifestations out there, yet they, as 12th-tier ultimates, had failed to lock onto even one of them after a century of effort?</p><p></p><p>In the end, they had to rely on Fan Hou paying a horrific price and using the secret "Nine Days of Kowtowing" technique to barely lock onto the location?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that the Milky Way Star Lord has one manifestation outside the universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, had a slight change in his expression and couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>Outside the universe? That was a realm that even the 12th-tier ultimates could not explore.</p><p></p><p>"Outside the universe? Where?"</p><p></p><p>The Prison Tribe's ultimate immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"With the universe separating us, even with the 'Nine Days of Kowtowing' technique, I cannot sense the specifics."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The universe itself can isolate and shield against layers of karma and space-time.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the chaotic void outside the universe, the rules there are far more numerous than within the vast universe. Using the karma within the universe to sense the karma outside the universe is even more difficult than reaching the heavens.</p><p></p><p>So Fan Hou could not detect much more.</p><p></p><p>"Wanhua said that the Milky Way Star Lord's mental will has reached the 12th-tier level, so with his mental will, he's likely condensed a manifestation near the universe."</p><p></p><p>The Prison Tribe's ultimate speculated.</p><p></p><p>12th-tier ultimates can condense manifestations outside the universe, but the connection between the manifestation and the true body is very short, and it is constantly under the erosion of the chaotic energy.</p><p></p><p>So, after a few attempts, 12th-tier ultimates generally lose interest.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, choose the avatar with the strongest karmic connection, lock onto its coordinates, and then we'll all go there and descend."</p><p></p><p>The Prison Tribe's ultimate said.</p><p></p><p>Although any of the Milky Way Star Lord's avatars and manifestations would do, the one with the deepest connection to the Milky Way Star Lord would be the best.</p><p></p><p>"It's here."</p><p></p><p>"In front of the 52nd spatial black hole."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Tribe's ultimate, Fan Hou, revealed a specific set of coordinates.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you there." The Ancestral Feathered Tribe's patriarch waved his hand, and an invisible spatial ripple swept across the scene, causing the numerous 12th-tier ultimates present to vanish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had stood up in front of the spatial black hole, intending to leave and reunite with his true body to make the ultimate leap.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Spatial ripples flowed like water.</p><p></p><p>One majestic figure after another instantly descended, with more than ten such figures surrounding Lin Yuan, isolating the space-time he was in, turning it into a kind of 'island'.</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Star Lord, enjoy the source of chaos and pollution."</p><p></p><p>The Feathered Tribe's ultimate was the first to act, with 24 wings covering the universe, and his pure white right hand reaching out to suppress Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura permeated the area, and an immeasurable, matchless power began to affect the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

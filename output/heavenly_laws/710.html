        <h1>Chapter 710</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Lin Yuan's dragging, as if pulling the entire Origin World, the vast demonic energy permeating the four corners of heaven and earth boiled simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Demon God who was originally looking down suddenly stumbled. Its giant tail struggled mightily at the end, working with the surrounding demonic energy to forcibly break free from Lin Yuan's grip and return behind it.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, quite strong indeed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at his right hand. The surface of his palm was now covered with dense black holes, all from the corrosion encountered while gripping the giant tail.</p><p></p><p>Was the Demon God's tail so easy to grab? The intense backlash produced during the process was enough to give even a 13th-level Eternal being a headache.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan dared to do this only after fully completing the creation of his Infinite Sand Particle Worlds, relying on each particle world to share the backlash.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy actually..."</p><p></p><p>In the Hidden World, the several sect leaders were completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>If earlier, Lin Yuan was just using all his strength to resist the Demon God's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Then just now, actively dragging the Demon God's tail, destabilizing its foundation and nearly pulling it along, meant that Lin Yuan already possessed the direct strength to shake the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy is not an Eternal Lord, how could he possibly shake a Demon God?"</p><p></p><p>The minds of the many high-level members of the Eternal Sect went blank.</p><p></p><p>Barely blocking the Demon God's attacks versus turning around and shaking the Demon God were two completely different things.</p><p></p><p>The latter meant that the strength difference from the Demon God was not very large, and could even be said to be on the same level.</p><p></p><p>In the four corners of heaven and earth, the experts of various supreme holy sects and holy sects were also watching and observing.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan revealed his true form that reached the heavens, even from far away, they could faintly see and perceive him resisting the Demon God's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy shook the Demon God?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that Demon Gods are on par with Eternal Lords?"</p><p></p><p>Many experts were filled with disbelief. Although the struggle between Lin Yuan and the Demon God essentially involved countless mysteries, what was displayed was just punches and kicks.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't very difficult to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>The black holes on the surface of his right hand quickly healed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Demon God, his gaze exuding intense fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Eternal Source, the infinite sand particle worlds within his body had fully completed their creation. Each particle world could resonate with each other, erupting with power at least ten or a hundred times stronger than before when the creation was not yet complete. It was precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>That Lin Yuan was able to go from barely resisting the Demon God's attacks to directly shaking the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Because if he went all out now, he could indeed pose a threat to the Demon God. Not a life-or-death threat, but at least enough to make the opponent take him seriously.</p><p></p><p>"It's only polite to return the favor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled as he looked at the somewhat dazed Demon God.</p><p></p><p>His form directly merged into space-time, disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Demon God's hollow eyes showed solemnity. This realm was filled with demonic energy, and the demonic energy was equivalent to the Demon God's domain. Wherever the demonic energy covered was within the Demon God's control.</p><p></p><p>But the moment Lin Yuan disappeared, the Demon God sensed that it had lost control over the surrounding realm.</p><p></p><p>This loss was forced, without any warning.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's enormous body appeared beside the Demon God, raising his hand to deliver a slap.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's body also began to rapidly grow larger, becoming as tall as Lin Yuan, its giant tail whipping out again.</p><p></p><p>Colliding with Lin Yuan's slap.</p><p></p><p>Crash!</p><p></p><p>Large amounts of space-time and the world were constantly being annihilated. This annihilation was fundamental, enough to cause irreversible effects on the Origin World's essence. But at this moment, neither Lin Yuan nor the Demon God cared about these things.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had not yet crossed into the 13th level. Although his foundation had accumulated to the extreme, when truly facing a Demon God on par with Eternal Lords, he naturally dared not hold back in any way.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In this clash, the Demon God was clearly at a disadvantage. Lin Yuan's sudden disappearance and reappearance caught it off guard, only able to barely defend.</p><p></p><p>The result was that the Demon God retreated several steps backwards.</p><p></p><p>Before the Demon God could react.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form disappeared once again.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the Demon God let out a roar! This roar was like the rage of heaven and earth, an apocalyptic roar.</p><p></p><p>The 'black ripples' formed by the roar swept out in all directions. The earth was torn apart by the roar, space-time also collapsed in the roar. Most of the central area of heaven and earth was affected by the roar, constantly being annihilated.</p><p></p><p>As for the nearby Hidden World, at the critical moment another defensive Eternal Treasure was activated. Combined with the fact that the Demon God's roar was not aimed at the Hidden World, it barely managed to withstand.</p><p></p><p>As the 'black ripples' spread, Lin Yuan's form was forced to appear, gazing at the Demon God from afar.</p><p></p><p>The black ripples were very powerful, but still could not overcome Lin Yuan at this moment. As the infinite sand particle worlds operated, the destructive power formed by the 'black ripples' was diluted in an instant.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong an attack, when dispersed into infinite sand particles and averaged across each particle world, it no longer posed such a great threat.</p><p></p><p>"Demon God's Roar, this is the Demon God's Roar, the Demon God's trump card killing move."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Hidden World, the several sect leaders looked with shock at the 'black ripples' spreading in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the various futures predicted by the Eternal Lords, after the Demon God completely suppressed the Origin World's consciousness with its own instinctive consciousness, it would use this move when focusing its efforts on attacking the Hidden World.</p><p></p><p>And according to the Eternal Lords' foresight, by the time the Demon God used this move, the situation in this Origin World would be considered extremely dire.</p><p></p><p>Because under the Demon God's Roar, even the Hidden World protected by multiple defensive Eternal Treasures could not hold out for too long.</p><p></p><p>"The killing move that the Demon God would only use after endless years, forced out early by Lord Galaxy..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Has it come out?" </p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Master's heart trembled. Observing the battle up close, he could naturally see the Demon God's passivity.</p><p></p><p>If the Demon God's Roar was not used soon, it would fall into Lin Yuan's endless cycle of disappearing and reappearing.</p><p></p><p>At that point, even if the Demon God didn't fall into a complete disadvantage, it would lose the initiative.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong."</p><p></p><p>The many other sect elders and high-level members swallowed hard. </p><p></p><p>The more they knew, the more they could understand Lin Yuan's strength. That was the Demon God! What level of power did Lin Yuan possess to be able to go toe-to-toe with the Demon God? In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God, having forced Lin Yuan to reveal himself with the Demon God's Roar, stared at Lin Yuan with hollow eyes, then shook its giant tail behind it and lunged forward to attack Lin Yuan with large strides.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's way of fighting was extremely primitive. It did not disappear into space-time and reappear elsewhere like Lin Yuan did.</p><p></p><p>But with each large step the Demon God took, the surrounding space-time condensed a bit more. Added to that, the invisible and intangible "black ripples" formed by the Demon God's Roar continued to vibrate.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also charged forward with large strides.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts evolution he had taken naturally excelled at close combat. Combined with the complete opening of the Infinite Sand Worlds, each punch and kick was imbued with infinite power.</p><p></p><p>He was even less afraid of this style of combat.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the two massive figures collided.</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's eyes were filled with endless darkness. Everywhere it looked, both tangible and intangible things were transforming into demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Countless particle lights suddenly lit up inside Lin Yuan's body. The Infinite Sand Particle Worlds all began to operate, with the universe inside his body as the core, unleashing power that constantly collided with and annihilated the darkness from the Demon God's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Yuan's left hand reached for the Demon God's giant tail, wanting to yank the Demon God up, but immediately the Demon God began to continuously emit the Demon God's Roar.</p><p></p><p>The "black ripples" vibrated incessantly at close range. Even Lin Yuan had to divert part of his attention to resist them.</p><p></p><p>"That move?" In the hidden world, several sect masters saw the Demon God's eyes fill with endless darkness. In the predictions of the various Eternal Lords, this scene had never appeared.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, even at the end, looking across many future timelines, they had not forced the Demon God to use this move.</p><p></p><p>And the darkness in the Demon God's eyes was clearly the most lethal, far surpassing the previous few moves. Even Lin Yuan was cautiously resisting it.</p><p></p><p>"Die."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's left hand grabbed the Demon God's giant tail again, while his right hand directly locked onto the Demon God's throat, wanting to tear the Demon God apart. But immediately after, the Demon God's two hands directly embraced Lin Yuan. The two beings' auras violently collided, and even the omnipresent demonic energy was completely annihilated under this intense vibration.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's physical body was incredibly strong, even surpassing Lin Yuan's, but Lin Yuan had the support of infinite particle worlds and the universe inside his body. For a time, the battle between the two fell into a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Roars continued, black ripples swept out continuously.</p><p></p><p>The giant tail swept across, lashing at Lin Yuan again and again.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan paid no attention to these. His foundation was profound, and combined with various protective divine abilities, even if he sustained injuries, he could quickly recover. He was completely trading injuries with the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Demon God had infinite demonic energy to support it, so it basically hadn't sustained any injuries.</p><p></p><p>But very clearly, the Demon God simply couldn't do anything to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inside the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful beings silently watched the two massive figures battling outside.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Galaxy can actually fight the Demon God to this extent?"</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Lord? Lord Galaxy must be an Eternal Lord, right?"</p><p></p><p>The several sect masters looked at each other. Originally they were very certain Lin Yuan was not an Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Because since the great change in heaven and earth, there had been no heavenly phenomena indicating someone crossing into the realm of Eternal Lord.</p><p></p><p>But now, they were uncertain about Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In a space of annihilation and collapse.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God, which had been locked in battle with Lin Yuan, swept its giant tail and suddenly retreated rapidly backwards.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also stopped, looking towards the Demon God that had stopped in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's form directly dissolved, merging into the vast demonic energy surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon God has retreated?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Very clearly, the Demon God had realized that continuing to fight with Lin Yuan like this, it would be constantly dragged along. Forget about destroying the hidden world, it couldn't even suppress the consciousness of the source world with its own instincts.</p><p></p><p>At first it had continuously attacked the hidden world because the Demon God saw hope in destroying it, as long as it persisted for hundreds of thousands or millions of years.</p><p></p><p>But fighting with Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>At this rate, even if they fought for hundreds of millions or billions of years, they wouldn't be able to determine a victor.</p><p></p><p>So it directly chose to retreat and leave.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God had no specific consciousness or will, and did not have complex emotions like saving face.</p><p></p><p>When it discovered there was no benefit to itself, it would make the most advantageous choice and decision.</p><p></p><p>"That's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the hidden world, countless living beings looked up, the Demon God's disappearance allowing them to more directly sense Lin Yuan's enormity. His true form stood between heaven and earth, having just finished battling the Demon God, the terrifying aura flowing over his body emitting an extremely great sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Is it over?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of several sect masters were excited.</p><p></p><p>Outside the source world.</p><p></p><p>In a distorted space-time.</p><p></p><p>More than ten towering figures stood here, their gazes occasionally looking towards the distant source world.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the area around the source world was filled with infinite demonic energy, as if the entire source world was wrapped in endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>But just then.</p><p></p><p>The expression of one of the towering figures suddenly changed, its gaze turning back towards the distant source world.</p><p></p><p>Its expression revealed a hint of disbelief: "That is?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

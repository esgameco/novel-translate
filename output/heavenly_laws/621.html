            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Jade Unicorn Great Saint looked at the All-Seeing Eye, "It is precisely because of this that the grudges and karmic retributions within the chaotic void, you cannot interfere with them, nor can you directly stop us."</p><p></p><p>"You can use your connections to get other peerless great saints to stop us, but how long can they stop us for?" the Jade Unicorn Great Saint said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, the Myriad Dao Pavilion had once helped many cultivators with great potential, and a few of these cultivators eventually became peerless great saints.</p><p></p><p>But as fellow peerless great saints, could he really expect them to turn against him just because of the help he had provided them in the past? The Jade Unicorn Great Saint did not think any peerless great saint would do that.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the galaxy was already before him, and this physical body was destined to be annihilated. The All-Seeing Eye could at most only stop him from pursuing the other true body incarnations of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>But the only ones capable of stopping him were the peerless great saints, and the peerless great saints basically would not do that.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was so.</p><p></p><p>It was a special existence related to the Thirteenth Realm, standing supreme in the chaotic void, and no peerless great saint dared to provoke it.</p><p></p><p>Even the Mysterious Emperor and the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master, those invincible great saints, would not provoke it.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, it was not a true temporal life, and could not instill much awe in the peerless great saints.</p><p></p><p>The peerless great saints at most only respected it, but did not fear it.</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>The Vast Heavens Great Saint spoke, he had no intention of completely offending the All-Seeing Eye, but he definitely would not let Lin Yuan, that Mysterious Yellow remnant, go.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's current strength, even if he could not become a peerless great saint in the future, as long as he waited for the Jade Unicorn and himself to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, he could easily strike at their clan.</p><p></p><p>The two peerless great saints had lived through countless universes, and their close relatives and friends had all perished, but their clan still remained.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Unicorn, Vast Heavens, I will remember you."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye dissipated on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Tear Fragment World.</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye looked at Lin Yuan, "Galaxy, I can't do anything."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye sighed, although it had predicted before intervening that the two peerless great saints would most likely not listen to it.</p><p></p><p>But when faced with this scene, the All-Seeing Eye still felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>"But with me here, those two can at most erase your physical body in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, as for all your true body incarnations, that's just wishful thinking."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye sneered and said, "I know of a few special and mysterious places that can isolate causality and space-time, and apart from me, no other living being, not even an invincible great saint, can enter."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye said, "Now you go prepare, bring your clan and friends, and I will teleport you there."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye could not directly interfere with the grudges within the chaotic void, but it could indirectly influence them.</p><p></p><p>Just like now, the two peerless great saints wanted to hunt down all of Lin Yuan's true body incarnations, so the All-Seeing Eye simply sent Lin Yuan to a place the two peerless great saints could not enter.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the two peerless great saints would be naturally helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was slightly grateful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without the All-Seeing Eye, Lin Yuan also had means to protect his spiritual incarnations.</p><p></p><p>The most secure way was to place all the human civilization clans into a miniature world, and then descend to other dimensional worlds through the Myriad Realms Gate.</p><p></p><p>As long as the human civilization clans within the miniature world did not come out, their world's changes could not be detected, and when Lin Yuan grew strong enough to sweep away those two peerless great saints, he could then bring the human civilization clans back.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this method involves different dimensions, and there may be the risk of exposing the Myriad Realms Gate.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was absolutely necessary, Lin Yuan still did not want to do this.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>"I'm also doing it for myself." The All-Seeing Eye said, "If you were to die at the hands of Jade Unicorn and the others, wouldn't all the effort I put into spreading the martial dao evolution path for you be in vain?"</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye helping Lin Yuan in this way also had its own plans.</p><p></p><p>One was that it was very optimistic about Lin Yuan, believing that as long as he grew smoothly, he would at least become an invincible great saint.</p><p></p><p>The other was that the All-Seeing Eye had already made many 'investments' in Lin Yuan, and naturally did not want to watch those two peerless great saints strike at him.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Unicorn Great Saint and the Vast Heavens Great Saint overlooked Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually quite curious, what have you gained in this Mysterious Yellow Universe? Did the Mysterious Emperor leave anything about us?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Unicorn Great Saint spoke.</p><p></p><p>Now the entire Mysterious Yellow Universe was under the control of the two of them, peerless great saints, so there was no hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed the two peerless great saints as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Emperor's mausoleum, there were numerous murals depicting the Mysterious Emperor's great deeds, recording this peerless great saint's rise from obscurity to overlooking the entire chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But from beginning to end, Lin Yuan had never seen any records about the Jade Unicorn Great Saint and the Vast Heavens Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>If he had not learned from the mausoleum's spirit that the Mysterious Emperor had erased thirty-nine of the physical bodies of these two peerless great saints before breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm, Lin Yuan would not have even known of their exploits.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing?"</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Emperor actually left no information about us?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Unicorn Great Saint's expression turned unsightly, and the Vast Heavens Great Saint next to him was the same.</p><p></p><p>The implication was that the Mysterious Emperor had never placed them in his sight.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, the auras of the two peerless great saints began to fluctuate slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stepped forward directly.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space-time began to distort, this was the Mysterious Yellow lineage's three great protective secret techniques - the "Nine Steps of Space-Time".</p><p></p><p>Facing the two peerless great saints, Lin Yuan had no intention of fighting them, so naturally his main goal was to escape.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Nine Steps of Space-Time'?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Unicorn Great Saint shook his head slightly, "We have long had methods to suppress this kind of escape secret technique, after chasing down so many Mysterious Yellow lineage disciples."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Yuan's control over the surrounding space-time began to be rapidly weakened.</p><p></p><p>"The first step has failed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, also looking up at the two peerless great saints.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, then I'll fight for my life."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kill him."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes burned with a fighting spirit, and the outer cosmic space began to spin frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Dragon Great Saint looked quite surprised. "Although you are not an ultimate Great Saint, you can actually make the Dao rules retreat and avoid you with your own domain. Impressive."</p><p></p><p>"I'm getting more and more eager to kill you," the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint's tone gradually turned icy.</p><p></p><p>The more terrifying Lin Yuan's performance became, the stronger the killing intent of these two ultimate Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint took the initiative to attack, slapping Lin Yuan's outer cosmic space.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious Yellow Universe, within the distorted space-time, the Eye of All Laws and a few other special existences still had not left.</p><p></p><p>"Eye of All Laws, what did you go in there for just now?"</p><p></p><p>The broken long sword swept a glance at the Eye of All Laws.</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws diverted a trace of power into the Mysterious Yellow Universe, so they naturally had some awareness of it.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing much, just wanted to take someone away."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws said.</p><p></p><p>"Take someone away?"</p><p></p><p>The broken long sword said, "Were you rejected by Chaotic Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>The Eye of All Laws nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>"The ants destined to be trapped in the time loop can only show off their might now." The broken long sword shook its head.</p><p></p><p>As an existence similar to the Eye of All Laws, it naturally stood on the opposite side of the ultimate Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ancient altar spirit nearby showed a slight surprise. "They're fighting in there?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the vast space-time fluctuations were faintly spreading in the Mysterious Yellow Universe, as if two prehistoric giant beasts were trembling in the deep water, causing the surface to become turbulent.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan was exerting his full strength to mobilize his outer cosmic space and contend with the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Fusing and devouring the source of the blazing sun, plus refining the second layer of the "Infinite Void" and refining the Dark Sky Heart, Lin Yuan's inner cosmic space was now a bit stronger than a normal ultimate Great Saint's inner cosmic space.</p><p></p><p>But the methods of an ultimate Great Saint are by no means limited to their inner cosmic space, let alone the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint, who was not an ordinary ultimate Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a match."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mood was heavy. Although he was barely able to contend with the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint at the moment, Lin Yuan was well aware that it was only temporary, and as time passed, he would inevitably be suppressed by this ultimate Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Detonate the outer cosmic space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of this method, and at the same time, he glanced at the other ultimate Great Saint, the Jade Dragon Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have too much hope in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now, there was only the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint, and suddenly detonating the outer cosmic space could indeed create an opportunity for him to escape.</p><p></p><p>But next to the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint, there was also the Jade Dragon Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppression of the two ultimate Great Saints, even if he detonated the outer cosmic space, he basically wouldn't have any hope of escaping.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I lose this physical body, I must destroy all the treasures and rarities to the end."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind. The weapons and equipment at the Great Saint level, he couldn't destroy them for the time being, but the treasures and rarities? He could annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In his inner cosmic space, the Mysterious Emperor's Mausoleum was floating, and the Mausoleum Spirit appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Can it block Chaotic Celestial and Jade Dragon?" The Mausoleum Spirit asked.</p><p></p><p>"It probably can't." Lin Yuan said truthfully. If the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint was not unwilling to pay any price during the process of suppressing him, Lin Yuan would have already been at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Ah." The Mausoleum Spirit fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan couldn't hold on, everything in the Mysterious Yellow Universe would fall into the hands of the enemies of the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Especially the three personal weapons of the Emperor, and that one pearl... "Crush that pearl." The Mausoleum Spirit said bitterly, as if making a certain decision.</p><p></p><p>"Crush that pearl?" Lin Yuan's brows furrowed. "Isn't that summoning the ultimate treasure the Emperor obtained from the dimensional gap?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered that the Mausoleum Spirit had said that once the Mysterious Yellow Pearl was crushed, it would summon the ultimate treasure the Emperor had obtained from the dimensional gap.</p><p></p><p>The treasure that he had gone to the trouble of breaking through to the Thirteenth Realm to preserve.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, just crush it."</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit said and then disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, Lin Yuan had a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>But since the Mausoleum Spirit said so, he wouldn't hesitate and directly took out the Mysterious Yellow Pearl.</p><p></p><p>The pearl was round, with a mysterious yellow color inside, and a faint aura of time lingered around it.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Pearl appeared in Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Celestial Great Saint and the Jade Dragon Great Saint also saw this scene, and the moment they saw the Mysterious Yellow Pearl, they vaguely sensed something.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Yuan grasped the Mysterious Yellow Pearl and gently squeezed.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The pearl made a crisp sound as it was crushed.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Mysterious Yellow Pearl was crushed, strands of the power of the timeline began to converge.</p><p></p><p>The space-time gradually manifested a series of scenes, which finally formed a closed loop, repeating endlessly like a cycle.</p><p></p><p>In the scene, there was a majestic celestial palace, with towering palaces and jade towers. In the highest temple, a man was sitting on the throne, resting his right hand on his head, as if he was sleeping.</p><p></p><p>But just as the Mysterious Yellow Pearl was crushed, this man seemed to have sensed something, and his closed eyes slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The man silently disappeared from the throne.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow Universe, next to Lin Yuan, a tall and mighty man had appeared, unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>The man's entire body was emanating a golden glow, perhaps the most imperial aura among the countless Great Saint-level powerhouses that had appeared in the chaos of the universe over millions and millions of universe cycles.</p><p></p><p>He stood silently next to Lin Yuan, with his hands behind his back, not looking at the Chaotic Celestial Great Saint and the Jade Dragon Great Saint, but glancing at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Celestial Great Saint and the Jade Dragon Great Saint were trembling in their spirits, almost turning around and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

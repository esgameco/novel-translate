            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The boundless, desolate void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan drifted along the thin, chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the All-Seeing Eye and a few other existences that had a deep karmic connection with Lin Yuan, even powerful experts passing by nearby would not be able to detect the slightest trace of Lin Yuan's aura.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's form and spirit seemed to have merged with the infinite chaotic qi and the vast void.</p><p></p><p>"That dimensional rift?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually glanced in a certain direction, and he had already condensed a projection to go there.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite cautious when it came to dimensional rifts.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor had obtained the 13th-tier divine weapon, the Heavenly Void Cauldron, from a dimensional rift. Even the Mysterious Emperor, with the strength of an invincible great saint, had almost suffered serious injuries there, showing how dangerous dimensional rifts could be.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's current strength was far beyond the Mysterious Emperor's at that time, but he would not be careless.</p><p></p><p>He only sent out a projection, both out of confidence in himself and to primarily explore the situation first.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were hidden dangers in that dimensional rift that the All-Seeing Eye had not detected, Lin Yuan would only lose a projection, which he could easily re-condense with a thought, without any impact on himself.</p><p></p><p>"I hope everything goes smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if the All-Seeing Eye guaranteed that, and even if Lin Yuan ultimately failed to retrieve that Dharma Source Fruit, as long as he took action, the karmic connection between them would be settled.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan naturally hoped that things would go well, as the All-Seeing Eye had indeed helped him save a lot of trouble in the past. Without the All-Seeing Eye, even with Lin Yuan's current strength, spreading the path of martial dao evolution would require tremendous effort and time, and the results might not be as good as with the All-Seeing Eye's help.</p><p></p><p>Even an invincible great saint could only overlook a certain era and ultimately had to break through to the 13th tier. But the All-Seeing Eye, as a special existence, was almost eternally lasting - as long as the chaotic void did not perish, it could continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? The 'Infinite Void' is about to complete its fourth layer?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness shifted, and a projection descended into his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>The boundless cosmic universe was about to undergo a certain transformation.</p><p></p><p>"Stop."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately halted the final transformation of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Infinite Void' cultivation I practice was created by a certain time life in the chaotic void, with the chaotic void as the ultimate goal. Theoretically, upon reaching the seventh layer, the cosmic universe within me could transform into an existence comparable to the scale of the chaotic void."</p><p></p><p>Of course, even the creator of this cultivation method had not reached the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>If one could truly cultivate the seventh layer, they would be considered extremely powerful even among the 13th-tier experts, and might not be far from becoming a time lord.</p><p></p><p>In the second source world, the Lord of Mount Wu's pursuit was to paint a 'source world', and once he succeeded, he could ascend to the realm of a time lord.</p><p></p><p>While the 'Infinite Void' cultivation aimed to nurture a chaotic void-like cosmic universe within oneself, the ultimate goals were similar.</p><p></p><p>"If I had not descended into the first and second source worlds, I might have thought this cultivation method was perfect, as it came from the hands of a great time life. How could their insights and vision be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the two source worlds, Lin Yuan realized that even time lives might not always be right.</p><p></p><p>For example, this 'Infinite Void' cultivation, not that it was wrong, but the cosmic universe it nurtured, comparable to the chaotic void, was it really perfect?</p><p></p><p>Even the chaotic void itself was not perfect, and required special places opened up by various time lives to compensate for its flaws.</p><p></p><p>How could the cosmic universe modeled after the chaotic void be perfect?</p><p></p><p>It was just that the time life who established this cultivation method could only interact with the chaotic void, and had no reference to other, more perfect dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>Even if time lives could traverse dimensional gaps, it was extremely difficult for them to explore and interact with other dimensional spaces, as they would either be unable to find them, or face strong rejection from those dimensions, as well as obstruction from the time lives born in those dimensions.</p><p></p><p>For example, if other dimensional time lives wanted to approach the chaotic void, they would be obstructed by the time lives born in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Gate of All Worlds, he could silently integrate into the worlds within various dimensional spaces.</p><p></p><p>He even had two source worlds that were more perfect than the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>In the first source world, Lin Yuan observed the fundamental operation of the source and the micro-source world nurtured within the Abyss Dragon's Heart. His understanding of that source world exceeded even the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>In the second source world, Lin Yuan comprehended the half-completed Eternal Painting drawn by the Lord of Mount Wu, which depicted that source world.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yuan had also deeply understood the Celestial Lord's comprehension of the 'Omnipotence' rune.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Lin Yuan have an in-depth understanding of the basic operation and essence of the second source world, but he had also surpassed any Carefree Celestial Realm expert in that world.</p><p></p><p>"The ultimate transformation direction of my cosmic universe cannot be the chaotic void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Whether he could truly become a time lord by pursuing the chaotic void as the ultimate goal was debatable.</p><p></p><p>"It should be based on the boundless myriad realms and endless dimensional planes. This is the direction my cosmic universe should transform towards."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind flashed with the details of the first and second source worlds, especially their fundamental operations, and he began to slowly integrate them into his own cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>This had to be completed before he finished cultivating the fourth layer of the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so could he lay the foundation before the root of his cosmic universe was established, so that he could continue to integrate more source world essences in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why source worlds are called source worlds is that they are more perfect and closer to true perfection than other worlds of the same level. By absorbing the fundamental operations of source worlds, my cosmic universe will also become more perfect, and may even have the hope of becoming truly perfect one day."</p><p></p><p>"A perfect world? That is a world that can only be opened up by a 14th-tier perfect time life. Once my cosmic universe transforms to true perfection, I may not be far from becoming a 14th-tier perfect time life."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just Lin Yuan's speculation. He had very little clue about how to actually become a 14th-tier perfect time life.</p><p></p><p>Perfect time lives could freely traverse the timeline, existing in the past, present, and future, and could even create the future they desired - a level of existence that ordinary lives could not even imagine.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Mount Wu's ultimate pursuit was only to paint a source world and ascend to the realm of a time lord.</p><p></p><p>As for becoming a perfect time life? The only thing Lin Yuan knew was that the prerequisite was perfection.</p><p></p><p>If his cosmic universe truly reached perfection, perhaps he would be very close to becoming a perfect time life? "Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to integrate the fundamental operations of the two source worlds into his cosmic universe.</p><p></p><p>For now, the realm of a perfect time life was still too far for him, as he had not even become a time life yet.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>His cosmic universe continued to resonate and transform. This transformation was different from...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Void - That kind of reconstruction and reorganization.</p><p></p><p>But the most fundamental existence has been changed.</p><p></p><p>It's like an iron knife and a golden knife.</p><p></p><p>Just a few hundred breaths ago.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental operations of the two source worlds have completely merged into the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this matter of taking the advantages of the two source worlds and perfectly integrating them into one's own internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already started preparing for it long ago, and now that he is putting it into practice, it naturally goes very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's step into the 5th layer of the Infinite Void."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully felt it for a while, and began the final transformation of his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>The 5th layer of the Infinite Void is a turning point.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a supreme sage cultivating to the 5th layer of this inherited legacy would possess the invincible strength of a supreme sage.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had integrated the fundamental operational advantages of the two source worlds even before reaching the 5th layer.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Accompanied by the final transformation of the internal universe.</p><p></p><p>An invisible aura began to sweep in.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the internal universe completed its transformation.</p><p></p><p>"After the fusion of the internal universe, and stepping into the 5th layer of the Infinite Void"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt his strength rise again.</p><p></p><p>"Now, even if I'm just an avatar, I can be on par with the Abyss Dragon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the avatar has not been cultivated, the internal universe is still normally developed. The only difference is that it is not as boundless as the true body's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>With the internal universe perfectly integrating the advantages of the two source worlds, and also stepping into the 5th layer of the Infinite Void, the avatar's strength has soared, completely reaching the Abyss Dragon realm.</p><p></p><p>"An avatar can be equivalent to an Abyss Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. At the beginning of the first source world, it took the gathering of countless causes and conditions to give birth to an Abyss Dragon. Now, the avatar he casually condensed can reach this realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is just right, the hope of retrieving the Law Source Fruit is greater."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>In the internal universe, next to the Jade Gourd, the red-robed little girl was swinging her legs back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>A mysterious fluctuation swept in.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl immediately jumped up.</p><p></p><p>"Has he stepped into the 5th layer of the Infinite Void?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl widened her eyes, full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Although she had already known that Lin Yuan would reach this level, it was just a matter of time. But when this day really arrived, it was still somewhat unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed is really too fast.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Void is a 13th-tier inheritance, not everyone can cultivate to the 5th layer.</p><p></p><p>Even those who pass the initial test and are very compatible with this inheritance, those who can step into the 5th layer are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Generally, there would only be one 5th layer cultivator out of hundreds of inheritance cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The question is no longer whether Lin Yuan can step into the 5th layer, but the speed at which he does it, which is unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>It makes the red-robed little girl's cognition start to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"No, something's wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the red-robed little girl's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Although the aura sweeping in from the internal universe is very similar to stepping into the 5th layer of the Infinite Void, after careful perception, the red-robed little girl confirmed that it is different from the normal 5th layer of the Infinite Void.</p><p></p><p>Similar yet different.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure solidified in the distance, and he smiled at the red-robed little girl, "I just modified the Infinite Void inheritance a bit."</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Infinite Void pursued the ultimate goal of chaotic void, but now the ultimate goal has changed to a more perfect world, and the cultivation method in the middle naturally needs to be modified.</p><p></p><p>"Modified?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl became even more silent.</p><p></p><p>The 13th-tier inheritance, the hard work of time and life, has basically reached the extreme in all aspects, and even other time lives may not be able to modify it, but Lin Yuan directly modified it? What's more amazing to the red-robed little girl is that the modified 5th layer of the Infinite Void gives her a more majestic and deeper feeling.</p><p></p><p>This is different from Lin Yuan's previous integration of other 13th-tier methods.</p><p></p><p>This kind of modification is from the root of the inheritance, the two are fundamentally different.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the current Infinite Void is more suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled, only the secret law inheritance he created himself can perfectly match himself.</p><p></p><p>As for the inheritances created by other existences? Even the great 13th-tier lives cannot perfectly match every life.</p><p></p><p>They can only be relatively compatible.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed little girl was a bit confused, but still nodded.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Chaotic Void, in front of a dimension rift that was constantly shrinking, more than ten figures stood in the distance, gazing at the distant dimension rift.</p><p></p><p>These more than ten figures were all supreme sages, the powerful ones summoned by the All-Seeing Eye to enter the dimension rift and retrieve the Law Source Fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, now.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the more than ten supreme sages were extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>The dimension rift was rapidly shrinking, and their main combat bodies were still not withdrawn, still fighting on the small continent within the rift with the dimensional life.</p><p></p><p>The environment within the dimension rift is completely different from the Chaotic Void, and even supreme sages will be greatly suppressed in such an unfamiliar environment.</p><p></p><p>"This dimension rift will be completely closed in at most three days, and if our main combat bodies don't make it back in three days..." One of the supreme sages couldn't help but speak.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chaotic Void, the dimension rift is extremely dangerous, and life forms below the 13th tier face the risk of death at any time in the dimension rift.</p><p></p><p>Once this dimension rift is closed, it is equivalent to the main combat bodies of the more than ten supreme sages being completely trapped outside the Chaotic Void, which is no different from complete annihilation.</p><p></p><p>It's only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Even for supreme sages, it is not easy to cultivate a main combat body, and it requires a lot of effort and blood.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Zhu, have you told Senior Wanfa? That Law Source Fruit is very difficult to retrieve, it's better for us to withdraw." The second supreme sage spoke.</p><p></p><p>The dimension rift will close in three days, and the hope of retrieving the Law Source Fruit in these three days is almost zero.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the supreme sages naturally do not want to continue fighting on the small continent, but want to withdraw their main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>This way, the loss will be less.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wanfa said he has summoned other sages to support us, and there is still hope."</p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu the supreme sage said, he had the closest relationship with the All-Seeing Eye, and knew many things in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Other sages? On that small continent outside the rift, the native creatures are extremely ferocious, even if more sages are summoned, it will be very difficult to retrieve the Law Source Fruit within three days."</p><p></p><p>The first supreme sage who spoke said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Zhu, which sage did Senior Wanfa summon exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The third supreme sage asked, he felt that the All-Seeing Eye had not given up, and must have some confidence.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the rest of the supreme sages all looked at Feng Zhu.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wanfa said he summoned..." </p><p></p><p>Feng Zhu swept his gaze across the many sages, and slowly said, "The Galactic Sage!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

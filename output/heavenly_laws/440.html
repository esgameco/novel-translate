            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 440: Toba Gushen's Confidence (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"This should be considered the riverbed, right?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed his surroundings. The stronger a being's life essence, the heavier its weight within the long river of time. </p><p></p><p>It would sink deeper into the depths of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>And now Lin Yuan was positioned at the bottom of the river of time, the riverbed.</p><p></p><p>This was already the deepest part of the river of time, with nowhere deeper to sink.</p><p></p><p>"So many lifeforms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around, seeing countless specks of light floating in the river of time, each representing a life. The vast array of life lights drifted and flowed with the currents of the river.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the life lights were unable to regain consciousness, to realize they were in the river of time. Only by comprehending the rules of time could one achieve that.</p><p></p><p>And comprehending the rules of time could basically only be done at the 11th stage.</p><p></p><p>"There are some 'small fish', and a few 'big fish'." Lin Yuan kept observing, moving his body in the river.</p><p></p><p>The larger the being, the clearer its vision within the river of time, able to see farther.</p><p></p><p>Those who had just comprehended the rules of time could only see dozens of meters around them in the river, anything farther became blurred.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try going against the current."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, and he began walking upstream, towards the past.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the rules of time, one gained the ability to go against the current.</p><p></p><p>But generally no 11th stage being would do this, because it served no purpose.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the rules of time did allow one to go against the current, but for an 11th stage life, this act was extremely strenuous.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was going against the flow of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Only the strongest would go against the current, in order to revive lifeforms that had died in the past.</p><p></p><p>An 11th stage life going against the current? With an 11th stage life essence, they could not withstand the backlash of reviving a being from the past. Even just reviving a 6th stage life would instantly be crushed into nothingness by the vast river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed the source of the river of time, trudging step-by-step, until he finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>"This life light, it's gray?"</p><p></p><p>A gray life light that no longer flowed with the river of time represented a life that had died in the past.</p><p></p><p>"With my current life essence, I should be able to bear forcibly retrieving this life light, and placing it at the newest time node to withstand the backlash."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was the "revival" method.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's life essence was so powerful that he could actually revive a 6th stage life that had died in the past. In the vast cosmos of races, this was simply a celestial myth.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, revival had been a means only available to 12th stage ultimates. Even the most prodigious 11th stage lives could not withstand the backlash of revival.</p><p></p><p>"Reviving a 7th stage life." Lin Yuan then looked towards a slightly larger gray light in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Reviving this gray light would bring Lin Yuan some pressure - he could do it, but would be severely injured from the backlash of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"Keep going against the current."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried with interest, an 11th stage life going against the raging river of time was extremely strenuous, but for Lin Yuan it was simple, the surging torrents at most providing some resistance.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the river of time?"</p><p></p><p>A life that had only recently comprehended the rules of time, at the 11th stage, looked around excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the rules of time at the 11th stage placed one in the second tier, no longer a newcomer.</p><p></p><p>"It's so vast."</p><p></p><p>"How can one break free from such a vast river of time?"</p><p></p><p>This 11th stage life felt both excitement and despair.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the 11th stage basically meant harboring hopes of breaking through to the ultimate stage.</p><p></p><p>But this vast river of time made all 11th stage lives realize</p><p></p><p>Just how slim their chances were of eventually crossing into the 12th stage.</p><p></p><p>The river of time reflected one's life essence, allowing a clear perception of the gap between oneself and the entire river.</p><p></p><p>Right now, this 11th stage life felt strained just going slightly against the river's flow, let alone breaking free from it entirely.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>This 11th stage life who had just entered the second tier felt a terrifying undercurrent surging from the bottom of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>The 11th stage life was battered by this undercurrent, taking a long time to recover.</p><p></p><p>"What was that, that undercurrent?"</p><p></p><p>The 11th stage life was full of confusion, straining to look towards the riverbed.</p><p></p><p>With his life essence...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The quality was such that he could clearly see dozens of meters around, but anything farther would become extremely blurred. </p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>The 11th level life form gazed as far as possible towards the depths of the river bottom, vaguely making out a massive entity occupying the entire riverbed, advancing against the flow of the river of time towards the source.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that indistinct massive entity, the 11th level life form was like an ant.</p><p></p><p>"With such an enormous size, and moving against the current, is it a supreme being?" This 11th level life form was shaken in his heart, with a vague sense that something was off.</p><p></p><p>Weren't supreme beings supposed to have broken free from the shackles of the river of time? How could it still be inside the river of time?</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>A towering figure vaguely sensed something, lowering his head to gaze upon the vast river waters.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>This towering figure was naturally a 12th level ultimate being. He studied the river of time with slight puzzlement, sensing the surging waters were more turbulent than usual.</p><p></p><p>"What could be the reason?"</p><p></p><p>The towering figure furrowed his brow slightly, but did not take any action.</p><p></p><p>Breaking free from the river of time's shackles did not mean having control over the river of time for a 12th level being.</p><p></p><p>In fact, a 12th level being's perception within the river of time was very low. To revive past lives that had perished required using a life imprint as "coordinates" to make it possible to perceive.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, if a 12th level being touched the river waters again after breaking free from the river of time, it would pose an immense hidden danger to their fundamental dao, possibly even resulting in being bound by the river of time once more.</p><p></p><p>Even supreme beings had to be extremely cautious when reviving past perished lives by touching the river waters, making contact then immediately withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>"Is there an issue with the flow of time in a certain space?"</p><p></p><p>The towering figure speculated in his heart that the excess turbulence within the river of time was most likely caused by the flow of time in a certain region of the prime universe differing from the surrounding mainstream flow of time.</p><p></p><p>Different flows of time would manifest in the river of time like "reefs".</p><p></p><p>The larger the region enveloped by the differential flow of time, and the greater the difference from the mainstream flow, the larger the "reef" would be, thereby affecting other regions of the river of time and creating turbulent undercurrents.</p><p></p><p>"Whose ultimate being's doing is this?"</p><p></p><p>This towering figure idly pondered, for such a wide-ranging differential in the flow of time could only be accomplished by a fellow 12th level ultimate being.</p><p></p><p>Within the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"With my current life essence, the highest I can revive is a 7th level life form. Reviving an 8th level life form would be too much for me to withstand the river of time's backlash."</p><p></p><p>After many attempts, Linyuan arrived at this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The river of time's backlash could only be resisted by one's life essence; external objects were useless.</p><p></p><p>"I now possess certain characteristics of a supreme being." A smile appeared on Linyuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Although unable to easily revive 11th level life forms like a true supreme being, Linyuan had at least accomplished something only supreme beings could do.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Linyuan began following the river of time back to the current time node.</p><p></p><p>Remaining in past time nodes for too long would constantly expose one to the scouring of the river of time. In this situation, even though Linyuan could endure for a very long time, he would still be most comfortable in his own time node.</p><p></p><p>Main galaxy star.</p><p></p><p>Linyuan's consciousness returned.</p><p></p><p>The many experiments in the river of time gave Linyuan a more concrete grasp of his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, the essence of all life forms within the river of time was far inferior to his own.</p><p></p><p>During his journey against the current, Linyuan had also glimpsed from afar those legendary 11th level perfected life forms, but compared to himself, they did not even measure up to his toenails.</p><p></p><p>"There is still a huge gap compared to supreme beings."</p><p></p><p>"I shall continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Just as Linyuan was about to contemplate the rules, his mind stirred and he broke into a smile, "Those three supreme being armaments have been successfully refined."</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, Linyuan's solar celestial spirit sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Before him floated three armaments - a silver battle saber, a golden armor, and a deep azure bead.</p><p></p><p>They were respectively offensive supreme being armament, material defense supreme being armament, and spirit defense supreme being armament.</p><p></p><p>In Linyuan's original plan, it would have taken several years to successfully refine these three supreme being armaments.</p><p></p><p>But breaking through to the 11th level caused Linyuan's overall abilities to explosively increase, accelerating the refinement speed such that he accomplished it in just a few months.</p><p></p><p>"With these three supreme being armaments, my strength will be greatly augmented once more."</p><p></p><p>Linyuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Reassessing in terms of battle power:</p><p></p><p>An ordinary perfected 11th level being had a battle power of 10.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the 11th level, Linyuan's battle power was 10,000.</p><p></p><p>With...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Now that the two major supporting fusion rules have reached the seventh boundary, coupled with the successful refinement of these three extremely powerful weapons, Lin Yuan's ultimate limit of combat strength may possibly reach tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand. </p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that even for a twelfth-level paragon, the threshold of combat strength is just around a million.</p><p></p><p>"If I employ the fleshly divine ability 'World' to directly self-detonate the world, the might within a short period of time may perhaps reach two to three million?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rapidly thought in his mind. The divine ability "World" was Lin Yuan's fifth fleshly divine ability, a purely offensive divine ability. It was also one of Lin Yuan's strongest trump cards. Even the might of the paramount weapons couldn't compare to the instantaneous power of the self-detonating "World".</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the paramount weapons were ineffective, but rather Lin Yuan couldn't fully unleash their upper limits. Normally, in the hands of a twelfth-level expert, paramount weapons could emanate power exceeding a million.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan lightly slashed the empty space with the silver battle blade in his hand. A jet-black crack appeared, vaguely revealing the myriad layers of void outside.</p><p></p><p>After the preliminary refinement of the paramount weapons, as long as Lin Yuan willed it, he could casually tear open the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Galactic Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tested the might of the paramount weapons, especially that offensive silver battle blade, feeling quite satisfied in his heart. However, Lin Yuan then continued to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Although the paramount weapons granted Lin Yuan an immense boost in combat strength, they were ultimately external objects. Lin Yuan hoped to become powerful himself, relying on the paramount weapons to possess unmatched might compared to paragons.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by. In the blink of an eye, four months passed.</p><p></p><p>"The super large-scale battlefield has opened."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan ended his cultivation and looked towards the source of the space-time fluctuations he sensed.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the super large-scale battlefield opened, Lin Yuan had been constantly sensing the space-time fluctuations emanating from there.</p><p></p><p>Just now, these space-time fluctuations suddenly intensified.</p><p></p><p>This meant the space-time of the super large-scale battlefield had finally stabilized completely.</p><p></p><p>With a thought of "super large-scale battlefield", Lin Yuan's solar celestial spirit set out, instantly heading towards the Xiayou Evolution Spire.</p><p></p><p>The super large-scale battlefield was currently the highest-level rule battlefield established by the various peak races. It could withstand the brief clashes between twelfth-level experts and fully accommodate eleventh-level experts wielding paramount weapons to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>With the completion of the super large-scale battlefield, the human civilization began summoning eleventh-level evolutionaries, centered around the nine evolution spires, gathering the vast majority of eleventh-level evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>Although the nine paragons of the human civilization were all aware that Lin Yuan's strength could crush a perfect eleventh-level, they had made other preparations as well.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the super large-scale battlefield, it appeared to be a melee between eleventh-level experts, but in secret, it was a collision between twelfth-level ultimate beings.</p><p></p><p>Numerous paramount weapons, and even the final moves left behind by paragons and ultimate beings...in theory, paragons were not allowed to personally take the field.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, no one knew for sure.</p><p></p><p>The so-called rules of the super large-scale battlefield were set by the paragons themselves.</p><p></p><p>If things really got out of hand, it was possible for the paragons to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this possibility was very small. Most paragons valued their reputations, and unless absolutely necessary, they wouldn't break the rules they had set themselves.</p><p></p><p>Within the insect race's domain.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God and a group of eleventh-level ancient gods emerged from a certain space belonging to the insect race.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba, your avatar still hasn't finished cultivating. Are you planning to enter the super large-scale inter-racial battlefield with your true self?" One of the ancient gods looked at Tuoba Ancient God and couldn't help but speak.</p><p></p><p>The insect race alliance also attached great importance to the opening of the super large-scale battlefield. Not only did they order many of the eleventh-level experts within the alliance to participate, but they also spent a huge price to invite independent eleventh-level experts from all over.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God had no intention of fighting for the insect race, but what they offered was simply too much, to the point where he couldn't resist sending out his true self.</p><p></p><p>Ever since his avatar was destroyed by Lin Yuan in the two-dimensional world, Tuoba Ancient God's avatar had yet to fully cultivate.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, Tuoba Ancient God had already condensed an avatar, but so far, the avatar's combat strength was significantly weaker than his true self.</p><p></p><p>Condensing an avatar was easy, but condensing one with strength comparable to the true self required expending a great deal of time, effort, and even resources.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to the two-dimensional world, Tuoba Ancient God's mind and will had suffered permanent damage. Forcibly condensing an avatar would also greatly impact his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have it under control."</p><p></p><p>Tuoba Ancient God looked at the ancient god who had reminded him and responded.</p><p></p><p>Since he had agreed to the insect race's request, he must have had full confidence in his heart.</p>

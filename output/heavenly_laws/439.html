            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 439: Time River's Lin Yuan (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"The key trump card?" Deputy Tower Master Nalan's eyes lit up, immediately becoming interested. </p><p></p><p>He would also enter the massive battlefield, so he was naturally very interested in the human civilization's methods.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Du had the strongest Xuanyuan experts behind him, so he might know a lot of top-secret information.</p><p></p><p>"The key trump card?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred as well.</p><p></p><p>He had discussed many things about the massive battlefield with the strongest Xia Qin experts, and the human civilization did prepare some trump cards, but could they really be called "key"? </p><p></p><p>"Did the strongest Xuanyuan experts tell you?" Deputy Tower Master Nalan looked at Xuanyuan Du expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"No." Xuanyuan Du shook her head. "I guessed it myself."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Deputy Tower Master Nalan was stunned for a moment, not quite reacting.</p><p></p><p>Guessed it herself?</p><p></p><p>"Nalan, you've also experienced the two-dimensional world. You must remember that great person?" Xuanyuan Du turned to look at Deputy Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"That great person..." Deputy Tower Master Nalan's expression changed slightly. "Are you referring to the 'Blood Rain' great person?"</p><p></p><p>Any human evolutionary who fell into the two-dimensional world found it hard to forget that "Blood Rain" great person who appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't just the human evolutionaries; many experts from the starry races were also deeply impressed by the human "Blood Rain."</p><p></p><p>From the very first time the heavenly gates opened in the two-dimensional world, it was the era of the human "Blood Rain." Many eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms, including the Four Celestial Kings who wielded ultimate weapons suited for them, were trampled underfoot by the human "Blood Rain."</p><p></p><p>When the two-dimensional world ended, that "blank sheet" vanished from the universe. The starry races, including the human civilization, all sought information about that "Blood Rain" great person.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were no clues.</p><p></p><p>But undoubtedly, that "Blood Rain" great person existed and seemed to have walked out of the two-dimensional world, becoming the only surviving lifeform among the experts of all races.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the starry races speculated that Blood Rain should be one of the hidden evolutionaries of the human civilization; otherwise, there wouldn't be a complete lack of information.</p><p></p><p>The eleven-level evolutionaries that the current human civilization openly displayed did not exceed one thousand.</p><p></p><p>These thousand eleven-level evolutionaries referred to the open ones. In reality, the human civilization also cultivated another batch of evolutionaries in secret.</p><p></p><p>This was the hidden force of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Not only the human civilization, but other racial forces in the universe also had such preparations.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that the Blood Rain great person will also enter the massive battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan immediately reacted, looking at Xuanyuan Du with excitement in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Probably."</p><p></p><p>"For such a major event that will impact the entire universe, the Blood Rain great person will definitely participate."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Du said. This was also her guess.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanyuan Du had also inquired with the strongest Xuanyuan experts, but she didn't receive any response. However, she firmly believed that the Blood Rain great person would definitely take action in the upcoming massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"If the Blood Rain great person participates, then everything will be easier to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan said.</p><p></p><p>Although the massive alien battlefield was not like the two-dimensional world, where one could wield ultimate weapons without restraint, and there might even be interference from the twelfth-level ultimate observers, with the dominance the Blood Rain great person displayed in the two-dimensional world, even in the massive alien battlefield, he would undoubtedly be the strongest group. At the very least, with the Blood Rain great person presiding, the human civilization's chances of taking the lead would increase.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently listened to the exchange between Xuanyuan Du and Deputy Tower Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, Xuanyuan Du didn't guess wrong. The "Blood Rain" from the two-dimensional world was indeed Lin Yuan, and in this upcoming massive battlefield, Lin Yuan would also participate.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Stellar Master, in the two-dimensional world, you missed the opportunity to meet the Blood Rain great person. In this massive battlefield, you should have another chance."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan looked at Lin Yuan with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Not every eleven-level expert has the opportunity to see the Blood Rain great person."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan Du also chimed in from the side.</p><p></p><p>Neither Xuanyuan Du nor Deputy Tower Master Nalan had the slightest inkling that the Blood Rain great person they spoke of was right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The gathering only lasted for half a day.</p><p></p><p>After the many eleven-level evolutionary experts exchanged for a while, they gradually dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Galactic Stellar Master.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Tao-Opening Realm..." Lin Yuan's mind flickered with bits and pieces about the twelfth-level Tao-Opening Realm.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the Tao-Opening Realm was to open one's own great Tao. Only then could one truly stabilize the twelfth-level realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what great Tao I will open?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite curious in his heart. Normally, the great path opened by the twelfth level would have been determined during the successful breakthrough to the ultimate realm. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, it would just be a gradual progression.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to begin cultivating and comprehending the Dao. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A profound and far-reaching ripple of space-time came from the distant starry depths.</p><p></p><p>"Where is that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up, "The location where the super large battlefield is being opened?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought quickly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In order to ensure that this super large battlefield being opened would be sturdy enough to withstand the unrestrained slaughter of the eleventh level perfected beings wielding supreme weapons, the supreme experts joined hands to drag out dozens of large cosmic secret realms from the depths of the void realm and fuse them together as the foundation of the super large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>According to the predictions of the supreme expert Xia Qin, the super large battlefield that would ultimately be opened could withstand extremely high combat strength, even allowing for the brief clash of twelfth level forces.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the means of the twelfth level realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed that even those at the space-time quintuple realm of eleventh level perfection could only vaguely perceive this kind of space-time ripple.</p><p></p><p>However, with Lin Yuan's comprehension of the space-time sextuple realm, he could vaguely recreate the scene in the distant depths of space-time where several supreme experts manipulated space-time to fuse and refine the vast secret realms.</p><p></p><p>"Although I also have the comprehension of the space-time sextuple realm, I am still far from a true twelfth level ultimate."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan also realized this point.</p><p></p><p>Although his space-time comprehension was the same as the twelfth level supreme beings, the power foundations were too far apart.</p><p></p><p>With blades of the same quality and level, one wielded with a hundred pounds of force, the other with a hundred tons - the destructive power they could unleash was naturally not on the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly."</p><p></p><p>"I have only been cultivating for so long."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan yearned for the Dao-defying realm and the twelfth level, he also knew that accumulation was most crucial for him now.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan could breakthrough to the ultimate realm at any time, and his hope of crossing into the twelfth level was much, much greater than any other eleventh level perfected cultivator, he still would not rashly attempt the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Once he began the breakthrough to the ultimate realm, there would be no path of retreat - either he would successfully cross into the twelfth level, or under the backlash of the long river of time, all traces of him would be erased.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not know if the Realm Gate could preserve his life, but for now he naturally assumed the worst scenario.</p><p></p><p>"The celebration for the eleventh level shall be set in a month's time."</p><p></p><p>While cultivating and comprehending the Dao, Lin Yuan had also received many congratulatory messages for crossing into the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Every new eleventh level cultivator had to hold a celebration to awe foreign races. Previously, when Vice Sect Master Nalan crossed into the eleventh level, he did the same.</p><p></p><p>As a member of human civilization, Lin Yuan naturally could not be an exception.</p><p></p><p>After all, holding a celebration brought tangible benefits for Lin Yuan - a large number of celebratory gifts.</p><p></p><p>A few hundred years ago, at the celebration for Lin Yuan's crossing into the tenth level, he received congratulatory gifts and spirit stones from various powers totaling seven to eight million cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>Seven to eight million cosmic crystals was not much for the current Lin Yuan, but one must know that this was only the gifts received for the tenth level celebration.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when Lin Yuan had just entered the tenth level, seven to eight million cosmic crystals was already a considerable sum.</p><p></p><p>And now.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan crossing into the eleventh level, the scale, prestige, number of congratulating powers, and value of gifts at his eleventh level celebration would far surpass his tenth level celebration.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, who was worried about the vast resources needed to cultivate the 'Profound Golden Body', these celebratory gifts were like charcoal in the snow.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could not fill all the resource needs for cultivating to eleventh level perfection of the 'Profound Golden Body', they could at least alleviate some of the pressure on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The eleventh level celebration held by Lin Yuan far exceeded the one held by Vice Sect Master Nalan in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it.</p><p></p><p>Although both Lin Yuan and Vice Sect Master Nalan held eleventh level celebrations, the significance they represented was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Many powers of human civilization could disregard Vice Sect Master Nalan, but they did not dare defy the Celestial Lord of the Galaxy in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>When Vice Sect Master Nalan crossed into the eleventh level, his eventual limit would just be eleventh level perfection, with almost no possibility of crossing into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Lord of the Galaxy had the hope of crossing into the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>If the Celestial Lord of the Galaxy did cross into the twelfth level in the future, becoming the tenth supreme expert of human civilization...</p><p></p><p>Then those powers that did not come to congratulate today, or those that...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The families who sent insufficient gift money will probably regret it immensely. </p><p></p><p>Rather than regretting it later, it's better to handle things satisfactorily now.</p><p></p><p>This is the thinking of all the major civilizational forces.</p><p></p><p>So it led to —</p><p></p><p>At this 11th rank celebration, the total congratulatory gift money Lin Yuan received reached:</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred and twenty billion universal crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tallied up the total gift money received, a smile appearing on his face. </p><p></p><p>Three hundred and twenty billion universal crystals, estimated to surpass the entire net worth of over a dozen ordinary 11th rank evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>With such an enormous amount of universal crystals, exchanged for various resources and leveraging the high-level citizen discounts Lin Yuan enjoyed, it was estimated he could massively propel forward the cultivation progress of the 'Xuanhuang Physique.'</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred and twenty billion universal crystals, plus the crystals I've accumulated over the years, perhaps I can cultivate the 'Xuanhuang Physique' to the great completion of the 11th rank?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The main constraints on cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Physique' were two aspects: one was the xuanhuang crystals, which Lin Yuan did not lack.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated xuanhuang crystals from so many years in the xuanhuang secret realm were completely sufficient, and there were also so many xuanhuang beasts continuously birthing new xuanhuang crystals.</p><p></p><p>So the main shackle limiting Lin Yuan's 'Xuanhuang Physique' cultivation was resources.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Three months went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>On the galactic main star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with epiphanies of spiritual light continuously emerging in his mind, driving the elevation of his realm of rules.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally comprehended the seventh level of the Great Destruction rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Great Destruction rules were a pillar-level fusion of rules, with the seventh level already in the 12th rank domain.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan was at the 10th rank, he had already comprehended this pillar-level fusion of rules to the apex of the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>Now having crossed into the 11th rank, his comprehension speed soared, so comprehending the seventh level was only natural.</p><p></p><p>In fact, over these three months, the pillar-level fusion of rules that first reached the seventh level was not the Great Destruction rules, but rather the rules of life and death reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"My inner world has expanded again."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, his consciousness descended into his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Crossing into the 11th rank triggered an infusion of primal chaos void essence, causing Lin Yuan's inner world to break through its shackles and limitations.</p><p></p><p>Although without the impartation of a 12th rank life essence to propel it, Lin Yuan's inner world could not reach tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of light-years in size.</p><p></p><p>But it was also no longer shackled, and every time Lin Yuan made progress in his realm of rules, his inner world would expand significantly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, his inner world continuously absorbed the permeating primal chaos void essence, also causing it to slowly expand.</p><p></p><p>However, the speed was too slow, far inferior to the ferocious expansion driven by elevating his realm of rules.</p><p></p><p>Right after crossing into the 11th rank, Lin Yuan's inner world reached six trillion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>But now, following the comprehension of two seventh-level pillar-fusion rules, Lin Yuan's inner world had explosively swelled to six trillion five hundred billion miles in diameter.</p><p></p><p>A full increase of five hundred billion miles to his inner world.</p><p></p><p>"With my current level of life essence, I wonder what I would appear like if projected into the river of time?"</p><p></p><p>A slight thought stirred in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Cosmic beings existed within the river of time.</p><p></p><p>However, only by comprehending the rules of time could one's consciousness descend into the river of time to briefly survey the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>And every being existed within the river of time, with a corresponding projection.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the more powerful a being's life essence, the more enormous their projection in the river of time would appear.</p><p></p><p>At the 10th rank, a being was already considered a small fish in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>While an 11th rank being could be considered a big fish.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful the life essence, the more gigantic the form projected into the deeper levels of the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan's consciousness swiftly merged into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive, constricted sensation rushed to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked around.</p><p></p><p>This was an inconceivable river, vast and boundless, with no end in sight.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, Lin Yuan's enormous body filled the entire riverbed.</p><p></p><p>Vast amounts of raging river water surged past, unable to budge Lin Yuan's body at all.</p><p></p><p>"Too crowded."</p><p></p><p>This thought emerged in Lin Yuan's mind - the originally vast and expansive river of time now gave a sense of being unable to accommodate him.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's casual bodily movements caused the river waters to surge violently towards the shores, who knows how many "big fish" were startled and fled madly in other directions.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 528</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the world inside the jade gourd was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>Not a single rune remained floating.</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand three hundred and thirty-three methods of constructing an internal universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind flashed with fragments from the numerous runes. He had now fully comprehended all the runes.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder one needs to comprehend all three thousand three hundred and thirty-three runes to pass the test," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The three thousand three hundred and thirty-three runes represented three thousand three hundred and thirty-three methods of constructing a universe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after comprehending them all, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that these universe construction methods complemented and fit together perfectly. </p><p></p><p>The universe that could ultimately be constructed would reach an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>"This is the foundation, the true foundation."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes were filled with amazement. The internal universe of someone at the Path-Breaking Realm would be nearly on par with the internal universe of a Chaos Lord. Who could compare to such a foundation?</p><p></p><p>"It's too incredible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded. With his heaven-defying comprehension ability, he had barely managed to fully grasp the profundities within the runes after expending most of his mental energy.</p><p></p><p>But as for the being who created the jade gourd, to create these universe construction methods out of thin air... At least for now, Lin Yuan had no confidence at all and couldn't see even a glimmer of hope of accomplishing that, no matter how much time he had.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason was that Lin Yuan's level of life hadn't reached that height. His realm was limiting his heaven-defying comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of a 13th order time lifeform?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although the various messages transmitted from the jade gourd, as well as the words revealed by the red-robed girl, had never mentioned the realm or strength of the being who created the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was absolutely certain that the creator of the jade gourd was definitely not someone that ordinary Chaos Great Saints or even Peerless Great Saints could compare to.</p><p></p><p>13th order time lifeforms could already see through many timelines, knowing parts of the past, present and future. Their perspective was already different from other lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Just as Lin Yuan was still immersed in the many runes he had just comprehended, the red-robed girl instantly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Have you comprehended these runes before?" the red-robed girl couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The runes inside the jade gourd were left by its creator. In theory, there shouldn't be any leaks. At most, one or two runes might be similar to the innate universes nurtured in the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But similarity in one or two could speed up the comprehension process. Could it be that all the runes were similar?</p><p></p><p>That's why the red-robed girl asked this question.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the possibility of rune imprints leaking, the fact that Lin Yuan had only spent one year to fully comprehend what the jade gourd's creator had set as the standard for one cosmic era...</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl still felt the possibility of rune leakage was greater.</p><p></p><p>"Comprehended them before?" Lin Yuan was slightly stunned, then immediately shook his head and said, "No, this is also my first time seeing these runes. They're too amazing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was full of admiration. Only after comprehending these runes did he truly understand how difficult it was to create them, and what level of understanding of the universe's essence was required.</p><p></p><p>"You're also very amazing," the red-robed girl said after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>The jade gourd's creator was amazing because he was a great time lifeform who could see through past and future, knowing countless universes from birth to destruction, and thus could create so many methods of universe construction.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl didn't know Lin Yuan's exact strength and realm, but she was certain he wasn't 13th order, and not even at the Chaos Realm.</p><p></p><p>For such a little guy to comprehend all the runes in just one year made even the red-robed girl's understanding collapse a bit.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do now?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>He had now comprehended all the runes.</p><p></p><p>What was next?</p><p></p><p>"Since you've already comprehended all the runes, you can naturally refine the jade gourd now," the red-robed girl said.</p><p></p><p>Although the time Lin Yuan took to comprehend the runes was unbelievably short, comprehension was comprehension. He had reached the standard to refine the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>And after refining the jade gourd, he would obtain the complete foundational inheritance within it.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating this inheritance to the extreme would make one's foundation unimaginably profound, absorbing seven colors of liquid to make the internal world expand to 23 times its original size.</p><p></p><p>So after cultivating this foundational inheritance, how could the internal universe be merely 23 times larger than lifeforms of the same level?</p><p></p><p>"Refine the jade gourd?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to extend the power of his internal universe into the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>But he found he couldn't touch the jade gourd's essence at all.</p><p></p><p>"Of course you can't refine the jade gourd with just your current internal universe power," the red-robed girl immediately said upon noticing Lin Yuan's attempt to refine it. "You must fully integrate the universe construction methods contained in those 3,333 runes into your own internal universe before you can refine the jade gourd."</p><p></p><p>Only after integrating all the universe construction methods from the runes would the internal universe undergo an essential transformation, and only then would there be a foundation for refining the jade gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there's no time limit. You can take it slowly," the red-robed girl explained.</p><p></p><p>According to the standard left by the jade gourd's creator, comprehending the runes had to be limited to one cosmic era, but there was no restriction on integrating all the runes into one's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>One cosmic era was fine, ten cosmic eras were also fine.</p><p></p><p>"Although you haven't refined the jade gourd yet, you can barely control some of its authority. You can send me into your internal universe, and I can guide you on how to integrate the universe constructions faster and better."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl immediately said.</p><p></p><p>The construction of a universe is extremely vast and complex. Even a slight change could potentially cause a domino effect, leading to the collapse of the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>However, after comprehending all the runes, Lin Yuan had essentially found a fixed "template". As long as he followed the constructions in the runes to make changes, nothing unexpected would happen.</p><p></p><p>Of course, getting guidance would definitely be faster.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any wariness towards the red-robed girl.</p><p></p><p>If the jade gourd's creator really had any killing intent towards him, there would be no need for such trouble. A single thought would be enough to suppress Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Even universes nurtured by the Chaos Void couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>But even a 13th order time lifeform couldn't completely kill the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Because he had an avatar in the Origin World. After entering the 12th order, more functions of the Door of All Realms were uncovered. Descending into the Origin World had cost Lin Yuan nearly half of his true spirit consciousness, equivalent to another major avatar.</p><p></p><p>Even if his true body in this Chaos Void died, it wouldn't affect the avatar in the Origin World.</p><p></p><p>With the methods of a 13th order time lifeform, they could easily kill all of Lin Yuan's true bodies, primordial spirits, avatars and incarnations in this Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But the Origin World? The Origin World was in a different dimension from the Chaos Void. Even 13th order time lifeforms would find it difficult to cross over. 13th order time lifeforms were only at the exploration stage regarding other dimensions and planes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could easily descend into the Origin World by borrowing the power of the Door of All Realms.</p><p></p><p>Without the Door of All Realms, invading other dimensions would encounter unimaginable resistance, leaving even 13th order time lifeforms helpless.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan barely managed to control the jade gourd, sending the girl in red clothes into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>The moment she left the jade gourd, the girl in red clothes sensed the external atmosphere. A look of comfort appeared on her face. She didn't know how long it had been since she had felt the fluctuations emanating from the true chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>To the girl in red clothes, these fluctuations were an incomparable pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"The life level is only at the Path-Opening Realm?" Next, the girl in red clothes sensed Lin Yuan's life aura. As the spirit of the jade gourd, her perception surpassed even some Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Path-Opening Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>He comprehended all the runes at the Path-Opening Realm? And in just one year? Hum! The next moment, the girl in red clothes entered Lin Yuan's internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly 800 million light-years?" The girl in red clothes was slightly surprised, but when she thought of the time Lin Yuan took to comprehend all the runes, she immediately calmed down.</p><p></p><p>For an internal universe at the Path-Opening Realm to reach 800 million light-years was extremely rare. Even with the foundation laid by the seven divine liquids condensed by the jade gourd earlier, it would still require a sufficiently vast base.</p><p></p><p>But the chaotic void was boundless, and many wondrous life forms possessed time bloodlines. The universes nurtured within them were innately vast and expansive. It wasn't impossible for a Path-Opening Realm to have an internal universe of nearly 800 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the internal universe, what shocked the girl in red clothes most was Lin Yuan's comprehension ability. Comprehending all runes in one year was something even those wondrous life forms with extremely dense time bloodlines couldn't achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see."</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes looked around, closed her eyes to sense for a moment, then pointed to a location and said, "Start from there."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He then began to control that area, reconstructing it using the first rune's internal universe structure as a template, and started combining them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>A slight trembling sensation spread throughout the entire internal universe. Lin Yuan frowned slightly and stopped.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you feel like your internal universe is about to collapse?"</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This is normal."</p><p></p><p>"Changing the universe's structure affects the entire universe."</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes said with a smile, "All universe structure changes will produce similar sensations."</p><p></p><p>"However, when others change their universe structure, there's a risk of their internal universe completely collapsing. You don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes said.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending all the runes, changing the universe structure was like an open-book exam for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly beside her.</p><p></p><p>"I'll continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed himself again in altering his internal universe's structure.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Attempting to change the fundamental structure of the universe enhances your understanding of the universe's essence. The speed of changing the universe's fundamental structure increases.]</p><p></p><p>At first, Lin Yuan's speed and efficiency in changing the universe were quite slow. After all, he had to be careful. Even with the standard answers, he needed to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>But as the degree of change deepened, Lin Yuan quickly became 'proficient', and his speed of change began to soar.</p><p></p><p>"This prodigy."</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes watched from the side.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she could still give some advice, such as guiding Lin Yuan on which position or direction to change from. But gradually, the girl in red clothes found she had nothing left to advise on.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan's methods of changing the universe's fundamental structure were even more exquisite than what she knew.</p><p></p><p>Every universe is different. The girl in red clothes only mastered the general direction of changing the universe's fundamental structure. In understanding this internal universe, she naturally couldn't compare to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, Qingfen Domain, Yu Family.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his aura deeply hidden.</p><p></p><p>"The transition to the martial path is going smoothly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly. His original body, Yu Yan, was equivalent to the eighth or ninth level of the Chaotic Void realm, with vast amounts of elemental energy contained within.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan re-cultivated the martial path, he naturally wouldn't waste this elemental energy, converting it all into resources for martial advancement.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up again at the eternal blazing sun spanning across the sky, and then a cultivation method appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Through specific methods, one could condense Blazing Sun Seeds within the body.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Seeds had many uses, such as reinforcing the physical body, guarding the soul and mind, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Every living being in the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom was granted this 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' upon birth to build their foundation.</p><p></p><p>"This 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' is said to come from the Blazing Sun Ancestor. Its popularization to every living being in the ancient kingdom was also that ancestor's intention."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' progressed from simple to difficult. Condensing one Blazing Sun Seed was easy to achieve, but condensing ten was extremely challenging. Condensing a hundred? That was something only twelfth-level Self-Path Realm powerhouses could accomplish.</p><p></p><p>In this Source World, the Path-Opening Realm was called the Self-Path Realm, with roughly the same meaning - opening one's own path.</p><p></p><p>"I can try cultivating it first to see if I can integrate it into the martial path."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As for his true body in the Chaotic Void? For now, he would wait for the results of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' originated from the Blazing Sun Ancestor, and it wasn't clear if there were any hidden dangers. If this body cultivated it, the worst outcome would just be abandoning this descent.</p><p></p><p>It was completely within Lin Yuan's acceptable range.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't affect his true body in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"The original body spent several hundred years and only condensed nine Blazing Sun Seeds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Dongyang Meng from the Dongyang family had also condensed nine Blazing Sun Seeds, which was why she and the original body were considered the last possible candidates to become disciples under the Qingfen Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, of these nine Blazing Sun Seeds, three were destroyed due to the Dongyang family's attack. Later, when I transitioned to the martial path, the remaining six also collapsed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' wasn't a legacy or a path, but more like an auxiliary cultivation method. By condensing Blazing Sun Seeds within the body, it enhanced certain innate qualities.</p><p></p><p>The more Blazing Sun Seeds, the greater the corresponding benefits.</p><p></p><p>As for what exactly these benefits were, the original body wasn't clear. He only felt that with each additional Blazing Sun Seed condensed, his cultivation speed increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. His martial prowess was rapidly recovering, requiring little effort, so he could use this time to try out this 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique'.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>In the world around him.</p><p></p><p>Strands of scorching energy poured into Lin Yuan's body, slowly condensing.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Cultivating the 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique', you've condensed the first Blazing Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Cultivating the 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique', you've condensed the third Blazing Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Cultivating the 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique', you've condensed the fifth Blazing Sun Seed]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

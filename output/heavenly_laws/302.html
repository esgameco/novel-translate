(Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Inside the Magic Jade Space, after passing each floor of the Nine-Layered Black Tower, one can receive the reward treasures left by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower. üíöüíéÔºñ‚ûàùê¨ ∞œÖùîµ.c·ªñ–º‚òùüë§</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's World Tree, "Interpretation of the Void", "Illusory Reality", Chaos Crystal, etc., were all obtained from the Nine-Layered Black Tower. These treasures provided him with great help.</p><p></p><p>Even after entering the Ninth Stage, Lin Yuan still often pondered over them.</p><p></p><p>Especially the "Interpretation of the Void", which explained the other side of the spatial rules from a perspective different from human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan comprehended it, he gained new insights and a deeper understanding of the essence of spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness avatar appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed his surroundings. After entering the Ninth Stage, this was his first time descending here.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he was at the Eighth Stage, Lin Yuan, now in the Ninth Stage realm, immediately noticed the subtle essence of the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>"Completely independent from the numerous spatial layers, how did the owner of the Magic Jade Tower achieve this back then?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression showed a hint of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew that the Magic Jade Space was not in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>After all, the owner of the Magic Jade Tower was not a lifeform from the main universe either. But the space opened up here was actually not relying on any spatial layer, which was somewhat incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how far I can reach on the third floor now."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Yuan walked towards the Nine-Layered Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>According to Shen Ji, the third floor of the Nine-Layered Black Tower was specially prepared for some extremely powerful and unique Ninth Stage lifeforms, as well as Tenth Stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was at the Eighth Stage, let alone passing the third floor, he couldn't even stay on the third floor.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had entered the Ninth Stage, he didn't have the extravagant hope of passing the third floor. He just wanted to know what the test on the third floor of the Black Tower actually was.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew what the first and second floors tested - the ability to resist pressure from all directions.</p><p></p><p>But on the third floor, when Lin Yuan was at the Eighth Stage, his mental will, after being nurtured by the world power within the world spanning over a hundred million miles, was actually not much inferior to the mental will of Ninth Stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he still couldn't sustain for a moment on the third floor. Lin Yuan vaguely realized that perhaps the test on the third floor of the Black Tower was different from the first and second floors.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Nine-Layered Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji walked out.</p><p></p><p>"You have been gone for a long time..." The humanoid stone statue was about to ask Lin Yuan why he hadn't come for such a long time.</p><p></p><p>But then he discovered that the strength of Lin Yuan's mental will, compared to when he descended previously, had undergone a qualitative change. At the same time, his will avatar also instinctively merged into the layers of space.</p><p></p><p>What he saw now was just a projection of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"You have entered the Ninth Stage?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Ji's tone was complex. Even though he had long known that the Ninth Stage posed no difficulty for a freak like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't such a monstrous genius appear when the owner of the Magic Jade Tower was still around!</p><p></p><p>"I got lucky." Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Luck again... Shen Ji felt a bit helpless. He looked at Lin Yuan and said, "You're here to try passing the third floor?"</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was still at the Eighth Stage, Shen Ji wouldn't recommend attempting the third floor, because it would be meaningless and couldn't even serve as tempering.</p><p></p><p>But since he was already at the Ninth Stage, with Lin Yuan's talent, he could naturally try to pass the third floor.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ji took the initiative to step aside.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked straight into the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Third Floor.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>Formless and terrifying pressure swept towards Lin Yuan from all directions.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it was as if pouncing on air. All the pressure passed through Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan's true body was not in the main space.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to take a step.</p><p></p><p>The pressure from all directions surged, already beginning to permeate through dozens of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Taking another step.</p><p></p><p>It permeated through hundreds of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Taking ten more steps.</p><p></p><p>It permeated through nearly ten thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formless and intangible pressure swept through nearly ten thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin Yuan's consciousness avatar was in over eighty thousand spatial layers, he still vaguely felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to take a hundred steps.</p><p></p><p>The heavy pressure seemed to solidify, oscillating back and forth in the eighty thousand spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"The real test of the third floor of the Black Tower is not resisting pressure, because this pressure simply cannot be resisted. Even a Tenth Stage powerhouse, with only a shred of mental will, would have their will avatar collapse if touched or scraped by the pressure from all directions."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pensive.</p><p></p><p>The real test of the third floor of the Black Tower was the occupation of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Occupying as many spatial layers as possible to evade the envelopment of pressure.</p><p></p><p>And the so-called "occupation" of more spatial layers, in Lin Yuan's understanding, was to derive and open up more layers of inner world space.</p><p></p><p>Only by opening up more layers of inner world space could one's control over the numerous spatial layers of the main world be correspondingly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lin Yuan's inner world had already opened up eighty-seven thousand layers of space. Theoretically, he could instantly "occupy" eighty-seven thousand layers of space in the main world.</p><p></p><p>"My current position is only one percent of the total length of the third floor."</p><p></p><p>"The pressure here has already swept through over eighty thousand spatial layers. To completely walk through the third floor, wouldn't I need to occupy millions or nearly a hundred million spatial layers?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was amazed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Occupying millions or nearly a hundred million spatial layers had another implication - opening up millions or nearly a hundred million spatial layers within one's inner world.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that among the five stages of the Ninth Stage, the last stage was the Million Layers Realm.</p><p></p><p>That is, opening up ten million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>But now, to pass the third floor of the Black Tower, one needed to open up millions or even nearly a hundred million spatial layers?</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's said that only special existences among the Ninth Stage have a chance to pass this floor." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the Million Layers Realm was the final stage of the Ninth Stage, it didn't mean it was the strongest of the Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, after opening up ten million spatial layers, one could still continue to open up more spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>But this was too difficult. Any Ninth Stage powerhouse who had opened up ten million spatial layers had spent who knows how much time and effort to reach this point. Now asking them to continue opening up...</p><p></p><p>The reason why ten million layers was set as the final realm of the Ninth Stage was because once the number of spatial layers reached ten million, one could attempt to break through to the Tenth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still far from the Million Layers Realm."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Lin Yuan directly exited the Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine-Layered Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji silently observed Lin Yuan's movements.</p><p></p><p>"Walking one percent of the way, the occupation of spatial layers is close to ninety thousand..." Shen Ji thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ji didn't know what to say. He had never seen such a thing before.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of those innate multi-spatial lifeforms who mastered numerous spatial layers from birth. But for someone like Lin Yuan, who cultivated step by step from weak to strong, occupying ninety thousand spatial layers at such an unimaginable speed...</p><p></p><p>"But no matter how monstrous a genius, it's not easy to pass the third floor. This was a test specially set by the master back then."</p><p></p><p>"Either honestly enter the Tenth Stage before coming, or deeply cultivate in the Ninth Stage realm. The latter is much more difficult than the former."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ji silently thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's no hope of passing the third floor in the short term..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. </p><p></p><p>In the five years since crossing the outer region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the number of spatial layers Lin Yuan had opened up had skyrocketed from 43,000 to 87,000.</p><p></p><p>This kind of progress could be called terrifying, but Lin Yuan had no confidence in achieving the millions or even tens of millions of spatial layers in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"In these five years, I've been able to feel that I can enter the Time Rule at any moment," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Five years ago, Lin Yuan already felt that he was about to grasp the Time Rule, but until now, he still hadn't entered it. This shows how difficult and abstruse the Time Rule is.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan, who possesses a heaven-defying comprehension ability, is like this. Other 9th stage evolvers, even if they spend hundreds of thousands or millions of years, would find it very hard to comprehend the Time Rule.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, the Time Rule is a pillar rule that at least 10th stage experts should comprehend. 9th stage is just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>There's basically no possibility of entering it.</p><p></p><p>"Time..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand. Vaguely, the flow of time on the surface of his right hand began to distort.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan truly felt that he was about to enter the Time Rule.</p><p></p><p>At the quickest, it would take a few days; at the slowest, a few months.</p><p></p><p>"I've also accumulated 71 strands of Boundary-Breaking Source Power," Lin Yuan sensed the amount of Boundary-Breaking Source Power and felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>Boundary-Breaking Source Power was his greatest reliance, able to cross dimensional boundaries and descend to any world.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The aura of heaven and earth has changed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>If the outer region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was almost no different from the main universe, then the inner region had an additional ancient and oppressive atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>"The summoning sensation has also gotten a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes slightly and began to listen.</p><p></p><p>He could now vaguely hear the contents of the summoning.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang... Great Xuanhuang, you have finally returned..."</p><p></p><p>The summoning seemed to come from an infinitely distant antiquity, crossing time and space to reach Lin Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang?" Lin Yuan furrowed his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Xuanhuang a name?" Lin Yuan guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The language of the summoning was not any that Lin Yuan had encountered before, but amazingly, as long as he heard it, he could understand its meaning.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue forward first."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, so far, the understanding of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm by the several peak races, including human civilization, only touched the most superficial layer.</p><p></p><p>Even the connection between the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and other universal eras was just a guess and couldn't be completely certain.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the Xuanhuang Secret Realm rejected the entry of 10th stage and above experts. Since the strongest couldn't explore it, naturally what was known was limited.</p><p></p><p>After entering the inner region,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan intentionally slowed his speed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"There?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to sense something and looked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>There, the aura was surging. A native lifeform tens of thousands of meters large was fighting against an alien with a long, slender tail.</p><p></p><p>As they clashed, the terrifying aura shook hundreds of thousands to millions of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"That alien has opened up at least millions of spatial layers," Lin Yuan observed from afar. "That native lifeform is also extremely powerful, not much weaker than the alien."</p><p></p><p>"I'll be going first."</p><p></p><p>He recognized the identity of that alien, named "Moro", belonging to the Starry Sky Grand Alliance, a rare special lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between the Human Civilization Grand Alliance and the Starry Sky Grand Alliance was not very good. After all, many of the bloodline evolution elixirs in human civilization were taken from numerous special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the strongest few existences among the special lifeforms joining hands to establish the Starry Sky Grand Alliance and formally participating in the battles between the peak races of the universe, perhaps the current special lifeforms would have already been mostly domesticated by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Special lifeforms were individually powerful but difficult to reproduce, but not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Except for those extremely rare special lifeforms that couldn't form a race, most special lifeforms still had reproductive abilities.</p><p></p><p>That Moro who had opened millions of spatial layers - Lin Yuan did not fear him. Five years ago, his combat power was not much weaker than a 9th stage with millions of layers, let alone now.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't want to cause any trouble.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took another path and rushed towards the core region of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>A few days later,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"There are human evolvers nearby?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and a black disc appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Any lifeform entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm would be randomly assigned to the outer region.</p><p></p><p>This prevented the possibility of "grouping up" from the start.</p><p></p><p>But after entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, according to the black disc issued by human civilization to each evolver, one could sense all human evolvers within a certain area.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the powerhouses of the myriad races in the starry sky could also enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. Human evolvers naturally had to unite and help each other in order to obtain the greatest opportunities and treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Is it Xi Lan?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan recognized the identity of this human evolver.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, when Lin Yuan went to the Central Star Domain to soak in the Eternal Spring, it was Xi Lan who received him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on the battlefield of code B0001, when Lin Yuan massacred the 8th stage invincibles of the Tianyu Race, the 9th stage evolver presiding over the battlefield at that time was also Xi Lan.</p><p></p><p>"Xi Lan... seems to be being pursued and killed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards a direction according to the sensing of the black disc.</p><p></p><p>Within layers and layers of space,</p><p></p><p>"Human, hand over the treasure, and I will let this avatar of yours leave," a huge figure was chasing from behind. "Otherwise, your avatar will die and the treasure will fall into my hands."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xi Lan did not pay attention and continued to flee quickly.</p><p></p><p>"That place of opportunity, I clearly discovered it first. Are you humans all so shameless?" The huge figure was furious. "If you hand over the treasure now, I promise to let you leave."</p><p></p><p>The huge figure was burning with anger.</p><p></p><p>As a peak 9th stage powerhouse with 100,000 layers, he had already opened 900,000 spatial layers, not far from a million.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the huge figure had discovered a place of opportunity that was about to emerge and was guarding beside it. Who would have thought that as soon as the place opened, Xi Lan rushed in, took the treasure, and ran.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the ability, catch me first," </p><p></p><p>Xi Lan transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't even know what that treasure was for, the heavenly phenomenon when the place of opportunity containing this treasure opened was extremely unusual.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what the huge figure said, Xi Lan would not agree.</p><p></p><p>What a joke.</p><p></p><p>There's no reason to return a treasure that's already in hand.</p><p></p><p>"But it's also troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"If this chase continues, there might be some unexpected developments."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was a bit anxious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his speed, the possibility of the huge figure catching up was not high.</p><p></p><p>But if the two of them chased like this, it would definitely attract the attention of other powerhouses nearby.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if it was a powerhouse from a race hostile to human civilization, Xi Lan might really suffer a loss here.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xi Lan was racking his brains for a way to break the situation,</p><p></p><p>The black disc in his inner world suddenly emitted a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Xi Lan, do you need help?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord is nearby?" Xi Lan was slightly startled and immediately learned Lin Yuan's identity through the black disc.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, hurry and escape. The enemy is not someone you can deal with."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's expression changed slightly and he immediately responded through the black disc.</p><p></p><p>"An enemy I can't deal with..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell silent for a moment and looked around.</p><p></p><p>"Where?"</p>

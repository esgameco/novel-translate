        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blue envoy Stone Pine stared at the crimson mirror surface, almost thinking he was hallucinating.</p><p></p><p>Since when did the Blazing Sun Seeds, which were extremely difficult to condense even one of, appear in the form of a 'sea'?</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Blue Burning Marquis received the imperial edict from the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom and took control of the Blue Burning Domain, countless geniuses had been born in this vast domain over innumerable years.</p><p></p><p>Ten Blazing Sun geniuses, within a timespan of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, could be called geniuses and directly join under the Blue Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>But if you extend the timeline to look at millions, billions, or trillions of years, Ten Blazing Sun geniuses were not particularly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence Stone Pine knew, the strongest genius in the history of the Blue Burning Domain was Feng Wanxing, currently the senior disciple of the Blue Burning Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Back then, before Feng Wanxing was 500 years old, he had condensed a total of 732 Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Stone Pine stared blankly at the sea of Blazing Sun Seeds in the crimson mirror. Just one crashing wave contained dozens of Blazing Sun Seeds.</p><p></p><p>So how many Blazing Sun Seeds were in the entire ocean?</p><p></p><p>Three thousand? Ten thousand?</p><p></p><p>Stone Pine dared not imagine. It completely exceeded his understanding.</p><p></p><p>"This matter needs to be reported to Senior Brother immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Blue Envoy Stone Pine barely composed himself, knowing that this scene before him was completely beyond his ability to handle. He could only notify Senior Brother as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even Senior Brother at the Sovereign realm couldn't handle a freak who had condensed so many Blazing Sun Seeds, but this matter still had to go through Senior Brother first.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Blue Envoy Stone Pine took out a red jade slip.</p><p></p><p>This was a communication tool between disciples of the Blue Burning Marquis. As long as they were within the Blue Burning Domain, it could achieve 'instant contact'.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, I've discovered a sea of Blazing Sun Seeds here at the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>Blue Envoy Stone Pine revised multiple times, organizing his words to explain his current encounter as clearly as possible.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Envoy?" </p><p></p><p>Several Yu family patriarchs and clan leaders noticed Blue Envoy Stone Pine's change, but only showed slight doubt.</p><p></p><p>They didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, most of their attention was focused on how to face the upcoming adverse situation.</p><p></p><p>The birth of a Ten Blazing Sun supreme genius in the East Yang family was absolutely the worst possible news for the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>With the slightest misstep, it could lead to the annihilation of the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>So the current Yu family patriarchs who had reached the Dao realm were already considering how to transfer the clan's seeds of hope.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family and East Yang family had been fighting for so many years that the grudges were irreconcilable. Now that the East Yang family had suddenly risen to prominence, how could they possibly spare the Yu family? So the Yu family patriarchs hadn't even considered surrendering or negotiating.</p><p></p><p>If the Yu family had given birth to a Ten Blazing Sun supreme genius, they also wouldn't have accepted negotiations or surrender from the East Yang family.</p><p></p><p>"That crimson mirror can detect the Blazing Sun Seeds inside my body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in place, observing Blue Envoy Stone Pine who was staring intently at the crimson mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Just now he had clearly sensed a feeling of being peered into, and every Blazing Sun Seed in his body had responded.</p><p></p><p>Now the Blazing Sun Seeds in Lin Yuan's body had formed a complete cycle, as if they were one entity, able to perceive even the slightest external changes.</p><p></p><p>"It seems he already knows how many Blazing Sun Seeds I've condensed." Lin Yuan wasn't very surprised by the blue envoy's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Six months ago, Lin Yuan had already condensed over 3,000 Blazing Sun Seeds. Now the number of Blazing Sun Seeds he had condensed exceeded 10,000.</p><p></p><p>It had reached 10,363.</p><p></p><p>Such a number of Blazing Sun Seeds appearing in someone under 500 years old was unheard of, at least as far as Lin Yuan knew.</p><p></p><p>"But this is good too."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the Blue Burning Domain or other great domains, they were all shrouded under the radiance of the Eternal Blazing Sun.</p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan planned to hide in the shadows forever, standing in opposition to the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, the only option was to join the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom's camp and strive for the greatest benefits for himself.</p><p></p><p>At least from the current situation, the Blue Burning Marquis was at least a Chaos Venerable level powerhouse, and the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom? It was even more unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>East Yang family.</p><p></p><p>The tall figure was receiving the hospitality of several East Yang family patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>East Yang Meng stood obediently to the side, while many high-level East Yang family members below showed reverence towards her.</p><p></p><p>As a Ten Blazing Sun supreme genius, as long as East Yang Meng successfully joined under the Blue Burning Marquis, she would have an unimaginable status and glory.</p><p></p><p>The entire East Yang family would benefit for countless tens of thousands of years because of East Yang Meng.</p><p></p><p>"If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have assassinated that Yu Yan." East Yang Meng thought aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't yet condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed, killing that Yu family member in advance would have been a good choice.</p><p></p><p>But now that she had finally condensed the tenth Blazing Sun Seed, the so-called assassination seemed somewhat laughable in hindsight.</p><p></p><p>In East Yang Meng's mind, her future status and that of Yu Yan would be completely different.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't Stone Pine returned yet?" The tall figure wondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had sent Stone Pine to the Yu family just as a formality. Could it be that he was also receiving hospitality from the Yu family?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the tall figure's expression changed as he took out a red jade slip. Stone Pine, who had gone to the Yu family as a formality, had sent a 'message'.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The tall figure frowned, not understanding why communication methods were being used when Stone Pine could just return directly. Although quite impatient, the tall figure still immediately sent a strand of consciousness into the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The message conveyed in the jade slip wasn't long, but it caused the tall figure's expression to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"An ocean composed of Blazing Sun Seeds?"</p><p></p><p>The tall figure could hardly believe it. If he wasn't certain that Stone Pine wouldn't dare joke about such things, he would definitely have considered it nonsense.</p><p></p><p>An ocean?</p><p></p><p>Composed of Blazing Sun Seeds?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, has something happened?" the other blue envoy beside him asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"At the Yu family..."</p><p></p><p>The tall figure's mind was shaken. He glanced at the blue envoy beside him and said quickly, "Come with me to the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>Although he was certain Stone Pine wouldn't dare play such a joke on him,</p><p></p><p>If the Yu family really had condensed an ocean-like quantity of Blazing Sun Seeds, it would be better for him to see it with his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>In front of several East Yang family patriarchs, the tall figure and the other blue envoy vanished.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, the tall figure hadn't explained anything to the East Yang family patriarchs. If Stone Pine's report was true, that Yu Yan of the Yu family would be unprecedented in the entire history of the Blue Burning Domain.</p><p></p><p>In comparison,</p><p></p><p>East Yang Meng, this Ten Blazing Sun genius, would be insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses who condensed ten Blazing Sun Seeds before 500 years old were born in the Blue Burning Domain from time to time.</p><p></p><p>"The two blue envoys..."</p><p></p><p>Several East Yang family patriarchs were somewhat dazed. The sudden disappearance of the blue envoys caught them off guard.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where did the Blue Envoys go?" the patriarch of the East Sun clan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he glanced at East Sun Dream. The Blue Envoys had suddenly disappeared without explaining why, and they hadn't even taken care of East Sun Dream, the supreme genius of the Ten Blazing Suns.</p><p></p><p>This made the East Sun clan patriarch feel somewhat uneasy. East Sun Dream was the future hope of their East Sun clan, yet she had been left behind?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps they had some urgent business?" an elder of the East Sun clan speculated. </p><p></p><p>For the two Blue Envoys to leave in such a hurry, they must have encountered something significant.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so," said the second elder of the East Sun clan, his gaze uncertain. "We should go check around the Yu family's place."</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility was low, the third Blue Envoy, Shi Song, had gone to the Yu family and still hadn't returned. Now the remaining two Blue Envoys were behaving strangely as well. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but suspect that the Blue Envoys' sudden disappearance might be related to the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>"The Yu family? Why go to the Yu family?" the East Sun clan patriarch asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Just to take a look," the East Sun clan elder said, a hint of worry appearing in his heart. "I hope it's not what I'm thinking."</p><p></p><p>At the Yu family residence.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Blue Envoy Shi Song had made contact, </p><p></p><p>The tall figure and the other Blue Envoy rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family wasn't far from the East Sun clan, which was why the tall figure had been puzzled that Shi Song hadn't returned for so long.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the tall figure appear, Blue Envoy Shi Song immediately walked over.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders, who had been pondering how to relocate the family's bloodline, immediately noticed the arrival of the other two Blue Envoys.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Blue Envoys." Yu Chaolong immediately stepped forward and bowed respectfully, though confused. </p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Three Blue Envoys. Didn't Blue Envoy Shi Song say that the other two Blue Envoys were at the East Sun clan? East Sun Dream is a supreme genius of the Ten Blazing Suns, so why has she come here too?"</p><p></p><p>The Yu family elders exchanged glances, their eyes filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Blue Envoy."</p><p></p><p>The leading elder of the Yu family, seeing the tall figure arrive and take the crimson mirror from Blue Envoy Shi Song's hand, had an incredible thought surface in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Could Yu Yan also be a supreme genius of the Ten Blazing Suns? Otherwise, how could it make the other two Blue Envoys rush back? And continue to confirm with the Blazing Sun Boundary bestowed by the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>"My son?" Yu Chaolong also thought of this possibility. The reactions of the three Blue Envoys were too unusual. Even without saying it explicitly, how could beings of the 11th and 12th realms not deduce this with their rapid thought processes?</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Envoy who just arrived should be at the Sovereign realm?" Lin Yuan's gaze lingered on the tall figure. Among the three Blue Envoys, two were at the peak of the Path-breaking realm, and one was at the Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of this Source World is truly incredible," Lin Yuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blue Flame Domain was vast and boundless, in terms of area, it was only equivalent to a universe in the Chaos Void, yet it had so many powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because of the 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique'?" Lin Yuan speculated internally.</p><p></p><p>The 'Blazing Sun Spirit Nurturing Technique' greatly increased the comprehension of laws for the lives in the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, thus causing a surge in the probability of producing powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Other lives might not be able to condense over ten thousand Blazing Sun Seeds like Lin Yuan, but if there wasn't the 500-year age limit, condensing several or dozens of seeds would still be quite possible.</p><p></p><p>And several or dozens of Blazing Sun Seeds would be enough to raise one's comprehension of laws by several levels.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really so?" </p><p></p><p>The tall figure looked at the undulating 'Sea of Blazing Suns' in the crimson mirror face, his thoughts difficult to calm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the 'Sea of Blazing Suns' and seeing it were two completely different experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Even the current Big Senior Brother probably couldn't have condensed Blazing Sun Seeds to this degree, right?" the tall figure thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Big Senior Brother in his mind was Feng Wanxing, the chief disciple under the Blue Flame Marquis, second only to the Blue Flame Marquis in the entire Blue Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>Big Senior Brother Feng Wanxing had condensed over 700 Blazing Sun Seeds before the age of 500, and after long years of cultivation, the number of Blazing Sun Seeds he had refined would only be more.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it probably couldn't compare to the 'Sea of Blazing Suns' in the crimson mirror face before them.</p><p></p><p>"How was this condensed under the age of 500?" the other Blue Envoy found it hard to believe. They had never doubted whether the Ancient Blazing Sun Mirror was malfunctioning; this mirror was bestowed by the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom and would absolutely not have any problems.</p><p></p><p>But the more this was true, the more incredible it seemed. At least ten thousand Blazing Sun Seeds forming an ocean? Could it be that Yu Yan could condense a Blazing Sun Seed every few years?</p><p></p><p>What the three Blue Envoys didn't know was that these ten thousand plus Blazing Sun Seeds were only what Lin Yuan had condensed in the past year, far from what they believed to be over 500 years.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it should be one seed condensed every few breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, what should we do now?" </p><p></p><p>Blue Envoy Shi Song, seeing the tall figure standing there dumbfounded, somehow felt relieved and quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think we should do?" </p><p></p><p>The tall figure glanced at Shi Song.</p><p></p><p>"What do I think we should do?" Shi Song thought for a moment. "Contact the Marquis?"</p><p></p><p>Even though they, as Blue Envoys, were disciples of the Blue Flame Marquis, they still referred to him as 'Marquis'.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to do that," the tall figure shook his head, an indescribable expression appearing on his face. "The Marquis probably already knows by now."</p><p></p><p>Each Ancient Blazing Sun Mirror was divided into a child mirror and a mother mirror. The Blue Envoys traveling through the Blue Flame Domain all held child mirrors.</p><p></p><p>As for the mother mirror, it was with the Blue Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>Every Blazing Sun Seed detected by the child mirrors would be 'synchronized' to the mother mirror.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Blue Flame Domain.</p><p></p><p>A majestic and towering city stood, with countless powerful auras constantly converging from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Within the city, the Blue Flame Mansion.</p><p></p><p>A man wearing a blue robe, with a faint blue flame burning between his brows, sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were narrow and long, and the aura he casually emitted was far more vast than the entire Blue Flame Mansion, or even the Blue Flame City.</p><p></p><p>This man was the Blue Flame Marquis, known as the Blue Flame Great Venerable before being enfeoffed by the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>The Blue Flame Marquis suddenly opened his eyes, the blue flame between his brows flickering casually.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>An equally crimson mirror appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the mirrors held by the Blue Envoys, this mirror carried a sense of heavy authority, as if it truly were the eternal blazing sun in the sky, radiating infinite light and heat.</p><p></p><p>"A life that has condensed ten thousand three hundred and sixty-three Blazing Sun Seeds has been discovered? Under 500 years old?"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Flame Marquis looked at the crimson mirror before him, where a faint red ocean composed entirely of Blazing Sun Seeds was vaguely visible on its surface.</p><p></p><p>He immediately fell into a certain silence.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

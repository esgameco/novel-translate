        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked, "Is that right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the vice chief of the Nalan Tower nodded in affirmation. </p><p></p><p>The information he received was that each time the Heavenly Gate opened, it would be the bloodiest and most tumultuous period across the entire continent. </p><p></p><p>At that time, even experts at the Demonic Emperor level would fall like rain, and everyone would crave to enter the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>As for Demonic Patriarchs? They did not appear in every era.  </p><p></p><p>But as long as there was a Demonic Patriarch alive when the Heavenly Gate opened, undoubtedly the one standing before the Gate in the end would be the Demonic Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Before the powerful beings from the main universes descended into this two-dimensional world, the Demonic Patriarch was the strongest in the continent.</p><p></p><p>"When was the last time the Heavenly Gate opened?" Lin Yuan immediately inquired.</p><p></p><p>"Nine thousand eight hundred years ago," the vice chief replied. Upon hearing about the 'Heavenly Gate', he became exceptionally attentive to this kind of intelligence and had already inquired about it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"So the next opening of the Heavenly Gate will be in two hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed. </p><p></p><p>This was not good news.</p><p></p><p>If there were no other powerful beings from the main universes, Lin Yuan was very confident he could eventually stand before the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, in that two-dimensional world now, there were over three hundred experts at the eleventh level alone.</p><p></p><p>Eleventh level experts had terrifyingly fast 'thought processing' speeds. Even if their comprehension was inferior to Lin Yuan's, given only two hundred years, Lin Yuan had no assurance of sweeping all the eleventh level experts.</p><p></p><p>Especially those peak eleventh level lifeforms at the sixth rank - they could break through to the ultimate realm at any moment, having already reached perfection in every aspect.</p><p></p><p>The ability of comprehension would definitely bring greater advantages the longer the time allowed.</p><p></p><p>And according to the timing of the Heavenly Gate's opening, the opening after the next would be in twelve thousand years.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, one could not comprehend rules or open inner worlds within the body, meaning a very short lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no confidence he could last twelve thousand years.</p><p></p><p>And as long as he died in this two-dimensional world, whether killed or from old age, it would lead to a fundamental loss of origin.</p><p></p><p>"Do the strongest experts know about this?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I have already informed the strongest expert," the vice chief nodded.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Heavenly Gate was not an overly hidden secret. Even if the vice chief had not mentioned it, Lin Yuan would have learned about it soon.</p><p></p><p>"The strongest expert's intention is for us to do our utmost," the vice chief said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Just from these few sentences, he sensed a kind of cruel competition.</p><p></p><p>The opponents of the evolutionary humans were actually those special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Especially those who had reached the sixth rank of the eleventh level - as special lifeforms, their innate talents were terrifying. Under the same starting conditions, other lifeforms could hardly compete.</p><p></p><p>The inner world of white paper flashed in Lin Yuan's mind - the cultivation method passed down by the vice chief.</p><p></p><p>"A total of thirteen cultivation methods, six with the greatest potential to reach the Demonic Sovereign realm, the remaining seven could reach Demonic King."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully read through them.</p><p></p><p>Although he had also reached the Demonic King realm, the cultivation method he practiced was temporarily created based on his inverse comprehension talent.</p><p></p><p>Compared to these methods inherited for tens of thousands or even millions of years, there were inevitably some deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the method Lin Yuan temporarily created was inferior to these long-inherited ones.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it lacked some subtle considerations.</p><p></p><p>Rustle rustle.</p><p></p><p>As he read through the thirteen cultivation methods, Lin Yuan's physical body began to subtly tremble, making partial adjustments according to them.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic King level experts can split mountains and rocks. Demonic Sovereign level can punch through a mountain range with one strike. Demonic Emperor level can tear apart hundreds of miles of land with one kick. As for Demonic Patriarchs, there are no clear records yet."</p><p></p><p>"Because Demonic Patriarchs have never used their full power before."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan comprehended the methods, he pondered this world's cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how those eleventh level experts are doing now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked into the distance, silently thinking.</p><p></p><p>In a primordial dense forest, a three-meter tall figure stood atop the tree canopy, its aura causing ferocious beasts dozens of miles around to tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally cultivated to the Demonic King realm."</p><p></p><p>This three-meter figure's gaze was icy cold. "I am a great eleventh level Ancient God, destined to break through to the ultimate in the future."</p><p></p><p>"If this avatar dies here, causing a fundamental loss to my spiritual will, the time to reach the ultimate will be infinitely delayed."</p><p></p><p>This three-meter figure was unwilling to accept such a consequence. "The Heavenly Gate opens in two hundred years? And only one can stand before it and leave this world in the end?"</p><p></p><p>The three-meter figure's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"For the next two hundred years, all my mental focus will be immersed in this world, doing everything possible to increase my strength."</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the three-meter figure vanished into the distance.</p><p></p><p>In an ordinary settlement, the Ancient God Tuo Ba disguised himself as a common human, walking down the street.</p><p></p><p>"I should not have agreed to the Insect Race," Tuo Ba regretted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He found that ever since offending the Galactic Stellar Master, his luck had never been good. First, he was completely at odds with human civilization. </p><p></p><p>Now he had even fallen into this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for considering an escape route, how could he have agreed to the Insect Race's invitation to come to the battlefield?</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been on the battlefield, he would not have been absorbed into here.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>"It's meaningless to regret now."</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing now is to raise my strength to the maximum before the Heavenly Gate opens in two hundred years," Tuoba Gushen calmed his mind and thought to himself. </p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to strive for the ultimate realm within a billion years. If he fell in this two-dimensional world during that period, causing his spiritual will to decline, then he would give up striving for the ultimate, because it would be destined to be impossible to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a sliver away from ascending to the Demonic Emperor realm." On the calm sea surface, a four-armed man stood there, the aura within him spreading out in all directions like an abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Even the strongest wouldn't find it easy to kill me, how could I possibly fall in this two-dimensional world?" The four-armed man's eyes shone brightly, he was a powerful special life form on par with the 'Mother of the Arboreal Realm'.</p><p></p><p>He had met all the prerequisites for striving for the ultimate a long time ago. If he hadn't been worried about failing in his attempt, he would have started long ago.</p><p></p><p>"This two-dimensional world may not be a bad thing for me. If I can eventually leave safely, I have a feeling my mental state will be greatly improved."</p><p></p><p>The four-armed man silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even he could feel a certain pressure at this moment, which was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>Luochuan Gathering Place.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered this large gathering place with Paduo and others. </p><p></p><p>As far as Lin Yuan could see, there were many people coming and going, some even emanating the aura of a Demonic cultivator. </p><p></p><p>But Demonic Kings were still rare. At least for now, besides the Demonic Kings lurking deep in the gathering place, Lin Yuan had not discovered a second Demonic King.</p><p></p><p>"Paduo, I need to leave for a bit," Lin Yuan bid farewell to Paduo.</p><p></p><p>This time he came, Lin Yuan did not plan to go back.</p><p></p><p>Settling in the gathering place would be very beneficial for Lin Yuan. At least the various cultivation resources he needed could be easily obtained here.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in such a gathering place, information tended to be very accessible, which was also something Lin Yuan greatly needed.</p><p></p><p>As for the cost of settling down? For Lin Yuan, who was now a Demonic King, it was extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Paduo nodded.</p><p></p><p>This time they came to exchange the resources they had obtained and purchase some daily necessities to take back.</p><p></p><p>Parting with Paduo, Lin Yuan quickly went to a shop.</p><p></p><p>"Sir," a charming woman greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's attire was plain, the aura he faintly emanated made one unable to ignore him.</p><p></p><p>"I want to sell some things," Lin Yuan calmly said.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, our shop offers extremely fair purchase prices, please feel free to sell," the charming woman immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan nodded, then took out a clump of soft white fur.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" The charming woman's expression changed slightly. "White Fox fur? And it's even the most precious part of the fur?"</p><p></p><p>The charming woman's heart was stirred into huge waves.</p><p></p><p>The White Fox was a Demonic-level ferocious beast with extreme speed. Even for a Demonic King, catching one would be very difficult, let alone capturing it alive and then skinning it.</p><p></p><p>The fur of the White Fox was very popular in those large cities, not only warm and soft, but also nourishing for women.</p><p></p><p>"How much is it worth?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I cannot make this decision myself. Let me call over the shopkeeper," the charming woman said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Lin Yuan's tone was indifferent. An ordinary Demonic King may not be able to catch a White Fox, but Lin Yuan was no ordinary Demonic King.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a man with a beard hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Sir."</p><p></p><p>"For this clump of White Fox fur, our shop is willing to offer a purchase price of thirty thousand Demonic crystals," the bearded man pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Thirty thousand Demonic crystals was already a considerable fortune, and matched the normal purchase price for White Fox fur.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly completed the transaction.</p><p></p><p>The bearded man watched Lin Yuan leave.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, why didn't you try to lower the price?" The charming woman asked, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She could tell Lin Yuan was eager to sell the White Fox fur, so lowering the price would have been most important at that time.</p><p></p><p>"Lower the price?" The bearded shopkeeper glanced at the charming woman. "You think we could lower the price on a Demonic King who can capture a live White Fox and take its fur?"</p><p></p><p>"A Demonic King?" The charming woman was startled.</p><p></p><p>That young man just now was a Demonic King?</p><p></p><p>The strongest in the Luochuan Gathering Place were at most Demonic Kings.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," the bearded shopkeeper shook his head. "But since he could produce White Fox fur, I treated him as a Demonic King."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the shop, Lin Yuan went to a few other shops.</p><p></p><p>He liquidated most of the spoils he had obtained from hunting ferocious beasts over this period.</p><p></p><p>He gained another twenty-three hundred Demonic crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Paduo, I won't be going back."</p><p></p><p>"If you have anything in the future, you can come to this place to find me," Lin Yuan saw Paduo one last time.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to Paduo, Lin Yuan went to the residence he had purchased.</p><p></p><p>It was a manor, which Lin Yuan had spent over twenty thousand Demonic crystals to buy.</p><p></p><p>Owning property was one of the conditions for being able to settle in the gathering place.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll just slowly cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan cherished every moment, clearly aware that after news of the Heavenly Gate's opening spread, all the powerful beings from the main universe descending into this two-dimensional world would strive to raise their strength regardless of anything else.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Gate opened in two thousand years, Lin Yuan was confident he could sweep through all the powerful beings from the main universe.</p><p></p><p>But with only two hundred years of time, it was still too short.</p><p></p><p>Soon, twenty years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

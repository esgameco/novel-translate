            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 425: A Hundred Years Later (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, the vast majority of areas were desolate and barren.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a tiny figure drifted in, following the ever-present tides of the void. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly opened his eyes and scanned the surrounding void, a sense of reflection welling up within him.</p><p></p><p>He had wandered the secret realm of the void for five years, and the boundless void for another five years.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he chose to sit down in meditation, digesting and comprehending his insights.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed.</p><p></p><p>For these twenty years of meditation, Lin Yuan randomly chose a position, not exerting any force, simply drifting with the ebbs and flows of the void tides.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years of enlightenment, the gains in fusing other rules were immense, but the space-time fusion rule? Still stuck at the sixth realm, far from even reaching the peak."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently to himself, not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The sixth realm of the space-time fusion rule was already the domain of the supremely powerful. As for the peak of the sixth realm, or even the seventh, eighth, or ninth realms?</p><p></p><p>No matter how confident Lin Yuan was in himself, he did not think he could comprehend them in the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Profound Lord who roamed the chaotic void had only attained the ninth realm in his comprehension of the space-time fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>Even so, when the six-armed figure spoke to Lin Yuan about these matters, he was filled with pride.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, after the sixth realm, even supremely powerful beings found further comprehension of the space-time fusion rule extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"I'll set aside the space-time fusion rule for now," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The main reason he could reach the sixth realm of space-time comprehension so quickly was due to the insights on space-time contributed by the powerful experts of myriad races within the "Blank Slate" two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Without those insights, even with his extraordinary comprehension abilities, Lin Yuan would have taken ten times, or even dozens of times longer to reach the sixth realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the insights from the powerful experts of the myriad races did not delve into the sixth realm, the numerous third, fourth, and fifth realm comprehensions of space-time provided Lin Yuan with an extremely solid foundation. Aided by the secret art 'Heavenly River', he was finally able to cross into the sixth realm within just a few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension of the space-time fusion rule is sufficient. Even if I advance to the eleventh stage, it will be extremely difficult to reach the seventh realm. Before the seventh realm, there is not a huge difference between the sixth realm and its peak."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought, "What I need to consider now is how to comprehend the chaos rule."</p><p></p><p>The chaos rule was the origin of all rules, encompassing even the space-time fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend the chaos rule before his final assault on the ultimate realm, it would greatly increase his chances of crossing into the twelfth stage.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the chaos rule was even more difficult than comprehending the sixth realm of the space-time fusion rule, perhaps many times more so.</p><p></p><p>The chaos rule transcended all other rules. Only supremely powerful beings had the possibility of touching upon the chaos rule, but even then, it was only a possibility.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of supremely powerful beings had never comprehended the chaos rule.</p><p></p><p>At least among the nine supremely powerful beings of human civilization, none had comprehended the chaos rule.</p><p></p><p>If even supremely powerful beings could not achieve it, then beings below that level essentially had no chance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not intend to comprehend the chaos rule in the tenth stage. As long as he could do so before his final assault on the ultimate realm, that would suffice.</p><p></p><p>"But how exactly do I comprehend the chaos rule?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt somewhat vexed. The method to comprehend the chaos rule was very simple - he just needed to fuse all the rules together.</p><p></p><p>But it was easier said than done, extremely difficult to actually accomplish.</p><p></p><p>How to fuse them? What method of fusion?</p><p></p><p>These were all problems.</p><p></p><p>Just fusing time and space had already cost Lin Yuan so much time and effort.</p><p></p><p>To fuse all the rules together?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that he was still lacking in many areas.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly..." </p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when I reach the eleventh stage, I will find the right direction."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that the rules a tenth stage life could sense were completely different from an eleventh stage life.</p><p></p><p>The higher one climbed, the farther one could see - this did not just refer to perspective, but encompassed many other aspects as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his extraordinary comprehension abilities would also continue to improve as his realm advanced, allowing them to manifest even more inconceivable effects.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining time I can linger here..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the illusory panel in the bottom left of his vision.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Lin Yuan]</p><p>[Identity: Master of the Myriad Realms Gate] </p><p>[Innate Talent: Defying Heavens Comprehension]</p><p>[Ability: Rebirth from a Drop of Blood]</p><p>[Ability: Augmentation]</p><p>[Ability: Elemental Body]</p><p>[Ability: World]</p><p>[Current State: Descent of Consciousness]</p><p>[Remaining Linger Time: 101 years]</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had already descended into the boundless void for 500 years. With a total linger time of 600 years, Lin Yuan had 100 years remaining.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough."</p><p></p><p>"Time to return and wrap up some loose ends."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slowly stood up. This descent into the Azure World had allowed his personal strength to increase as expected.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the fifth physical ability or the various insights into rules, compared to before he embarked, he had made sufficient progress in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Besides increasing his strength, Lin Yuan also needed to pay attention to the propagation of the martial path evolution system.</p><p></p><p>This would not only impact his final assault on the ultimate realm, but even his future success in becoming a supremely powerful being depended greatly on how widely the path of martial evolution spread.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward.</p><p>In an instant, he appeared within the Tian Qing world. </p><p>Standing in front of the Martial Hall.</p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao immediately hurried over to pay respects.</p><p>"How are the preparations going?"</p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the High Priest Qing Yao.</p><p>Having sat in meditation in the void for twenty years, Lin Yuan was naturally not purely secluded in cultivation.</p><p>Occasionally he would also pass down orders to the High Priest Qing Yao through the Primordial Demonic Tree.</p><p>In fact, it was not just in the Tian Qing world, but in dozens of other worlds that had already been occupied by the Yin Yuan Spirit, they were similarly within Lin Yuan's sphere of command.</p><p>"Everything is prepared."</p><p>To her, the words of the Martial Ancestor were more important than her own life.</p><p>The orders issued by the Martial Ancestor were naturally something the High Priest Qing Yao would complete regardless of any cost.</p><p>"Two billion six hundred and fifty million martial cultivators are standing by, with even more martial cultivators still being recruited."</p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao spoke.</p><p>These two billion six hundred and fifty million martial cultivators were at least at the third stage of martial cultivation, having already traveled quite a distance in the martial cultivation system.</p><p>They were the martial elites of the Tian Qing world.</p><p>"Good."</p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p>He had the High Priest Qing Yao prepare so many martial cultivators in order to accelerate the spread of the martial cultivation system.</p><p>How to spread the martial cultivation system at the fastest speed? Naturally, it was to send a group of martial cultivators who had already achieved some accomplishments in martial arts to worlds where martial cultivation was just beginning to sprout.</p><p>The boundless void contained billions upon billions of worlds, and even if Lin Yuan only took half of those domains, the number of worlds he possessed was inconceivable.</p><p>To spread martial arts to so many worlds? Relying solely on the Yin Yuan Spirit and the Sun Yuan Spirit would cause them to die of exhaustion.</p><p>In the previous few hundred years, the Yin Yuan Spirit had only occupied a few dozen worlds, partly because it tried to remain low-key as much as possible to avoid attracting the attention of other evil spirits.</p><p>But even if the Yin Yuan Spirit spread martial arts without any restraint, in a few hundred years, the number of worlds influenced by martial arts would probably only be in the hundreds or thousands.</p><p>Spreading martial arts was not as simple as just occupying a world; it also required a great deal of time to influence and assimilate that world.</p><p>The latter was where most of the time was spent when the Yin Yuan Spirit occupied worlds to spread martial arts.</p><p>When Lin Yuan first took over the Tian Qing world, his true self also spent a lot of time on this.</p><p>Therefore, the best way to spread martial arts was to let the martial cultivators spread it themselves.</p><p>This was also why, in the first few hundred years after his descent, Lin Yuan did not quietly cultivate in the Tian Qing world, but instead had the Yin Yuan Spirit occupy world after world.</p><p>Only by occupying more worlds and establishing a larger foundation of martial cultivators could the spread of martial arts be faster in the future.</p><p>Otherwise, relying solely on the martial cultivators of the single Tian Qing world to spread martial arts would still be inefficient.</p><p>"Next, I will send these martial cultivators to different worlds," Lin Yuan said.</p><p>Of course, this task would not be carried out by his true self, but by the Yin Yuan Spirit and the Sun Yuan Spirit.</p><p>Transporting a large number of martial cultivators to descend upon different worlds was not a difficult task for the two great spirits. With their shared comprehension of rules and Lin Yuan's realization of the sixth level of space-time fusion,</p><p>combined with the vast inner worlds within his body, the transportation mission was extremely simple.</p><p>"Send to different worlds..."</p><p>The High Priest Qing Yao's heart raced. Although she had vaguely sensed this possibility, hearing the Martial Ancestor say it directly still made it difficult to conceal her excitement.</p><p>If it was truly as the Martial Ancestor said, wouldn't martial arts have the prospect of becoming the sovereign of this boundless void?</p><p>Next,</p><p>Lin Yuan went to dozens of other worlds in turn. These dozens of worlds had been personally occupied by the Yin Yuan Spirit, and even if martial arts spread throughout the boundless void in the future, they would still be considered one of the originating worlds of martial arts.</p><p>After completing all this,</p><p>Lin Yuan took another step forward.</p><p>Appearing deep within the void secret realm.</p><p>"Martial Ancestor."</p><p>The Child of the Void was startled and immediately bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p>At this moment, he was not in the most core area of the void secret realm, but rather in the second most important area.</p><p>Ever since realizing that the Martial Ancestor could freely enter and exit the core area of the void secret realm, the Child of the Void had not entered that place again, subconsciously treating the core area as the Martial Ancestor's domain.</p><p>He had voluntarily retreated to this place.</p><p>"How are the arrangements going?"</p><p>Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p>"Almost done."</p><p>"Most of the evil spirits have already retreated to the divided territories."</p><p>The Child of the Void immediately replied.</p><p>Decades ago, the Child of the Void had divided the boundless void and the void secret realm into two parts.</p><p>One side was the territory of the evil spirits, and the other side was the territory of the martial cultivators.</p><p>He had presented this division to Lin Yuan for review.</p><p>Lin Yuan had agreed at the time.</p><p>After saying a few words to the Child of the Void,</p><p>Lin Yuan's form disappeared again.</p><p>Lin Yuan's form appeared in the hidden space of the void secret realm, and he sat down cross-legged.</p><p>"For the next two hundred years, I will continue secluded cultivation."</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Lin Yuan slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>The two great spirits continued to transport many martial cultivators to other worlds.</p><p>While his true self cultivated here.</p><p>Time passed rapidly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, two hundred years had gone by.</p>

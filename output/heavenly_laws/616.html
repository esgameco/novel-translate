        <h1>Chapter 616</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Venerable Ones who were observing from afar had not yet reacted when they heard the voice of the Dual Source Great Saint quickly spreading through the spatial-temporal fluctuations:</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Great Saint, I admit defeat this time and will immediately leave this universe. I swear I will not approach this universe for ten thousand universal cycles."</p><p></p><p>After the brief encounter with Lin Yuan, the Dual Source Great Saint no longer had any thoughts about this Mysterious Yellow Universe, no matter how the Opener was an almost invincible Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>His Dual Source was simply no match for Lin Yuan. In front of Lin Yuan, the Dual Source Great Saint not only failed to save his life, but almost couldn't even escape.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't taken advantage of Lin Yuan dealing with Black Brilliance and Savage Might, causing the overwhelming spatial-temporal suppression forces around to disperse, the Dual Source Great Saint wasn't even sure if he could have escaped like he did now by desperately activating the Dual Source fusion power.</p><p></p><p>"That's... the Dual Source Great Saint?"</p><p>"The Dual Source Great Saint is admitting defeat?"</p><p>"Who is the Silver River Great Saint?"</p><p>"Duh, who else could it be? Among the ten Great Saints, except for the mysterious last one who appeared, the other nine all have titles. The Silver River Great Saint must be that mysterious Great Saint!"</p><p></p><p>The many Chaos Venerables were immediately in an uproar. In their speculation, the probability of the Dual Source Great Saint being the victor in the battle of the ten Great Saints was very high.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Great Saint's strength was indeed formidable, and he was the first to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint was the first to flee and admit defeat? "The Silver River Great Saint... I've never heard of him before."</p><p></p><p>"Probably an ancient Great Saint from eons ago, to be able to force the Dual Source Great Saint to admit defeat and swear not to approach this universe for ten thousand universal cycles. That Silver River Great Saint must have the power to annihilate the Dual Source Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>A peak Chaos Venerable concluded.</p><p></p><p>If the strength was only slightly superior, the Dual Source Great Saint would not have needed to be so panicked and immediately swear to leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, the spatial-temporal suppression of this post-natal universe was so severe that its Opener must not be simple, even if he had given up the worldly treasure at hand.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Dual Source Great Saint had a bit of confidence, he would have gone to explore other areas.</p><p></p><p>But directly swearing to leave meant that the Dual Source Great Saint did not dare to linger at all.</p><p></p><p>Even staying for a while would come at a price.</p><p></p><p>"If the Silver River Great Saint's strength is so strong, why didn't the Dual Source Great Saint join forces with the other eight Great Saints to fight him?" a Chaos Venerable asked with doubt.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know they didn't try to join forces to fight him?" The peak Chaos Venerable who had just drawn the conclusion said with a shocked tone, "Maybe the nine Great Saints have already tried to join forces to fight, but were still suppressed by the Silver River Great Saint, and only the Dual Source Great Saint managed to escape."</p><p></p><p>The deathly silence on the battlefield just now had made him quite puzzled. With all ten Great Saints in there, how could there be not even a single sign? Now seeing the Dual Source Great Saint fleeing in panic, this peak Venerable drew an even deeper conclusion - that the strength of the Silver River Great Saint had already reached the level of being able to easily crush the joint forces of the nine Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he was able to easily suppress the aftershocks of the battle, causing the outside world to see an unusually quiet battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Silver River Great Saint be an Absolute Great Saint?" The peak Chaos Venerable was inwardly shocked. Nine Chaos Great Saints joining forces, three of them being powerful Dual Source Great Saints like this one. </p><p></p><p>Yet they were all swept away by the Silver River Great Saint. The only conclusion the peak Venerable could draw was that the Silver River Great Saint might be an Absolute Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Mysterious Yellow Universe,</p><p>The gray-blue light stopped, forming the figure of the Dual Source Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"This Silver River Great Saint..."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint's expression showed fear, and at the same time, seeing that Lin Yuan did not pursue him out, he heaved a huge sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, that treasure item held back the Silver River Great Saint, or else I might not have escaped so easily."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint thought to himself. From his brief contact, he was certain that Lin Yuan's spatial-temporal distortion technique was also suitable for chasing and suppressing enemies.</p><p></p><p>That distorted space-time could be shrunk to hundreds of light-years to maximize suppression, or instantly expanded to millions or tens of millions of light-years to obstruct the enemy's escape.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had really pursued him, the Dual Source Great Saint would have had no chance of surviving.</p><p></p><p>"Not a match, I'm not a match at all. Chaos Great Saints can actually become this powerful?" </p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint calmed down and began to review the situation.</p><p></p><p>In terms of spatial-temporal suppression, the Silver River Great Saint was far superior to Black Brilliance Great Saint's black distortion. Even the Dual Source Great Saint found it extremely difficult under the shroud of that distorted space-time.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Silver River Great Saint's offensive capabilities were also terrifyingly powerful. Especially with that grabbing motion, the Black Brilliance Great Saint's Black Brilliance Domain directly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Might Great Saint's powerful physique also quickly weakened.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the distorted space-time suppression and nearly Chaos Great Saint-level offensive abilities, Lin Yuan could easily sweep away Chaos Great Saint-level powerhouses. These two capabilities complementing each other unleashed combat power far beyond just a simple addition.</p><p></p><p>In the Dual Source Great Saint's view, Lin Yuan almost had no weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Lin Yuan was not yet an Absolute Great Saint, nor Lin Yuan's opponent. </p><p></p><p>But for Chaos Great Saints like them, Lin Yuan's suppressive force was no different from an Absolute Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Great Saints walked different paths and excelled in different areas, but Lin Yuan was almost perfect. The only thing the Dual Source Great Saint was unsure of was Lin Yuan's defense.</p><p></p><p>Because under the distorted space-time suppression, the Dual Source Great Saint couldn't even get close to Lin Yuan, and all his attacks were blocked and diluted by the overwhelming spatial-temporal forces.</p><p></p><p>"Although the losses are severe... at least I escaped with my life."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint sighed. With his perception of causality, he naturally sensed that the causal threads of Savage Might Great Saint, Black Brilliance Great Saint and a few other Great Saints were still in the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>That meant their main combat bodies in the Mysterious Yellow Universe had not yet perished. </p><p></p><p>Under such extreme spatial-temporal suppression, the Chaos Great Saints suppressed by Lin Yuan were only alive or dead at Lin Yuan's will. The fact that they were not killed meant Lin Yuan did not intend to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Why did he not intend to kill them? It was naturally to extract more benefits.</p><p></p><p>The main combat bodies of each Chaos Great Saint were forged at the cost of many generations.</p><p></p><p>If possible, no Chaos Great Saint would be willing to give up their main combat body. Lin Yuan not killing Black Brilliance, Savage Might and the others could only mean that the two sides were negotiating.</p><p></p><p>"Probably Black Brilliance, Savage Might and the others will be slaughtered by the Silver River Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Dual Source Great Saint didn't know why, but he actually felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He had used the ancient altar spirit to rush out of the Mysterious Yellow Universe in a short time, of course at a great cost.</p><p></p><p>Now, returning empty-handed was equivalent to a complete loss, a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>But compared to Black Brilliance Great Saint, Savage Might Great Saint and the others, the Dual Source Great Saint actually felt 'lucky' in a way. At least while being slaughtered by the ancient altar spirit, he didn't have to be slaughtered by the Silver River Great Saint as well.</p><p></p><p>In the outer universe,</p><p>Seeing the Nine Phoenix Great Saint, Shadow Demon Great Saint...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two newly ascended great saints had their physical bodies and souls rapidly destroyed. The surrounding few chaos great saints were slightly trembling in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean, Galaxy Great Saint?" The others asked nervously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, as long as you bring the required chaos stones, you'll be able to leave here alive," Lin Yuan said as he swept his gaze across the many great saints.</p><p></p><p>He directly destroyed the physical bodies and souls of the Nine Phoenix Great Saint and Shadow Demon Great Saint, not even giving them a chance to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he had a personal grudge against these two chaos great saints. </p><p></p><p>The premature destruction of his home universe was caused by the aftershocks of the battles between these two chaos great saints.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's strength had increased even slightly slower, he might have been destroyed along with the universe's great collapse before he could ascend to the 12th Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the 12th Realm, his essential life imprint would still have been bound within the river of time. And during the universe's great collapse, the river of time would gradually disintegrate and decay, causing all the life imprints within it to perish.</p><p></p><p>This rule of the chaotic void would apply regardless of how powerful Lin Yuan's life imprint was - as long as it remained in the river of time, it would collapse and be destroyed along with it. At that time, the only way for Lin Yuan to survive would be to transfer his life imprint into the universes of the nine strongest human civilization experts.</p><p></p><p>However, the premature arrival of the universe's great collapse had greatly reduced the chances of the human civilization's strongest experts surviving it. If the universe containing Lin Yuan's life imprint were to collapse, he would still die.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, under normal circumstances, the universe's great collapse arriving so prematurely would certainly lead to massive casualties among the countless citizens of the human civilization, including the strongest experts.</p><p></p><p>Although everything had changed because of Lin Yuan, allowing the human civilization group to smoothly weather the universe's great collapse, he had not forgotten the two great saints.</p><p></p><p>Before, when he lacked the power, he could do nothing about them. But now that they were in his hands, Lin Yuan naturally took the opportunity to take his revenge.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another reason why Lin Yuan chose to act against the Nine Phoenix and Shadow Demon - the price they could pay was quite limited.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Sovereign had already exhausted most of his accumulated resources to reach the Chaos Realm's perfection. And these two great saints had been constantly fighting each other since their breakthroughs, leaving them no time to accumulate chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"The chaos great saints I could only look up to from afar have now become not as powerful," Lin Yuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He then continued looking at the other surrounding chaos great saints, smiling as he said, "I will give you time to consider, but not too much."</p><p></p><p>Based on each chaos great saint's strength, Lin Yuan quoted them prices - 1 billion chaos stones for powerful ones like Black Obsidian and Violent Savage, and 500 million or 300 million for the weaker ones.</p><p></p><p>According to Lin Yuan's estimation, these prices were close to the limit that each chaos great saint could bear. Any higher, and they would rather choose to abandon their main combat bodies than agree.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation of a main combat body was not easy - it was just a matter of how much price one was willing to pay. If the price exceeded the effort and time required to cultivate a new main combat body, the chaos great saints would naturally choose to cultivate a new one.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Galaxy Great Saint." </p><p></p><p>The Violent Savage Great Saint and Black Obsidian Great Saint glanced at each other - 1 billion chaos stones was a huge amount that would take them time to gather.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent, ever since the discovery of the mysterious great saint who resembled "Brother Galaxy", the Ancient Bright Sovereign had been paying close attention to the news and information within the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"What? Ten great saints fought over a precious treasure, and that mysterious great saint single-handedly swept away the other nine, with only the Dual Source Great Saint escaping, who immediately swore to leave this outer universe?"</p><p></p><p>"In the end, the Dual Source Great Saint called that mysterious great saint the 'Galaxy Great Saint'?"</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Great Saint? Brother Galaxy?" Ancient Bright Sovereign was a bit dazed. If before it was just a guess that the mysterious great saint was Brother Galaxy, without any actual evidence to confirm it.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ancient Bright Sovereign was not present on the scene, and could only feel a sense of familiarity from the transmitted images.</p><p></p><p>But now? </p><p></p><p>Ancient Bright Sovereign was almost certain that the mysterious great saint was indeed Brother Galaxy. What a coincidence - both the similarity and the name were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Bright Sovereign was deeply shocked. Even though he had long known that Lin Yuan was destined to stand at the peak of the chaotic void, this had happened too quickly.</p><p></p><p>It had not been that long.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have already established a good relationship with the Galaxy Great Saint. Even if we did not form a friendship, at least I would not incur his displeasure." Ancient Bright Sovereign's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>When facing such a terrifying expert, it was better to have no achievements than to provoke him.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because I reminded you in time." The young man in the black robe, who had also been observing the information about the "Galaxy Great Saint", couldn't help but claim credit.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, you reminded me at the right time." Ancient Bright Sovereign immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed the case. If not for the young man's reminder, he would not have paid special attention to Lin Yuan back then.</p><p></p><p>If he had not noticed, it would have meant he did not focus on him, and if Lin Yuan had encountered any unpleasant incidents in the Ancient Bright Chaos Continent, wouldn't Ancient Bright Sovereign have ended up taking the blame?</p><p></p><p>The battle in the Mysterious Yellow Universe had spread like a hurricane through the surrounding void domains, with the reputation of the Galaxy Great Saint resounding throughout the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>At first, some chaos sovereigns and great saints did not believe it, but as time passed and neither the Dual Source Great Saint nor the Black Obsidian Great Saint denied it, many realized the news was likely true.</p><p></p><p>In the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan stood silently as the powerful spatial forces from his outer universe constantly pressed down on the distant Dark Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Sky Palace was surrounded by dark sky forces that could threaten even chaos great saints. Even the powerful Dual Source Great Saint would have to exert their full strength to resist such forces, and it would take considerable time to enter the palace and retrieve the Dark Sky Heart.</p><p></p><p>But for the current Lin Yuan, it was not too difficult, if not exactly easy.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The forces from his outer universe swept over, and the dark sky forces surrounding the Dark Sky Palace began to rapidly dissipate and disappear.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten breaths, the dark sky forces around the palace had been completely driven away, fully exposing the dark palace before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and reached out towards the Dark Sky Palace.</p><p></p><p>When he withdrew his hand, a crystalline stone, emanating a deep, dark aura like a beating heart, appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

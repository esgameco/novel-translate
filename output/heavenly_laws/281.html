            <p>Chapter 281: Three Precious Treasures (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Over two thousand years old?" Lin Yuan was also carefully observing the black mirror.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the Gate of Myriad Realms eight times, each time staying for twenty years, eighty years, one hundred and sixty years, three hundred years, five hundred years, six hundred years, thirty years, and nine hundred and twenty years respectively.</p><p></p><p>Adding up all the time spent in those realms, it totaled two thousand six hundred and ten years. If the time in the main world was included, Lin Yuan's precise age was two thousand six hundred and thirty years old.</p><p></p><p>Here, the precise age refers to the age of the mind and will, which is the most fundamental way to determine the age of a living being.</p><p></p><p>As for the age of the physical body? The age of the soul? They cannot fundamentally measure the true years a life has experienced.</p><p></p><p>After all, the physical body can be replaced, and the soul can be abandoned. Only the true spirit of the mind and will is the core of life.</p><p></p><p>"It can actually calculate my true age so precisely?" Lin Yuan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>When he met the supreme expert Xia Qin earlier, the other party also sensed Lin Yuan's true age, but far less accurately than this mirror.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, who had mastered the complete rules of time, could sense the true years Lin Yuan had experienced, which was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>But this mirror?</p><p></p><p>"It must be a treasure related to the rules of time." Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Time-related treasures contain the power of time, and only those who have fully mastered the rules of time have the ability to refine them.</p><p></p><p>"How exactly did you cultivate? In just over two thousand years, not only did you cultivate to the eighth stage, but you also comprehended so many universal powers?" The stone statue Shen Ji couldn't understand. "Could it be that you have never encountered any bottlenecks or shackles?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji felt it was a bit absurd.</p><p></p><p>The talent Lin Yuan had displayed so far, even if he were four or five million years old, would be considered incredible, let alone just over two thousand years old. What could one achieve in just over two thousand years?</p><p></p><p>Enough to comprehend a universal power?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the stone statue had many guesses in its mind.</p><p></p><p>For example, was there something wrong with the black mirror?</p><p></p><p>Or was Lin Yuan a legendary time being?</p><p></p><p>The former was almost impossible. The black mirror was refined by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower and contained complete time rules. Even if there was a problem with this trial space, it would not malfunction.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter, time beings are born in time, living in the river of time, existing in the past, present, and future. The passage of time cannot leave any traces on them, so they escaped the probing of the black mirror?</p><p></p><p>But even for a great existence like the owner of the Magic Jade Tower, they had only heard of time beings and had never seen them with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The more the stone statue Shen Ji thought about it, the more difficult it was to understand.</p><p></p><p>Even if one was an abnormally monstrous genius, they should at least conform to basic logic, right? Lin Yuan, however, had completely shattered its understanding.</p><p></p><p>What the stone statue Shen Ji didn't know was that the eighth stage cultivation and dozens of universal powers were just part of Lin Yuan's achievements in the past two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's greatest gain was opening up the path of martial arts evolution, which was his true focus and effort.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial arts evolution was Lin Yuan's strongest foundation for becoming a supreme expert in the future. Whether it was spatial rules and other rules, or various universal powers, they all served the path of martial arts evolution.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps my comprehension is a bit higher than others?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I don't care why you can do these things. The talent and potential you have shown can allow you to freely choose three treasures from all the rewards on the first and second floors of the Black Tower."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji spoke.</p><p></p><p>Normally, those who pass the first floor of the Magic Jade Tower will randomly obtain a certain treasure from the first floor. Among all the treasure rewards on the first floor, these treasures are basically in the lower-middle tier.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan utilized dozens of universal powers, including source-grade universal powers. His potential was so high that it exceeded the stone statue's imagination, so it decided to let Lin Yuan freely choose three items from the numerous treasures on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>Freely choosing, and three items at that.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how much stronger it is compared to being randomly bestowed.</p><p></p><p>But now, upon learning that Lin Yuan was only a little over two thousand years old, the stone statue changed the scope of selection from the first floor rewards to both the first and second floor rewards.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that when the owner of the Magic Jade Tower first created this trial space, they established separate reward vaults for each floor. The higher the floor of the Black Tower, the richer and rarer the corresponding reward vault.</p><p></p><p>The reward vault of the second floor was naturally much higher than the reward vault of the first floor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only passed the first floor, yet the scope of his reward selection included the many reward treasures in the second floor reward vault of the Black Tower. One could imagine the shock in the stone statue's heart.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that Lin Yuan basically had no use for most of the reward treasures in the third floor reward vault of the Black Tower, it might have even considered opening up the third floor vault.</p><p></p><p>After the stone statue Shen Ji finished speaking, it raised its right hand, and multiple layers of light screens appeared in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>They recorded numerous treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>"So many treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart raced. The vast majority of the treasures recorded on the reward list were ones he had never even heard of, but through the explanatory notes for these reward treasures, he was certain of their incomparable preciousness.</p><p></p><p>If placed in the main world, they would be enough to make those ninth-stage and tenth-stage experts break their skulls.</p><p></p><p>For example, the source essence gold that the Vermilion Roc Star Lord obtained at a huge cost could only rank at the bottom of this reward list.</p><p></p><p>"Too many, too many."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked through it several times and found it a bit difficult to choose. The main reason was that he had never heard of the vast majority of the reward treasures. Although the list had basic explanatory notes for each reward, it was difficult to thoroughly understand the reward treasure based on these notes alone, and to determine whether it was suitable for him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Shen Ji." Lin Yuan's gaze left the reward list and looked at the stone statue standing beside him. "I don't know which three reward treasures I should choose."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan found it difficult to choose because he was unfamiliar with these reward treasures.</p><p></p><p>But the stone statue Shen Ji, as the guardian of this trial space, was in charge of bestowing the rewards for each floor and certainly knew the value of each reward treasure.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it would be too lazy to bother with these things. But after so many years, it had been too lonely for too long. Moreover, Lin Yuan had displayed talent that was utterly unreasonable and incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji was still very willing to offer its own suggestions.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to choose the most valuable treasure rewards, or are you planning to choose the treasure rewards most suitable for you?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji asked. It needed to understand Lin Yuan's needs before it could make specific suggestions.</p><p></p><p>"Suitable for me." Lin Yuan said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Most of the treasures on the reward list were ones that Lin Yuan had never even heard of, which meant that they might be very difficult to find even in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Obtain.</p><p></p><p>So choose the most suitable one for yourself as much as possible. After all, no matter how high the value of the treasure is, it must be useful to you.</p><p></p><p>"I do have some ideas." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji sized up Lin Yuan, pondered for a moment, and said seriously: "The most important thing for you now is to fully comprehend the complete spatial rules."</p><p></p><p>"Fully comprehend the complete spatial rules?" Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Normal eighth-level lifeforms indeed do not need to fully comprehend the complete spatial rules to break through to the ninth level." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Because with the vastness of spatial rules, you only need to comprehend a small part of it to accommodate and integrate other rules." </p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The integration of Yin rules and Yang rules requires Lin Yuan to fully comprehend both rules before it can be achieved.</p><p></p><p>This is because Yin rules and Yang rules are at the same level, so if you want to integrate them, you must comprehend them all.</p><p></p><p>However, spatial rules are the pillar rules, and their vastness surpasses ordinary rules by an unknown amount. The integration of spatial rules and ordinary rules does not require a thorough comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"But this is under normal circumstances." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji sighed, "Even if some eighth-level lifeforms comprehend a few cosmic powers and break through to the ninth level, the cosmic powers are integrated into the spatial rules along with the ordinary rules."</p><p></p><p>"Basically it has little impact."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji paused for a while after saying this, "But you have comprehended too many cosmic powers, including a primordial-level cosmic power."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to step into the ninth level, you must comprehend the complete spatial rules."</p><p></p><p>"Only the complete spatial rules can carry the dozens of cosmic powers you have comprehended."</p><p></p><p>After the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji finished speaking, he said no more.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is." Lin Yuan suddenly realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he recently felt it was difficult when comprehending the integration of rules. It turned out that the spatial rules he had comprehended so far were not enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan did not reveal that he had comprehended dozens of cosmic powers, so even if others wanted to give advice, they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"So I suggest that the first treasure you choose is the 'Interpretation of the Void'." The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"'Interpretation of the Void'?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up, and he immediately found the introduction and explanation of this treasure in the reward list.</p><p></p><p>"Interpretation of the Void": It is the interpretation and understanding of space by the owner of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The introduction is very short. The only thing that caught Lin Yuan's attention was that this "Interpretation of the Void" came from the owner of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>"The spatial rules are vast and endless. The so-called complete mastery of spatial rules is only mastering one aspect of it. This 'Interpretation of the Void' written by the owner interprets and understands the spatial rules from another perspective."</p><p></p><p>"It should be of great use to you. Even if you comprehend the complete spatial rules in the future, it can still be effective."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue looked at Lin Yuan and said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"I'll choose this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said immediately.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence is the owner of the Magic Jade Tower? Even a few words he wrote are priceless, let alone a complete book of "Interpretation of the Void"?</p><p></p><p>So after hearing the suggestion of the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji, Lin Yuan had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji showed a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's talent and aptitude are extremely rare, it is estimated that even the owner of the Magic Jade Tower was far inferior when he was at the eighth level.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how heaven-defying one's aptitude is, it needs to be on the right path to be effective. In the reward vault of the first and second floors of the Nine-Storey Black Tower, there is no shortage of weapons and treasures that can greatly increase combat power.</p><p></p><p>But on the path of a lifeform's evolution, the usefulness of combat power is far lower than the metamorphosis of the lifeform itself.</p><p></p><p>"This is the 'Interpretation of the Void', the masterpiece of the owner. I hope you can contemplate it well." The humanoid stone statue waved his right hand.</p><p></p><p>A silver-white book appeared in mid-air, over a meter tall, emitting faint spatial fluctuations. Lin Yuan looked at the book and seemed to see the vast spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the silver-white book. One by one, the silver-white characters began to leave the book and approach Lin Yuan, all merging into his forehead.</p><p></p><p>The silver-white characters merged one after another. Each silver-white character contained a large amount of information. If recorded in the characters of human civilization, it is estimated that even millions of characters would be far from enough to express it.</p><p></p><p>After a total of 3,333 silver-white characters merged into Lin Yuan's forehead, the entire silver-white book began to disintegrate and disappear.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body on the main star of the galaxy also closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The 3,333 silver-white characters that appeared in the depths of his mind emitted a silver-white light. Lin Yuan carefully browsed the characters one by one, never having discovered that the information expressed by just one character was so much and so deep.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious characters, your insight into the spatial rules rapidly improves]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious characters, your insight into the spatial rules rapidly improves]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heaven-defying. Observing the mysterious characters, your insight into the spatial rules rapidly improves]</p><p></p><p>Every moment, a large amount of inspiration about space surged into his mind. Lin Yuan had never thought that space could be comprehended in this way. It was not purely comprehending space, but comprehending the five elements, lightning, light, etc., and then comprehending space from shallow to deep.</p><p></p><p>Buzz.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt that he had continuously comprehended four spatial core models.</p><p></p><p>"I've hit the jackpot."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan calmed himself and forcibly shifted his attention away from the silver-white characters in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the owner of the Magic Jade Tower's interpretation and understanding of space." Lin Yuan was excited. "Each character contains endless profundity. This is a description of space from a perspective different from human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that even the strongest, after seeing this "Interpretation of the Void", would have many insights.</p><p></p><p>The strongest have comprehended the complete time rules and complete spatial rules, but each of the strongest has a different understanding of the time rules and spatial rules.</p><p></p><p>Nine-Storey Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The "Interpretation of the Void" was currently being fully comprehended by his true body, and he even put aside the integration of rules for this. After all, if he did not fully comprehend the complete spatial rules, the subsequent integration of Taiji rules and the integration of many cosmic powers would greatly reduce efficiency.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji looked at Lin Yuan and said in a gentle tone, "As for the second treasure, I suggest you choose this one."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, an image appeared in front of the humanoid stone statue.</p><p></p><p>In the image, a sapling swayed, rippling with endless world power.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The rules of life and death cycles guide the space. </p><p></p><p>The rules of life and death cycle endlessly, seeming to have no end.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, immersed in comprehension, directly comprehending the primordial rules of life and death in the universe.  </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the rules of life and death in front of him were constantly interweaving and merging, giving Lin Yuan a feeling of directly watching the 'standard answer'.</p><p></p><p>Every moment, his comprehension of the rules of the life and death cycle was elevating.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of life are filled with endless vitality, while the rules of death pervade boundless deathly aura. The two merge to form the rules of the life and death cycle, the most essential point lying in the word 'cycle'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, with the same rules of life and death interweaving and merging in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"So the rules of the life and death cycle need to construct a stable cycle model, only then can the rules of life and death freely convert and interweave."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to analyze the rules of the life and death cycle in the way of modeling human civilization rules.</p><p></p><p>Even the most basic five elements rules have a thousand different faces, not to mention the fusion of rules - the slightest difference between the two fusing rules would result in variation in the final fused rule.</p><p></p><p>"A stable and perfect cycle model!"</p><p></p><p>The rules of life and death in front of Lin Yuan constantly transformed, eventually forming a vortex-like 'framework' of darkness, faintly beginning to influence time and space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed unaware, still immersed in comprehension.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension transcends the heavens, by observing the fusion of life and death, you have comprehended the first stable cycle model.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his mind booming, as the rules of the life and death cycle elevated to the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>"Finally cultivated this fused rule to the second boundary." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension of fused rules was much harder than imagined, especially from the first to the second boundary. </p><p></p><p>Countless tenth-level experts were stuck until the lifespan limit of the tenth level without being able to cross over.</p><p></p><p>The former Vice Pagoda Master Nalan was like this, as were the Black Star Master, Liuli Master and other tenth-level experts.</p><p></p><p>The latter may have had hope of crossing into the eleventh level, but it was only hope - the greater possibility was failing to cross over.</p><p></p><p>Even for Lin Yuan, after initially comprehending the rules of the life and death cycle and sensing the vast aura of life and death, he felt it would take five to six hundred years to cultivate this fused rule to the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>But now.</p><p></p><p>Only fifty years had passed.</p><p></p><p>And he had cultivated it to the second boundary realm.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, Lin Yuan could now attempt to break through to the eleventh level by relying on the second boundary rules of the life and death cycle.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of the life and death cycle at the second boundary level, coupled with the myriad foundations empowering my physical body, soul, inner world, mind and will, the Profound Strike and more."</p><p></p><p>"The final explosive power may reach the peak of the third boundary, or even approach the power of the fourth boundary rules of the life and death cycle?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>When he initially comprehended the rules of the life and death cycle, Lin Yuan had forcibly raised it from the early first boundary to the second boundary, even initially entering the third, by relying on his many empowering foundations.</p><p></p><p>Now that his comprehension of the life and death cycle rules had reached the second boundary, Lin Yuan felt his normal extreme attack should approach the fourth boundary level.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the fourth boundary level of the pillar-level fused rules, even among eleventh level lifeforms, was considered formidable. Theoretically, the seventh or eighth boundary level fused rules were the realm of the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the means of eleventh level lifeforms went far beyond just fused rules, but at least it showed that in this aspect, Lin Yuan had already reached the normal level of eleventh level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>No longer at the awkward entry level.</p><p></p><p>"Second boundary rules of the life and death cycle." Lin Yuan operated the successfully 'constructed' cycle model, trying to influence the balance of life and death in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Within the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>Vast rules of life and death constantly intertwined, faintly revealing the illusory shadow of a stable great cycle model.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of the small cycle model constructed by Lin Yuan, a tiny local area of the great cycle model in the guiding space began to show slight disorder.</p><p></p><p>But it quickly returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan wasn't surprised by this.  </p><p></p><p>After all, the great cycle model of the life and death rules in the guiding space represented the fourth boundary level life and death cycle rules.</p><p></p><p>He was only at the second boundary now, so naturally he couldn't shake it.</p><p></p><p>This attempt was just to see how far he was from the fourth boundary.</p><p></p><p>Outside the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>A black-robed man's figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The balance of life and death in the space was influenced by an external force?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's expression changed slightly. As the spirit of the altar, the spirit of the black planet, he was fully aware of all changes within the guiding space.</p><p></p><p>"The balance of life and death within the life and death cycle rules guiding space can only be influenced by the life and death cycle rules themselves. That little guy has cultivated the life and death cycle rules to the second boundary?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man immediately deduced the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Second boundary?"  </p><p></p><p>"So soon?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't paid much attention to the second boundary level life and death cycle rules, seeing it as only the entry level for eleventh level lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>But what shocked the black-robed man was that just fifty years ago, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the life and death cycle rules was only at the initial entry level.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, only fifty years had passed, and he had soared to the second boundary.</p><p></p><p>"The flow of time hasn't changed." The black-robed man confirmed that the time of Lin Yuan's comprehension did not deviate from the main flow of time.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on the guiding space could never have such a great effect." The black-robed man's expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>The essential manifestation of the life and death cycle rules within the guiding space merely made it slightly easier for latecomers to comprehend this fused rule.</p><p></p><p>Some bottlenecks that had obstructed people for tens of thousands of years could be overcome in seven or eight thousand years instead.</p><p></p><p>Just slightly easier.</p><p></p><p>Not directly reducing the difficulty to zero.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this kind of guiding space made countless tenth level lifeforms go crazy - at critical junctures, even a slight ease made a qualitative difference, let alone being slightly easier.</p><p></p><p>For example, comprehending a second boundary level pillar-fused rule a bit earlier could allow one to break through to the eleventh level before the lifespan limit of the tenth.  </p><p></p><p>This was not just the difference between the eleventh and tenth levels, but the difference between life and death.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's performance now made the black-robed man slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Because over the past fifty years, Lin Yuan had successively comprehended other pillar-level fused rules, sending out avatars to the guiding spaces behind the other great gates to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>In other words, of the fifty years, the time Lin Yuan actually spent on the life and death cycle rules was probably only a portion.</p><p></p><p>"Do the lifeforms in the outside world these days not follow the rules at all?"</p><p></p><p>After remaining silent for a long time, this thought suddenly emerged in the black-robed man's mind.</p><p></p><p>He had major gaps in his memory, but vaguely remembered that Lin Yuan's speed of comprehension was exaggerated to a terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>On the main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>"I can try to break through to the eleventh level now," Lin Yuan thought inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The biggest obstacle for a tenth level lifeform crossing into the eleventh level was raising a pillar-level rule to the second boundary.  </p><p></p><p>There were also some other requirements regarding the physical body, soul, inner world, etc., but with Lin Yuan's accumulated foundations, he naturally met them all.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan was willing to attempt breaking through to the eleventh level, he could cross over.</p><p></p><p>From initially entering the tenth level, to stepping into the eleventh, it only took fifty years.</p><p></p><p>If this was spread, it would definitely drive a group of tenth level lifeforms insane, even eleventh level lifeforms wouldn't dare believe it.</p><p></p><p>The transition from the tenth to eleventh level was a major boundary realm transcendence, an essence transformation of life. Countless tenth level lifeforms lingered at this boundary for millions or tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Yet you only took fifty years?</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush."</p><p></p><p>"Currently on the black planet, I've only occupied six of the twelve great gates' guiding spaces in the depths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, resisting the urge to break through to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Mainly because there wasn't much benefit.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan wasn't under any pressure, with human civilization being extremely powerful. He could take some more time before breaking through to the eleventh level.</p><p></p><p>Because once he broke through to the eleventh level, he would be unable to enter the remaining six great gates on the black planet.</p><p></p><p>The black life planet was the inheritance star of the tenth level, only allowing tenth level lifeforms to enter. Neither ninth nor eleventh level could go in.</p><p></p><p>So -</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's correct approach was to comprehend all the fused rules corresponding to the twelve great gates on the black planet, then send out avatars to enter the guiding spaces.</p><p></p><p>First occupy the comprehension quotas, then we'll see.</p><p></p><p>As long as the avatars occupied the guiding spaces, even if Lin Yuan broke through...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Until the eleventh realm, he would not be expelled.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at the tenth realm, the more fusion rules he comprehended and the higher the cultivation level of those fusion rules, the greater the benefit to himself. </p><p></p><p>From any perspective, Lin Yuan had no reason to hastily cross into the eleventh realm.</p><p></p><p>Other peak tenth realm experts, after raising their pillar-level fusion rules to the second level, would unhesitatingly attempt to break through to the eleventh realm.</p><p></p><p>This was because their potential at the tenth realm had been exhausted, and there was no point in delaying further.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different, he still had great room for improvement.</p><p></p><p>"In fifty years, apart from the rules of life and death cycle and great destruction, I have also comprehended four pillar-level rules corresponding to the twelve great doors of the black planet."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, there were far more than just twelve pillar-level fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>But after clearly understanding the effects of the space guided by the twelve great doors behind the black planet, Lin Yuan's direction in comprehending the pillar-level fusion rules naturally focused on those twelve pillar-level rules.</p><p></p><p>"The six pillar-level fusion rules I have comprehended so far are relatively simple, involving the fusion of two pillar rules."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining six pillar-level fusion rules are much more difficult, encompassing the fusion of three, four or even five pillar rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even among pillar-level fusion rules, there were naturally differences in levels.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the inherent attributes of the pillar rules themselves, but simply the number of fused pillar rules also absolutely determined the height of the final fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>A fusion rule encompassing the space, life and destruction pillar rules would naturally be stronger than one with just the space and life pillar rules.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>"I still have plenty of time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Tenth realm cultivators could easily live for billions of years, and he was still young.</p><p></p><p>"For pillar-level fusion rules, fusing the rules of time and space..." Lin Yuan recalled his attempts in the realm of space-time over the years.</p><p></p><p>Although the time rule was also a pillar-level rule, it transcended other pillar-level rules. Trying to fuse space-time? So far, Lin Yuan's progress in this area had been slow.</p><p></p><p>With the mighty power of the time rule, even fusing it with an ordinary rule would make it far stronger than an ordinary pillar-level fusion rule.</p><p></p><p>"Fusing space-time, and then raising the space-time rule to the fifth level, this is one of the thresholds for eleventh realm experts to attempt the ultimate realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded. At his level, information that was once extremely confidential was now fully known to him, including intelligence on eleventh realm experts attempting the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>The most important point for ultimate beings was to break free from the constraints of the river of time, which required mastery over space-time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the more rules fused, the greater the benefit. If he could comprehend the legendary chaos rule, it would be of tremendous help in attempting the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>"This chaos crystal..." Lin Yuan's mind stirred as he took out a gray crystal, within which the auras of various fused and scattered rules swirled.</p><p></p><p>"If it were ten or a hundred times larger, the help it could provide me might even surpass that of the black planet." The chaos crystal was too small, and the depth of the rules contained within was not high either.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the chaos crystal were ten or a hundred times larger, Lin Yuan would not have obtained it.</p><p></p><p>In the judgment of the nine-story black building in the demon jade space, the chaos crystal was classified as a level eleven wonder, and if it were ten or a hundred times larger, it would undoubtedly be a level twelve wonder, or even a level twelve supreme wonder.</p><p></p><p>Battlefield A098.</p><p></p><p>The Solar Celestial sat cross-legged beneath that thousand-mile permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>"There has been quite a stir from the insect race recently, inviting several eleventh realm special lifeforms to join them. They probably want to intensify the war."</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had never left the range of the permanent spatial rift overhead, his true self was highly attentive to the intelligence and information on this large alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After all, so far he was very satisfied with the speed at which he was accumulating rift source energy on this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>If there were no other unavoidable reasons, Lin Yuan naturally did not wish to leave.</p><p></p><p>"I now have nearly five hundred strands of rift source energy, most of which were accumulated on this battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was in a good mood. With nearly five hundred strands of rift source energy, he had a feeling of being wealthier than ever before.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the increase in the intensity of the war does not become too great." Lin Yuan pondered for a moment. In history, the battlefields with the highest war intensity had almost decimated the large battlefields, with even paramount experts personally taking action.</p><p></p><p>If it really reached that level, Lin Yuan would naturally not have time to calmly accumulate rift source energy here.</p><p></p><p>"But fifty years ago, how did the paramount experts deal with that aurora that came from outside the universe?" Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>The power of that aurora reached an unimaginable level, easily shattering a large alien battlefield. If not for more than a dozen ultimate beings joining forces, the impact would have been even greater.</p><p></p><p>The greater the power of the aurora, the more precious it was. The paramount experts intercepting it must have been a considerable gain.</p><p></p><p>"Did the paramount experts create a permanent spatial rift instead of repairing it, in preparation for this moment?" Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>The permanent spatial rift contained the ultimate destructive power, which the main universe's self-healing abilities could not repair.</p><p></p><p>But if the paramount experts wished, they could take action to dissipate the destructive power within the permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Once the destructive power disappeared, relying on the main universe's powerful healing abilities, it would be easy to repair the rift.</p><p></p><p>Main Galaxy Star.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Lin Yuan continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Destruction Rule..." A wisp of destructive aura appeared before Lin Yuan. In terms of pure killing force, the Great Destruction Rule surpassed even the Life and Death Cycle Rule.</p><p></p><p>Among the six pillar-level fusion rules Lin Yuan currently grasped, the Life and Death Cycle Rule had the highest realm, already reaching the second level.</p><p></p><p>Next was the Great Destruction Rule, just one step away from the second level realm. Lin Yuan estimated that it would take anywhere from a few days to a few months before he could raise this fusion rule to the second level realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lin Yuan would possess two fusion rules at the second level realm, which would significantly boost his combat strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Destruction Rule..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed himself in comprehending the essence of the Great Destruction Rule from the guiding space of the black planet's Great Destruction Rule.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, while comprehending the Great Destruction Rule, Lin Yuan was also comprehending other fusion rules, with each mutually referencing and triggering the others.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Within a twisted space-time.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen majestic figures stood in the four directions, and in the center position among them, a dazzling seven-colored aurora hundreds of miles long was quietly suspended.</p><p></p><p>"This aurora belongs to the rare twelfth level material and can serve as the main ingredient for forging an ultimate weapon. How should we divide it now?"</p><p></p><p>A figure with a horn on its forehead spoke. Those who could stand here were all paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>Fifty years ago, more than a dozen paramount experts joined forces to intercept the aurora that came from outside the universe. After fifty years of suppression, they finally removed the foreign aura from the aurora.</p><p></p><p>And now was the time to divide this aurora.</p><p></p><p>In fact, every paramount expert present wanted to monopolize this aurora for themselves.</p><p></p><p>But if they really did that, it would inevitably provoke the other paramount experts to take action.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the more than a dozen paramount experts were wary of each other, and eventually proposed the relatively peaceful idea of dividing the aurora.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice.</p><p></p><p>At the paramount level, there was no need for a life-or-death struggle over an external object.</p><p></p><p>This aurora was indeed precious, an elite among twelfth level materials, but before being refined into an ultimate weapon, it would provide little boost to the combat strength of paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>"Battlefield A076, one of the main battlefields of my human civilization, was pierced by this aurora, causing heavy casualties among the cultivators of my human civilization. So..."</p><p></p><p>Among the more than a dozen evolved experts, the ancient force evolved expert of the human civilization looked around arrogantly and said, "My human civilization wants one-fifth of this aurora."</p><p></p><p>"One-fifth?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining paramount experts' expressions turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>There were more than a dozen paramount experts present, and even one-tenth each would not be enough, yet you want one-fifth?</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Force, you're going too far?"</p><p></p><p>The horned paramount expert who spoke first opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Too far?"</p><p></p><p>"How do you account for the heavy losses suffered by the young ones of my human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>"They are the elite and future of my human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Force paramount expert narrowed his eyes. "Without one-fifth, I cannot convince the others of this outcome."</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, another eight auras at the paramount level pierced through the space-time barrier and forcefully squeezed in.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

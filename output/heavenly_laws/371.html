        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Not long after parting with Xia Qinzhiqiang, Lin Yuan comprehended the second level of the Great Destruction fusion law. </p><p></p><p>For other top-tier experts at the tenth stage, if they could comprehend the second level of a Pillar-level fusion law, wouldn't they be overjoyed?</p><p></p><p>This meant they could advance to the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>In the vast cosmos of myriad races, eleventh stage lifeforms were the strongest existences below the Paramount Ones. </p><p></p><p>This "strongest" referred to overall strength, not limited to just combat power.</p><p></p><p>For example, thoroughly comprehending the laws of time?</p><p></p><p>For a tenth stage lifeform to thoroughly comprehend the time laws was an extremely high threshold that had rarely occurred since the universe's inception.</p><p></p><p>But for an eleventh stage lifeform to thoroughly comprehend the time laws, although still very difficult, it would be much easier compared to a tenth stage lifeform.</p><p></p><p>Once the time laws were thoroughly understood, it meant a significant extension of one's lifespan.</p><p></p><p>By slowing down the flow of time around themselves, one year for an eleventh stage lifeform could equal thousands or millions of years for a tenth stage lifeform.</p><p></p><p>However -</p><p></p><p>These things didn't hold much significance for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The time laws? Lin Yuan had already thoroughly comprehended them back when he was at the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>And even if he hadn't comprehended them, Lin Yuan didn't care much about his own longevity.</p><p></p><p>How old was he now? The longevity that those ancient eleventh stage lifeforms craved, Lin Yuan already had in excess.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivating the Great Destruction law to the second level, even if he gained another second level fusion law, it wouldn't greatly increase Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was currently benchmarking himself against eleventh stage experts. With his current foundation and means, even without comprehending any second level fusion laws, he could be considered invincible at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>And at the eleventh stage realm, comprehending one second level Pillar fusion law would only represent a slight breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will successively cultivate the remaining four Pillar fusion laws to the second level," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"And the third level..." Lin Yuan's expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the law he had the most hope of advancing to the third level was the Law of Life and Death Reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>However, even with the guidance of the black planet's spatial insights, Lin Yuan estimated it would take between one to two hundred years for him to reach the third level.</p><p></p><p>As for the fourth level? Before even reaching the third level, Lin Yuan did not know the magnitude of advancing to the fourth level, but at most it would not exceed five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"From the first level to the fourth level, taking at most seven hundred years is acceptable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did some rough calculations and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seven hundred years was like the blink of an eye for a tenth stage evolved being, but for Lin Yuan, he could cultivate one Pillar fusion law to the fourth level in that time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in those seven hundred years, Lin Yuan would comprehend not just one Pillar fusion law, but six of them.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he could comprehend new Pillar fusion laws at any time, as well as gain insights into the laws of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"What level would my current strength be considered among eleventh stage lifeforms?"</p><p></p><p>The thought suddenly occurred to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So far, the myriad races of the cosmos divided eleventh stage lifeforms into six ranks.</p><p></p><p>The first rank were those who had just entered the eleventh stage, not even having thoroughly comprehended the time laws.</p><p></p><p>The second rank were those who had thoroughly comprehended the time laws.</p><p></p><p>The third rank were those who had cultivated a certain Pillar law to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>The fourth rank had fused the laws of time and space into the space-time laws.</p><p></p><p>The fifth rank had raised the space-time laws to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>The sixth rank had reached the pinnacle in all aspects, on the verge of breaking through to the Ultimate realm at any moment.</p><p></p><p>In theory, once an eleventh stage lifeform reached the fifth rank, they had the ability to attempt breaking through to the Ultimate realm. But the chances were slim, hence the existence of the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even for sixth rank eleventh stage lifeforms at the apex, the probability of successfully crossing into the Ultimate realm was still very low.</p><p></p><p>To become an Ultimate, transcending the constraints of the river of time with unlimited longevity, involved many factors.</p><p></p><p>Historically, many eleventh stage lifeforms viewed as promising had ultimately failed their attempt and perished.</p><p></p><p>So the various major races concluded that breaking through to the Ultimate realm required a certain "luck" factor.</p><p></p><p>No matter how thorough the preparations or how profound the foundation, without this "luck" factor, success was impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Probably around the second rank," Lin Yuan compared and positioned his current strength at the second rank among eleventh stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Third rank eleventh stage lifeforms had already cultivated a certain Pillar fusion law to the fifth level, a realm Lin Yuan could not reach in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"If I can cultivate all twelve of the Pillar fusion laws within the black planet to the fourth level, I should be on par with third rank eleventh stage lifeforms," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At minimum, a third rank eleventh stage lifeform needed to cultivate a certain Pillar fusion law to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>But twelve Pillar fusion laws at the fourth level represented a qualitative change from the sheer quantity. Combined with the fact that the latter six Pillar fusion laws were not ordinary ones, it should be comparable to a fifth level Pillar fusion law.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the gap between tenth and eleventh stage lifeforms was far from just reflected in fusion law comprehension.</p><p></p><p>There were also vast differences in their physical bodies, souls, inner worlds, willpower, and more.</p><p></p><p>Normally, an eleventh stage lifeform underwent one more infusion of the primordial cosmic essence compared to a tenth stage being - a gulf as vast as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had received the infusion of the primordial essence of chaos and void, which greatly bridged this gap, allowing him the possibility of being on par with eleventh stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, Lin Yuan was idly chatting with Vice Pavilion Master Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"For the A098 alien battlefield, the war intensity is estimated to escalate significantly. The Goddess of Freedom has begun recruiting, asking me to dispatch a clone over there."</p><p></p><p>Vice Pavilion Master Nalan sighed.</p><p></p><p>As an eleventh stage evolved being, each one was absolutely crucial. Even on major alien battlefields, eleventh stage experts were suppression-level forces.</p><p></p><p>As for Paramount Ones? Unless they were truly enraged or other factors arose, Paramount Ones would not take the field.</p><p></p><p>Below the Paramount Ones, eleventh stage beings were the strongest. Even an eleventh stage evolved being like Vice Pavilion Master Nalan who had just entered the first rank could influence the outcome of wars across vast regions.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard about it," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the A098 alien battlefield was the major battlefield where Lin Yuan's solar spiritual body was located.</p><p></p><p>Back when Lin Yuan first sensed the changing situation on the massive alien battlefield, he realized a higher intensity war may be coming.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the war intensity doesn't reach the level of Paramount One intervention, it shouldn't affect me much."</p><p></p><p>On the A098 battlefield, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged beneath the permanent spatial rift. With his comprehension of space and time, other tenth and eleventh stage experts would have difficulty detecting him here.</p><p></p><p>On the main galactic star, Lin Yuan's form sat within the deeper layers of space.</p><p></p><p>An awe-inspiring aura of blood energy circulated as a yellowish force field seemed to emanate and spread within a hundred li around him.</p><p></p><p>This was the 'Xuan Huang Body', one of the three great protective secret arts of the Xuan Huang lineage.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the inheritance, the most important thing was definitely self-preservation - only by staying alive was there hope.</p><p></p><p>This was why the Xuan Huang lineage had techniques like the 'Xuan Huang Body' and 'Space-Time Step' focused on preservation.</p><p></p><p>"The third layer," Lin Yuan opened his eyes and sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Xuan Huang Body' was divided into four layers total, with the fourth being the perfect realm.</p><p></p><p>A twelfth stage lifeform who had perfected the 'Xuan Huang Body' was said to be imperishable, easily able to withstand the damage of a universal epoch's destruction.</p><p></p><p>However, as Lin Yuan continued cultivating, he became increasingly aware of the difficulties of this secret art.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the 'Xuan Huang Body' required vast resources.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan thought that with the large quantities of Xuan Huang crystals in the secret realm, along with the nearly ten thousand ninth stage alien corpses and treasures offered, he could at least cultivate this art to a relatively deep level.</p><p></p><p>This was based on Lin Yuan's deductions from the various information about this secret art.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that Lin Yuan had overlooked a key factor - that he was different from ordinary tenth stage lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>For a common tenth stage lifeform, the vast resources of the secret realm would naturally meet the demands of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Before crossing into the tenth stage, his physical body was already hundreds of times that of peers at the same level.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the tenth stage and undergoing the infusion of primordial essence of chaos and void, this gap had reached the magnitude of tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>And that was just his physical body, not even counting his soul and inner world.</p><p></p><p>For a regular expert to raise the 'Xuan Huang Body' to the next level required one portion of resources.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan needed millions or tens of millions of portions.</p><p></p><p>Although the end result was still satisfactory for Lin Yuan, the resources required were simply too vast.</p><p></p><p>And this was just for Lin Yuan's true body...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One, with the two great spiritual souls still watching beside him. </p><p></p><p>Ever since crossing into the tenth level, finding that his own resource demands had skyrocketed, Lin Yuan decisively stopped the cultivation of the two great spiritual souls in the 'Xuanhuang Physique' secret technique. </p><p></p><p>This defensive secret technique must prioritize the Venerable One's cultivation. As for the two great spiritual souls, they could only be temporarily inconvenienced.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield No. A098.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still sat cultivating beneath the permanent spatial rift. </p><p></p><p>"In the past few months, there have been at least a hundred more eleventh level experts on the battlefield," Lin Yuan glanced at the distant area while cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The total number of eleventh level evolved humans in the human civilization did not exceed one thousand on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Now, just on this single battlefield, there were over a hundred eleventh level experts, not including the eleventh level experts who originally presided over this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As well as those eleventh level experts who came secretly, evading Lin Yuan's perception.</p><p></p><p>"Tuoba Ancient God."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze deepened, on this battlefield, he had heard intelligence about the Tuoba Ancient God. </p><p></p><p>The Tuoba Ancient God was invited by the Insect Race to come aid them.</p><p></p><p>The Tuoba Ancient God was the ancient god corresponding to the ancient god evolution path that Fang Qing originally cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Fang Qing incident, Lin Yuan had some grievances with this ancient god.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan became an evolver, the Tuoba Ancient God was the first to dare openly extort his life.</p><p></p><p>According to the intelligence Lin Yuan obtained about the Tuoba Ancient God,</p><p></p><p>This ancient god was a fifth-tier eleventh level life, with strength so formidable that he ranked among the top ancient gods, otherwise he would not dare defy the Central Ancient God, nor plan to assault the ultimate realm within tens of millions of years.</p><p></p><p>The Central Ancient God had said that the Tuoba Ancient God's lifespan was only a billion years.</p><p></p><p>But for an eleventh level life, a billion year lifespan was not based on the time flow rate of the main world.</p><p></p><p>With the Tuoba Ancient God's control over the flow of time, it was possible he could still be alive hundreds of billions or trillions of years later in the main world.</p><p></p><p>However, the fact that the Tuoba Ancient God had the idea of assaulting the ultimate realm meant he likely would not continue delaying time to eke out a lingering existence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many of the ancient, special lifeforms born since the beginning of the universe had already lived long enough. Delaying their personal time flow to achieve a different kind of immortality held little meaning.</p><p></p><p>Even if they endured through era after era, did that mean they could become the ultimate?</p><p></p><p>But every eleventh level life had a different view.</p><p></p><p>Some eleventh level lifeforms believed that in the distant future, there was hope for them to become the ultimate. Other eleventh level lifeforms felt that since they would die eventually anyway, they might as well quickly assault the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the eleventh level lifeforms with the latter view were basically all special, solitary lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>If they had tribal bonds, they would definitely want to live as long as possible to shelter their tribe for a longer time.</p><p></p><p>The Tuoba Ancient God had no kin or relations, and was the universe's singular, unique special lifeform, which is why he dared to open his mouth so wide against Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is far from being the Tuoba Ancient God's match," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Tuoba Ancient God was a fifth-tier eleventh level, while Lin Yuan was currently only comparable to a second-tier eleventh level - their strengths were incomparable.</p><p></p><p>The six tiers of eleventh level lifeforms had vast gaps in strength between each tier.</p><p></p><p>"Give me another thousand years," Lin Yuan harbored killing intent towards the Tuoba Ancient God, but also realized it was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Only with his current growth rate, he estimated he might have a chance in a thousand or two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would just be a chance. With the Tuoba Ancient God's strength, Lin Yuan estimated he would need to become a paramount expert to have a chance of killing him.</p><p></p><p>Xia You Evolution Spire.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Yin spiritual soul personally rushed over.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there were also other tenth level alpha evolvers.</p><p></p><p>"You only have a hundred years," Xia Qin, the paramount expert's figure appeared, not wasting words as a segment of dazzling, multicolored aurora hovered in the air.</p><p></p><p>According to the agreement with the other eight paramount experts of human civilization, this aurora would stay at each evolution spire for a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>After nine hundred years, it would be used as the main ingredient to forge the ultimate weapon.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the aurora's might would be contained, making it difficult to gain insights from it again.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the extraterrestrial aurora that easily shattered a large battlefield?" Lin Yuan's gaze immediately fell on the aurora.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heavenly, observing the unknown aurora deepens your insight into the laws of light.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heavenly, observing the unknown aurora deepens your insight into the laws of causality.] </p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is heavenly, observing the unknown aurora deepens your insight into the laws of space.]</p><p></p><p>Just in a single breath, Lin Yuan gained insights into dozens of law undulations from this aurora segment, the most concentrated being the laws of light and causality.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of light."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that the laws of light within the aurora were not normal laws of light, but must have fused with the power of other laws, otherwise it could not be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>There were also the laws of causality. This type of law was easy to get into but profoundly difficult. Without fully devoting himself, Lin Yuan's insights into the laws of causality were not very high.</p><p></p><p>"The six remaining pillar-level laws from the Black Planet, two of them involve the laws of causality. Perhaps by using this aurora, I can reach the required insights into the laws of causality?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. Although the laws of causality were not pillar-laws, they surpassed most pillar-laws in terms of insight difficulty.</p><p></p><p>And the pillar-level fusion laws that encompassed the laws of causality were extremely special and bizarre, making them hard to guard against.</p><p></p><p>Alien Battlefield No. A098.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, with the thousand-mile permanent spatial rift above his head slowly emanating spatial undulations.</p><p></p><p>At this moment -</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan abruptly looked up towards the permanent spatial rift above his head.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, he sensed some unknown change occurring within this permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yuan's gaze,</p><p></p><p>A 'white paper' squeezed its way in.</p><p></p><p>The 'white paper' only had length and width, no concept of 'thickness', giving an extremely contradictory feeling.</p><p></p><p>"White paper?" Lin Yuan stared fixedly at the white paper, vaguely feeling it made his hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Rustle rustle.</p><p></p><p>After squeezing into the universe, the white paper instantly pierced through the entire large battlefield in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>However, the large battlefield did not shatter, but rather experienced some kind of dimensional collapse, losing its spatial volume concept. In just an instant, the large alien battlefield spanning nearly a thousand light-years was compressed into a scroll painting, then absorbed into the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>The white paper continued flying into the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere it passed, all matter was compressed, even space itself was encompassed, forming scroll after scroll of paintings that merged into the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>A towering figure staggered back a few steps, staring at the rapidly departing 'white paper' in utter disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He was a twelfth level ultimate, who had just carelessly been swept into the 'white paper'. But as an existence that had jumped out of the river of time, the 'white paper's' dimensional compression ability could not fully suppress him, allowing him to break free.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>He had escaped.</p><p></p><p>On Battlefield No. A098, countless lifeforms, including those eleventh level experts, had fallen into the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>Even space itself rapidly collapsed, as if a portion had been randomly cut out.</p><p></p><p>"The Taiyuan Ruins, that direction is towards the Taiyuan Ruins."</p><p></p><p>One paramount expert after another appeared, staring grimly at the departing 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>"What change has occurred at the Taiyuan Ruins?" The Unicorn Paramount Expert's expression was solemn. Five or six decades ago, that extraterrestrial aurora had also come from the Taiyuan Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Now this bizarre 'white paper' had similarly come from the direction of the Taiyuan Ruins.</p><p></p><p>This made them have to speculate whether some unforeseeable change had occurred at the Taiyuan Ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't worry about the Taiyuan Ruins for now."</p><p></p><p>"If we let that 'white paper' continue flying, one-thousandth of our universe will be completely compressed into a lower dimension."</p><p></p><p>One paramount expert spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Although the 'white paper's' dimensional compression was ineffective against paramount experts, their tribes and the countless lifeforms within were still in the compression range.</p><p></p><p>"Let's join forces."</p><p></p><p>"We paramount experts will join forces to pin down that 'white paper'."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we can't let it continue flying around randomly."</p><p></p><p>The paramount experts immediately decided, quickly taking action and using their space-time powers to slowly restrict the 'white paper's' movement.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the 'white paper's' flight speed slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Eventually stopping in a certain region of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The 'white paper' slowly unfurled, revealing a scroll painting emanating a mysterious aura before the paramount experts.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

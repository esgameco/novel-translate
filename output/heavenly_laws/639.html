        <h1>Chapter 639</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable's expression was solemn. As an observer, although he did not directly face the power of Lin Yuan's Sword of Spacetime, he could still sense it to some degree.</p><p></p><p>Just a single strike of the Sword of Spacetime had already inflicted some injuries on the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable. Now that 333 Swords of Spacetime were unleashed simultaneously, the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable would need to resort to his true techniques to block them.</p><p></p><p>"The Silvery River Heavenly Venerable is also not weak in his comprehension of the Dao rules."</p><p></p><p>Hengyang Heavenly Venerable reached this conclusion. The comprehension of the Nine Layers of Spacetime Realm was considered ordinary among the Pinnacle Heavenly Venerables, but among the imperial clan who only knew how to excavate their bloodlines, it was already extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially the strongest level under the comprehension of the Chaotic Evolutionary Power rules.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good, good, good!" </p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom's face broke into a smile when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he was worried about how Lin Yuan could withstand the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable for even a hundred breaths.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable's techniques were focused on swift battles and decisive victories. The Crimson Lotus Hellfire disregarded defenses, and ordinary Heavenly Venerables would find it difficult to endure under such raging flames for a hundred breaths.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The situation had evolved beyond the question of whether Lin Yuan could withstand for a hundred breaths, but rather, which of these two Heavenly Venerables would emerge victorious in the end.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson Lotuses Filling the Skies!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the 333 Swords of Spacetime, the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable was on high alert. His physical body dispersed once again, transforming into numerous Crimson Lotus Hellfires that drifted in the spacetime.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!!! The 333 Swords of Spacetime slashed through, causing large swaths of spacetime to shatter. The drifting Crimson Lotus Hellfires were also affected, but relying on their own Void attributes, they managed to barely withstand the 333 Swords of Spacetime.</p><p></p><p>After the 333 Swords of Spacetime passed, the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable's form coalesced once again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately prepared to strike again.</p><p></p><p>"Silvery River Heavenly Venerable, there's no need to continue fighting," the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable said immediately.</p><p></p><p>With the strength Lin Yuan had just displayed, it was only natural for him to be able to withstand for a hundred breaths.</p><p></p><p>And based on the current level of their exchange, if they continued to fight, the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable would have to resort to his true lethal techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, those techniques were meant for dealing with enemies, and the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable naturally did not wish to use them against his own Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Chiyuan, what do you think?" the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable looked towards the distant Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Having Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable assess Lin Yuan's strength was Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable's original intention.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there's no need to continue fighting," Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable nodded. The reason he had the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable take action was to increase the chances of securing that first-grade Blessed Land in the upcoming competition.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan's strength reached the Pinnacle Heavenly Venerable threshold and did not drag them down, Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable would turn a blind eye.</p><p></p><p>And now, the strength Lin Yuan had displayed was not just avoiding being a drag, but a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Although Chiyuan Heavenly Venerable also desired that first-grade Blessed Land, he hoped more that it would be occupied by the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom, and everything he had done was based on the interests of the Scorching Sun Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded and retracted his divine ability 'World'. </p><p></p><p>This technique had fused and devoured the Scorching Yang Source, so when he unleashed it, the Scorching Yang aura was extremely dense. Even if he said he had not excavated his Ancestor's Bloodline to the Heavenly Venerable level, no one would believe him.</p><p></p><p>"The Silvery River Heavenly Venerable's strength?"</p><p></p><p>"It's too terrifying, it seems to be no weaker than the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Ancestor's Bloodline at the Heavenly Venerable level? Unprecedented?"</p><p></p><p>"Even for an Ancestor's Bloodline at the Heavenly Venerable level, it still requires a vast amount of time to excavate. How long has the Silvery River Heavenly Venerable's bloodline been refined to the Heavenly Venerable level?"</p><p></p><p>"Monstrous, truly monstrous."</p><p></p><p>The other ancient Heavenly Venerables observing were filled with shock. They could also feel the terrifying power of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Heavenly Venerables had been quite dissatisfied with the Emperor's decision, thinking that forcibly inserting the Silvery River Heavenly Venerable into the Heavenly Venerable roster was the Emperor simply using 'backdoor' methods.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan did not have a core imperial clan identity, he could completely compete for one of the twelve Heavenly Venerable positions based solely on his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's intervention to place Lin Yuan on the Heavenly Venerable list was simply the icing on the cake.</p><p></p><p>"Silvery River Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Among the many Heavenly Venerables, the Scorching Sun Heavenly Venerable was astonished as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had previously had some interactions with Lin Yuan when the latter took over as the guardian of the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the Scorching Sun Heavenly Venerable did not give Lin Yuan any trouble, but instead decisively stepped aside, unwilling to offend this core imperial clan member.</p><p></p><p>In the Scorching Sun Heavenly Venerable's view, Lin Yuan's future potential was immense.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for him to risk offending Lin Yuan over such a small matter as the Black Jade Nest.</p><p></p><p>Now, looking at it...</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Heavenly Venerable was extremely grateful for his decision back then.</p><p></p><p>It had been such a short time, yet the Silvery River Heavenly Venerable had already attained such strength?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan and the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable flew towards the gathered Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Silvery River Heavenly Venerable," the Crimson Lotus Heavenly Venerable looked at Lin Yuan and sincerely admired him, "I have always believed that the Dao rules are the foundation, but now I see that the pinnacle of bloodline power is no less than the power of the Dao rules."</p><p></p><p>Throughout their exchange, the other party, Lin Yuan, had not even utilized his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The profound insights into the rules of the Great Dao were the opposite of what the Crimson Lotus Venerable had attained - the power of the evolution of chaos. The Crimson Lotus Dharma Fire burned through Lin Yuan's physical body, flesh, and soul.</p><p></p><p>"To reach the Ancestor realm, one still has to rely on the rules of the Great Dao," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Although the Scorching Sun bloodline was a Thirteenth-Tier bloodline, it was impossible to reach the Thirteenth Tier through this bloodline alone.</p><p></p><p>To break into the Thirteenth Tier, one could only forcefully explore the path of the evolution of one's own chaotic power and break through the limitations of the time cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the Ancestor realm is no easy feat," the Crimson Lotus Venerable shook his head. In the long history of the Source World, there were only six true Ancestors who had established their own ancient nations.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Silver Galaxy Venerable, don't be so modest," the Scarlet Flame Venerable chimed in. "With your strength, it's only a matter of time before you surpass us."</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the subsequent potential of the Ancestor bloodline, just based on Lin Yuan's current strength, as long as he comprehended even the first level of a chaotic evolution rule, his strength would be on par with the Scarlet Flame Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And given Lin Yuan's understanding of time and space, comprehending the path of chaotic evolution power was not an outrageous idea.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened obediently. His current strength was roughly on par with the Crimson Lotus Venerable, and if he went all-out, he wouldn't be confident of winning.</p><p></p><p>As for comparing himself to the Scarlet Flame Venerable? He was clearly inferior.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Flame Venerable's strength was approaching the level of an invincible Sage, even in the chaotic void, surpassing the Heavenly Profound Venerable and the Jade Dragon Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"But the fight for the First-Grade Treasure Land is right before us. When you clash with the other Venerables of the ancient nations, it won't be as easy as it is now," the Scarlet Flame Venerable said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He grasped the Scarlet Flame Venerable's implication.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's sparring with the Crimson Lotus Venerable ended quickly, and neither side suffered any significant damage, as they had not used their true offensive methods.</p><p></p><p>If it came to an all-out battle with the enemy Venerables to seize the First-Grade Treasure Land, those supreme Venerables might even risk their main combat bodies.</p><p></p><p>That level of conflict would be far more intense than the casual sparring just now.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Silver Galaxy, you can go back and rest now. We'll head to that Treasure Land in ten years," the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation Emperor said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lin Yuan nodded and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"The future of my Scorching Sun Ancient Nation," the Scarlet Flame Venerable looked at the place where Lin Yuan had vanished, anticipation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, compared to the ownership of the First-Grade Treasure Land, he was more curious about how far Lin Yuan's future would go.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver Galaxy Manor, Lin Yuan returned and continued his cultivation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The sparring with the Crimson Lotus Venerable had made him clearly aware of his strength level - he was at the level of an experienced Pinnacle Venerable, but not as strong as the top Pinnacle Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"The First-Grade Treasure Land." Lin Yuan yearned for it deeply. The fight for the Treasure Land was not only for its benefits, but also to repay the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan had received many benefits from this ancient nation over the years he had been here, so naturally, he wanted to give back.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength is only enough to not be a burden in the fight for the Treasure Land, but it's still too weak," Lin Yuan thought to himself, and then divided his mental focus to comprehend the inheritance of "Scorching Sun, Mysterious Yin, and Chaos."</p><p></p><p>His incarnation traveled between the various domains of the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, comprehending the essence blood of many Mysterious Yin Venerable Ones and experiencing the Mysterious Yin Dao within.</p><p></p><p>As for the true body of Lin Yuan in the manor, it began to comprehend the "Scorching Sun Chapter" of the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's body already contained the Scorching Sun bloodline, and with his current location at the heart of the greatest Scorching Sun vein in the Scorching Sun Ancient Nation, the Scorching Sun Dao permeated the area, making it easy for him to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>【Your transcendent aptitude has enhanced your comprehension of the Scorching Sun Dao.】</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's spiritual consciousness was elevated to a higher realm, and he found himself in a world filled with endless Scorching Sun flames.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the place?" Lin Yuan looked around, familiar with this location. Once he had gathered enough Scorching Sun seeds, he would be able to freely enter this mysterious Scorching Sun world.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" </p><p></p><p>Just by observing the surroundings, Lin Yuan sensed something was off.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his previous visits to this flame world, the location where he had appeared this time was different.</p><p></p><p>"It's much higher up," Lin Yuan concluded after careful observation.</p><p></p><p>"The Scorching Sun Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the towering figure standing with hands behind his back at the highest point of the world. Due to the elevated position, the majestic figure was much clearer, and Lin Yuan could sense many subtle auras.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Lin Yuan gained significant benefits and promptly withdrew, as one could not stay in that flame world for too long, or risk being assimilated.</p><p></p><p>The moment his spiritual consciousness returned to his physical body, Lin Yuan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, there was a vast and boundless expanse, with countless miniature Scorching Sun seeds floating, a total of 33,332 of them.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, the 33,333rd Scorching Sun seed rapidly formed and materialized.</p><p></p><p>The instant this Scorching Sun seed appeared, it joined the previous 33,332 seeds, forming a complete Scorching Sun great cycle.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!

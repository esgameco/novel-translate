        <h1>Chapter 482</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 482 Immortal Realm Consciousness (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Immortal Realm is located in the deepest part of the Immortal Realm, where the laws and the Dao are manifested as tangible entities.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the laws here is much easier than outside.</p><p></p><p>It's like an "open-book exam".</p><p></p><p>Ever since Lin Yuan visited the Ancestor of the Abyss of Demons, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals has been waiting for Lin Yuan to come.</p><p></p><p>For the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals, since he poses no threat to Lin Yuan whatsoever, he will definitely focus on befriending him.</p><p></p><p>Having one more Dao companion is much better than having one more enemy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals planned to thoroughly introduce the many wondrous uses of the origin place to Lin Yuan after his arrival.</p><p></p><p>This is the purpose for which the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals has been waiting for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals did not expect that Lin Yuan would enter a state of "sudden enlightenment" even before entering the origin place of the Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the higher the realm, the more difficult it is to achieve sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>When the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals crossed into the Twelfth Realm in the past, he entered the origin place of the Immortal Realm and cultivated for tens of billions of years, finally barely managing to attain a moment of "sudden enlightenment" with the help of the environment of the origin place.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' innate talent and aptitude is undoubtedly the strongest since the birth of the Immortal Realm. He single-handedly established the cultivation system of the Dao of Immortals, and finally crossed into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, it was the Immortal Realm that constrained the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals. If he were in the main universe, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' upper limit would probably be even higher.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the environment outside the origin place is more conducive to 'sudden enlightenment'?" A preposterous idea flashed through the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' mind.</p><p></p><p>But it was immediately discarded. The cultivation environment outside the origin place is definitely not as good as the one inside.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Lin Yuan could enter a state of "sudden enlightenment" even before entering the origin place only shows that this Ancestor of the Dao had accumulated too much.</p><p></p><p>Far exceeding the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' own accumulation after cultivating in the origin place for tens of billions of years, so he could attain a state of sudden enlightenment just by being slightly stimulated by the origin place.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals nodded slightly, his figure appearing outside the origin place, gazing at Lin Yuan from afar, intending to guard him during his period of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals did not take advantage of Lin Yuan's sudden enlightenment to do anything. Firstly, this is a state of sudden enlightenment, not slumber.</p><p></p><p>If any danger were to arise, Lin Yuan would instinctively emerge from the state of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Lin Yuan the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals saw was just a manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Even with this manifestation in a state of sudden enlightenment, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals could not lock onto Lin Yuan's exact spatial coordinates at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Half a year went by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes, his spirit shining.</p><p></p><p>This sudden enlightenment greatly benefited Lin Yuan, allowing him to comprehend hundreds of pillar-level fusion rules and elevate them all to the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>The addition of hundreds of pillar-level fusion rules at the Seventh Realm has improved Lin Yuan's strength, but it is not a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>However, through these hundreds of pillar-level fusion rules at the Seventh Realm, Lin Yuan has now seen the direction of the Chaotic Rules.</p><p></p><p>This is crucial for Lin Yuan, no matter which evolutionary path or rule comprehension, the direction is important. As long as the direction is right and he persists, there will eventually be a day of success.</p><p></p><p>But if the direction is wrong, or if he doesn't know the direction, then it will be difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a light sigh. At this moment, in his inner world, the power of the many fusion rules is intertwined and entangled, returning to the origin and vaguely forming the embryonic form of an "egg".</p><p></p><p>"Continuing to comprehend more fusion rules, there is hope to nurture the true Chaotic Rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, and it was only now that he realized the brief explanations about the Chaotic Rules left behind by Emperor Xuan and the Master of the Demon Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Now that the foundation is laid, the Chaotic Rules will naturally be grasped.</p><p></p><p>Because—</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Rules are not attained through enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But are nurtured.</p><p></p><p>And the prerequisite for nurturing is the comprehension of myriad rules.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals." Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the distant figure of the thin, elderly man in a Dao robe.</p><p></p><p>During the period of sudden enlightenment, Lin Yuan had been aware of the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' aura.</p><p></p><p>If the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals dared to make any threatening moves during Lin Yuan's sudden enlightenment, Lin Yuan's worst plan was to simply disperse this manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Dispersing the manifestation does not mean the sudden enlightenment would be interrupted.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals did not make any moves, and even to put Lin Yuan at ease, he did not even approach.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals saw that Lin Yuan's sudden enlightenment had ended, and immediately stepped forward, appearing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"I originally thought that you would only experience a moment of sudden enlightenment after cultivating in the origin place for a very long time, but I didn't expect you to attain it even before entering."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals sighed with some amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky." Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Lucky?" The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>At their level, there is no such thing as "luck" when it comes to sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation in normal times is quantitative change, while sudden enlightenment is qualitative change, but without the previous quantitative change, there would be no talk of qualitative change and sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"As the Ancestor of the Dao, when do you plan to assault the Ancestral Realm?" The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals looked at Lin Yuan and asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>He could see that Lin Yuan was still at the Jade Immortal Realm, and even though Lin Yuan's fundamental nature was incredibly strong to an unimaginable degree, he was still a Jade Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals had never witnessed such a powerful Jade Immortal, since he is a Jade Immortal, he must consider assaulting the Ancestral Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Realm, also known as the Dao Ancestral Realm or the Ancestral Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to accumulate for a while longer." Lin Yuan replied.</p><p></p><p>Even if he planned to make the ultimate leap, he would definitely choose to do so in the main universe, because he would once again undergo the baptism of the Chaotic Void Origin.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Realm does not have that.</p><p></p><p>As a Twelfth Realm ultimate being, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals' realm and strength are weaker than the Twelfth Realm ultimate beings in the main universe, not only because he lacks opponents at the same level, but also because he has never undergone the baptism of the Chaotic Void Origin when crossing into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Different worlds may have different rules, let alone the Immortal Realm and the main universe being in different dimensions.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals had never undergone the baptism of the Chaotic Void Origin, causing him to spend tens of billions of years stabilizing at the Parting the Dao Realm after crossing into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I see, assaulting the Ancestral Realm is extremely perilous. I almost perished when I did it back then." The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>No matter which world or dimension, assaulting the Twelfth Realm requires breaking free from the constraints of the river of time, which requires confronting the river of time, and naturally, one must endure the backlash from the river of time.</p><p></p><p>"But with your foundation, Ancestor of the Dao, you shouldn't have any problems, right?" The Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals faced the backlash from the river of time when he assaulted the Ancestral Realm, it was like a lone boat in the vast ocean.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals also knew that in such a situation, the test was the mastery of time and space.</p><p></p><p>The higher the mastery of time and space, the longer one can sustain the assault on the river of time, and the more time and opportunities there are to take that final step.</p><p></p><p>And in terms of mastery of time and space, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals is not as good as Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals believed that Lin Yuan should have no problem taking that step.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let me introduce the origin place to you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao led Lin Yuan into the origin place of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This place was a boundless space, with a vast amount of the purest origin power surging. Lin Yuan could clearly see that many origin powers converged to form various stones.</p><p></p><p>These were the "immortal origins" that were worthless in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan now realized how much the environment recreated by the immortal origins differed from the true origin place of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few centuries, Lin Yuan had obtained many immortal origins through transactions, but just by approaching the origin place of the Immortal Realm, the fluctuations of the many rules had brought him a shock far beyond what the "environment" recreated by the immortal origins could.</p><p></p><p>"It's so wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around the origin place, and wherever his gaze fell, the various rules were manifesting in reality.</p><p></p><p>These rules not only manifested, but also constantly intertwined and interweaved, which would greatly benefit any strong cultivator who could comprehend the rules.</p><p></p><p>The rules were not dead, but alive. Comprehending a single rule would certainly be inferior to comprehending multiple rules simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The collision between the comprehension of multiple rules would bring about an enhancement far exceeding that of a single rule.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Lin Yuan's mind was once again immersed in a flood of enlightenment, but with the previous enlightenment adaptation outside the origin place, he did not immediately fall into a state of enlightenment this time.</p><p></p><p>"The origin place is vast and boundless, and that will be the residence for me and my disciples," the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao said, slightly raising his hand and pointing in a direction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed his gaze, and a large continent was quietly floating there. This continent was clearly opened up by the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, otherwise there should not be such a conspicuous "creation" within the origin place.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Ancestor, you can freely choose a place to cultivate and comprehend, or you can open up a continent like me and bring your disciples here to comprehend together."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Also, in the origin place, most areas are accessible to the Martial Dao Ancestor, but there is one place that requires caution, and that is the location of the Immortal Realm's consciousness."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Immortal Dao looked at Lin Yuan and waved his hand, revealing a vast map of the origin place. Nearly 90% of the area was empty, with only the central position marked in red.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm's consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had long known that the world had a consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Including the vast Macrocosm, it also had a consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, the world's consciousness was different from human consciousness, as it only had instincts and no specific emotions.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the world's consciousness would not manifest, only silently maintaining the operation of the world.</p><p></p><p>But if something that could harm the world were to occur, the world's consciousness would intervene.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the Macrocosm, if those Twelfth-Tier Ultimates dared to leave the Macrocosm, they would face the backlash of the entire universe, the source of which was naturally the Macrocosm's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth-Tier Ultimates did not know how much energy they had consumed and absorbed from the Macrocosm. Once they left, it would be like cutting off a large piece of flesh for the Macrocosm, which naturally would not allow it.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the only opportunity for the Twelfth-Tier Ultimates to leave would be when the Macrocosm collapsed and disintegrated, and the consciousness also fell into slumber at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm's consciousness is very wary of us. If we get too close, it is highly likely that the entire power of the Immortal Realm will come to suppress us," the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>As a Twelfth-Tier existence, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was already equivalent to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But equivalence did not mean being on par. Facing the power of the entire Immortal Realm, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao was still unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the Immortal Realm's consciousness to suppress a Twelfth-Tier consciousness for a long time was also not realistic, as it would consume a huge amount of energy, and might even cause the Immortal Realm to enter its final collapse prematurely.</p><p></p><p>So the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Immortal Realm's consciousness had reached an implicit balance: I won't provoke you, and you won't provoke me.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao, Lin Yuan had a deeper understanding of the world's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll be going back now."</p><p></p><p>"If you have any other questions, you can contact me anytime, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao's figure disappeared, and Lin Yuan clearly felt his aura appear on the continent he had opened up.</p><p></p><p>"I'll start comprehending as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan no longer paid attention to the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and immediately focused all his mind and spirit on the manifesting Dao rules throughout the origin place.</p><p></p><p>【Your comprehension talent is extraordinary. By observing the essence of numerous rules manifesting, your comprehension of myriad rules has greatly improved.】</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan leisurely floated around the various parts of the origin place.</p><p></p><p>In these two hundred years, Lin Yuan had comprehended countless pillar-level integrated rules.</p><p></p><p>The "egg" gradually taking shape in his inner world had also become increasingly distinct, with various rule auras emanating and permeating, giving Lin Yuan's inner world a flavor of the origin place.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the area where the Immortal Realm's consciousness resides, the rule fluctuations there are even more pronounced, no, they are no longer just rule fluctuations, but the rules themselves."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked towards the central position of the origin place.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not difficult to reach this conclusion. Why did the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao know that approaching the Immortal Realm's consciousness would risk suppression?</p><p></p><p>It was because the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had also discovered that the place where the Immortal Realm's consciousness resided was the source of all the rules of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The so-called rule manifestation fluctuations in the origin place all originated from there.</p><p></p><p>If one could enter that place to comprehend the rules, the benefits to oneself would far exceed what could be gained by simply being in the origin place.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have found the direction to cultivate the Chaos Rule, there is still a long way to go before I can finally nurture the Chaos Rule. If I could directly face the essence of all the rules of the Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and decided to try approaching the location of the Immortal Realm's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Since the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao had previously approached or even contacted it and was still fine, there was no reason why Lin Yuan would run into any trouble.</p><p></p><p>In terms of survival ability, Lin Yuan was even superior to the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Lin Yuan here was just a manifestation, so even if he was suppressed by the Immortal Realm's consciousness, it would not have any real impact. At worst, he could just send out another manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Lin Yuan approached the vicinity of the Immortal Realm's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!!</p><p></p><p>Just by getting close, a terrifying consciousness pressure was transmitted, causing the entire origin place to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"The reaction is so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised, but quickly understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>The location of the Immortal Realm's consciousness in the origin place was equivalent to the core of Lin Yuan's spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>It was the most fundamental existence, and when an external force, especially a powerful one, approached it, it would naturally trigger the highest alert of the Immortal Realm's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan ignored the warning of the Immortal Realm's consciousness and continued to approach.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Immortal Realm's consciousness mobilized the power of the entire origin place, surging towards Lin Yuan in a mighty onslaught.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

            <p>Chapter 233 Far-reaching Influence (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Just say what you have to say." </p><p></p><p>Seeing the black-haired elder hesitating and stammering, the Holy Son of Wan Yang did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>Now he saw hope in catching up to the 13th Peak Master. Comprehending the body of an ultimate expert would definitely allow him to gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>Then, by leveraging the foundation of his Nine Yang Divine Veins, entering the 7th stage within a hundred years was not a joke.</p><p></p><p>As for the 8th stage after the 7th stage, the Holy Son of Wan Yang had not considered it yet. The 8th stage was still too far for him.</p><p></p><p>Mental will index, inner world, physical body and soul perfection, none of the conditions were met.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Holy Son of Wan Yang's focus was entirely on the 7th stage. As long as he could enter the 7th stage, he would have narrowed the gap with the 13th Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, now there is no bad news that can shake my state of mind."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the black-haired elder still hesitating, the Holy Son of Wan Yang said calmly. </p><p></p><p>After having hope, the Holy Son of Wan Yang felt that his mental will had also improved.</p><p></p><p>The so-called living through long years and tempering one's mental will was essentially about experiencing great ups and downs.</p><p></p><p>The same goes for life and death crises.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the 13th Peak Master had entered the 7th stage, the Holy Son of Wan Yang was once in despair, even risking his life to come to the interior of a star to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>This was the "down".</p><p></p><p>And now, learning that there was the body of an ultimate expert to comprehend from.</p><p></p><p>Having the prospect of catching up to the 13th Peak Master in the future, this was the "up".</p><p></p><p>Great ups and downs, great downs and ups. </p><p></p><p>Nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"It's bad news related to the 13th Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder said tentatively. He was clear about how much the Holy Son of Wan Yang desired to catch up to the 13th Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>But the news he just learned was a bit too cruel for the Holy Son of Wan Yang.</p><p></p><p>"13th Peak Master?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Bad news related to the 13th Peak Master?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the other party had already entered the peak of the 7th stage general level?</p><p></p><p>This was indeed not good news.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, going from just entering the 7th stage general level initial phase to the peak phase, he was indeed the 13th Peak Master he wanted to chase.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in a hundred years, wouldn't the 13th Peak Master have the prospect of entering the 7th stage marquis level?</p><p></p><p>By then, even if everything went smoothly for him, he would only be just entering the 7th stage, and the gap with the 13th Peak Master would still be very large.</p><p></p><p>"I got news that the 13th Peak Master, he seems to have entered the 8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder mustered up courage and spoke out the news he just received.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't say it, as long as the Holy Son of Wan Yang connected his consciousness to the virtual network, he would still find out.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say about the 13th Peak Master entering the 8th stage? Entering which stage?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang was still pondering how to quickly advance towards the 7th stage marquis level after entering the 7th stage in a hundred years. Hearing the black-haired elder's words, he almost thought he was hallucinating.</p><p></p><p>8th stage?</p><p></p><p>The 13th Peak Master entered the 8th stage?</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang's mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the black-haired elder repeated it several times that the Holy Son of Wan Yang managed to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this news come from?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang's first reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>From the 7th stage to the 8th stage was a major bottleneck and shackle.</p><p></p><p>If before his seclusion, the 13th Peak Master was already at the peak of 7th stage king level,</p><p></p><p>then breaking through to the 8th stage now would still be considered normal.</p><p></p><p>But the 13th Peak Master had clearly just entered the 7th stage not long ago.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, consecutively passing the three major thresholds of mental will, inner world, and physical body and soul perfection?</p><p></p><p>Is this still human?</p><p></p><p>Is this still human?!</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, this news came from the Red Kun main star. On the central continent of the main star, there were fluctuations of aura from someone breaking through from 7th stage to 8th stage, and only the 13th Peak Master meets the conditions for breaking through from 7th stage to 8th stage."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case,"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a mistaken rumor?"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to believe that the 13th Peak Master had already entered the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Still chasing the 13th Peak Master?</p><p></p><p>With what?</p><p></p><p>"There is indeed a possibility of mistaken rumors."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder thought for a moment and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, if the 13th Peak Master really broke through to the 8th stage, the Red Kun lineage will quickly release an announcement. By then, everything will be clear."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder said.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's wait."</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of Wan Yang was silent for a while before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait."</p><p></p><p>The black-haired elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>Red Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>13th Mountain Peak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his aura was extremely profound, like a celestial body, starting to influence the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>8th stage evolved beings, after the ultimate metamorphosis of their physical body and soul, coupled with the opening of their inner world, if they didn't restrain their aura, were indeed no different from those cosmic celestial bodies.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the 8th stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the brand new power within his body.</p><p></p><p>Although at the 7th stage, relying on his vast inner world, Lin Yuan could crush most 8th stage experts in terms of power.</p><p></p><p>But that was only crushing in terms of power. The profoundness of the realm was something Lin Yuan only experienced now.</p><p></p><p>The biggest trump card of 8th stage evolved beings was their inner world, but that didn't mean 8th stage evolved beings only had inner world techniques.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the 8th stage is mainly divided into four phases. The first phase is the initial phase, the second phase is the middle phase, the third phase is the late phase, and the fourth phase is the ultimate phase."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was very clear about the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was a fifth phase to the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, 8th stage invincibles were still in the fourth phase.</p><p></p><p>The 8th stage invincible evolved beings, such as the Red Kun Star Lord, Golden Dragon Star Lord, Wan Yang Star Lord and so on, had mastered a power that transcended the 8th stage.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this power, the 8th stage invincibles could crush all 8th stage evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also subtle differences in strength among the 8th stage invincibles, but in a one-on-one fight, one party basically couldn't defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why such powerhouses were called 8th stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>Unless a 9th stage expert took action, the 8th stage invincibles would be in an undefeatable position.</p><p></p><p>Even facing a group of 8th stage invincibles besieging them, they could easily escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, as an 8th stage invincible, the power he mastered that transcends the 8th stage should be related to the Star Sea Roaming Kun."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Each 8th stage invincible was unique and couldn't possibly master exactly the same power.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed his own changes for a bit, then got up and walked out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Outside the hall, the Red Kun Star Lord and the Great Peak Master had been waiting for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Red Kun Star Lord was the first to know about the commotion when Lin Yuan broke through, followed by the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"My good disciple, you've entered the 8th stage just like that?" The Red Kun Star Lord carefully looked at Lin Yuan and shook his head slightly, saying, "When your master entered the 8th stage back then, how many years did it take? Eight thousand years? Or ten thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>The Star Sea Roaming Kun, as a special lifeform with a supreme bloodline, was born with an inner world, so it was much easier for the Red Kun Star Lord to enter the 8th stage compared to human evolved beings.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've been at the seventh stage for nearly a hundred thousand years. Compared to Junior Brother, I feel like all these years have gone to waste," said the Great Peak Master, feeling slightly aggrieved. </p><p></p><p>Although he had long been clear that comparing himself to a prodigy like his junior brother was simply asking for trouble, seeing how easily his junior brother had entered the eighth stage, the senior brother couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, despite saying this, the Great Peak Master still felt fortunate that he had entered the eighth stage first. Otherwise, wouldn't he have been surpassed by his junior brother?</p><p></p><p>"Master, Senior Brother," Lin Yuan looked at the Chikunxing Master and the Great Peak Master, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, how do you feel now?" asked the Great Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't the two of us collide with the power of the world? This will help you become more familiar with the power at the eighth stage," the senior brother said eagerly. </p><p></p><p>When he had just entered the eighth stage, the Chikunxing Master had used the power of the world within his body to leave an extremely "deep" impression on him. Although it indeed helped greatly in mastering his own world power, the experience was exceptionally unforgettable.</p><p></p><p>"Colliding with the power of the world?"</p><p></p><p>The Chikunxing Master glanced at the Great Peak Master without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, when he was at the peak of the sixth stage, about to break through to the seventh stage, he had already opened up the world within his body. But he had never crossed hands with other eighth stage evolutionists.</p><p></p><p>Now that his senior brother had taken the initiative to be his sparring partner, Lin Yuan naturally wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you need to be careful. Although I also just entered the eighth stage not long ago, I'm still more familiar with it than you for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>The senior brother reminded, understanding that this might be the last chance for him to be on par with his junior brother. After some time, with his junior brother's talent and aptitude, he would definitely leave him far behind.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master's mind moved slightly, and an intangible world power enveloped the area. The terrifying world power, even if suppressed and restrained, could easily crush sixth and seventh stage evolutionists.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master activated his world power, covering Lin Yuan, but he felt as if he was covering a black hole.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>A power far exceeding the limit of the Great Peak Master's world power spread out in all directions with Lin Yuan at the center.</p><p></p><p>"I?" The Great Peak Master's face changed. He sensed that this power was boundless, and his own world power simply crumbled.</p><p></p><p>The two were not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>"Stop, stop, stop," the Great Peak Master hurriedly called out.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of world power?" The Great Peak Master found it hard to believe. He recognized that the power that crushed his world power was also world power, but it was much stronger than his.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, just how vast is your inner world?"</p><p></p><p>The senior brother swallowed. The strength of the world power depended on the foundation of one's inner world. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's world power was far stronger than his, which could only mean that his own inner world was far inferior to the other party's.</p><p></p><p>But didn't Lin Yuan just break through?</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master was a bit confused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He could only attribute it to his junior brother being extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, your junior brother has already held back with all his might," the Chikunxing Master said, shaking his head on the side.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the eighth stage, Lin Yuan's inner world had already exceeded a hundred thousand li in size. Now, Lin Yuan's inner world was at least over two hundred thousand li.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan didn't hold back when sparring with the Great Peak Master, whose inner world was less than two hundred li, the latter would probably be suppressed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Held back with all his might?"</p><p></p><p>"There's holding back and going all out?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Master muttered in his heart, but knowing that his master wouldn't lie to him, his junior brother, even though he had just entered the eighth stage, was already far superior to him in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, my good disciple, for now, familiarize yourself with the eighth stage realm. We'll talk about other things later," the Chikunxing Master instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Also, I will have someone announce the matter of your breakthrough to the eighth stage," the Chikunxing Master said.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because those old friends kept sending messages to confirm with him whether it was really the Thirteenth Peak Master who had entered the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The news of Lin Yuan entering the eighth stage was quickly confirmed through an announcement released by the Chikunxing Lineage.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because there was no need to conceal it. As one of the most powerful apex races, human civilization had the trump card of "resurrection".</p><p></p><p>When breaking through from the fifth stage to the sixth stage, one's life essence was not strong enough, so one had to conceal their identity. After all, no matter how much of a genius a fifth stage evolutionist was, they couldn't meet the conditions for resurrection.</p><p></p><p>If they died, they would really be dead.</p><p></p><p>But at the eighth stage, let alone how much it would cost for foreign races to assassinate an eighth stage, most of the eighth stage human evolutionists had the "Avatar Technique".</p><p></p><p>For a supreme being, resurrecting an eighth stage wasn't a huge expense. Of course, at the level of supreme beings, even the smallest expense would be considered a huge cost in the eyes of lower stage evolutionists.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of those powerful races had to be cautious. Their races didn't have supreme beings to protect them. If they wanted to be resurrected, they could only seek the apex races.</p><p></p><p>But whether the supreme beings of the apex races were willing to help resurrect them was another matter.</p><p></p><p>"The Chikunxing Lineage has issued an announcement. The one who broke through to the eighth stage is indeed the Thirteenth Peak Master."</p><p></p><p>"My god, how old is the Thirteenth Peak Master to already be at the eighth stage?"</p><p></p><p>"When I was the Thirteenth Peak Master's age, I was still playing around at the first and second stages."</p><p></p><p>Every Star Alliance was shaken. Originally, some people still thought there might have been some mistake, because without the Chikunxing Lineage's announcement, the one who broke through to the eighth stage might not necessarily be the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was basically confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Wanyang Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son closely followed the movements of the Chikunxing Lineage.</p><p></p><p>Almost the instant the announcement was released, he already knew.</p><p></p><p>"It's really the Thirteenth Peak Master who entered the eighth stage?" The Wanyang Holy Son thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Actually, during this waiting period, he had already mostly accepted it in his heart. Until he saw the announcement, he felt relieved instead.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, are you alright?" The black-haired elder beside him asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>Even for him, upon learning that the Thirteenth Peak Master had entered the eighth stage, he was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the Wanyang Holy Son who regarded the Thirteenth Peak Master as his goal?</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you don't need to chase after the Thirteenth Peak Master. Sometimes those prodigies defy common sense." The black-haired elder tried his best to comfort his young master.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," the Wanyang Holy Son sighed.</p><p></p><p>If the Thirteenth Peak Master was still at the seventh stage now, even if he was a seventh stage king.</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son would still feel immense pressure. It's just that the Thirteenth Peak Master had entered the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>The Wanyang Holy Son suddenly felt the pressure on his shoulders vanish, because from now on, he had no meaning in chasing the Thirteenth Peak Master.</p><p></p><p>Because he couldn't catch up.</p><p></p><p>Chikunxing Master Star.</p><p></p><p>First Peak.</p><p></p><p>The new member Feng Yu looked at the announcement from the Chikunxing Lineage in front of him and fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p><p></p><p>[Please kindly move your fingers and share this website on Facebook, so that we can continue operating]</p>

            <p>Chapter 227: The Reopened Seven Star Cave World (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"An ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower?"</p><p></p><p>"Magic Jade Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked in his heart. He had inexplicably joined the Magic Jade Tower?</p><p></p><p>Having comprehended the 3,333 paths of evolution, Lin Yuan felt it was incredible. He had only comprehended them and hadn't actually cultivated them. How did the other party know he had accomplished this?</p><p></p><p>"Magic Jade Tower"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts surged. At the level he was at now, he would at least have heard of any slightly notable races or forces in the main world, even if he didn't fully understand them. However, before today, he had never heard of the three words "Magic Jade Tower".</p><p></p><p>"Is it a force related to the owner of this body? From outside the main world?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for becoming an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower was to comprehend the 3,333 paths of evolution within that body. It was easy to associate that body with the "Magic Jade Tower".</p><p></p><p>"This kind of means..." Lin Yuan marveled in his heart. Originally, he thought that the greatest opportunity from this corpse, which was worth several top powerhouses fighting over, was that supreme path of evolution.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed that becoming a member of the Magic Jade Tower was the ultimate benefit.</p><p></p><p>"Magic Jade Tower? Why is it named after magic?" </p><p></p><p>The clear whispers Lin Yuan heard were not in any language he knew, yet he could inexplicably understand their meaning.</p><p></p><p>And the name Magic Jade Tower sounded like it might not be a positive force.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if that top powerhouse's corpse that floated in from the permanent spatial rift was related to the Magic Jade Tower, then why did he die?</p><p></p><p>Many doubts flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Magic Jade Imprint..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to carefully observe his soul.</p><p></p><p>After he comprehended the 3,333 paths of evolution, these paths underwent changes and condensed into the so-called "Magic Jade Imprint", which automatically made Lin Yuan an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>So that "Magic Jade Imprint" should be the key.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered that this imprint ultimately merged into the depths of his own soul.</p><p></p><p>"Found it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly found an imprint of a "Nine-Layered Black Tower" deep in his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's mind merged with this imprint, he immediately received a large amount of information.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is..."</p><p></p><p>There were two ways to become a member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The first way was to cultivate any one of the comprehended paths of evolution.</p><p></p><p>Each path of evolution contained within that body had huge flaws and hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating it, making up for its deficiencies, and overcoming many difficulties would automatically make one an ordinary member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>The second way was like Lin Yuan's. Without cultivating, just by comprehending and seeing through the 3,333 paths of evolution, it would trigger a certain threshold, condense the Magic Jade Imprint, and automatically make one a member of the Magic Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>These two methods mainly tested two aspects.</p><p></p><p>The former tested whether the evolver could overcome repeated difficulties when faced with a thorny path and make it to the end.</p><p></p><p>The latter tested the evolver's comprehension and mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that without cultivating, just comprehending would continually face pressure on one's mental willpower.</p><p></p><p>To be able to comprehend 3,333 paths of evolution under such premises, as long as the time spent did not exceed 100,000 years, that comprehension ability could be called terrifying. The Magic Jade Tower very much welcomed such evolvers to join.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of this body should have been a top powerhouse from the Magic Jade Tower."</p><p></p><p>"It's just unknown for what reason he perished, and his body carried many of the Magic Jade Tower's 'wrong' paths of evolution."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can't be said he carried them, but rather this top powerhouse himself cultivated them, which is why we could comprehend them..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"And this 'Magic Jade Imprint'..."</p><p></p><p>With the help of this imprint, Lin Yuan vaguely sensed that he could perceive a mysterious space.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious space was not in the main world, and the "Magic Jade Imprint" was like a key. As long as Lin Yuan was willing, he could enter.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yuan also received a warning.</p><p></p><p>"Entry into the Magic Jade Space is forbidden before reaching the Eighth Stage Limit!"</p><p></p><p>"Magic Jade Space?"</p><p></p><p>"One can only enter at the Eighth Stage Limit?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that although his current inner world had reached over 100,000 miles in radius and could be said to not be much weaker than an Eighth Stage Limit evolver, who knew what aspect the Magic Jade Space tested Eighth Stage Limit evolvers on? What if it wasn't the inner world?</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was very curious about that Magic Jade Space, he also felt he should obediently wait until reaching the Eighth Stage Limit before considering exploring it.</p><p></p><p>In any case, with Lin Yuan's cultivation speed, reaching the Eighth Stage Limit wouldn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>"Condensing the Magic Jade Imprint didn't attract the attention of others?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked around, discovering that the other evolvers were still painstakingly comprehending that body. From time to time, an evolver's body would collapse and a new evolver would quickly fill in.</p><p></p><p>"I can continue comprehending?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at that body and found it still tested the comprehension of more paths of evolution.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the speed of comprehension has increased, and my mental willpower has also been enhanced to a certain degree. Is it because of that 'Magic Jade Imprint'?" Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Magic Jade Imprint not only served as a key, but also stabilized Lin Yuan's soul and mental willpower, like a calming divine needle, roughly equivalent to an Eighth Stage soul defense treasure standing guard.</p><p></p><p>"It's too incredible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Just one imprint could have the effect of an Eighth Stage soul defense treasure? The origins of this Magic Jade Tower were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Canlan Star Virtual World.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared as he looked at his parents and sister.</p><p></p><p>"Brother," Lin Yi said, "You haven't seen us for so long. Mom and Dad often nag about you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at his parents and said apologetically, "I've been a bit busy recently."</p><p></p><p>In order to comprehend that body, Lin Yuan had spent most of his time on it, resulting in not seeing his family for almost one or two years.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay. Xiaoyuan, you are now the 13th Peak Master of the Vermilion Roc Star Domain. It's normal to be busy," his mother Lu Qiong said, shaking her head.</p><p></p><p>At most, she would just nag a few more times usually and naturally wouldn't delay Lin Yuan's affairs.</p><p></p><p>The family of four then sat down and chatted casually.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had a very high status, his relationship with his parents and sister was extraordinary. Plus, Lin Yuan intentionally restrained his aura. Moreover, in the virtual world, his parents and sister didn't feel any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>"What level is this arena competition? There aren't even a few Third Stage evolvers. It's far inferior to the arena competition Xiaoyuan participated in."</p><p></p><p>Father Lin Shoucheng chatted about the recent...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hot topic.</p><p></p><p>Can't help but start complaining.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi spoke up.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 8 9 s h u x . c o m</p><p></p><p>Although she is only a first-stage evolver now, she has no choice but to have an elder brother who is a peak master and knows many secrets.</p><p></p><p>"Arena competition?" Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Our little Yuan is still the champion of the last arena competition on Canglan Star." Mother Lu Qiong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Arena champion."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts drifted, feeling quite strange in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The arena competition of the Annan Star Alliance is held every fifteen years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still clearly remembers the many opponents he encountered when he participated in the arena competition.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was still in the third or fourth stage. In order to study the evolution paths of his opponents, he deliberately delayed the duration of the competition and earned the title of "Torture King".</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>He is already at the peak of the seventh stage, only half a step away from entering the eighth stage. In terms of real combat power, he can crush the vast majority of eighth-stage evolvers.</p><p></p><p>His citizen level has even reached level seven, and he is a "councilor" high above the entire Annan Star Alliance. Even the star lords of ordinary star domains are polite to him.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that fifteen years have passed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said to himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, the fifteen years here are the fifteen years of the main world, the fifteen years that his parents and younger sister have gone through.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan, if the time spent traversing worlds is counted, it far exceeds fifteen years, probably around a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"With my current identity, when the teacher opens the trial world, I will watch those challengers pass the trials together with my senior brothers, while I was one of those challengers back then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In just fifteen years, Lin Yuan's identity has changed from a challenger to an "examiner".</p><p></p><p>After continuing to chat with his parents and family for a while.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness disconnected from the virtual world and returned to reality.</p><p></p><p>"Origin Essence Gold."</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, a "bell-shaped" weapon the size of a fist appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Plus, with Lin Yuan's continuous shaping in the main world in recent years, at this moment, the Origin Essence Gold is basically fully formed and can be used as a weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Guard the flesh and soul."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's requirement for this Origin Essence Gold is defense, extreme defense.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!</p><p></p><p>The "bell-shaped" weapon, which was the size of a palm, quickly rose and came to the top of Lin Yuan's head, dropping down layers of light curtains, protecting Lin Yuan inside.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>With the current defensive ability of this "bell-shaped" weapon, eighth-stage evolvers basically can't break Lin Yuan's defense, unless they are at the peak of the eighth stage or an invincible existence like Teacher Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan was fiddling with the "bell-shaped" weapon.</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord suddenly sent a message asking Lin Yuan to go over.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan got up and quickly came to the crimson red hall.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was grateful to Chi Kun Star Lord in his heart. The other party was indeed treating him sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"This is the soul defense treasure you want to repair. I have asked a good friend to repair it."</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord raised his right hand slightly, and a drop of water flew over.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it stopped in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's repaired?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was overjoyed. The eighth-stage soul defense treasure obtained from the eighth-stage evolver Ou Yin was severely damaged, after all, it had withstood a blow from an invincible eighth-stage.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how damaged it was, it was still an eighth-stage soul defense treasure. Lin Yuan would not give up on it no matter what.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, Lin Yuan had asked Teacher Chi Kun Star Lord to thoroughly repair it.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the price is?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the water droplet, observed it carefully for a while, and then looked at Chi Kun Star Lord and asked.</p><p></p><p>But it was definitely not an easy matter, otherwise Lin Yuan would have solved it himself and wouldn't have to ask Chi Kun Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>"It's all trivial."</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord didn't care at all. He didn't even ask about the origin of this water droplet.</p><p></p><p>"If you mind these things, just accept a few disciples when opening the Seven Star Cave World this time."</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord said.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Star Cave World? It seems that this arena competition has produced many geniuses again?" Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In each arena competition, Chi Kun Star Lord would select a star system and gather the top ten from each planet's arena competition in a trial world to test whether they could join the Chi Kun lineage.</p><p></p><p>But there are many trial worlds here.</p><p></p><p>And the Seven Star Cave trial world is not available after every arena competition. Chi Kun Star Lord will only choose to open it when the number or proportion of geniuses reaches a certain level.</p><p></p><p>In the last arena competition, three Chi Wen-level geniuses were born, including the silver-haired girl Yin Ling with spatial talent and that three-eyed tribe man.</p><p></p><p>"There are indeed some pretty good little guys."</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Star Lord nodded. For him, no matter how strong the talent was, it was just pretty good.</p><p></p><p>Unless they could directly comprehend the skin and hair of the "Xuanhuang" evolution path like Lin Yuan, he basically had no intention of personally accepting disciples.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take a look then."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan replied. If he really saw some suitable evolvers, he wouldn't mind accepting them into the Thirteen Mountain Peaks.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at the beginning, Lin Yuan would at most only accept outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>Only if the other party's subsequent performance continued to satisfy him would he gradually promote them to core disciples or even personal disciples.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than half a month passed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the virtual world, Chi Kun Star Lord once again opened the Seven Star Cave World.</p><p></p><p>More than a million challengers were thrown into this world. Countless challengers, after the initial confusion, began to move towards the second star cave and the third star cave.</p><p></p><p>In a mysterious space somewhere in the Seven Star Cave World.</p><p></p><p>Twelve figures stood casually there. They were the twelve peak masters. At this moment, they were intentionally or unintentionally observing the evolvers undergoing the trials below.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Little junior brother, little junior brother, you're here."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, if you take a fancy to anyone later, little junior brother, just say it directly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but little junior brother, you have to leave some for the big senior brother. We don't mind, but the big senior brother is about to go to other star domains and needs manpower under his command."</p><p></p><p>The peak masters greeted Lin Yuan very enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also responded to each of them one by one. The peak masters of the Chi Kun lineage were relatively united and had no scheming against each other, which was also related to Chi Kun Star Lord's personality.</p><p></p><p>"More than 150,000 challengers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan came to his position and looked down at the first star cave and the second star cave below. The number of evolvers in this Seven Star Cave trial was 50% more than in Lin Yuan's time, with more than 150,000 challengers.</p><p></p><p>"The last time the Seven Star Cave World opened, I was also one of those more than 100,000 challengers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze looked down, his thoughts drifting.</p>

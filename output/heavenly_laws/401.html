            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, don't be afraid, they just want to see you." The Paragon Butterfly spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan swept through the eight foreign races, beating and crushing the legendary level 11 special lifeforms like the Four Celestial Kings. Even to the Paragons, this was shocking.  </p><p></p><p>So apart from the Paragon Xia Qin, the other Paragons were stirred and developed a deep curiosity about Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This was a good opportunity to deliver the eleven wondrous objects.</p><p></p><p>These eleven wondrous objects were treasures that the human civilization evolvers like Xuanyuan Du had spent over ten thousand years painstakingly battling and killing other powerful races to obtain. Lin Yuan taking fifty percent was already more than enough, he naturally would not 'embezzle' more.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan obtained the wondrous objects with utmost ease, built upon an absolute foundation of strength.</p><p></p><p>For the human civilization and other level 11 evolvers, to obtain these wondrous objects, especially in the later stages, they could only compete with other powerful races, the difficulty was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Stand behind me."</p><p></p><p>The Paragon Butterfly glanced at Lin Yuan, and immediately the surrounding space began to shift.</p><p></p><p>"I can sense that the distance between us and my true self has suddenly expanded to billions of light years," Lin Yuan's heart wavered, realizing that the Paragon Butterfly before him was not her true form, but a negligible avatar.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan followed the Paragon Butterfly to the front of a majestic palace.</p><p></p><p>"This is the third key site of the human civilization," the Paragon Butterfly stopped and explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The third key site was where the nine Paragons usually gathered.</p><p></p><p>After the human civilization birthed the virtual world, the third key site was rarely used, as the Paragons mostly convened in the virtual world for convenience.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This palace exerted immense pressure on him - it was at least a Paragon weapon, an extremely powerful one at that.</p><p></p><p>Among the hundreds of wondrous objects Lin Yuan obtained in the two-dimensional world, none could surpass the oppressive aura of this palace.</p><p></p><p>Following the Paragon Butterfly, Lin Yuan entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>Deep inside the palace,</p><p></p><p>Nine towering figures sat on nine massive thrones.</p><p></p><p>After the Paragon Butterfly arrived, her form quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the nine Paragons," Lin Yuan immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he still greatly respected the Paragons, because for them, protecting the human civilization was completely without any reward.</p><p></p><p>Those level 8, 9, 10 and 11 evolvers of the human civilization battled the foreign races on the battlefield out of 'duty', but they could also obtain many benefits and rewards.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's merit point system ensured that as long as one contributed to the civilization, they would receive many privileges.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason for the current prosperity of the human civilization - contributions were balanced by rewards.</p><p></p><p>But what about the Paragons?</p><p></p><p>They sheltered the human civilization, dedicating vast amounts of time and effort, but what could they gain?</p><p></p><p>Basically nothing.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful physical body," the Paragon Gu Li, one of the nine Paragons, gazed at Lin Yuan and said softly.</p><p></p><p>As the ultimate existence of the Force evolution path that believed in breaking all rules through force, the Paragon Gu Li's greatest strength was his physical body's power.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yuan obediently listened.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was naturally far beyond other level 10 evolvers.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao evolution path excelled in physical bodies. Combined with the enhancements from the mysterious gourd, his physical strength exceeded the base by 23 times.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the 'Profound Primordial Body' technique also greatly boosted his physical prowess. When he broke through to level 10, he withstood the infusion of chaotic primordial origins.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of many factors, Lin Yuan's physical body had become incredibly powerful. With just his body alone, he could likely match an ordinary level 11 evolver.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the physical body of Lin Yuan's Solar Yuan Spirit - his true self would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful body is no match for comprehending the rules," the Paragon Xu Shen on another throne said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The Paragon Gu Li glanced at Xu Shen.</p><p></p><p>The Paragon Xu Shen mastered the great dao of space and was absolutely the most troublesome of the nine human Paragons, because you could never find his true self.</p><p></p><p>"Without a body, how can there be comprehension of rules?" Another Paragon spoke, showing a kind smile towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan," the Paragon Xia Qin said slowly from his throne, "We are very satisfied with your performance in the two-dimensional world."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Paragon," Lin Yuan immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>Being able to satisfy even one or two Paragons was already extremely difficult, let alone satisfying all nine Paragons - at least since the beginning of the Stellar Era, this had never happened in the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Paragons, these are eleven wondrous objects," Lin Yuan willed, and eleven wondrous objects appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Of the eleven, eight were materials for the Twelve Celestial Wonders, and three were Paragon weapons - two offensive and one defensive type.</p><p></p><p>"Passable," the nine Paragons on their thrones nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>These wondrous objects had no major effects for them, but could at least enhance the foundation of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the level 11 evolvers like Xuanyuan Du had all perished in the two-dimensional world after exhausting their efforts to obtain these treasures. Lin Yuan taking fifty percent was already more than enough.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Within the second dimension world, these strange objects were seeking him out, although their effects were not as great as Lin Yuan's, but at least they could make up for it to some extent. </p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan, if you have any strange objects you don't need, you can exchange them for merit points anytime, and then exchange them for the twelve-star rare treasures that are helpful to you in the treasury of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi reminded him.</p><p></p><p>In this second dimension world, only Lin Yuan successfully came out alive. In terms of gains, Lin Yuan definitely gained the most.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength to sweep through the second dimension world, he must have also obtained a batch of strange objects. Adding the eleven strange objects he got a share of, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi estimated that Lin Yuan probably had more than thirty strange objects in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had no interest in the strange objects in Lin Yuan's hands. These were obtained by Lin Yuan's own strength and means. However, not all strange objects could be useful to himself.</p><p></p><p>The treasury of human civilization also collected a batch of twelve-star rare treasured weapons, with a rich variety that could only be exchanged with merit points.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could completely choose the ones suitable for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Among the nearly one hundred strange objects he obtained from the second dimension world, most of them were useless to him. Rather than keeping them, it was better to exchange them for treasures and rarities that were useful to him.</p><p></p><p>After all, human civilization would definitely not let him suffer a loss.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take these eleven strange objects."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi's hand, the eleven strange objects in front of Lin Yuan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I let you come here is to join forces and bring you to the 'shore' of the river of time again, to enhance your comprehension of the rules of time, and deepen your understanding of the fusion of time and space, striving to comprehend the rules of time-space fusion at an earlier date."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi continued.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had long comprehended the rules of time, but just like the rules of space, the so-called comprehension of the rules of time was only the comprehension of one aspect of the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>To finally comprehend the rules of time-space fusion, he still needed to continue to constantly contemplate the rules of time.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi alone could allow Lin Yuan to break free from the river of time for dozens of breaths. If the power of nine Paramount Lords was gathered, the time Lin Yuan could break free from the river of time would naturally be longer.</p><p></p><p>Such help for Lin Yuan to comprehend the rules of time would naturally be greater.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the nine Paramount Lords joining forces to forcibly allow a life form in the river of time to break free would definitely face a backlash from the river of time and the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>However, the merit Lin Yuan had established in the second dimension world this time was too great. Even though eleven strange objects had been taken away, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi and the other Paramount Lords felt that they should make it up to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As for the backlash, as long as they controlled the time well, and with Lin Yuan being only a tenth-stage life form, that cost was still bearable for them.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the shore of the river of time?" Lin Yuan's expression was slightly hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Being at the shore of the river of time, overlooking the entire panorama of the river of time, was an unprecedented great opportunity for most life forms.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan? His comprehension of the rules of time had already reached an extreme. Even if he went to the 'shore' again, it would not be of much use. After all, he was only a tenth-stage life form. Even if he briefly came to the 'shore', how far could he see?</p><p></p><p>From the perspective of efficiency, it was far inferior to absorbing that cluster of light containing the comprehension of the rules of time-space fusion from the powerful beings of various races.</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had probably underestimated the difficulty of bringing Lin Yuan out of the river of time again.</p><p></p><p>Similar to reviving life forms that had died in the past, the more powerful the life form being revived, the greater the cost the Paramount Lords had to bear.</p><p></p><p>Reviving a sixth-stage life form and reviving an eleventh-stage life form naturally had different costs.</p><p></p><p>And bringing life forms of different levels out of the river of time to the shore also had a difference.</p><p></p><p>Within the river of time, countless life forms exhibited different physical sizes and weights according to their inherent natures.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the higher the inherent nature of a life form, the larger its physical size and weight. A tenth-stage life form in the river of time was considered a small fish, while an eleventh-stage life form could be considered a big fish.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan? Even before falling into the second dimension world, his strength was on par with an eleventh-stage life form, qualifying him as a big fish.</p><p></p><p>Now, after experiencing the journey in the second dimension world and comprehending the rules of time-space fusion, with the world within him undergoing a metamorphosis, even in the river of time, he could be considered a massive being.</p><p></p><p>Occupying one-tenth to one-fifth of the riverbed, he belonged to the strongest level below those perfect legendary eleventh-stage life forms.</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi thought that Lin Yuan was only a tenth-stage life form, at most approaching the eleventh stage, so he was confident that he could easily bring Lin Yuan to the 'shore' of the river again.</p><p></p><p>But the actual truth was probably different from what the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi noticed Lin Yuan's hesitation and slightly raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount Lord, could I change the reward?" After thinking for a moment, Lin Yuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Change the reward?" The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi looked at Lin Yuan, his expression slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What reward could be more important than observing the river of time?</p><p></p><p>What reward could be more important than taking a step further towards comprehending the rules of time-space fusion?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I have already comprehended the rules of time-space fusion." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment and decided to be frank, otherwise he wouldn't know how to refuse the Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi's 'kindness'.</p><p></p><p>"You've comprehended the rules of time-space fusion?"</p><p></p><p>The Paramount Lord Xia Qinzhi fell silent. He looked at the other eight Paramount Lords around him, a hint of bewilderment in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

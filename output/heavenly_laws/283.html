            <p>Chapter 283: The Great Scholar of Tai'e: When Did You Become a Great Scholar Too? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Go and invite the Galaxy Realm Master."</p><p></p><p>The other invincible 8th stage evolvers looked at each other. </p><p></p><p>Battlefield B0001 is the oldest medium-sized battlefield, gathering a large number of evolvers from human civilization and powerful members of the Feather Tribe.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the intensity of war, Battlefield B0001 is second only to the large-scale alien battlefields. 8th stage invincible existences often fight here, and human civilization has deployed dozens of 8th stage invincibles on this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the 8th stage invincibles, there are even 9th stage powerhouses paying attention.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it is the human civilization side or the Feather Tribe side, the 9th stage powerhouses will only pay attention and basically will not intervene.</p><p></p><p>Once 9th stage powerhouses enter the battlefield, the nature changes, and the entire battlefield may be penetrated.</p><p></p><p>The major alliance of peak races in the cosmic starry sky is trying to restrain 9th stage powerhouses from taking action. Except for large battlefields, it is rare to see 9th stage powerhouses taking action.</p><p></p><p>Previously, human civilization dispatched many 9th stage evolvers to cleanse the many powerful races of the Insect Race Alliance because the Insect Race took the initiative to tear off their masks.</p><p></p><p>"Inviting the Galaxy Realm Master is indeed a way."</p><p></p><p>The many 8th stage invincible evolvers nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>As 8th stage invincibles, they are naturally extremely proud, but they have no doubts about the Galaxy Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>In that battle in the Galaxy Realm, the Galaxy Realm Master fought against five and killed two 8th stage invincibles from alien races.</p><p></p><p>With such ferocity, which 8th stage invincible on the scene dares to have other thoughts?</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Realm Master single-handedly raised the upper limit of the combat power of 8th stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he broke the undefeated myth of 8th stage invincibles and was vaguely praised as the first 8th stage evolver of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, he is the first 8th stage evolver in the history of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"It's just, what price should we pay to invite the Galaxy Realm Master?" The woman in green asked.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the Galaxy Realm Master, there is indeed hope to reverse the situation on the battlefield and at least stall a considerable portion of the 8th stage invincibles of the Feather Tribe.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, human civilization is equivalent to standing in an undefeated position.</p><p></p><p>This is all very good.</p><p></p><p>The problem is what kind of price to pay.</p><p></p><p>If the price is too low, the Galaxy Realm Master will be too lazy to come.</p><p></p><p>If the price is too high, there is no upper limit. They are also not clear about how high a price is needed to invite the Galaxy Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>"I have decided to give up one-tenth of the total merit from the upcoming battles on this battlefield." The short and fat figure pondered for a moment and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"One-tenth of the total merit?"</p><p></p><p>The total merit involved in a battlefield is very huge.</p><p></p><p>Why do those Realm Masters keep opening up and taking over one alien battlefield after another? Is it purely to serve human civilization?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, it is because taking over an alien battlefield can obtain a lot of benefits, among which merit points are the most important aspect.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we don't lose to the Feather Tribe, let it go."</p><p></p><p>The 8th stage invincible evolvers thought for a while and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Losing the war against the Feather Tribe also requires a huge price for these 8th stage invincible evolvers who are stationed on the battlefield. Maybe even this avatar cannot be preserved.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case."</p><p></p><p>"Then I will contact the Goddess of Liberty, and she will contact the Galaxy Realm Master."</p><p></p><p>The short and fat figure said.</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing an 8th stage invincible, especially a legendary 8th stage invincible like Lin Yuan, must obtain the consent of the Goddess of Liberty.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the price they agreed on must also be notarized by the Goddess of Liberty, which is also to express their sincerity to the Galaxy Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>Magic Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared again, and an invisible heavy pressure came from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"I use various cosmic forces to resist the enveloping pressure, which can help me develop more methods of cosmic force?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since the last time he failed to break through the second floor of the Black Tower, he occasionally descended to the Nine-Storey Black Tower through the Magic Jade Imprint.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the pressure from the second floor of the Black Tower, he tempered his use of various cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, for 8th stage life, cosmic force is unique, so there are no techniques for its application at all.</p><p></p><p>But in the Spirit Realm, many supreme Immortal Kings master multiple Creation Forces, and the combination of different Creation Forces can often unleash greater power.</p><p></p><p>The internal environment of the Nine-Storey Black Tower is specially designed for the comprehension of cosmic forces and spatial laws. With Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension ability, he can constantly adapt and adjust himself to better comprehend the techniques of using cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan's descent here is just a pastime during his comprehension of spatial laws. When he is tired, he comes to try it out and takes it as a relaxation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine-Storey Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengi was also watching Lin Yuan's performance on the second floor.</p><p></p><p>"But it's also good. I look forward to what achievements you will have in the future." The humanoid stone statue Shengi stared at Lin Yuan in the image.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gave up on his own.</p><p></p><p>Being expelled by the Nine-Storey Black Tower, he appeared outside the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"How was it, kid?" The humanoid stone statue asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I gained some insights." Lin Yuan said. In fact, it was more than just some insights. He just comprehended six techniques for using cosmic forces, including three advanced cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>"Feel more about the essence of cosmic forces. It will be of great benefit to the ultimate sublimation and transformation of your inner world into an inner universe in the future."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengi said.</p><p></p><p>"Inner universe..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Why do the cosmic forces comprehended by 8th stage invincibles have great benefits for 9th stage cultivation?</p><p></p><p>It is because cosmic force is the fundamental force of the cosmic starry sky in the main world. When comprehended at the 8th stage and integrated into the supporting laws, transforming the inner world, it allows the inner world to contain a trace of the fundamental force of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when the inner world sublimates into an inner universe, it will have a promoting effect.</p><p></p><p>"With the cosmic forces you have mastered, plus the suppression of the World Tree, the future sublimation of your inner world into an inner universe should not be difficult. The only thing to pay attention to is what kind of inner universe will eventually be sublimated."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengi looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Inner universes also vary in strength.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shengi was curious about what level Lin Yuan's future inner universe would reach. Dozens of ordinary cosmic forces, more than ten advanced cosmic forces, plus a primordial cosmic force.</p><p></p><p>What kind of inner universe will it form?</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that your race's upper limit is not high. Even if you fully comprehend the complete spatial laws, your inner world will be at most a million square miles. If it could be a little bigger..."</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue said this and suddenly laughed. What was he thinking? Even with only a million square miles inner world, relying on so many cosmic forces integrated, it can still turn decay into magic.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Goddess of Liberty is looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart moved.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the Goddess of Liberty came to Lin Yuan's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Great Scholar Lin Yuan..."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Liberty was filled with coldness and murderous intent, very distinctive.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Liberty."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's tone was slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>In human civilization, the status of the three goddesses was no lower than the nine supreme beings. For more than two million years, the three ultimate intelligent goddesses had made indelible contributions.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Liberty informed Lin Yuan of the invitation from the alien battlefield No. B0001.</p><p></p><p>"You want me to go to this alien battlefield to confront the many powerful members of the Tianyu race?" Lin Yuan raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I agree, I will receive one-tenth of the total merits in the upcoming war?" Lin Yuan was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>The alien battlefield No. B0001 was arranged with a large number of powerful members of human civilization and the Tianyu race, so the merits involved were naturally huge. Even if it was only one-tenth, it was estimated to be calculated in millions.</p><p></p><p>"Just by making a move once, I can get at least millions of merit points?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, he would naturally make a move at the most critical moment of the situation to turn the tide, so the number of times he would probably make a move was only once.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Liberty, will there be any ninth or tenth level powerhouses making a move on this alien battlefield?" Lin Yuan thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"In a medium-sized alien battlefield, there will almost never be ninth level or above powerhouses entering the field. Even if it happens, there will be ninth level or above human civilization evolutionaries to deal with it."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Liberty's tone was cold, as if there was no emotion at all.</p><p></p><p>"If I go to this battlefield, will there be any accidents, such as being cursed to death by alien powerhouses on all my clones?" Lin Yuan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>No matter when, one's own safety was the most important. If he were to lose his life for some merit points, Lin Yuan naturally would not be willing.</p><p></p><p>Merit points had a stable way of obtaining for Lin Yuan, and there was no need to take any risks for it.</p><p></p><p>"As the first medium-sized alien battlefield to be opened up, it will be watched by the eyes of the supreme beings. Scholar Lin Yuan only needs to focus on dealing with the eighth level aliens."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Liberty said again.</p><p></p><p>Given Lin Yuan's importance to human civilization, since the Goddess of Liberty agreed to Lin Yuan going to the battlefield, she naturally had gone through a large number of deductions to confirm that Lin Yuan would not have any real risk of death.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan had stepped into the seventh level, he wanted to go to the medium-sized alien battlefield, but was stopped by the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>It was because at that time, Lin Yuan had a small probability of encountering dangers that were difficult to resist on the medium-sized alien battlefield, which might involve the clone and the original body.</p><p></p><p>"Then I agree." Lin Yuan nodded. With his current strength, let alone being the first in history at the eighth level of human civilization, even if all the eighth levels in the history of the entire star space races were added together, they probably could not compare to him.</p><p></p><p>In the battle of the Galaxy Star Domain back then, Lin Yuan had not yet recovered to his full strength, and had not revealed his full strength either.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it still shocked the interior of human civilization, and the surrounding alien races were probably even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true combat power had already broken through the threshold of the ninth level. As for what level he was at within the ninth level, it would only be known after fighting a battle.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining Lin Yuan's consent, the Goddess of Liberty immediately contacted the eighth level invincible evolutionary on the No. B0001 battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The two of them would need to meet in the virtual world soon to discuss the specific requirements for making a move.</p><p></p><p>"《Interpretation of the Void》."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to comprehend this book left by the owner of the Magic Jade Building again.</p><p></p><p>"It's really profound." Lin Yuan was somewhat obsessed. There were three thousand three hundred and thirty-three fonts in the 《Interpretation of the Void》, and each font seemed to contain endless information.</p><p></p><p>Every time Lin Yuan comprehended, he could realize new spatial essences from the same font.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, Lin Yuan had comprehended for several days.</p><p></p><p>"The 7132nd spatial model."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes, and with a slight movement of his mind, strands of spatial power gathered in front of him, forming an extremely complex spatial model in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"There are still more than 500 spatial models left before I can fully comprehend the complete spatial rules."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan let out a sigh of relief, and at the same time sensed the fatigue from his mind.</p><p></p><p>The level of the 《Interpretation of the Void》 was too high, and Lin Yuan's long-term comprehension consumed a lot of mental power, which could not be maintained for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This had nothing to do with "Heaven-defying Comprehension". It was mainly because of Lin Yuan himself. If his mental power was sufficient, he could continue to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a look at the virtual world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness connected to the virtual world, intending to relax for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Creator's Virtual World." Lin Yuan's consciousness directly entered.</p><p></p><p>This virtual world was specially opened up for the creators of the many evolutionary paths of human civilization, and was used as a place for daily communication among the creators.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Lin Yuan entered the Creator's World.</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao appeared beside Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the public area of the Creator's World, every creator had the right to enter.</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao was extremely curious about Lin Yuan. If it weren't for the Goddess of Wisdom's obstruction and warning, he would have probably used some means to forcibly reveal Lin Yuan's true identity long ago.</p><p></p><p>"I've been a bit busy recently." Lin Yuan said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Not just a bit busy, there were too many things Lin Yuan needed to do, such as the 《Interpretation of the Void》, the fusion of rules, the Nine-Layered Black Tower, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Each one of them required a lot of time and energy.</p><p></p><p>"It's good to be busy."</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way."</p><p></p><p>"After a while, the Great Scholar Molang plans to specially open up a virtual world to talk about the essence of spatial rules and time rules. Do you want to go?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao glanced at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Molang was one of the few great scholars in the Creator's Virtual World who directly revealed his own identity.</p><p></p><p>The reason for doing so was because the Great Scholar Molang was one of the top and most ancient great scholars of human civilization. Even if his identity was revealed, it would not be affected much.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of time rules and spatial rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up. So far, he had no interest in time rules for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But spatial rules? Even with the 《Interpretation of the Void》 left by the owner of the Magic Jade Building, Lin Yuan did not mind getting in touch with more powerhouses' understanding and views on space.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go or not?"</p><p></p><p>"I have an invitation."</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao asked again.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to listen to the Great Scholar Molang's talk was not something ordinary people could do. Only beings who were also evolutionary great scholars could receive an "invitation".</p><p></p><p>Of course, if a certain evolutionary great scholar was too lazy to participate, he could also give the "invitation" to other creators.</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao had this kind of plan. If Lin Yuan begged a little more, he wouldn't mind giving the invitation to the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Invitation?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Then a virtual screen appeared in front of him. Opening the email column, an invitation from the Great Scholar Molang appeared there.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the invitation you're referring to?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned his head to look at the Great Scholar Taao.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Scholar Taao blinked his eyes and repeatedly looked at the invitation for a while. Finally, he looked at Lin Yuan and said in disbelief, "When did you also become a great scholar?"</p>

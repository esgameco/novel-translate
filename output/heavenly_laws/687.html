        <h1>Chapter 687</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sacred Blue Cloud Mountain stood tall, as the supreme overlord power before the great changes of heaven and earth. It was the home of the Blue Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>Within the Blue Cloud Mountain, numerous small worlds had been opened up.</p><p></p><p>They were used to cultivate the fresh blood of the Blue Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the sect to persist until the present day, even as most of the outside regions were occupied by the 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Cloud Courtyard, Elder Lin Yuan had not changed much compared to a thousand years ago, except that his aura had become more restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Chen, it is said that the 'Demons' are indestructible. Is there really no way to completely eliminate them?" asked a young disciple, just after exchanging the necessary jade slips.</p><p></p><p>Over the past thousand years, Elder Lin Yuan had lived in seclusion in the Blue Cloud Courtyard, occasionally guiding the doubts of the newly promoted disciples. Over time, he had gained quite a reputation, and many disciples were willing to ask him questions.</p><p></p><p>"The Demons originate from the demonic qi of heaven and earth. As long as the demonic qi exists, the Demons will not be extinguished," Lin Yuan said calmly. "To completely eliminate the Demons in the world, one must erase the source of the demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>The so-called source of the demonic qi was the legendary Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Having lived in this source world for a thousand years, Lin Yuan had also learned many hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>For example, the demonic qi? If the demonic qi were to be compared to sunlight, then the Demon God would be the sun.</p><p></p><p>As long as the sun exists, the demonic qi will flow endlessly, and the terrifying 'Demons', even if completely annihilated, will be reborn under the endless demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"How can one erase the source of the demonic qi?" the young disciple continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Lin Yuan shook his head, although he had sensed that all the demonic qi originated from the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>But where the Demon God was, Lin Yuan did not know.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he knew, he would not try to erase it, as the Demon God's strength was at least at the Thirteenth Realm, capable of brewing a 'Demonic' disaster that could engulf the entire source world.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you don't need to think too much about it," Lin Yuan said casually to the worried young disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," the young disciple nodded and left the Blue Cloud Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he reached the entrance, a few other young disciples gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang, what did you discuss with Steward Chen?" the young disciples were quite curious.</p><p></p><p>"I asked how to completely eliminate the 'Demons' in the outside world," the young disciple named Ouyang said truthfully.</p><p></p><p>"What did Steward Chen say?"</p><p></p><p>"Steward Chen said that to destroy the Demons, one must erase the source of the demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang explained.</p><p></p><p>"Erase the source of the demonic qi?" the few young disciples pondered for a while.</p><p></p><p>They did not doubt Lin Yuan's response. Over the past thousand years, the Steward Chen of the Blue Cloud Courtyard, although he had never revealed any powerful abilities, was well-versed and experienced, and even the elders of the sect would occasionally come to consult him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, with Steward Chen's understanding of the 'Demons', why is he still staying in the Blue Cloud Courtyard? Wouldn't it be better for him to go out and eliminate the demonic qi gathering places?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Steward Chen was once infected by the demonic qi during an operation to eliminate a demonic qi gathering place, leaving him with some hidden dangers."</p><p></p><p>"I see, Steward Chen has made such a great contribution to our sect!" the young disciples said with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Being infected by demonic qi had severe consequences, and those who survived were very few.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the Blue Cloud Courtyard, Lin Yuan sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"The waters of this source world are deep. The few eternal sects in the center of heaven and earth must have time immortals guarding them, but they have allowed the demonic qi to spread. What is the reason behind this?" Lin Yuan's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why, eight hundred years ago, after he had regained his peak strength, he had still hidden himself in the Blue Cloud Mountain - he could not fathom the situation in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But hiding in the Blue Cloud Mountain did not hinder Lin Yuan's cultivation and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The symbolic scriptures and techniques recorded in the Blue Cloud Sect were enough for Lin Yuan to ponder and comprehend for hundreds or even thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan also needed a lot of time to slowly open up his own particle worlds. With the demonic qi permeating the outside world and 'Demons' everywhere, if he ever lacked resources, he could simply go out and return fully loaded, as the so-called 'Demons' were nothing but chicks in his eyes, and even the great Demons could be easily subdued and refined by him.</p><p></p><p>If not for his caution towards the Demon God, Lin Yuan would have long ago gone to the center of heaven and earth to hunt down those source Demons.</p><p></p><p>"After a thousand years of cultivation, I have reached the peak of the first realm of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Dao. In a few hundred to a few thousand years, I can cross into the second realm," Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Dao was his foundation, and even the terrifying 'Demon' refining techniques he had now were based on the power of the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Dao.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Chaotic Yin-Yang Grand Dao, the greater the help it would provide to Lin Yuan, a fundamental help that nourished his body, spirit, mind, and will.</p><p></p><p>"And there is also the Thirteenth Realm inheritance, the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>After a thousand years of cultivation and refinement, he had also completed half the progress of the fourth layer of this inheritance.</p><p></p><p>In the past thousand years, Lin Yuan had made sufficient advancements in all aspects, especially after comprehending the symbolic scriptures of the second source world, which had greatly helped him in understanding many great Dao and rules.</p><p></p><p>But the greatest harvest was the opening of his particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>By stabilizing each particle world with the Dao of Symbols, and with the 'inexhaustible' Demons of this source world, the number of particle worlds Lin Yuan had opened had already reached a hundred billion.</p><p></p><p>A hundred billion particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>Although there was still a distance to reach his ultimate goal of Endless Particle Worlds, these hundred billion particle worlds had already bestowed Lin Yuan with terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Lin Yuan had three true body avatars, respectively in the Chaotic Void, the first source world, and the second source world.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of strength, the strongest true body avatar was the one in the second source world, without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Even considering the advantages of the universe within the Chaotic Void body and the Blazing Sun Divine Body in the first source world, they were still far inferior to the current true body avatar in this source world.</p><p></p><p>"I am different from Yuanlong."</p><p></p><p>"The particle worlds Yuanlong opened were just ordinary particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>"But the particle worlds I have opened have all been reconstructed through the inheritance of the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was radiant. The Thirteenth Realm inheritance, the 'Infinite Void', was a legacy that could be cultivated on any world, including particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the mere hundred billion particle worlds were almost comparable to Yuanlong's entire Endless Particle Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"So far, the opening of the particle worlds has been proceeding smoothly, but I will still wait until I have fully mastered it before making a move," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The true body avatar in the second source world was a pioneer, exploring and opening up the particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Does the world exist in danger?</p><p></p><p>If everything goes smoothly, by the time this true body Venerable has thoroughly opened up the Heng sand particle world, which is the cultivation time of the other two true body Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the second source world true body Venerable is currently the strongest is that the other two true body Venerables have not yet begun to open up the particle world.</p><p></p><p>"Although the external 'Demons' are said to be endless, in the past thousand years, with my hunting, the 'Demons' have clearly decreased a lot," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>One Demon Spirit can provide Lin Yuan with the resources to open up hundreds or even thousands of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>One great Demon can provide Lin Yuan with the resource energy to open up hundreds of thousands or even millions of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan has opened up a hundred billion particle worlds, which shows how many Demon Spirits and great Demons he has hunted.</p><p></p><p>Although Demons do not die, when their demonic bodies are completely extinguished, even if they recover, it will take a long time.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I need to expand the hunting range next, so that I can hunt more great Demons," Lin Yuan thought to himself, as with the continuous opening of particle worlds, he was also aware of the huge resources he needed.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in a certain desolate void, and in front of him, a stream of auras intertwined and swirled, constantly forming runes, each of which seemed to be the external manifestation of the great Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This Rune Dao is indeed useful."</p><p></p><p>"It can easily replicate many Dao rules, greatly reducing the cultivation threshold."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, feeling the difference in difficulty between perceiving formless Dao rules and perceiving tangible Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>"Before the great changes in the second source world, the number of powerhouses must be astonishing." Although Lin Yuan did not know the prosperous state before the great changes in heaven and earth, he could infer from the usefulness of the Rune Dao that it must have been an extremely brilliant cultivation era.</p><p></p><p>Probably Carefree Third Realm experts, on par with the Invincible Great Saints of the Chaotic Void, would often appear.</p><p></p><p>After all, even in the second source world, with the six great ancient countries backed by the six ancestors, the strongest Celestial Venerable who could match the Invincible Great Saints would not be many.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I have basically mastered the Rune inheritance that the Qingcloud Saint Sect possesses, and if I want to comprehend even more profound Rune inheritances, I will have to find even more powerful sects."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>More powerful sects? Which sect that has survived the rampant 'Demons' is not extremely hidden? To find the lair of such a force is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan knew where the eternal sect forces in the center of the heaven and earth were, but the risk of going there was still too great, so he planned to wait until he had finished opening up the Heng sand particle world before considering it.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slowly, at worst I'll try to create the subsequent part of the Rune Dao by myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, with the premise of obtaining part of the Rune Dao inheritance, given his extraordinary comprehension, he could try to create the subsequent part. But it would take too long, and whether it could match the original Rune Dao was uncertain. At least for now, Lin Yuan was certain that the perfection of the Rune Dao must have been experienced by a Thirteen Tier Time Life.</p><p></p><p>Only a Thirteen Tier Time Life could simplify the Dao rules in this way.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen Tier Time Life? Lin Yuan did not feel that his comprehension was lower than that of the Time Life, but the height at which the Time Life stood and the scenery they saw were different. He still highly valued the Rune Dao they had created.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced around the desolate void, and hundreds of years ago, he had left the Milky Way Chaotic Continent and wandered the Chaotic Void, trying to comprehend the operation of the entire Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had left a clone on the Milky Way Chaotic Continent, which he could summon at any time.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's current reputation as the Invincible Great Saint in the Chaotic Void, this alone guaranteed the safety of the Milky Way Chaotic Continent, as no Great Saint would dare to cause trouble there.</p><p></p><p>Qingcloud Saint Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall at the highest point.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master and the elders gathered.</p><p></p><p>"In the past thousand years, the number of 'Demons' in the vicinity has clearly decreased," said one of the elders with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The younger disciples might not have noticed, but the elders, who had experienced many great Demon attacks on the mountain and cleaned up many Demon gas gathering places, would occasionally encounter some Demon Spirits.</p><p></p><p>The threat of Demon Spirits is far less than that of great Demons, and when encountering Demon Spirits, the elders are not worried, as with the perception of Demon Spirits, they probably can't even detect the existence of the Qingcloud Saint Mountain.</p><p></p><p>But even if Demon Spirits are weak, they are still 'Demons', and they should not disappear mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, the number of 'Demon Spirits' that have mysteriously disappeared is too many, making many elders feel incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it a good thing that the number of Demons has decreased?"</p><p></p><p>Some elders were puzzled, thinking that the fewer 'Demons' around the Saint Mountain, the safer the Saint Mountain would be.</p><p></p><p>"It can't be that simple," the Qingcloud Saint Sect Master said in a low voice. "Most 'Demons' will reside in a certain area, and if the 'Demons' in an area decrease, there are two possibilities."</p><p></p><p>"One is that a more powerful 'Demon' has appeared in this area, and this 'Demon' makes the other 'Demons' instinctively retreat."</p><p></p><p>"So this is why the number of 'Demons' has decreased."</p><p></p><p>The Qingcloud Saint Sect Master paused for a moment before continuing, "The second possibility is that the 'Demons' in this area have been devoured, which is why the number has decreased."</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the elders' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>'Demons' being devoured?</p><p></p><p>Those capable of devouring 'Demons' are most likely Demon Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And as Demon Cultivators become more powerful, they will tend to approach true 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>A powerful Demon Cultivator is actually not much different from most 'Demons', perhaps retaining some fragmented memories, but their emotions have basically been erased, and they may even lose their memories as they continue to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>"A Demon Cultivator? Has another Demon Cultivator appeared in our sect?"</p><p></p><p>Some elders were horrified, as even they could feel the decrease in the number of 'Demons' in the surrounding area, which meant that this Demon Cultivator had devoured a huge number of Demons.</p><p></p><p>After devouring so many 'Demons', the Demon Cultivator's strength, even if it has not reached the Carefree Third Realm, is not far off.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the 'Demons' outside, the Demon Cultivator would be more terrifying, as they would lurk within the Saint Mountain, not knowing when they would strike.</p><p></p><p>"It's also possible that it's the first possibility, or there may be other possibilities we haven't considered," the Qingcloud Saint Sect Master said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, regardless of which possibility it is, it is not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>With the decrease in the number of 'Demons' in this area, the loss of a large amount of 'Demon' exhalation of Demon Qi will cause the Demon Qi concentration in the surrounding area to slowly rise, which will attract the attention of more distant and powerful 'Demons'.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 705</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Golden Mist Treasure Land.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged there.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the irregular rift connecting to the origin of the Source World gradually healed completely.</p><p></p><p>"Is it gone?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was inevitably regretful.</p><p></p><p>Directly observing the operation of the Source World's origin was rapidly improving his comprehension of the Dao and rules at every moment.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, such opportunities could only be encountered when a new treasure land was first born.</p><p></p><p>The relationship between a treasure land and the Source World was like that between a mother tree and its fruit. </p><p></p><p>Before the fruit completely separated from the mother tree, one could slightly observe the most fundamental area of the mother tree through the connection between the two.</p><p></p><p>Once completely separated, this connection would break, and naturally everything would return to its original state.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it would take between several hundred to ten thousand years for a treasure land to fully sever its connection with the Source World after coming into existence.</p><p></p><p>The exact duration was related to the level of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>As a top-tier first-class treasure land, the Golden Mist Treasure Land maintained its connection with the Source World for just over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that this rift channel connecting to the Source World's origin cannot be forcibly opened."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Even beings as powerful as the Ancestors could directly sense the operation of the Source World's origin through their life level.</p><p></p><p>But forcibly opening a rift channel penetrating to the Source World's origin would incur backlash from the entire Source World.</p><p></p><p>Few living beings could withstand such backlash.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Lin Yuan really asked, the six Ancestors would forcibly open the rift channel connecting to the Source World's origin even at the cost of being suppressed by the Source World's backlash.</p><p></p><p>But in that case,</p><p></p><p>The favor Lin Yuan owed would be too great.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after ten thousand years of contemplation, Lin Yuan believed he had reached the limit in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to observe the operation of the Source World's origin would be far less useful than the previous ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand years of bitter cultivation and seclusion have greatly improved me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>At his level, even ten thousand years, or ten billion years, might not lead to any progress in strength.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different. With his extraordinary comprehension ability, plus the accumulated advantages of different dimensional spaces, his strength underwent another qualitative change over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's vision, the space-time of the Golden Mist Treasure Land and the outside world were all in order, like fine threads running through the world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could influence and control them with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>If he wished, he could trigger space-time storms within the Source World at any time, wiping out 90% of all life.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand years ago, Lin Yuan had completed a thorough transformation in his comprehension of space-time fusion rules, enlightening the Dao of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Space-Time was a realm that could only be touched at the thirteenth level. At this level, I am space-time, and space-time is me.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Emperor Xuanhuang had already reached the limit of the ninth level in space-time accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Later, after obtaining the thirteenth-level weapon Tianxu Cauldron and observing its inner mysteries, he barely stepped into the half-step realm of space-time fusion rules.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had completely crossed over, rivaling time-based lifeforms in space-time comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Any dimensional realm has space-time; space-time is the foundation of all worlds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan kept observing the space-time threads in his field of vision, becoming more and more amazed.</p><p></p><p>Countless space-time threads formed a kind of balance. It was because of this balance that a stable environment was created, giving birth to countless lives.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Origin Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>At his current level, he could already sense a certain force penetrating endless dimensional realms, maintaining the basic operation of all worlds.</p><p></p><p>If any of the countless space-time threads made even a small mistake, it would trigger a disaster. But over long ages, without external interference, space-time remained extremely stable.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, there was a higher force at work.</p><p></p><p>This higher force was what the six Ancestors called the Supreme Origin Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even thirteenth-level time-based lifeforms were still contemplating this Dao.</p><p></p><p>"My life level is still too low."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed for a while, then shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could indeed perceive this force penetrating everything, but it was very vague.</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme Origin Dao is still far from me. With this energy, I'd be better off comprehending the Chaos Taiji Dao to the third level."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>Eight thousand years ago, he had entered the second level of the Chaos Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>Five thousand years ago, his comprehension of the Chaos Taiji Dao had reached the peak of the second level.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he was still stuck at the peak of the second level.</p><p></p><p>He was only half a step away from the perfect third level.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ethereal Supreme Origin Dao,</p><p></p><p>Enlightening the third level of the Chaos Taiji Dao was easier for Lin Yuan and would be more helpful.</p><p></p><p>The first Source World divided the path of Chaos Evolution Power into three levels.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the third level was the realm of perfection. In this Source World, without the support of an internal universe, one could rival cultivators from the Chaos Void, relying on a higher level of Chaos Evolution Power path.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Taiji Dao was incomparably stronger than other Chaos Power Evolution paths. Just the prerequisite for evolving it was the peak of the second level of Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Chaos Taiji Dao to the third level was also countless times more difficult than comprehending other Chaos Evolution Power paths to the third level.</p><p></p><p>Even Lin Yuan was temporarily stuck at this bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan's mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>He descended into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the boundless internal universe.</p><p></p><p>Now his internal universe was equivalent to the size of over ten thousand Void Domains.</p><p></p><p>Vast and endless.</p><p></p><p>"'Infinite Void' Sixth Layer"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Six thousand years ago, he had completed the fifth layer of this inheritance and entered the sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>The sixth layer was also the upper limit of this inheritance. As for the seventh layer? Even the time-based lifeform who created the inheritance hadn't achieved it; it was only a theoretical realm.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Infinite Void' I'm cultivating has already deviated from the original inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The ultimate goal of the original 'Infinite Void' was the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>But now the ultimate goal of Lin Yuan's internal universe was the legendary Perfect World.</p><p></p><p>For this, Lin Yuan had absorbed the perfections and advantages of the Chaos Void, the First Source World, and the Second Source World, finally resulting in his current internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the upper limit of my current internal universe is not the seventh layer, but the eighth, ninth, or even tenth layer."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. After completing the sixth layer, the 'Infinite Void' inheritance no longer had much guiding use for him. The path ahead needed to be pioneered and created by himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the path that every powerful being must walk. Lin Yuan's martial evolution path was also like this.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also somewhat unsure.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years ago, he already had little concept of his own strength, because even a regular invincible great saint of the Chaos Void couldn't withstand a single strike from him. And after ten thousand years of cultivation, Lin Yuan had once again undergone qualitative changes in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Welcoming a qualitative improvement, the sixth level of "Infinite Void", the second level of the Chaos Taiji Way, and so on.</p><p></p><p>An improvement in any aspect would cause Lin Yuan's strength to surge greatly. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention when stacked together.</p><p></p><p>"The stronger the accumulated foundation, the greater the improvement when breaking through to the thirteenth level," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When breaking through from the eleventh to the twelfth level, one would receive an infusion from the origin of the Chaos Void. </p><p></p><p>How much infusion depends on the accumulated foundation of life itself.</p><p></p><p>The same is true for breaking through from the twelfth to the thirteenth level, so whenever the Chaos Void gives birth to a time life, it triggers phenomena affecting thousands of void domains.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if the origin of the Chaos Void will be able to bear the infusion for me at that time?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts spread out.</p><p></p><p>With his current accumulated foundation, if he successfully enters the thirteenth level, the origin he could bear, without saying it would empty the Chaos Void, would probably be equivalent to the sum of dozens or hundreds of other time lives bearing the origin.</p><p></p><p>Maybe even more than that.</p><p></p><p>At that time, could the Chaos Void really fill him up? The Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan drifted along with the chaos qi, arriving at a desolate void.</p><p></p><p>"It's right here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed for a moment, then raised his hand and made a slash.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, time and space were separated, and a posterior universe was forming magnificently.</p><p></p><p>A posterior universe, unlike an internal universe, is opened up by a supreme saint and is independent of the saint himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if the supreme saint perishes, the posterior universe will not collapse.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a posterior universe cannot achieve what an internal universe can - as long as the cultivator does not die, it can continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>Posterior universes, like naturally born universes, will have a day of collapse, and the collapse of a posterior universe is complete collapse, unable to be reborn after a great destruction like naturally born universes.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Universe opened up by His Majesty the Xuan Emperor was like this. After tens of millions of cosmic cycles, it was approaching collapse, and finally emerged due to the destruction of time and space at the edges.</p><p></p><p>"Opening up a posterior universe and experiencing a creation is also a way to sort out one's understanding of rules and the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the posterior universe gradually took shape, various rules and ways began to operate, and he began to formulate the rule environment he wanted.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, this posterior universe can also serve as the old nest for the human civilization group."</p><p></p><p>"Even if extreme circumstances occur and I fall deep into the time loop, it won't be immediately destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was thinking far ahead. Now for him, some things needed to be prepared.</p><p></p><p>For example, preparing a backup retreat for the human civilization group? While Lin Yuan was still around, no force in the Chaos Void would dare to provoke the human civilization group.</p><p></p><p>But what if he fell deep into the time loop?</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang lineage and the Magic Jade Tower lineage were both precedents.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan naturally had to prepare more.</p><p></p><p>After all, his rise was too fast.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization group simply couldn't keep up with him.</p><p></p><p>Until now, not even a single Chaos Realm being had been born.</p><p></p><p>"With my methods, there's no need to make arrangements in those naturally born universes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the posterior universe that was already more than half formed.</p><p></p><p>Even for an invincible supreme saint, the posterior universe they open up will eventually have a day of collapse.</p><p></p><p>So those saints would normally make some arrangements in naturally born universes to ensure their own inheritance would not be extinguished with the collapse of the posterior universe.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Xuanhuang Secret Realm in the home universe, and that wooden house of the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>Naturally born universes are protected by the Chaos Void, can be said to be absolutely safe, and will constantly be reborn, making them the ideal place to ensure the continuous inheritance of forces.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan didn't need to go to such trouble.</p><p></p><p>Because with Lin Yuan's current mastery and application of time and space, the posterior universe he opened up basically would not have a day of collapse, and could coexist with the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>With the posterior universe not collapsing, human civilization would have an absolutely safe old nest. Just add some restrictive measures, and it could basically ensure that human civilization would be passed down from generation to generation.</p><p></p><p>As for if the Chaos Void were to be destroyed?</p><p></p><p>If that day really came, time lives would be forced to enter the dimensional cracks, and all life inside would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>And these backup arrangements were all Lin Yuan's worst-case scenario, made in case he couldn't break through the time loop.</p><p></p><p>In fact, according to the timeline observed by the six ancestors of the first source world, Lin Yuan's hope of successfully crossing into the thirteenth level was still very high.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years had passed, and the six ancestors had basically put down everything, constantly observing more future timelines of Lin Yuan, and never had any timeline where he fell deep into the time loop.</p><p></p><p>Milky Way Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan and other supreme beings came to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>Now the human civilization group, after Lin Yuan, had given birth to more than twenty Path-breaking Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>However, these twenty-plus Path-breaking Realm beings naturally couldn't compare in status to the nine supreme beings like Supreme Being Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>Now the cultivation environment of human civilization was too favorable. During the home universe period, the human civilization group fought with the myriad races, and only in the bloody rain did one supreme being after another emerge.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, what did you call us for?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Since the human civilization group entered the Chaos Void, Lin Yuan, this pillar of the group, had hardly managed any affairs.</p><p></p><p>Now specifically calling them all over, it was obviously not a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"I have opened up thirty-three posterior universes, scattered throughout the Chaos Void. You select some evolvers to send in."</p><p></p><p>"These thirty-three posterior universes are to be kept secret from outsiders, don't let it spread, and the evolvers sent in should be selected from the first and second levels as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-three posterior universes were the old nest Lin Yuan prepared for human civilization, and also the final foundation.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-three posterior universes, according to the rules set by Lin Yuan, would only allow exit and not entry after he challenged the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>Not only could they not be entered, even evolvers of human civilization would not be able to lock onto the specific location coordinates of the thirty-three posterior universes. They would merge into the deepest part of the Chaos Void, and even invincible supreme saints would not be able to approach.</p><p></p><p>Posterior universes that can only exit and not enter, and do not have a great destruction, will provide a constant supply of fresh blood for the human civilization group outside.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy, what are you...?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan vaguely sensed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Specifically opening up thirty-three posterior universes, and not letting it spread to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>No matter how you look at it, it had a flavor of making final arrangements.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings also looked at Lin Yuan with slight worry.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they vaguely guessed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>What could make Galaxy Supreme Saint, who shook the Chaos Void, make such arrangements? It could only be that matter -</p><p></p><p>Challenging the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was calm as he swept his gaze over the supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>These supreme beings had all come out of their home universe, and had watched Lin Yuan grow from weakness to his current invincibility. Besides awe, they also had emotional attachment.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan also comforted them a little: "It's just preparation based on the worst outcome."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

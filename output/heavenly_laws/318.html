        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 318: Me, Hiding? (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Continue expanding the space layers," Lin Yuan's thoughts focused. </p><p></p><p>Actually, as early as when he had expanded to millions of space layers, Lin Yuan could have attempted to break through to the tenth stage. </p><p></p><p>According to the experience of countless ninth stage cultivators in the main world breaking through to the tenth stage, millions of space layers satisfied the threshold for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was unwilling to give up this greatest opportunity from his world-traversing journey. </p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the tenth stage, the world within his body would continue to metamorphose and begin to "solidify" to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>At that time, wanting to expand space layers like in the ninth stage would not be so easy.</p><p></p><p>Rather than doing that, it would be better to expand as many space layers as possible while in the ninth stage.</p><p></p><p>Why did that peak ninth stage life form from the Feather Race, Hunyi, expand over thirty million space layers yet still refuse to break through to the tenth stage? </p><p></p><p>Was he stupid?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>Space layers represent the thickness and depth of a world, an even more profound essence beyond just the visible size.</p><p></p><p>The more space layers expanded in the ninth stage, the greater the help it would provide for stepping into the tenth stage, and even the eleventh stage after the world within transforms into a inner universe.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan was currently frantically expanding space layers, although it couldn't be said that there wouldn't be other opportunities later.</p><p></p><p>But he had to seize this chance.</p><p></p><p>Additionally,</p><p></p><p>Another reason Lin Yuan did not attempt to break through to the tenth stage was the Yellow Yin Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yellow Yin Secret Realm did not allow cultivators of the tenth stage or above to enter - this was a rule since the opening of the Yellow Yin Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even supreme experts could not forcibly enter. Lin Yuan was worried that if he broke through to the tenth stage while traversing worlds, the metamorphosis of his spiritual will's essence would be detected as an anomaly by the Yellow Yin Secret Realm, causing him to be "expelled."</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>This possibility was not very high.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's will descending here was separate from his main body, so even if he truly broke through to the tenth stage, it would have no relation.</p><p></p><p>For Lin Yuan, the descent of his will also served the purpose of "trial and error."</p><p></p><p>But to be safe, considering various factors, Lin Yuan would focus on expanding space layers for now.</p><p></p><p>With his current accumulation, whenever he wanted to break through to the tenth stage, he could do so. There was no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Those peak ninth stage experts who had just expanded to millions of space layers were eager to attempt the tenth stage breakthrough because their longevity was nearing its limit.</p><p></p><p>They had no other choice but to do so.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's longevity was still quite abundant, so there was no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>"The Yellow Yin Secret Realm..." Lin Yuan once again passed through the Myriad Realms Gate, sensing the situation over at the Sun Primordial Spirit's side.</p><p></p><p>"Xio Lan's aura has already weakened by nearly a quarter," Lin Yuan kept count in his heart, knowing Xio Lan could persist for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could foresee that by the end of this traversal, with his current strength, he should be able to sweep through all the ninth stage experts in the Yellow Yin Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the myriad resources within the secret realm would be his to take or leave.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lin Yuan did not need to fully experience this traversal journey. If he went back now, he could also sweep through the entire Yellow Yin Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Ocean of Light,</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of True Gods sat in a spacious palace hall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's two primordial spirits had long kidnapped a large number of Demigods, thoroughly enraging the gods of the Ocean of Light. Coupled with the large number of divine crystals plundered three hundred years ago, old grievances and new resentments made the gods furious.</p><p></p><p>"My most devout believer, the seventh-level Demigod Yinmosi, has mysteriously disappeared for over two hundred years. I can sense he is still alive, but I don't know where he is," said a True God with a single horn, scanning the surrounding gods.</p><p></p><p>"My two Demigod believers are the same," said another True God with white wings.</p><p></p><p>"My believer too."</p><p></p><p>"Blocked from our perception, could they have fallen into other divine nations?"</p><p></p><p>"Was it done by those dark abyss gods?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the dark abyss also has primordial gods restraining them, they wouldn't do such a thing."</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of True Gods discussed, eventually concluding that their believers were likely in other divine nations. Otherwise, it would be impossible to block the gods' perception of their believers.</p><p></p><p>But these divine nations might not belong to living gods. In the distant past, the shattered divine nations of fallen gods also had similar abilities.</p><p></p><p>"So someone kidnapped our Demigod believers and hid them within a shattered divine nation?"</p><p></p><p>"What is their motive? And why not just kill them directly?"</p><p></p><p>The True Gods were puzzled. Although this conclusion was inconceivable, other than this possibility, there was no way to explain what they had experienced.</p><p></p><p>"There is a group of powerful Demigods in the mortal realm who luckily obtained divine destiny and gained a shattered divine nation. However, they began targeting our churches' Demigods, kidnapping them one by one for some purpose and placing them in that shattered divine nation."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a True God speculated on the cause and process of the events.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still many unexplained things in between, at least the origins of the matter were clarified.</p><p></p><p>"So what should we do now? Where exactly are our Demigod believers, and who is the culprit behind all this? Are there any clues?"</p><p></p><p>A True God voiced his doubts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True God seated in the highest position spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was a Primordial God, the highest-ranking deity below the Primordial Gods, and surveyed the gods in the hall before saying slowly, "I have already sent the auras of your believers to the God of Divination over a hundred years ago, to have him deduce their final location."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the gods in the hall felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination was one of the twelve Primordial Gods of the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination possessed a very special ability - that of foresight and divination.</p><p></p><p>The God of Divination could commune with the heavens and earth, observing the changes and evolution of all things in the world from a unique perspective.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, as long as the God of Divination was willing to pay the price, he could know anything in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, to request the God of Divination's assistance also required paying an immense price. If it were not for the severe loss of their Demigod-level believers, this Primordial God would not have sought out the God of Divination.</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination told me he will provide the results during this period," the Primordial God seated in the highest position said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"Then we shall wait."</p><p></p><p>"We will also bear some of the cost of requesting the God of Divination's assistance."</p><p></p><p>The gods looked at each other and spoke up one by one.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Primordial God's expression improved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Time passed slowly, and several months went by in a blink.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the expression of the Primordial God seated in the highest position changed.</p><p></p><p>The other True Gods noticed and turned their gazes towards him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, that Primordial God's expression gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked towards the gods and said slowly, "The God of Divination has provided the results."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the God of Divination."</p><p></p><p>"So where did our Demigod believers disappear to in the end?"</p><p></p><p>The gods looked at the Primordial God with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"The God of Divination..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The god said, "The place where the last breath of all believers disappears is located in the Dragon Mountain Ridge area of the Sran Empire on the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations."</p><p></p><p>This senior god spoke directly. </p><p></p><p>"The Sran Empire, that is the territory of the chief god of order."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Ridge? I remember now, the lord of Dragon Mountain Ridge has decent natural talents and gifts. It's speculated in the outside world that he may have obtained divine connections."</p><p></p><p>"Divine connections? I understand now, the mastermind behind the abduction of us demigod-level believers must be this lord of Dragon Mountain Ridge. This matches our previous speculation that all believers are being hidden in some dilapidated divine nation."</p><p></p><p>"The lord of Dragon Mountain Ridge, the patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan, a demigod under 500 years old, he deserves to die. How dare he take action against us in secret."  </p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the divination god, we would still be kept in the dark. This patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan deserves to die."</p><p></p><p>The gods spoke indignantly, but did not act rashly. After all, Dragon Mountain Ridge was located within the sphere of influence of the Order Church, which was the church of the chief god of order. </p><p></p><p>Before clarifying whether this matter was related to the chief god of order, and whether the chief god was aware of it, no matter how angry these true gods were, they had to remain rational.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"We will descend our divine power incarnations ourselves and go to Dragon Mountain Ridge to see if the great chief god of order will manage this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the great chief god of order advocates order, while the actions of the patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan are equivalent to creating chaos. I don't believe the chief god of order knows about this."</p><p></p><p>The gods looked at each other and immediately made a decision. The twelve chief gods of the Ocean of Light were supremely exalted, especially the chief god of order. At the level of the chief god of order, how could he possibly look upon those demigods in the mortal realm?</p><p></p><p>This matter was probably done by the patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan himself, and had nothing to do with the chief god of order.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, the people of the Dragon Mountain clan were still on the territory of the Order Church, so even if they were in the right, they had to give a heads up.</p><p></p><p>"I have had contact with the Pope of the Order Church in the Sran Empire. Let me first inquire if he knows about this matter." One of the true gods spoke up and immediately sent out a strand of divine power to make contact.</p><p></p><p>Any Pope of a true god's church has an extremely special connection with the true god itself, even being a direct descendant.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of the Order Church, a major divine church, was directly the will vessel of one of the subordinate divine spirits of the chief god of order.</p><p></p><p>Although subordinate divine spirits lack free will, they are still divine spirits existing in the Ocean of Light. It was perfectly normal for the true gods present to have had contact with them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go now."</p><p></p><p>"To Dragon Mountain Ridge to demand an explanation."</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of true gods in the great hall descended their divine power incarnations from their respective churches and marched imposingly towards Dragon Mountain Ridge in the Sran Empire.</p><p></p><p>Sran Empire. </p><p></p><p>Order Church.</p><p></p><p>The Pope suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan is the culprit behind the abduction of many demigod-level experts from various churches in recent centuries?"</p><p></p><p>"Now a large number of true gods have descended their divine power incarnations and are rushing over here?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order frowned. His true form was a divine spirit in the Ocean of Light, managing the church in the mortal realm under the orders of the chief god of order.</p><p></p><p>The task given to him by the chief god of order, besides managing the church well, was to seek out demigods with sufficient potential to be guided to the Ocean of Light and become subordinate divine spirits of the chief gods.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Pope's most promising candidate was the patriarch of the Dragon Mountain clan.</p><p></p><p>The other party was young, had immense potential, and on top of that had no interest in faith, which made the Pope want to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>And over the years, the Pope had been working towards this goal.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>"So many true gods, brazenly descending their divine power incarnations without regard for face. This is outrageous!" The Pope immediately stood up and rushed towards Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>He was also a bit uneasy in his heart. Those true gods dared to make such a huge commotion, so they must have grasped some evidence. If this matter blew up, it would definitely not bode well for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The chief god of order valued order above all else, and order included both rewards and punishments.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan really was the culprit behind the disappearance of so many demigod-level experts from various churches over the past few centuries, and the chief god of order found out, he would undoubtedly handle it by the rules and show no favoritism.</p><p></p><p>Cold and impartial - that was an apt description of the chief god of order.</p><p></p><p>"I absolutely cannot let Lin Yuan meet those divine spirits." The Pope decided to protect Lin Yuan for now.</p><p></p><p>As long as the two sides did not meet face-to-face or confront each other directly, there was still room for the matter to be defused. At that time, it would also be easier to explain things to the chief god.</p><p></p><p>Swish.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Pope arrived at Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>"See the patriarch?" Dragon Mountain Ling and a few others immediately came forward to welcome him. They also recognized the Pope and knew his status and position, so they dared not show the slightest disrespect.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Mountain patriarch may be related to the disappearance of demigods over the past few centuries. Now a large number of true gods have descended their divine power incarnations and are coming to Dragon Mountain Ridge to demand answers from the patriarch."</p><p></p><p>The Pope briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, there must be some misunderstanding here."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling and the others trembled in their hearts. Hundreds of true gods descending divine power incarnations? Those were the divine power incarnations of true gods. Even a slight leak of aura would be enough to flatten Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling and the others also quickly realized that the reason those true gods were willing to come and demand answers was probably out of respect for the Order Church.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the overbearing nature of true gods, they would have simply taken action to wipe out Dragon Mountain Ridge instead of asking about any crimes.</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing now is to bring the Dragon Mountain patriarch to my church and have him lie low before those true gods arrive."</p><p></p><p>The Pope said quickly.</p><p></p><p>The true gods dared to come to Dragon Mountain Ridge and demand answers with a show of force,</p><p>but they absolutely would not dare to do so in front of the Order Church.</p><p>That was the majesty of the chief god of order.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"We'll seek refuge in the church."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling and the others also immediately found their main focus.</p><p></p><p>They immediately led the Pope and the others into the Dragon Mountain Palace and came to the door of the cultivation room.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, a major incident has occurred." Dragon Mountain Ling promptly activated the communication method, wanting to contact Lin Yuan who was in secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the cultivation room, Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The door opened.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling quickly explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, you should hurry to the church and lie low for now." Dragon Mountain Ling said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much she revered her own clan patriarch, she didn't think Lin Yuan could survive against the divine power incarnations of hundreds of true gods.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the life-or-death crisis of the pillar upholding the Dragon Mountain clan, how could Dragon Mountain Ling not be anxious? How could she not panic?</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Patriarch, as long as you take refuge in the church, I guarantee those divine spirits will not dare to act rashly," the Pope also hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Take refuge?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was calm and distant as he walked out of the Dragon Mountain Palace and looked towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, an aura of terrifying majesty began rapidly approaching from the distance, like a vast heavenly force descending.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, his sleeve fluttering, and lightly scooped towards the front. When he pulled his hand back, his palm had somehow gained hundreds of "particle" figures.</p><p></p><p>"Need to take refuge?"</p>

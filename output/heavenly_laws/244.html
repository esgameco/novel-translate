            <p>Chapter 244: The Gray Gourd (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>This man and woman had an overwhelming aura, both being Eighth Stage Evolvers.</p><p></p><p>The man was tall and had sky-blue pupils, clearly possessing an extraordinary bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The woman wore a light white robe, had a profound temperament, and faint silver patterns could be seen on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"This planet was originally a strategic planet of the Shadow Clan, used to remotely control this star domain. But now, it has become the main planet of our human civilization," the man exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, it's the main planet of the Milky Way Star Domain. That Milky Way Star Lord is extremely wealthy and directly carried out a B-grade transformation on this planet," the woman said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was a well-known fact that the Milky Way Star Lord was extremely wealthy, as 100,000 Universe Crystals was no small sum, even Eighth Stage peak Evolvers couldn't gather that much.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan wasn't a top-tier genius of human civilization, an Eighth Stage Evolver under a hundred years old, he wouldn't have been able to gather over 100,000 Universe Crystals even if he held an Eighth Stage celebration.</p><p></p><p>Those major forces and independent Evolvers weren't fools.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was just an ordinary Evolver, they probably wouldn't even celebrate, let alone go all out on congratulatory gifts just to give face to the Scarlet Roc Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>"This Milky Way Star Lord is indeed extraordinary, not only extremely wealthy but also possessing astonishing strength. Shortly after taking office, he cleansed the star domain of special lifeforms and independent alien Evolvers. The fresh blood of Eighth Stage aliens on his hands is at least six or seven heads," the male Evolver said with some hesitation on his face, "I don't know if he would allow us to follow him."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this Milky Way Star Lord is very young, not even a hundred years old yet. The two of us want to take the initiative to follow him," the male Evolver expressed his true thoughts.</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe and myriad races, it was normal for the weak to follow the strong.</p><p></p><p>But the two of them were already tens of thousands of years old, following a "little kid" not even a hundred?</p><p></p><p>In the Human Civilization Alliance, or even other races, once one decided to follow someone, they would be completely tied to that person.</p><p></p><p>No matter what happened in the future, this connection could not be severed.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Ran, you care too much about face and miss the opportunity," the female Evolver beside him shook her head slightly and said, "The Milky Way Star Lord is too young now, which is the perfect time for us to follow him. Otherwise, with the Milky Way Star Lord's cultivation speed, when he reaches a few thousand or tens of thousands of years old, invincible at the Eighth Stage? Or even a Ninth Stage Evolver, if we try to follow him then, he probably won't accept."</p><p></p><p>"While others are still hesitating, if we take the lead in following him now, even if we don't get any benefits, our status will at least be higher than those who follow later," the female Evolver considered comprehensively. </p><p></p><p>Face? The weak have no face.</p><p></p><p>"You're right," the male Evolver nodded slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He also knew the difference between giving charcoal in snowy weather and adding flowers to brocade.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered giving charcoal in snowy weather.</p><p></p><p>"By becoming followers, we must obey the orders of the Milky Way Star Lord. Otherwise, even if the Milky Way Star Lord kills us, the three goddesses won't intervene," the male Evolver said.</p><p></p><p>"To gain something, you need to pay a price. There's no such thing as wanting benefits without taking risks," the female Evolver flew directly towards the Milky Way's main planet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the male Evolver immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly landed on the star platform of the Milky Way's main planet.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The planetary defense system of the Milky Way's main planet, transformed by B-grade, emitted vast fluctuations, enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>It could instantly suppress the vast majority of Eighth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"You two Eighth Stages, what brings you here?" A dark red-skinned alien flew out, cautiously sizing up the two.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Stage?"</p><p></p><p>The two Eighth Stage man and woman were startled. They originally thought they were the first batch of Eighth Stages to follow the Milky Way Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect other Eighth Stages had already followed, and this Eighth Stage was even an alien?</p><p></p><p>"We've long heard of the Milky Way Star Lord's great reputation and have come specifically to pay our respects," the Eighth Stage woman immediately explained their intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Visit the Star Lord? You two?" The red-skinned alien thought for a moment and said, "I'll ask the Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Visiting the Star Lord required his consent. The red-skinned alien couldn't make the decision.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the red-skinned alien looked at the two and nodded, "The Star Lord has agreed. Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the man and woman entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, wearing green Eighth Stage armor, was sitting cross-legged, comprehending a spatial law model. Only when the two entered did he slowly open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was like the rising of the sun.</p><p></p><p>The man Lu Ran and woman immediately said with utmost respect, "Greetings, Milky Way Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Ran, Ruan Wei." Lin Yuan spoke calmly. All the Eighth Stage Evolvers of the Human Civilization Alliance were registered, and with Lin Yuan's memory, he naturally remembered clearly.</p><p></p><p>This man and woman before him had entered the Eighth Stage for several thousand years. After completing their "duty" of guarding a star domain, they voluntarily resigned and then traveled the universe.</p><p></p><p>Guarding a star domain and becoming a Star Lord was a "cushy job," but it was also like being imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>The Star Lord had to be stationed in the star domain, or must have a clone or true body stationed there.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't leave. For some Evolvers, this was hard to accept, so they wouldn't always serve as Star Lords.</p><p></p><p>"We heard that the Milky Way Star Lord single-handedly cleared the star domain of all restless aliens, and our hearts were filled with admiration, so we came specifically to follow you," the female Evolver Ruan Wei said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me?" Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>His teacher, the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, also had many followers.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?" Lin Yuan asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Once they decided to follow, Lin Yuan would hold the power of life and death over them, and even the three goddesses couldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, followers must have a request.</p><p></p><p>Back when the Black Prison Clan's Black Prison Mo followed the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, his request was to establish a clan inheritance.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Black Prison Clan later became illustrious in the Scarlet Roc Star Domain for a time.</p><p></p><p>"After entering the Eighth Stage, we deeply felt the difficulty of cultivation. So in the future, if the Star Lord can enter the Ninth Stage, just giving us some guidance would suffice," Lu Ran said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Although the virtual world of human civilization had some cultivation experiences of Ninth Stage Evolvers, those were their own experiences and weren't of much help to them.</p><p></p><p>But how difficult was it to get personal guidance from a Ninth Stage Evolver?</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan agreed after only a moment's thought.</p><p></p><p>He had just taken over the Milky Way Star Domain and urgently needed many subordinates. Two Eighth Stage Evolvers could save him a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lu Ran and Ruan Wei had clean backgrounds and were both human Evolvers, so they were barely trustworthy. That's why Lin Yuan directly agreed to accept them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Lu Ran and Ruan Wei felt relieved upon hearing those words.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought that joining the Galaxy Star Lord's subordinates wouldn't be an issue, but when they met Lin Yuan, they realized they had underestimated this Galaxy Star Lord. His understanding of the rules far exceeded their imagination. Just by sitting there, the gaze he directed at them made their hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>So the two of them began to doubt themselves again, until Lin Yuan nodded in agreement, and they finally put their minds at ease.</p><p></p><p>"You two stay on the main star for now. If there's anything that needs to be done in the future, you'll go do it. I won't let you work for nothing," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when it came to followers, it was entirely possible to exploit them as much as possible, but Lin Yuan was unwilling to do so.</p><p></p><p>As long as a star domain developed well, it could generate a large amount of profit. Lin Yuan was willing to share some of it.</p><p></p><p>Chi Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Thirteen Mountain Peaks.</p><p></p><p>The Solar Yuan Spirit sat cross-legged deep within the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan comprehended the Solar Rules, the aura of the Solar Yuan Spirit also surged.</p><p></p><p>The Lunar Yuan Spirit was originally condensed by Lin Yuan based on the power of the sun, closely related to the Solar Rules. Comprehending the Solar Rules would obviously lead to the advancement of the Solar Yuan Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..." A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face as the Flame World within his body began to expand wildly, reaching a size of 400,000 li in diameter, reaching the normal level of an Eighth Stage Peak Evolutionist's inner world.</p><p></p><p>"Not inferior to an ordinary Eighth Stage Peak." Lin Yuan's Yang Spirit examined himself.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the complete Solar Rules meant reaching the Eighth Stage Peak for the Solar Yuan Spirit, as the Solar Yuan Spirit did not follow the martial arts cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm at the Eighth Stage Peak, if I comprehend the Lunar Rules and the Lunar Yuan Spirit also reaches the Eighth Stage Peak, when the two of us combine to form the Taiji Yuan Spirit, what level of power will it be?" Lin Yuan's Yang Spirit had some expectations in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Lunar and Solar Yuan Spirits condensed by Lin Yuan's martial arts evolution path were divided from the Taiji Yuan Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The two could also be combined.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after the fusion of the Solar Yuan Spirit and Lunar Yuan Spirit, their strength would skyrocket, not inferior to the original body.</p><p></p><p>At the Seventh Stage, if the Lunar Yuan Spirit and Solar Yuan Spirit fused, they could even forcibly open up a second Taiji Small World.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of the Lunar Yuan Spirit... Now I can completely go to the medium-sized alien battlefield, right?" Lin Yuan's Yang Spirit thought.</p><p></p><p>The permanent spatial rifts on the medium-sized alien battlefields were much larger than those on the small-sized alien battlefields.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that being in a permanent spatial rift of that size might lead to an even greater increase in the accumulation of Boundary-Breaking Source Power.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lin Yuan was at the Seventh Stage, the Goddess of Wisdom did not recommend him to go to the medium-sized alien battlefields, not even with an avatar.</p><p></p><p>Avatars were not invincible. Some Eighth Stage Invincible and Ninth Stage Evolutionists had means to deal with avatars.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was the unparalleled genius of human civilization and the founder of the martial arts evolution path. The Goddess of Wisdom naturally prioritized Lin Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yuan had entered the Eighth Stage, going to the medium-sized alien battlefields shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, on the medium-sized alien battlefields, the strongest were Eighth Stage Invincibles, with a small probability of traces of Ninth Stage powerhouses appearing.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's Yuan Spirit concealed its identity and mixed in, even if extreme situations occurred, he could just abandon the Yuan Spirit at most.</p><p></p><p>Although the medium-sized alien battlefields were far more dangerous than the peripheral Galaxy Star Domains, Lin Yuan wasn't going there to reveal his identity. Who would know he was the unparalleled genius of human civilization if he concealed his identity?</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom..." Lin Yuan immediately applied to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Any human evolutionist going to the alien battlefields needed to apply to the three goddesses, otherwise they would not be able to obtain a battlefield pass, equivalent to being an illegal resident, and would be jointly attacked by humans and aliens.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Level 7 Citizen Lin Yuan, your application has been approved," the solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, it was approved." </p><p></p><p>With his strength reaching the Eighth Stage and concealing his identity, going to the medium-sized alien battlefields shouldn't pose any risks. This could be seen from the Goddess of Wisdom approving the application.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the God-Suppressing Bead bestowed by the supreme powerhouse Xia Qin, it was even more foolproof.</p><p></p><p>Although the God-Suppressing Bead was on the original body, if the avatar was subjected to memory pollution and other means that affected the original body, the God-Suppressing Bead could still be activated, allowing both the original body and avatar to temporarily break free from the influence and fully control the avatar to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Small-sized Alien Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Lunar Yuan Spirit left the permanent spatial rift and exited the battlefield, heading towards the selected medium-sized alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the most economical way to use Boundary-Breaking Source Power was for the Lunar Yuan Spirit to remain still while the Yang Spirit went to the selected medium-sized alien battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Once the Yang Spirit arrived, the Yin Spirit would then leave and return to the Chi Kun Main Star.</p><p></p><p>However, doing so would risk exposing both the Yang Spirit and Yin Spirit in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan would rather waste some Boundary-Breaking Source Power than allow himself to take even the slightest risk.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finished his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the scenes on the main star.</p><p></p><p>"Developing quite well." Lin Yuan nodded slightly. Under the management of the four Eighth Stage subordinates and two Seventh Stage subordinates, the Galaxy Main Star was thriving. Large business associations and other forces from nearby star domains had begun to settle in.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue taking inventory." Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly as he began to investigate the spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>Hunting down those special lifeforms and alien lone wanderers had made Lin Yuan extremely wealthy, especially the two special lifeforms "Shang Shan" and "Ao Du," who contributed nearly 100,000 cubic universe crystals in income.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the other special lifeforms and alien lone wanderers also brought Lin Yuan a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>After collecting the treasures that could be recognized into a unified spatial bracelet, Lin Yuan began to sort through the remaining miscellaneous items.</p><p></p><p>As special lifeforms and alien lone wanderers who had lived for long ages, they occasionally obtained treasures they didn't recognize and would collect them.</p><p></p><p>Now they had all fallen into Lin Yuan's hands. Those treasures of unknown origin and unknown use were piled up like a mountain range.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take a slow look." Lin Yuan had a very simple method for dealing with these miscellaneous items of unknown origin and unknown use - crushing them.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of Lin Yuan's mind, hundreds of miscellaneous items suddenly began to deform and turn into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan was about to shift his gaze when he seemed to discover something. His eyes fell on the powder.</p><p></p><p>There, a gray gourd was falling along with the powder.</p><p></p><p>"This gourd blocked my strike?" A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what use this gourd had, at least its material was not bad and could be worth a few cubic universe crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if there's anything different." Lin Yuan grasped the gourd and exerted a bit of force, only to find it still unmoved. His expression gradually changed.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even just exerting a bit of force could cause the tectonic plates of a planet to tear apart and enter a period of mass extinction.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan's consciousness reached out and came into contact with the gray gourd. His expression changed slightly.</p>

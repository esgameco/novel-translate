        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 476 Temporal-Spatial Guidance (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>For the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm, whether it's the Immortal Realm or the Abyss Realm, there are basically no secrets.</p><p></p><p>Locking onto a certain life, no matter where the other party is located.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's in the very source of the Immortal Realm, they still cannot escape.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm wanted to lock onto Lin Yuan's specific location.</p><p></p><p>But found that he was unable to determine the other party's coordinates.</p><p></p><p>This made the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm feel distressed and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a person appeared in front of you.</p><p></p><p>You can see him, but you cannot touch him.</p><p></p><p>The higher the level of the powerful beings, the more confused they become when facing such a situation.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The expression on the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm's face became solemn. His consciousness, which had only just revived by half, now began to continue reviving.</p><p></p><p>If at the beginning, he was only quite curious as to why the Demon Monarch, whom he regarded as his children, had died and fallen. </p><p></p><p>Intending to find the perpetrator, kill them for revenge, and then continue to fall into slumber.</p><p></p><p>That's all there was to it.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm has become thoroughly interested.</p><p></p><p>"Cause and effect"</p><p></p><p>Countless lines of cause and effect appeared before the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>As an existence at the Dao Ancestor level, the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm's understanding of the rules of cause and effect was naturally extremely deep.</p><p></p><p>Although he had never met Lin Yuan directly, the latter had killed six Demon Monarchs and countless demons.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarchs and demons were a part of the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm, especially the Demon Monarchs, who had a close relationship similar to the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm's offspring and incarnations.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's killing of the Demon Monarchs was equivalent to establishing a direct causal connection with the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this causal connection, the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm could easily lock onto Lin Yuan's accurate location.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm's lines of cause and effect were extremely numerous, connecting the Immortal Realm and various parts of the Abyss Realm, and even some lines extending beyond the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm immediately found the line related to Lin Yuan and followed it back.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Still unable to sense it?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the line of cause and effect proved that the other party had not died.</p><p></p><p>But despite not having died, he was unable to lock onto the location range through the line of cause and effect.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm consecutively used dozens of methods to try to lock onto Lin Yuan's coordinates, but all were in vain.</p><p></p><p>Even though he clearly knew that Lin Yuan was still alive and in the Immortal Realm, in the Xuantian Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm still felt as if it was a flower in the mirror, a moon in the water.</p><p></p><p>"It's the temporal-spatial, a deeper level of temporal-spatial."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm sat on the throne, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Through multiple attempts at probing, the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm came to the conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The existence that killed the Demon Monarchs was truly in an extremely deep temporal-spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself was unable to forcibly peek and lock onto it.</p><p></p><p>"To go to such a deep temporal-spatial realm, one's understanding of temporal-spatial must reach a certain height, at least surpassing mine."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm silently thought to himself. He was already at the Dao Ancestor level, so a temporal-spatial understanding that surpassed him? Could it be that another Dao Ancestor had been born in the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible? The celestial anomalies triggered by the ascension to the Dao Ancestor level could not be concealed, and currently in the Immortal Realm and Abyss Realm, it was basically impossible for any life to have crossed into the Dao Ancestor level.</p><p></p><p>"Not a Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm was very certain about this in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened during the time I was in slumber?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm silently wondered. Although he was certain that the perpetrator was not a Dao Ancestor, since he was unable to lock onto their location, it was equivalent to being unable to harm them.</p><p></p><p>"Come back, all of you."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Abyss Realm could not grasp Lin Yuan, but since he had taken action against the Demon Monarchs, he must not be very fond of the demons in the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>So the first thing the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm did was to summon back all the countless demons and Demon Monarchs that had invaded the Immortal Realm and were rampaging.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Immortal-Demon War was just a game for the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm. Even if those demons and Demon Monarchs devoured more immortals, it would not be of any help to him, the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>Four powerful Demon Monarchs coldly overlooked the vast immortal city below, which was already on the verge of collapse under the attack of countless demons.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City's Lord and many top-tier Jade Immortals fought to the death to resist, but it was to no avail. In the face of absolute power, any resistance and struggle was futile.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>"Delicious food."</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Monarchs greedily gazed at the immortal city below.</p><p></p><p>Devouring immortals and devouring their own kind of demons were completely different experiences, and the benefits to themselves were also different.</p><p></p><p>Just thenâ€”</p><p></p><p>"Come back, all of you."</p><p></p><p>A deep voice sounded in the minds of the four Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Heavenly Father, the Heavenly Father is calling us back?"</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Monarchs were greatly shocked. They regarded the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm as their "Heavenly Father" since they originated from him.</p><p></p><p>"Go back."</p><p></p><p>"If the Heavenly Father tells us to go back, there must be something important."</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Monarchs reluctantly looked at the immortal city below, they were just about to devour the delicious food.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm's order, no Demon Monarch dared to disobey it, for it was an instinct deeply imprinted in their consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Monarchs voluntarily retreated, and the countless demons also quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, the demons outside Canghai Immortal City had disappeared almost completely.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Canghai Immortal City originally thought that they were doomed.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had left some life-saving methods in other places, if he died at the hands of the Demon Monarchs, the terrifying spiritual-level pollution, those life-saving methods might not even be useful.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>All the Demon Monarchs had retreated?</p><p></p><p>"We, we survived!"</p><p></p><p>Inside Canghai Immortal City, countless immortals wept with joy. They never imagined that they would still be able to live. Those ferocious and ruthless demons had voluntarily retreated.</p><p></p><p>Qianzhen Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>It was still a scene of countless demons attacking the city.</p><p></p><p>The towering Demon Monarchs had almost opened their mouths, just waiting for the immortal city to be breached so they could devour the countless immortals inside.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Monarchs received the order from the Ancestor of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>They could only lead the countless demons to retreat and return to the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>Chuyu Immortal City, Shaohaos Immortal City, Tianluans Immortal City, the thirty-three Immortal Realms, countless demons were besieging the immortal cities under the leadership of the Demon Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time.</p><p></p><p>All the demons retreated, even if the besieged immortal cities were just a step away from being breached and the demons could enter, not a single Demon Monarch dared to cross the line.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did those demons all leave?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter why they left, at least we don't have to die."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, being devoured by demons is said to be extremely painful and will result in memory pollution."</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock and bewilderment, the many immortals all became greatly elated. To be able to live, who would want to die? Especially a cruel death of being devoured by demons.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the demons retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"Was it the Dao Ancestor? Did the Dao Ancestor intervene?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch should not have intervened.</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't the Patriarch, then who intervened?"</p><p></p><p>The city lord and other high-level figures of the Immortal City were relieved, but they also began to speculate on the reason for the retreat of the demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The most likely speculation was that the Patriarch had intervened, but even the disciples of the Patriarch's lineage were unaware of the details.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, if the Patriarch had truly intervened, his own disciples would have known about it.</p><p></p><p>Shuangwu Immortal City.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Grade-A Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>The city lord and other high-level figures were respectfully waiting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the news of the endless demonic beasts retreating from the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms reached the hands of the top-tier Jade Immortals.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Three Immortal Realms are vast and boundless. Even for powerful Jade Immortals, it would take tens of thousands or even millions of years to traverse all of them through spatial traversal.</p><p></p><p>However, the transmission of information is much simpler than direct travel. Through the connections of the laws of causality, the powerful Gold Immortals and Jade Immortals can achieve "real-time communication".</p><p></p><p>"All the demonic beasts have retreated?"</p><p></p><p>"They retreated on their own? Without any other powerful figures intervening?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did all the demonic beasts retreat on their own?"</p><p></p><p>The city lord and other high-level figures were filled with doubts.</p><p></p><p>The duration of the Immortal-Demon Wars is usually calculated in thousands or tens of thousands of years. Yet, this time, it had only been a few decades, and the war was far from over.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even when the Immortal-Demon Wars were nearing their end, the demonic beasts would retreat one by one, returning to the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it was as if they had received a unified order to withdraw from the Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Who could command the Demon Overlords?</p><p></p><p>The city lord and other high-level figures trembled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A name emerged in their minds simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Demon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss, who else could command the Demon Overlords in such a large-scale manner?</p><p></p><p>And why would the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss do this?</p><p></p><p>The city lord and the other high-level figures exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no clear evidence,</p><p></p><p>they instinctively felt that it was related to Lin Yuan's recent actions.</p><p></p><p>The timing of the demonic beasts' retreat was simply too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>They would not have retreated at this precise moment if it were not for Lin Yuan's intervention.</p><p></p><p>This made the top-tier Jade Immortals inevitably associate the events.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Demon Abyss"</p><p></p><p>The city lord's heart was filled with towering waves. If the speculation was true, it would mean that the existence they wanted to visit had the power to make the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss retreat.</p><p></p><p>Although the retreat of the endless demonic beasts from the Immortal Realms was not the same as the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss retreating, it at least showed that the Ancestor was wary of something.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation area.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was observing everything with the perspective of the Temporal Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Temporal Seventh Realm, the profound mysteries of the nature of time and space were fully revealed to Lin Yuan. The time and space of the Immortal Realms, the Demon Abyss, and even the spatial dimensions of this latitude, were all in constant rotation, forming a stable world that allows life to thrive.</p><p></p><p>Even the most ordinary stones, plants, and trees are influenced by the flow of time and space. If the time-space continuum were to collapse, these existences would also disappear.</p><p></p><p>The rotation of time and space, the coexistence of various rules, is what forms the stability of all things. As Lin Yuan observed this, a deep sense of awe filled his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was truly magnificent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan no longer had any confusion. The mysterious phenomena of time and space had all been comprehended by him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had become all-knowing in the realm of time and space.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right," Lin Yuan quickly calmed down. His so-called "all-knowing" was just an illusion, a result of his breakthrough to a higher level, where he received too much information.</p><p></p><p>Upon further reflection, Lin Yuan's heart was filled with countless new doubts, such as the deeper explanations of the Temporal Seventh Realm in the secret technique "Heavenly River," as well as the descriptions of the Temporal Eighth Realm, which made him feel complex and troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it step by step," Lin Yuan quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Those dozens of surveillance methods just now came from the deepest part of the Demon Abyss, should be from that Ancestor of the Demon Abyss?" Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>With his current understanding of time and space, he could naturally detect the surveillance of other Twelfth-Tier existences, and even counter-surveil and lock onto them.</p><p></p><p>"I killed six Demon Overlords, so I must have alarmed the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss," Lin Yuan thought casually, without any fear.</p><p></p><p>When he first arrived in the Immortal Realms, Lin Yuan had been extremely solemn towards the Ancestor of the Immortal Dao and the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss, at least hoping that they could suppress him.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Demon Abyss had used dozens of surveillance methods, but still failed to lock onto Lin Yuan's true body, which already said everything.</p><p></p><p>"Making the demonic beasts retreat to the Demon Abyss on their own? That's quite cautious," Lin Yuan glanced around the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"They want to visit me?" Lin Yuan looked outside the Immortal Abode, where Zhen Zi had already informed him of the Immortal City Lord and the other Jade Immortals' request to see him.</p><p></p><p>On the throne in the Immortal Abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared out of thin air and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal City Lord and other high-level figures respectfully stood below.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, great one, for your timely intervention. If it weren't for you, the billions of immortals in Shuangwu Immortal City..." the Immortal City Lord immediately spoke respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"It was just a casual act," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He had acted against those six Demon Overlords solely because they had disturbed his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"As for the other demonic beasts retreating on their own..." the Immortal City Lord carefully probed.</p><p></p><p>The retreat of all the demonic beasts was related to Lin Yuan, but it was still just speculation.</p><p></p><p>"That was the will of the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was the truth. With Lin Yuan's strength, he could easily crush the demonic beasts, including the Demon Overlords, but he could not command them.</p><p></p><p>To make all the demonic beasts retreat to the Demon Abyss in such a unified manner, only the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss could do it.</p><p></p><p>"The will of the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss..." the Immortal City Lord swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan did not explicitly state it, his casual mention of the Ancestor of the Demon Abyss was with a sense of equality.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, yes," Lin Yuan looked at the trembling top-tier Jade Immortals below and suddenly spoke, "Please convey this message to the outside: from now on, all cultivators of the Martial Dao shall belong to my lineage."</p><p></p><p>The main reason Lin Yuan was meeting the Immortal City Lord and the others was for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly spread the Martial Dao Cultivation Path throughout the Thirty-Three Immortal Realms, he needed to let the immortals know about Lin Yuan's methods.</p><p></p><p>Letting the Immortal City Lord and the other top-tier Jade Immortals spread this news would be the most convenient.</p><p></p><p>At least in the Xuantian Immortal Realm, the propagation of the Martial Dao Cultivation Path would not encounter any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Temporal Seventh Realm, Lin Yuan no longer had any reservations in this Immortal Realm. He naturally needed to consider spreading the Martial Dao Cultivation Path.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Three Immortal Realms are boundless. Once the Martial Dao could be widely disseminated here, it would greatly assist Lin Yuan's ultimate ascension.</p>

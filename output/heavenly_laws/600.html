        <h1>Chapter 600</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming took his leave. </p><p></p><p>He had come specifically to inform Lin Yuan about this matter, purely to share the intelligence information.</p><p></p><p>This was also something Lin Yuan had previously asked him to do - </p><p></p><p>If anything major happened in the Chaotic Void, remember to notify him as well.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Ancient Ming was very concerned about this matter, so he came here immediately.</p><p></p><p>After the Venerable Ancient Ming left,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>In the post-heaven universe, the most valuable thing was undoubtedly the exploration of the Peerless Great Saints into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was also the key obsession of those Chaotic Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Reaching perfection at the 12th Realm and breaking through to the 13th Realm might yield just a bit more insight, and then they could cross into the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, this was actually not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, Lin Yuan could even interact with true 13th Realm Temporal Beings, and even possess them, experiencing the perspective and height of the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Chaotic Great Saints and Peerless Great Saints of the Chaotic Void,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's conditions were simply far superior.</p><p></p><p>And the commotion in that post-heaven universe had even reached the ears of the Venerable Ancient Ming.</p><p></p><p>It was basically being spread throughout the Chaotic Realm, and the nearby Great Saints would likely all head there.</p><p></p><p>With the Great Saints intervening, a post-heaven universe from millions of years ago would not last long against them, in Lin Yuan's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Even if he rushed there now, it would be meaningless, as by the time he arrived hundreds of years later, the entire post-heaven universe would have been thoroughly ransacked, and he wouldn't even get a drop of the soup.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Lin Yuan looked at the beast skin in front of him, the map on it constantly flickering with light.</p><p></p><p>With the map on the beast skin, if Lin Yuan could reach that post-heaven universe, he would have a huge advantage, even with other Chaotic Great Saints competing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he would likely be able to obtain most of the resources left behind by the Mysterious Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't have the same burning desire as those Chaotic Great Saints for the Mysterious Emperor's exploration and understanding of the 13th Realm, but he was still very interested in the many resources, weapons, and treasures left behind by a Peerless Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Great Saints had no particular desire for resources, because they had already reached the pinnacle, and no amount of resources could further increase their strength.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>He was currently in a period of strength cultivation, and as he continuously cultivated the "Infinite Void" second layer, the universe within him changed daily, so his thirst for resources never ceased.</p><p></p><p>That's why he had the idea of using the Gate of a Myriad Realms to bring the black jade from the Source World and sell it to those Chaotic Great Saints at a high price.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual and willpower-enhancing black jade, Lin Yuan reckoned, would be something no Chaotic Great Saint could refuse, and they would stop at nothing to acquire it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to bloody conflict and plunder, Lin Yuan still preferred to obtain resources through peaceful trade.</p><p></p><p>"It's just the Mysterious Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the beast skin map, feeling a little reluctant, after all, the legacy of a Peerless Great Saint must be of immense value and could save him so much cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask the Spirit of the Mysterious-Yellow Forbidden Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still wanted to learn more.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious-Yellow Forbidden Realm.</p><p></p><p>Due to the great destruction of the universe, the Mysterious-Yellow Forbidden Realm was also affected, and the once vast secret realm was now reduced to a hundred-meter radius.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Spirit of the Forbidden Realm had fallen into slumber.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Lin Yuan left here opened its eyes and began to summon the Spirit of the Forbidden Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure of the Spirit of the Forbidden Realm awakened from its slumber, looking at Lin Yuan with a hint of confusion. In the current state of the universe, what did Lin Yuan want it to do?</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about the Mysterious Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"About the Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure blinked its eyes and asked cautiously, "In what aspect?"</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the weapons and treasures."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Emperor had indeed become trapped in a time loop while attempting to break through to the 13th Realm, then his treasures and weapons would surely be left in his palace, waiting for someone to claim them.</p><p></p><p>After all, when attempting to reach the 13th Realm, external forces would have little effect.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the weapons..."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure thought for a moment. "The Mysterious Emperor's many weapons, the Mysterious Emperor's Seal has the greatest power. With a single seal, even ordinary Chaotic Great Saints would be annihilated, unable to resist."</p><p></p><p>"There is also the Mysterious-Yellow Armor, impervious to all laws, indestructible through all tribulations. Wearing this armor, even Peerless Great Saints of the same realm would find it difficult to inflict any harm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly, growing more and more enthralled. The Mysterious Emperor's six main battle weapons were all incredibly powerful, and even among the Peerless Great Saints, there were few who could match them.</p><p></p><p>"Back when the Emperor was still around, those Peerless Great Saints did not dare to clash with him directly," the six-armed figure said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Among the Peerless Great Saints, the Mysterious Emperor was undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Peerless Great Saints and Chaotic Great Saints were both at the perfected Chaotic Realm realm.</p><p></p><p>But while the realms were the same, their combat prowess and killing abilities varied greatly.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what exactly happened?" the six-armed figure asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly explained the situation regarding the map on the beast skin.</p><p></p><p>"The universe created by the Emperor has been discovered?" the six-armed figure said, sounding melancholic.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Emperor were still alive, the universe he had created would not have been discovered by anyone.</p><p></p><p>But now that the universe had been discovered, and was being hunted by the Great Saints and Venerables, it meant the Mysterious Emperor had been absent from the Chaotic Void for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the weapons and treasures left behind by the Emperor should all be yours," the six-armed figure said, looking at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As the creator of the Mysterious-Yellow Forbidden Realm, the six-armed figure felt that the Mysterious Emperor's legacy rightfully belonged to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual being created by the secret realm was naturally unwilling to see the emperor's precious weapons and treasures fall into the hands of outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had taken control of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, and was considered the emperor's disciple, the rightful heir to that post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>As for the outsiders? Those envious venerable saints and great sages? In the eyes of the six-armed figure, they were nothing but invaders and plunderers! "I'll try my best," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The "Tear of the Stars" fragment world. Lin Yuan pondered, considering the many possibilities of his entry into that post-heaven universe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need to ponder, for the biggest problem facing Lin Yuan now was how to reach the vicinity of that post-heaven universe in the shortest possible time.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't get there in time, everything would be for naught.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult," Lin Yuan murmured, seeing no hope.</p><p></p><p>With his current attainment in the eight-layer realm of time and space, reaching the post-heaven universe would require hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>To be able to get there in a short time, he would probably need a qualitative breakthrough in his time and space comprehension, such as reaching the nine-layer realm?</p><p></p><p>But a breakthrough in time and space comprehension? It would require a great deal of accumulation, and while Lin Yuan could achieve the nine-layer realm with his current time and space comprehension, it would still take time.</p><p></p><p>This was a dead end.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't make it on my own in a short time, what if I rely on external forces?" Lin Yuan shifted his thinking, pondering silently.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the Scorching Sun Ancient Country, even a Celestial Venerable would have to make a hundred thousand void traversals to get from the capital to the edge of the domain.</p><p></p><p>But with the help of the ancient country's time-space transmission array, one could reach the destination in just over ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>The time-space transmission array here was the external force.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Dao Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilion was spread throughout the chaotic void, with Myriad Dao branches in different void domains, and the Myriad Laws Eye could descend upon any Myriad Dao branch with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>If the Myriad Laws Eye was willing to help Lin Yuan, there was hope that he could get there in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go ask."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment and immediately condensed a clone, descending upon the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Myriad Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Yuan entered, he came to the innermost space.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilion Master greeted Lin Yuan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The last time the Myriad Laws Eye had evaluated Lin Yuan, he had kept it in mind until now.</p><p></p><p>The future Thirteenth-Tier Time Life? </p><p></p><p>Goodness.</p><p></p><p>To be able to receive such an evaluation from the Myriad Laws Eye, even the peerless great saints would not be able to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The peerless great saints were only a hair's breadth away from the Thirteenth-Tier, but that hair's breadth was like an abyss, almost impossible to cross.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see the Myriad Laws Eye," Lin Yuan said immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment," the Myriad Dao Pavilion Master pondered for a moment and immediately began to contact the Myriad Laws Eye.</p><p></p><p>If other powerful experts came and demanded to see the Myriad Laws Eye, the Myriad Dao Pavilion Master wouldn't even bother to entertain them.</p><p></p><p>How could anyone just see the Myriad Laws Eye as they pleased? </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Pavilion Master naturally knew how to handle this.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the time and space began to swirl, forming a vortex.</p><p></p><p>A huge eye materialized, gazing down at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"What do you need me for?" the Myriad Laws Eye asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>"I want to go here," Lin Yuan directly stated the spatial coordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>"What is your relationship with that boy Xuanhuang?" the Myriad Laws Eye asked with a hint of surprise, staring at Lin Yuan a little longer.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang... Lin Yuan's thoughts turned, and he immediately understood that the Myriad Laws Eye was referring to Emperor Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang was extremely ancient, and even in the era of the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master, there were very few experts who knew of him.</p><p></p><p>But the Myriad Laws Eye was clearly quite familiar with Emperor Xuanhuang, even addressing him as "that boy".</p><p></p><p>"I have obtained some of the legacy left behind by Emperor Xuanhuang," Lin Yuan replied without hiding anything.</p><p></p><p>As a peerless great saint, Emperor Xuanhuang had once opened three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Xuanhuang Secret Realms, using them as his legacy domains.</p><p></p><p>"I see," the Myriad Laws Eye murmured in realization.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity about that boy Xuanhuang, if not for the heart demon that confined him, he might have had a slim chance of becoming Thirteenth-Tier," the Myriad Laws Eye muttered, seemingly reminiscing about something.</p><p></p><p>"Heart demon?" Lin Yuan listened nearby.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard of this concept, even the secret realm spirit didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>"When breaking through to the Thirteenth-Tier, the most dreaded thing is a heart demon obsession, because the time loop you find yourself in will change according to your weaknesses. Your state of mind must be completely perfect to have a chance of enduring it. If you have a heart demon obsession, the time loop will cycle according to your heart demon, and the possibility of breaking free is almost non-existent," the Myriad Laws Eye explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>But he was puzzled in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Even a peerless great saint like Emperor Xuanhuang had something he couldn't let go of? Otherwise, how could he have formed a heart demon obsession?</p><p></p><p>"Alright," the Myriad Laws Eye looked down at Lin Yuan and said, "You've come to me to have me send you to the vicinity of that post-heaven universe, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite willing to seek help," the Myriad Laws Eye's eyes sparkled with amusement. "But I'll agree to it."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

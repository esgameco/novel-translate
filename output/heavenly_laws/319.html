        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 319: Deity of the Mortal Realm (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The vast expanse of the heavens and earth. </p><p></p><p>Hundreds of domineering figures with powerful auras whistled towards the direction of Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>As incarnations of divine power descending from the Ocean of Light, each figure on the scene represented a true deity.</p><p></p><p>Although only incarnations, their strength far exceeded the peak of demigods, nearing the level of eighth-rank true gods.</p><p></p><p>Especially the dozen or so figures at the very front, they were the incarnated divine powers of superior gods descending, their aura fluctuations reaching the threshold of true godhood.</p><p></p><p>Even among eighth-rank true gods, their strength differed vastly, determined by the authority over rules grasped by their divine personas, as well as the purity of their divine power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important factor was how much faith they had amassed.</p><p></p><p>Faith was the foundation of every true god, borrowing the power of living beings to allow seventh-rank demigods to coalesce divine nations and uphold them.</p><p></p><p>In the distant past, there had occurred many divine wars, with the true gods of the Ocean of Light and the Dark Abyss slaughtering each other, fundamentally over the struggle for faith.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>After flying for a while, the hundreds of divine incarnations vaguely sensed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Especially those incarnations of superior gods, their brows furrowed tightly as they surveyed their surroundings repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>As true gods, with their lofty realms, even as incarnations they had keen perception of space. At this moment, some true gods had already sensed something.</p><p></p><p>"The space has changed."</p><p>"The space of the mortal realm is not like this."</p><p>"That's right, I also find it very strange."</p><p>"Could it be we didn't come to the mortal realm?"</p><p>"Impossible, the 'anchors' of our divine incarnations are the major churches in the mortal realm, how could this not be the mortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>The true gods rapidly communicated, gazing at the unfamiliar environment around them.</p><p></p><p>"Stop bickering," said an superior god after pondering briefly. "Based on our speed, we should have reached Dragon Mountain Ridge long ago, but where is Dragon Mountain Ridge now?"</p><p></p><p>Upon these words, the remaining true gods' expressions turned grave.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The speed of true gods was immense. Even if the Plateau of Ten Thousand Nations was vast and boundless, this group of true gods had flown for so long that they should have arrived.</p><p></p><p>When true gods flew, it was not mere physical flight, but "translocation" flight that compressed spatial distances.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p>"Has Dragon Mountain Ridge been moved away?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the lower gods had yet to catch on, having little perception of the essence of space.</p><p></p><p>"No, it is us who have been moved away."</p><p>"Without us realizing it, we were moved into a sealed space at some point."</p><p></p><p>An superior god voiced his conjecture.</p><p></p><p>Although this speculation seemed unthinkable - to move away so many true gods right before their eyes, like a fantasy tale.</p><p></p><p>But besides this possibility, the superior god could not think of any other explanation.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, you can try returning to the Ocean of Light."</p><p></p><p>The superior god swept a glance at the incredulous gods and added another line.</p><p></p><p>The Ocean of Light was not located anywhere in the mortal realm, but in other spatial layers instead.</p><p></p><p>So those demigods in the mortal realm could never find the Ocean of Light or Dark Abyss where the gods resided, no matter how hard they searched.</p><p></p><p>While the distant Ocean of Light was unreachable for demigods, to the gods present it was but a stone's throw away.</p><p></p><p>With their main selves as 'coordinates', the numerous divine incarnations could easily lock onto the spatial layer containing the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>All they needed was to tear through space to enter.</p><p></p><p>"I refuse to believe there are such powerful beings in the mortal realm capable of easily moving us away."</p><p>"Right, I'll return to the Ocean of Light now."</p><p>"Apart from the almighty Lord of Gods, it's absolutely impossible for anyone to move us all simultaneously!"</p><p></p><p>A large portion of the divine incarnations immediately tore open space, intending to enter the Ocean of Light and reunite with their main selves.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>While space was indeed torn open...</p><p></p><p>Moments later, all the divine incarnations reappeared in the main space, faces ashen.</p><p></p><p>Through this attempt, these divine incarnations made the shocking discovery that they could vaguely sense the location of the Ocean of Light.</p><p></p><p>But they just could not go there.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an invisible barrier separated the two places.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it seemed all the divine incarnations were trapped within a sealed spatial prison.</p><p></p><p>If this conjecture was true, then who was the being capable of such a feat? The Lord of Gods? The Lord of Gods would not be so bored as to specifically come and mess with them, right?</p><p></p><p>If not the Lord of Gods, then who else?</p><p></p><p>Outside the Dragon Mountain Palace:</p><p></p><p>Under the watchful gaze of the Pope of Order and several core members of the Dragon Mountain Clan like Dragon Mountain Spirit, Lin Yuan stretched out his right hand towards the void, and hundreds of "parton" figures akin to headless flies appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, if what the Pope says is true and a large number of true god incarnations are about to descend, taking refuge in the Church of Order should be the top priority now."</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, there are many doubts surrounding the disappearance of so many demigods. Preserving yourself should be the priority now."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Spirit and the other core members of the Dragon Mountain Clan continued to plead desperately. </p><p></p><p>They knew Dragon Mountain Yuan's importance to the clan. Anyone else in the clan could run into trouble or even have the clan destroyed.</p><p></p><p>But Dragon Mountain Yuan absolutely could not have any issues. With him around, rebuilding the Dragon Mountain Clan would take no time at all. Without him, even if everyone else in the clan survived, they would only be divided up by other powers.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's earlier words "You want to hide?", Dragon Mountain Spirit and the others took it as a denial of any involvement in the disappearance of the many demigods.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, whether Lin Yuan was responsible or not was irrelevant. With so many true god incarnations descending, accidentally killing Dragon Mountain Yuan was entirely possible.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Spirit and the core members of the Dragon Mountain Clan also saw the hundreds of "parton" figures appear in the clan leader's palm.</p><p></p><p>But they did not pay it much mind. The top priority now was to take refuge in the Church of Order along with the Pope before those true god incarnations arrived.</p><p></p><p>Only by relying on the mighty Lord God of Order could they deter those true god incarnations.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order beside them was also feeling somewhat anxious. The descent of hundreds of true god incarnations put pressure on him too.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his status as an subordinate divine spirit of the Lord God of Order, the Pope dared to assert that those true god incarnations would not dare act against him.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan...</p><p></p><p>First of all, Lin Yuan was not a believer of the Lord God of Order. If he really was involved in the demigod disappearances, the Pope had no reason to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Only by entering the Church could the inviolable majesty of the Lord God of Order block those true god incarnations.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Clan Leader, we cannot delay any longer," the Pope said, glancing at Lin Yuan. He already had the idea to forcibly bring Lin Yuan into the church.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's publicly known strength was that of a demigod, but the Pope's true self was a true god from the Ocean of Light. Although...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even though he was only a subordinate deity under the main god, his power was still stronger than that of lower-level gods. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, although his physical body was just a vessel in the mortal realm, forcibly taking away a demigod would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Chieftain, my apologies for the offense."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order glanced over again. </p><p></p><p>Then he glanced a third time. </p><p>A fourth time.</p><p>A fifth time.</p><p></p><p>Until finally, the Pope of Order was staring fixedly at the palm of Lin Yuan's right hand.</p><p></p><p>In his palm, hundreds of "particle" figures were flitting about like headless flies, but could not escape the confines of his palm.</p><p></p><p>For a demigod, this was not a strange thing - capturing some insects like flies and trapping them in the palm was extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>But the Pope of Order was now breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's palm was magnified billions of times, and those "particle" figures were also magnified billions of times, it would be discovered that these "particle" figures were all domineering in aura, far surpassing the incarnations of true gods at the demigod peak.</p><p></p><p>"True god incarnations?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>True god incarnations were the continuation of a true god's will. Even the incarnations of lower gods were close to the threshold of level 8 true gods in power.</p><p></p><p>But now, these true god incarnations were struggling in Lin Yuan's palm like ants?</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not it."</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order immediately looked towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Just now, to be precise, it was before Lin Yuan extended his right hand and those hundreds of "particle" figures appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order could clearly sense terrifying auras rapidly approaching Dragon Mountain Ridge.</p><p></p><p>Those should be the true god incarnations coming to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>Only now, all those auras had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order had originally thought that these true god incarnations had deliberately suppressed their auras out of awe of the Order Church.</p><p></p><p>But a terrifying thought suddenly emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, far away in the Ocean of Light, the main consciousness of the Pope of Order began contacting the gods whose incarnations had come seeking revenge.</p><p></p><p>Although these true god incarnations were trapped in Lin Yuan's palm, their main consciousnesses were still free, but were now in complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>"All the divine power incarnations of the true gods are trapped in an unknown and vast space, unable to break free or return to the Ocean of Light."</p><p></p><p>"Some true gods suspect that it might be the main god of the Dark Abyss who took action?"</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order involuntarily swallowed, his gaze still fixed on Lin Yuan's right palm.</p><p></p><p>Trapped in an unknown and vast space?</p><p></p><p>Was that Lin Yuan's palm?</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order's heart was tossed by towering waves, and he could no longer maintain his calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>For the mere Dragon Mountain Chieftain, who was only a demigod, to trap hundreds of true god incarnations just by raising and lowering his right hand?</p><p></p><p>This was no longer something even the most powerful greater gods could do, let alone true gods.</p><p></p><p>This was the domain of main gods.</p><p>Level 9 main gods.</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order even vaguely felt that while killing a few hundred true gods might not be difficult for a level 9 main god, perhaps even main gods not skilled in spatial abilities could not so easily toy with hundreds of true gods in the spatial realm like Lin Yuan did?</p><p></p><p>Defeating and killing were two different things.</p><p></p><p>Killing and toying were also two different things.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Mountain Chieftain, you...you..." The Pope of Order's voice trembled as he looked at Lin Yuan's back, his gaze filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Those true god incarnations won't be coming anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Pope of Order, then at the dumbfounded expressions of Dragon Mountain Ling and the other core members of the Dragon Mountain Clan.</p><p></p><p>Then Lin Yuan raised his right hand slightly, brought his face close to his palm, and gently inhaled.</p><p></p><p>Within the palm world...</p><p></p><p>Space has its limits in terms of what it can withstand. Even in the mortal realm, which has the most expansive space, repeated battles between gods would tear open layer after layer of spatial planes.</p><p></p><p>This cage of space imprisoning them now was likely the same.</p><p></p><p>With hundreds of true god incarnations joining forces, the power they unleashed should reach the level of greater gods.</p><p></p><p>At that point, even if they could not tear through the cage, they might be able to shake it somewhat, which would be their chance.</p><p></p><p>However, after repeated attempts by the many true god incarnations to consecutively tear through hundreds of millions of spatial layers of this cage, they still could not see its end.</p><p></p><p>"Such a tremendously layered spatial cage, which main god of the Dark Abyss could have created it?"</p><p></p><p>One of the true god incarnations could not help but speak up. Initially, they did not think it was the work of a main god, because main gods would not be so bored.</p><p></p><p>But as they continued probing and understanding this spatial cage, the sense of shock in their hearts only grew more intense. Aside from a main god, who else could create such a spatial cage?</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Ask for help from the main gods in the Ocean of Light?"</p><p></p><p>The many true god incarnations seemed at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at that moment, a huge "face" appeared in the sky above this realm, occupying nearly half the celestial dome.</p><p></p><p>One eye of this face was as large as the sun. Even without emanating any aura, it still made the souls of the gods tremble.</p><p></p><p>Before the true god incarnations could react, that towering face gently inhaled towards them.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a terrifying force permeated every inch of space. All the true god incarnations disintegrated without being able to resist for even an instant, including the incarnations of greater gods.</p><p></p><p>The true god incarnations, formed from the purest divine power rather than flesh and blood, reverted to their original state as vast amounts of pure energy, surging into the "mouth" of that immense face.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, after Lin Yuan "consumed" all the divine power incarnations, the energy they contained was not even enough to be considered a dessert for him at his current level of power - he could only taste their flavor.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan patted his right hand, glancing at the petrified Pope of Order and the still dumbfounded Dragon Mountain Ling and other core Dragon Mountain Clan members who had yet to react.</p><p></p><p>"There's no danger now."</p><p></p><p>"You all can go about your business."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Lin Yuan walked straight into the Dragon Mountain Palace. Dealing with hundreds of true god incarnations was no difficulty for him.</p><p></p><p>As a level 9 expert who had opened 900 million spatial layers, Lin Yuan's attainments in spatial abilities meant even some level 10 experts in the main world likely could not claim certain victory over him, let alone in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Chieftain..."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling and the other core Dragon Mountain Clan members blinked, still not having recovered. What did he mean there was no danger? Didn't the Pope just say a large number of true god incarnations were about to come seeking revenge?</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, what exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Mountain Ling looked towards the Pope of Order beside him, his expression still somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Pope of Order...</p>

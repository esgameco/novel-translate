            <p>Chapter 249 Lurking (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Outside the main star of the galaxy. </p><p></p><p>Five alien races merged into the depths of space.</p><p></p><p>As invincible Eighth Stage beings, they had basically comprehended five to six thousand core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>They could easily merge into layers upon layers of space.</p><p></p><p>The space of the main world was vast and boundless, with an unknown number of layers.</p><p></p><p>Many secret realm worlds were hidden within certain layers of space, undiscovered for countless eons.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is this Galactic Overlord doing? Not coming out for ten years?" The five invincible Eighth Stage aliens were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't strange for an Eighth Stage powerhouse to go into seclusion for decades or even centuries. But the Galactic Overlord had just taken over the galactic domain, and logically speaking, he should frequently move about within the domain.</p><p></p><p>What new Overlord would hide in the main star and not come out?</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, as the Overlord, he definitely wouldn't do things personally. But he couldn't just never show his face, right?</p><p></p><p>"No matter."</p><p></p><p>"We'll just wait."</p><p></p><p>"If ten years isn't enough, then fifty years."</p><p></p><p>"If fifty years isn't enough, then five hundred years."</p><p></p><p>The leading Eighth Stage invincible spoke. He came from the powerful "Dark Scaled Tribe", and was named Salah.</p><p></p><p>The Dark Scaled Tribe was a member of the Insectoid Alliance. The other four Eighth Stage invincibles also came from the major alien races of the Insectoid Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Insectoids themselves didn't have the concept of Eighth Stage invincibles. Each Insectoid Queen could give birth to countless warriors. As long as the number of Eighth Stage Insectoid warriors was high enough, even Eighth Stage invincibles would be daunted.</p><p></p><p>Thereforeâ€”</p><p></p><p>The way to define the strength of an Insectoid Queen was by what stage it was at.</p><p></p><p>And how many warriors of each stage it had birthed.</p><p></p><p>An Eighth Stage Insectoid Queen was the strongest existence at the Eighth Stage. As long as time and resources were sufficient, it could continuously produce Eighth Stage Insectoid warriors.</p><p></p><p>Even if these Insectoid warriors lacked basic comprehension of laws, quantitative change led to qualitative change. With enough numbers, they could sweep across everything.</p><p></p><p>This was the "Insect Tide Tactic" the Insectoids used to rampage across the starry universe.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"For us, what does it matter even if we have to wait thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>The third Eighth Stage invincible spoke. They similarly yearned to step into the Ninth Stage. But facing the threshold of fusing laws, relying on secluded cultivation was useless.</p><p></p><p>Fusing laws, especially when it involved a certain pillar law, required not only sufficient personal foundation, but more importantly, that critical "flash of inspiration".</p><p></p><p>"Wait thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>"This Galactic Overlord's talent and potential are so terrifying that he's already ranked seventh on the list compiled by the Insectoids. If we let him cultivate for thousands of years, maybe he'll reach the Ninth Stage, or at least become an Eighth Stage invincible."</p><p></p><p>This Eighth Stage invincible's tone was worried.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>The other four Eighth Stage invincibles fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If they were talking about other evolvers being able to comprehend some cosmic power and become Eighth Stage invincibles within a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>They would certainly scoff at the notion.</p><p></p><p>Were cosmic powers that easy to comprehend?</p><p></p><p>They were all Eighth Stage invincibles and naturally understood the difficulty of comprehending cosmic powers. Who knew how many life and death crises they had experienced, how many fortuitous encounters and opportunities they had obtained.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much of a genius or monster one was, could they sit there motionless and comprehend cosmic powers?</p><p></p><p>But if they were talking about the Galactic Overlord?</p><p></p><p>There were already enough miracles surrounding the Galactic Overlord.</p><p></p><p>If he said that he would go into seclusion for hundreds or thousands of years and comprehend some cosmic power, it was indeed a real possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, we have no choice."</p><p></p><p>Salah of the Dark Scaled Tribe said, "There's only one chance. The Galactic Overlord is hiding in the main star and not coming out, so we can only wait."</p><p></p><p>"If we wait thousands of years and the Galactic Overlord really comprehends some cosmic power, the Insectoids' mission should be considered a failure."</p><p></p><p>Among Eighth Stage invincibles, there were differences in strength, but the gap wasn't large. When two Eighth Stage invincibles fought, they would basically enter a stalemate. Under normal circumstances, it was very difficult for one side to defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why powerhouses at this level were called "Eighth Stage Invincibles".</p><p></p><p>Even if several Eighth Stage invincibles ganged up on one Eighth Stage invincible, although the latter might not be able to win, he could still easily escape unscathed.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>In Salah's view, if the Galactic Overlord could really comprehend some cosmic power and become an Eighth Stage invincible, then their assassination would be considered a failure.</p><p></p><p>The Poison of Memories only targeted mental memories. The Galactic Overlord had to completely lose all ability to resist for it to work.</p><p></p><p>Even Ninth Stage powerhouses would find it difficult to make an Eighth Stage invincible completely lose their ability to resist, let alone them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the eyes of the several Eighth Stage invincibles, the Galactic Overlord becoming an Eighth Stage invincible was only a possibility, not a certainty.</p><p></p><p>They were waiting outside the main star like a mantis stalking a cicada, and the chances of success were still very high.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The talent I've displayed is entering the Eighth Stage before a hundred years old, and an unimaginable growth rate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Before taking office, my teacher had already warned me that the Insectoids might carry out an assassination against me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced in the direction of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>He had spent 100,000 cosmic crystals to carry out a B-grade transformation on the main star. Apart from the main star being of critical importance as the economic and political center of the domain.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to make his base as impregnable as possible.</p><p></p><p>A B-grade planetary transformation could easily suppress the vast majority of Eighth Stage powerhouses. Its defense was also staggeringly powerful. Even Ninth Stage powerhouses attacking could only endure for a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>If Eighth Stage invincibles attacked, even a group of them could only last for a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>For powerhouses, even a ten-thousandth of an instant was enough to do many things.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could completely expose this true body to avoid direct contact with Ninth Stage powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lin Yuan didn't believe the Insectoids would mobilize Ninth Stage level forces to assassinate him.</p><p></p><p>Mobilizing Ninth Stage level combat power was equivalent to tearing off the facade with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If the benefits were large enough, the Insectoids wouldn't mind doing so. But based on the talent Lin Yuan had displayed so far, he was far from deserving of that.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan mainly needed to guard against assassination by Eighth Stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>Facing Eighth Stage invincibles, Lin Yuan only needed to hide inside the main star.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan first arrived in the Galactic Domain, he had swiftly and decisively cleared out the biggest destabilizing factors in the domain.</p><p></p><p>This was to reduce the frequency of his own outings later on.</p><p></p><p>"Human civilization evolvers, upon reaching the Eighth Stage, must guard the border domains. This is tradition, a rule that even the offspring of the most powerful cannot be exempt from."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Evolvers below the Eighth Stage were all under the protection and investment of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the Eighth Stage, they had to make contributions and guard the border domains. The danger wasn't actually that great.</p><p></p><p>Peerless geniuses like Lin Yuan who might face assassination by alien races were often bestowed with many life-saving trump cards before heading to the border domains.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if a certain evolver made huge contributions to human civilization, such as being an Evolution Scholar or close to one.</p><p></p><p>They could also apply for exemption from the duty of guarding border domains.</p><p></p><p>But such situations were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Based on Lin Yuan's displayed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan actually had the qualifications to apply for the potential of the exposed edge, but if he did so, while all the other newly promoted Eighth Stage Evolvers went to guard the marginal star domains, only Lin Yuan didn't go. This would be equivalent to declaring to the aliens that the Galactic Star Lord still had bigger secrets.</p><p></p><p>Once that happened, even if Lin Yuan hid behind the human civilization, it might not be absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>"These ten years..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts turned, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The ten years in the main world allowed Lin Yuan to make leaps and bounds in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>First of all, in terms of Rule Comprehension, Lin Yuan had already comprehended 2,932 core models of Spatial Rules.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that ten years ago, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the core Spatial Models was only just over 2,000 models.</p><p></p><p>After ten years, Lin Yuan directly comprehended 900 core Spatial Models.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of comprehending these 900 core Spatial Models was incomparably higher than the initial 900 models.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension difficulty of the 7,782 core Spatial Models increased geometrically as they progressed.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension difficulty of the 2,000th core Spatial Model far exceeded that of the first core Spatial Model.</p><p></p><p>This was reflected in the Inner World, where the later the Spatial Model was comprehended, the greater the expansion of the Inner World.</p><p></p><p>The 2,932 core Spatial Models directly increased Lin Yuan's Inner World to a radius of 2 million miles.</p><p></p><p>This 2 million mile radius was the normal size of the Inner World.</p><p></p><p>After the basic amplification of the Crimson Liquid, Lin Yuan's Inner World reached a radius of 6.66 million miles.</p><p></p><p>After the further basic amplification of the Orange-Yellow Liquid, the current size of Lin Yuan's Inner World had now exceeded 10 million miles in radius.</p><p></p><p>"Orange-Yellow Liquid..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out that mysterious gourd. At this moment, the color of the gourd had turned grayish-yellow, exuding a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the initial Crimson Liquid or the Orange-Yellow Liquid, their amplification effects on the physical body and Inner World were all basic amplifications.</p><p></p><p>"Now my physical body and Inner World's basic amplification has probably reached five times?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Liquid's 3.33 times and the Orange-Yellow Liquid's nearly 2 times.</p><p></p><p>The latter was inferior to the former because Lin Yuan did not completely absorb the Orange-Yellow Liquid.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, if Lin Yuan thoroughly absorbed the Orange-Yellow Liquid, the final amplification would reach 6.66 times.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>Even after more than ten years, Lin Yuan was still shocked by the effects of the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>This was a basic amplification, not an ordinary addition or subtraction. Now Lin Yuan's Inner World size had reached 10 million miles.</p><p></p><p>A 10-million-mile Inner World.</p><p></p><p>That was the upper limit for human Evolvers. Only by comprehending the complete Spatial Rules at the Eighth Stage could one achieve it.</p><p></p><p>But to comprehend the complete Spatial Rules at the Eighth Stage was almost impossible. Even some Ninth Stage powerhouses had not comprehended the complete Spatial Rules.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan had achieved it in a certain aspect.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not comprehended the complete Spatial Rules, he had obtained one of the greatest benefits after comprehending the complete Spatial Rules.</p><p></p><p>A 10-million-mile radius Inner World.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the 10-million-mile radius Inner World was not Lin Yuan's upper limit. He could still continue to improve, and there was still a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>"With a 10-million-mile radius Inner World, even if my current combat strength is not as good as an Eighth Stage Invincible, it's not far off."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>According to his speculation, when the Inner World reached a radius of tens of millions of miles, even without comprehending some kind of Cosmic Power, one could contend against an Eighth Stage Invincible.</p><p></p><p>If the Inner World reached hundreds of millions of miles, then one could crush an Eighth Stage Invincible.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, Eighth Stage Invincibles had stood undefeated at the Eighth Stage level. This was the legend that belonged to Eighth Stage Invincibles.</p><p></p><p>But as long as Lin Yuan continued to cultivate, he could break this legend.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, the Yin Rule is still a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed. Over the past ten years, part of his energy had been focused on absorbing the Orange-Yellow Liquid and comprehending Spatial Rules, among other things.</p><p></p><p>This led to him being unable to fully comprehend the Yin Rule for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This was the essence of the complementary nature of Yin and Yang in the Taiji Dao.</p><p></p><p>When one aspect improved, the improvement of the other aspect was a natural course of events.</p><p></p><p>"There are already 36 strands of Boundary-Breaking Source Power."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into the depths of his sea of consciousness, gazing at that majestic and magnificent Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, the amount of Boundary-Breaking Source Power Lin Yuan had accumulated was only 17 strands, but now it had increased to 36 strands.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the development of the Galactic Star Domain is stable and doesn't require me to do anything. I can proceed with the eighth crossing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, how to choose for the eighth crossing, Lin Yuan was still somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze shifted, looking towards a certain direction on the main star.</p><p></p><p>There was a mountain peak, the residence of Ruan Wei, the Eighth Stage Evolver who had voluntarily come to follow Lin Yuan more than ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ruan Wei was standing on the mountain top, with the surrounding space subtly distorting, evidently comprehending a core Spatial Model.</p><p></p><p>"Wrong."</p><p></p><p>"The direction is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw Ruan Wei's problem at a glance.</p><p></p><p>The Spatial Rules were vast and endless. The 7,782 core Spatial Models summarized by the predecessors of human civilization throughout the ages only explained certain aspects of the essence of Spatial Rules.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's comprehension of the core Spatial Models might be different.</p><p></p><p>"So be it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment, and his figure disappeared from the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Space? What exactly is space?"</p><p></p><p>Ruan Wei frowned, and her aura began to fluctuate unstably.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared.</p><p></p><p>He pointed a finger at Ruan Wei's brow.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Ruan Wei sobered up and immediately bowed to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Space is everything."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan, who had already comprehended nearly 3,000 core Spatial Models, he was fully qualified to correct Ruan Wei's wrong path.</p><p></p><p>"Space is everything?"</p><p></p><p>Ruan Wei looked slightly confused.</p><p></p><p>"Space encompasses all things. The space you see is only an insignificant part. The universe and starry sky, layer upon layer of space, almost have no end."</p><p></p><p>"When comprehending Spatial Rules, never concretize space, otherwise it's easy to go astray."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>Evolvers comprehending Spatial Rules were like blind men touching an elephant. There were no specific criteria, but if they touched an elephant's leg and then believed that space was the elephant's leg, it would undoubtedly be a huge mistake.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>Ruan Wei's heart was moved, and she immediately bowed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>She had just tried hard to perceive the Spatial Rules and attempted to imagine the appearance of the Spatial Rules, not knowing that she had committed a great taboo.</p><p></p><p>If she really fixed the concrete image of space, from then on, it would be difficult for her to continue to progress in Spatial Rules.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan only gave a casual reminder, he undoubtedly pulled Ruan Wei back onto the widest and broadest path.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why many Evolvers were willing to follow the strong. Often, a word of guidance from the strong could lead them out of a dead end.</p><p></p><p>A single sentence could possibly change a lifetime.</p>

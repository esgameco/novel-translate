            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 460 Terrifying Merit Point Settlement (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuanzhen's true body was seated in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>Centered around him, all the time and space were constantly merging and interweaving, as if worlds were being born and destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This was a manifestation of the attainment of a certain high level of the fusion of time and space rules.</p><p></p><p>Since ninety years ago, when the Insect Clan's Wanhua Queen revealed part of the secrets, Lin Yuanzhen's true body has been constantly residing in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, as this place can be considered absolutely safe, and the Twelve Ultimate Existences cannot lock onto the specific coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Since some of his own strength has been exposed, Lin Yu naturally needs to consider whether the Twelve Ultimate Existences will try to suppress and kill him.</p><p></p><p>The Strongest Summer Qin has invited Lin Yu to go to the Central Star Domain, where there are many tribal weapons to suppress. That can also be considered safe enough.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yu still prefers the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Galactic Prime Star? He can simply dispatch a clone to preside over it.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yu's current mental and willpower strength, as well as his level of understanding of the rules, even a randomly condensed clone can exert nearly peak Eleventh Realm power.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, Lin Yu can be called a 'weakened version' of the Twelve Ultimate Existences.</p><p></p><p>Before stepping into the Twelfth Realm, Lin Yu had set a requirement for himself.</p><p></p><p>That is, his true body should avoid going out of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm as much as possible. </p><p></p><p>For any affairs in the outside world, he will let the Sun and Moon Avatars handle them as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are also a large number of clones that can be used.</p><p></p><p>"In ninety years, I have also upgraded 36 pillar-level fusion rules to the Seventh Realm, that is, the Twelfth Realm level, but the time-space fusion rule?" Lin Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If the Sixth Realm of the time-space fusion rule is divided into early, middle, late, and peak four levels, then Lin Yu's current understanding of the time-space fusion rule should be at the middle level, still some distance from the late stage.</p><p></p><p>This is already extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Even for most of the Twelve Ultimate Existences, their understanding of the time-space fusion rule is mostly in the early to middle stages, at most the late stage, and there are very few who have reached the peak of the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Seventh Realm of time-space fusion rule understanding? At least so far, Lin Yu has not heard of any Twelve Ultimate Existence who has achieved this.</p><p></p><p>Even as powerful as Emperor Xuanhuang and the Patriarch of the Demon Jade Tower, their understanding of the time-space fusion rule is only at the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With my current rule understanding, I still can't break through the seventh layer of the Demon Jade Tower?" Lin Yu sighed, a bit helpless. When he was at the Tenth Realm, he could already break through one-third of the way to the seventh layer of the Black Tower, but now at the Eleventh Realm, and after cultivating for a hundred or two hundred years, he is still stuck at the last part of the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the gap between me and the true Twelfth Realm beings is still not small," Lin Yu thought to himself. The nine-layer Black Tower was established by the Patriarch of the Demon Jade Tower, and starting from the seventh layer, only Twelfth Realm beings have a chance to break through.</p><p></p><p>"Inner World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yu's avatar consciousness descended into the inner world. In ninety years, in addition to the improvement in rule understanding, the inner world has also undergone tremendous expansion.</p><p></p><p>After the second time of enduring the baptism of the Chaotic Void Origin, Lin Yu gained benefits no less than the Eleventh Realm Perfect Assault Ultimate, but the vast majority of the Chaotic Void Origin has been buried in the depths of the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yu has not yet crossed into the Twelfth Realm, and his life essence has not yet undergone a major leap, so he cannot absorb all the Chaotic Void Origin in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>But as time passes, the Chaotic Void Origin buried in the depths of the inner world is gradually being absorbed.</p><p></p><p>As a result, in just ninety years, Lin Yu's inner world has expanded to more than 9 billion li in radius.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that when Lin Yu first entered the Eleventh Realm, his inner world was only 6 billion li in radius. In more than a hundred years, it has reached more than 9 billion li, an increase of more than 3 billion li.</p><p></p><p>How many Eleventh Realm Perfect Existence inner worlds is this equivalent to?</p><p></p><p>"In theory, if I were to absorb all the dormant Chaotic Void Origin, my inner world would reach the Twelfth Realm threshold, which is tens of thousands of light-years?" Lin Yu thought.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, my inner world will slowly transform into an inner universe?"</p><p></p><p>However, this will take too long, from thousands of li to tens of thousands of light-years? The gap is too large.</p><p></p><p>And the inner world is limited by the life essence, so as long as Lin Yu has not crossed into the Twelfth Realm, there may be an upper limit constraint.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuanhuang Body', it's not far from Eleventh Realm perfection," Lin Yu carefully sensed his physical body and a satisfied smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Over the past ninety years, Lin Yu has gradually completed transactions with other peak faction forces, and more than half of the 600-plus supreme weapons have been traded away, in exchange for an ocean-like amount of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>More than eighty years ago, Lin Yu officially brought the 'Xuanhuang Body' to great perfection.</p><p></p><p>Now, it is only a few steps away from Eleventh Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>And once the 'Xuanhuang Body' reaches Eleventh Realm perfection, in terms of pure physical body, Lin Yu will be comparable to the Twelve Ultimate Existences.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Realm perfected 'Xuanhuang Body' requires the support of the various peak factions to achieve, how should I cultivate the Twelfth Realm perfected 'Xuanhuang Body'?" Lin Yu was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>The normal Twelfth Realm perfected 'Xuanhuang Body' can allow the cultivator to match the peak of the 'Divide the Dao' realm just relying on the physical body.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the Twelfth Realm 'Xuanhuang Body' is said to be able to easily overcome the great calamity of the destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yu's physical body starting point is too high, and after he reaches the Twelfth Realm, the resource demand for continuing to cultivate the 'Xuanhuang Body' to Twelfth Realm perfection will far exceed the normal Twelfth Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>The normal Twelfth Realm perfected 'Xuanhuang Body' has already reached the point where the resources of an entire universe may not be enough to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yu's Twelfth Realm perfected 'Xuanhuang Body', at least in this universe, there is basically no hope of succeeding, not even great perfection is achievable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the benefits are also huge.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yu's current powerful physical foundation, once the 'Xuanhuang Body' is cultivated to Twelfth Realm perfection, just relying on the physical body, he may be able to contend with Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yu reviewed his gains over the past ninety years.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, compared to ninety years ago, Lin Yu's strength has increased by a large margin. Now, to kill tens of thousands of Eleventh Realm aliens, he probably doesn't even need to activate the divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>"Dimensional Source Force."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yu's mind sank into his sea of consciousness, looking at the majestic and grand Dimensional Gate.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the cultivation and realm, the greater the impact Lin Yu receives when observing the Dimensional Gate. This giant gate seems to transcend all dimensions and spaces, and even the time-space fusion rule is far from being able to encompass and cover it.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand four hundred and fifty-three strands of Dimensional Source Force." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yu slightly sensed the amount of Dimensional Source Force, such a huge amount of Dimensional Source Force is completely sufficient to 'customize' a very high-level dimensional world traversal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The super-large-scale war is about to end, and the 11th transition can be carried out." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered the expression, contemplating which transition method to choose for the 11th transition. </p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current realm of cultivation, the choices left for him were not many - one was to undergo a 'customized' transition, the other was to descend into the 'Immortal Realm'.</p><p></p><p>"The super-large-scale war has ended."</p><p></p><p>The Solar Primordial Spirit emerged from the depths of the altar on the super-large-scale battlefield. </p><p></p><p>According to the rules set by the various peak clan forces, occupying the altar for over a hundred years would grant them the right to dominate the battlefield, which meant victory in the war.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the powerful experts of the various peak clan forces had withdrawn from the super-large-scale battlefield ninety years ago, and human civilization could already declare victory in the war.</p><p></p><p>"The war is over."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this super-large-scale war was really too easy."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if it weren't for the Galactic Overlord, our human civilization would not only have achieved victory, but might still be fighting those peak clan forces."</p><p></p><p>The evolved humans of human civilization withdrew from the battlefield, casually conversing with each other. </p><p></p><p>Apart from the initial stage, the rest of the war had been extremely comfortable for them.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not harvest as many merit points as expected, since the Galactic Overlord alone had broken through the eleven major peak clan forces, there was basically nothing left for these Eleventh-Realm experts to do.</p><p></p><p>But at least they were safe, and the many Eleventh-Realm experts of the human civilization alliance felt that they had just been 'going through the motions' without exerting much effort, yet the war had still ended.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Eleventh-Realm experts had still gained a considerable amount of merit points, even though they did not engage in combat with the Eleventh-Realm experts of the alien races. The very victory of the war itself would still yield a certain amount of merit points.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the merit point harvest of the Eleventh-Realm experts had not decreased much. </p><p></p><p>After all, the war had lasted for a hundred years, and if it weren't for the Galactic Overlord, human civilization might have had to fight for thousands or even tens of thousands of years to win this super-large-scale war.</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if every war could be this comfortable."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, just earning merit points without doing anything."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've already decided that as long as there is the Galactic Overlord leading the war, I will definitely participate."</p><p></p><p>The many Eleventh-Realm experts successfully withdrew from the super-large-scale battlefield, then returned to the domain of human civilization under the wave of the mightiest of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The location of the super-large-scale battlefield was not within the territory of any clan, but rather a desolate star domain.</p><p></p><p>There were many such desolate and barren star domains in the universe, without any occupational value, not even attracting the attention of ordinary or weak clans.</p><p></p><p>"I should leave as well."</p><p></p><p>As the overlord of the human civilization alliance, Lin Yuan was naturally the last to leave the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the super-large-scale battlefield with a hint of reluctance, for he had reaped countless harvests here - not only the bodily essences and primordial spirits of tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm aliens, but also hundreds of supreme weapons and many precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>The incredibly profound spatio-temporal structure of the super-large-scale war itself had also greatly benefited Lin Yuan's comprehension of space-time fusion.</p><p></p><p>Over the past hundred years, Lin Yuan's insights into space-time fusion had advanced by leaps and bounds, primarily due to his innate perceptiveness, but the reference and observation of the super-large-scale battlefield had also played a significant role.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave a clone behind to observe the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan manifested a clone that merged into the profound spatial layers, constantly observing the super-large-scale battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after reaching the middle stage of the Sixth Realm of Space-Time, the super-large-scale battlefield was no longer of great benefit to Lin Yuan, as many Twelfth-Realm ultimate experts had attained insights into space-time on par with or even surpassing his own.</p><p></p><p>But even if the benefits were not substantial, they were still beneficial.</p><p></p><p>Leaving a clone behind was a trivial matter for Lin Yuan, whose mental will was strong enough to maintain hundreds of clones at the Eleventh-Realm peak level without any strain.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Yellow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale war had officially come to an end, which meant that the distribution of merits was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>The three Goddesses would now determine the performance and contributions of each Eleventh-Realm evolved human on the super-large-scale battlefield, and bestow the corresponding merit points as rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Goddess of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a wisp of Lin Yuan's Solar Primordial Spirit connected with the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body was located in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, where the virtual world could not cover, and it was also a 'signal blind spot' for the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>In fact, at Lin Yuan's current level of cultivation, even if he were not in the Mysterious Yellow Realm, he could easily isolate himself from the virtual world and the three Goddesses, as long as he did not wish to be detected, even while within the domain of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Overlord of the Super-Large-Scale War, Ninth-Rank Citizen Lin Yuan, your performance is currently under evaluation, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Goddess of Wisdom echoed.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary Eleventh-Realm evolved humans, the evaluation of their battlefield performance could be completed in an instant by the three Goddesses.</p><p></p><p>After all, the corresponding merit points for their contributions were already clearly defined, and there was no need for subjective judgment.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>His performance on the battlefield had been so dazzling that it could be said that without him, the course of this super-large-scale war would have been completely different.</p><p></p><p>The evaluation of Lin Yuan's contributions required extreme caution, and even the subjective judgment of the nine Supremes was needed.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>More than half an hour had elapsed.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Goddess of Wisdom sounded in Lin Yuan's ear once again.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Overlord of the Super-Large-Scale War, Ninth-Rank Citizen Lin Yuan, based on your performance on the battlefield, the final evaluation is as follows."</p><p></p><p>"Kills of Eleventh-Realm aliens: Obtained"</p><p></p><p>"Guided the first large-scale war victory: Obtained"</p><p></p><p>"Occupied the victory altar for a hundred years: Obtained"</p><p></p><p>After going through dozens of evaluation criteria, Lin Yuan finally heard the final amount of merit points he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>"After the evaluation, Lin Yuan, the scholar, has obtained a total of 2,162,453,000 merit points in this war."</p><p></p><p>"Over 2 billion merit points?" Lin Yuan raised an eyebrow, this amount of merit points was somewhat beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lin Yuan had estimated that he would obtain at least 50 billion merit points, with an upper limit of around 100 billion, but over 200 billion merit points?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It should be that other contributions were included in the evaluation," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's performance on the super-large-scale battlefield was not limited to the slaughter of tens of thousands of Eleventh-Realm aliens and leading human civilization to the final victory.</p><p></p><p>There was also his unique deterrent effect.</p><p></p><p>At least the Eleventh-Realm experts of the other peak clans, including the strongest Eleventh-Realm experts, had all left a deep psychological shadow in Lin Yuan's mind.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 334</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 334 Shen Ji: You just barged through without any pause? (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy. New69bookbar.com  </p><p></p><p>In just three days, the world within Lin Yuan's body had recovered to nearly two billion square miles. </p><p></p><p>The vast forces of the world, mixed with the power of more than twenty billion spatial layers, made even ordinary tenth-level experts feel fear.</p><p></p><p>"The main universal space is stable, and the countless spatial layers are also extremely solid," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the Realm of Gods, Lin Yuan could easily open stable "Martial Realms" between many spatial layers, to be used as places for all martial deities to ascend.</p><p></p><p>But in the main universe, Lin Yuan could not do this. The space of the main universe was too stable. To forcibly open up a world required at least the eleventh level of power. Even worlds opened by eleventh-level experts could not last forever - without maintenance, they would gradually be restored by the innate restorative power of the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Unless one reached the level of a supreme expert with the ability to cause permanent spatial rifts, it was almost a pipe dream to open a stable "Martial Realm" in the main universe.</p><p></p><p>"However, these past few days, the hottest topic in human civilization should be the path of martial evolution."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan connected his consciousness to the virtual network. The headlines of all the major human media were about the path of martial evolution.</p><p></p><p>Before the ninth level of the martial path was uploaded, there was only the eighth level evolution path. Even if it topped the Annan Stellar Alliance rankings, it was still just a local evolution path for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>The Annan Stellar Alliance? It was just one of the countless stellar alliances within human civilization's domain.</p><p></p><p>No matter how phenomenal the speed of the martial evolution path, the vast majority of human evolutionary cultivators and citizens had never heard of it.</p><p></p><p>But when the ninth level martial evolution path directly entered the Southern Stellar Region's evolution rankings, it could be considered to have "thoroughly gone mainstream."</p><p></p><p>There were many, many regions like the Annan Stellar Alliance for human civilization, but there were only five major stellar regions for the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the stellar region evolution rankings were closely watched by countless human evolutionary cultivators every day.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was just a change of fifty-three places, or a hundred places, on the Southern Stellar Region evolution rankings, it would cause discussion at the level of the entire human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"This is also a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"With the martial evolution path 'going mainstream', the number of evolutionary cultivators practicing it..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was pleased as he opened the information on the number of martial evolution path cultivators.</p><p></p><p>According to human civilization's regulations, every citizen who became an evolutionary cultivator needed to register at their local Evolutionary Cultivator Association.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had also registered at the Canglan Star Evolutionary Cultivator Association in the past.</p><p></p><p>After registration, the detailed information of each evolutionary cultivator was collected to calculate the number at each level for every martial evolution path cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"First Level: 6,956,341,200,000"</p><p>"Second Level: 925,430,000,000" </p><p>"Third Level: 196,500,000"</p><p>"Fourth Level: 54,200,000"</p><p>"Fifth Level: 8,120,000"  </p><p>"Sixth Level: 980,000"</p><p>"Eighth Level: 0"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the relevant data and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that there was a huge drop-off in the number of cultivators between the second and third levels.</p><p></p><p>This was not because the probability of breaking through from the second to third martial level was too low, but rather at least half of the current first and second level numbers had increased in just the past few days.</p><p></p><p>With the martial evolution path ranking 53rd in the stellar region evolution rankings, giving it such massive "exposure" to all of humanity, who knows how many citizens chose to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>And the first to second level of the martial path could be "rapidly achieved" through certain means, being just an accumulation of energy.</p><p></p><p>But going from the second to third level was much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating along a stable evolution path is indeed highly efficient," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a few years since the martial evolution path was uploaded, and in the time that had passed in the main world of about a hundred years, over two thousand seventh level martial cultivators had already been born.</p><p></p><p>One must know, when Lin Yuan originally opened the first to seventh levels of the martial path, including the time spent traversing worlds, it took a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan also knew that those who could reach the seventh level of the martial path within a hundred years were basically all high-level evolutionary cultivators who had converted paths.</p><p></p><p>Many sixth and seventh level evolutionary cultivators had seen the potential of the martial evolution path very early on, and paid a huge price to abandon their original paths to choose the martial path instead.</p><p></p><p>For high-level evolutionary cultivators re-cultivating the martial path, their grasp of the fundamental nature of power and rules allowed them to make rapid breakthroughs in the early and middle stages without needing any additional insights.</p><p></p><p>"The revenue share from these years..." Lin Yuan glanced at his account balance of over nine hundred million universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>These were universal crystals, not civilization currency or universal currency, but rather the crystals used universally by many races across space.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the net worth of an eighth-level expert was between a few thousand to ten thousand universal crystals.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's revenue share over the past twenty to thirty years was equivalent to lying down and earning more than half the lifetime savings of over a thousand eighth-level experts.</p><p></p><p>"Nine hundred million universal crystals, with four hundred million of that being revenue from just the past few days. The pricing for the ninth level is five trillion civilization currency, equivalent to five universal crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Four hundred million universal crystals in revenue share means total sales of around 1.2 million universal crystals, which is the ninth level being purchased two to three hundred million times."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was somewhat amazed. There were still a lot of wealthy people in human civilization - those high-level evolutionary cultivators had terrifying means of making fortunes.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly one million universal crystals in revenue share, and it will only increase more in the future," Lin Yuan became increasingly aware of the earning potential for the founder of a high-level evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Although the process of opening an evolution path was arduous, once accomplished it became a goose that lays golden eggs.</p><p></p><p>Universal crystals were the common currency across the myriad races of the universe. Although not as valuable as human civilization's merit points, with enough quantity they could already purchase most of the universe's wondrous treasures.</p><p></p><p>"However, the revenue share is secondary," Lin Yuan withdrew from the martial evolution path's revenue interface, his gaze turning towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts rose and fell.</p><p></p><p>The constant expansion of human civilization's domain and wars with other races were mainly to gain more territory and increase the population base as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>With a larger population base, not only would more evolutionary genius talents be born, but they could also attempt to cultivate many evolution paths, increasing the probability of a tenth-level peak existence breaking through to become a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>Among the peak civilizations, the human race had the most supreme experts, a full nine of them, which was related to their vast population.</p><p></p><p>Those unique, special lifeforms could easily cultivate to the tenth level, but dared not attempt to break through to the supreme level, because they had no chance of success.</p><p></p><p>So there were many "ancient gods" in the depths of space constantly spreading...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The evolutionary path formed by the characteristic information, such as the "ancient god" evolutionary path circulating within human civilization. </p><p></p><p>It was in preparation for impacting that step.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raced through numerous spatial layers at will.</p><p></p><p>"Almost to the core area," Lin Yuan sensed the "calling feeling" and knew he was very close to the core area.  </p><p></p><p>"Probably about half a month left," Lin Yuan calculated the time, feeling increasingly eager.</p><p></p><p>The calling feeling became clearer as he got closer.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang Sovereign?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan translated the calling voice into the text of human civilization. "Is it the Sovereign of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>According to the information collected by human civilization over so many years, the Sovereign of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm should be the former ruler of the realm.</p><p></p><p>Also an existence at the level of the most powerful.</p><p></p><p>"A calling feeling related to a supreme being."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was pondering when his expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Over there?"</p><p></p><p>He sensed a faint aura lurking in that area.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A hundred million-mile large insect tribe mother nest took flight, frantically fleeing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Insect tribe?" </p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was vast and boundless. The route Lin Yuan was on was too insignificant compared to the entire secret realm, so encountering a ninth-level insect tribe was a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Stay put."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, the power of two billion spatial layers spreading out. That insect tribe mother nest had comprehended nearly thirty million spatial layers, but it was clearly not enough before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign!" The insect tribe mother nest spoke resentfully, emitting dense spiritual waves, and then directly self-destructed, its enormous body exploding apart.</p><p></p><p>"So decisive?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The insect tribe mother nests had huge bodies, and losing one avatar cost far more than a small ninth-level like Xiran.</p><p></p><p>"Does it know I have a 'memory poison'?" Lin Yuan guessed the reason.</p><p></p><p>Other ninth-level xenoraces were worried that Lin Yuan would capture them alive, then take them back to the human domain and use the means of those powerful beings in human civilization against them.</p><p></p><p>But the insect tribe indeed knew that Lin Yuan didn't need to do that at all.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the insect tribe sent four invincible eighth-levels to surround and kill the Galactic Sovereign, they used a "memory poison" that could utterly destroy a powerful being on the level of memory, to the point where even "resurrection" couldn't "resurrect" from that kind of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Those four invincible eighth-levels fell, so the insect tribe naturally knew that the "memory poison" had fallen into Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Not a bad harvest, probably worth about four hundred million universe crystals." Lin Yuan nodded. This insect tribe had clearly reaped considerable gains in this secret realm. </p><p></p><p>But now it had all become Lin Yuan's windfall.</p><p></p><p>At the Galactic Sovereign's abode.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan ended his cultivation for the day.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right."</p><p></p><p>"I can go to the Magic Gem Space and try the third floor of the Black Tower." The thought occurred to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He was quite tempted by the rewards for clearing each Black Tower floor. The "Chaos Crystal" he got for clearing the second floor, Lin Yuan was still frequently observing, hoping to gain some insights.</p><p></p><p>There were also secret teachings like the "Void Interpretation" and "Illusion Reality" that came from the hand of the Magic Gem Tower's master.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed the "Magic Gem Imprint" deep in his soul, sending a wisp of spiritual will along the imprint to instantly descend into the Magic Gem Space.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I came." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the grayish mist around him, feeling somewhat nostalgic.</p><p></p><p>The "long time" here included the thousands of years he spent in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan arrived before the towering nine-story Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>"You're here?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji walked out, smiling at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Trying the third floor again?" The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji saw Lin Yuan's purpose. In fact, besides trying the third floor of the Black Tower, Lin Yuan had no other reason to descend into the Magic Gem Space.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In his previous few attempts at the third floor, Lin Yuan had failed. He was still an immeasurably long way from clearing the third floor.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Go on in." </p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji didn't waste words, directly opening the entrance to the Black Tower and clearing a path.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan went straight in.</p><p></p><p>On the third floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>Every inch of space was filled with an omnipresent pressure.</p><p></p><p>From his many previous attempts, Lin Yuan already knew what the third floor of the Black Tower tested.</p><p></p><p>The first and second floors tested one's resistance to formless pressure, requiring the cultivator to resist the pressure.</p><p></p><p>But the pressure permeating the third floor was not something a cultivator could resist. The real test of the third floor was for the cultivator to occupy more spatial layers in order to evade the pressure coming from all directions.</p><p></p><p>So the key on the third floor was evasion.</p><p></p><p>"Last time I came to try the third floor, I only opened up less than ten thousand spatial layers, and didn't even get through one percent of the path," Lin Yuan recalled the scenes from before.</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, to clear the third floor would require opening up nearly a billion spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated that even the strongest ninth-level beings of the myriad races in the main universe's starry sky during this era would be unable to pass the third floor.</p><p></p><p>"But for me now..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instantly occupied layer upon layer of space and lightly took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The humanoid stone statue Shen Ji watched the scene of the third floor with keen interest.</p><p></p><p>"Last time this little fellow spent over half a time period just to complete one percent of the path, which must have dealt him quite a blow," the stone statue Shen Ji thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Prodigies are all arrogant, especially a monstrous genius like Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>No matter how clearly Shen Ji told Lin Yuan that the standard for clearing the third floor was those special ninth-levels, or even tenth-level beings.</p><p></p><p>But seeing himself so fragile on the third floor, like a sheet of paper, must have left a bad taste in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"This time the little fellow dares try the third floor again, he must have had some breakthrough. Maybe he can finally complete two or even five percent of the path?"</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji thought, already assuming Lin Yuan had a major breakthrough, otherwise he wouldn't make that judgment.</p><p></p><p>To complete two or even five percent of the path would require a ninth-level being capable of opening up nearly a million spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>The number of spatial layers Lin Yuan previously opened was less than ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>"Truly befitting a genius who comprehended dozens of cosmic forces while at the eighth level. It hasn't been that long, yet he's had such a great breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The stone statue Shen Ji smiled as he observed. But just then, in the scene, Lin Yuan lightly took another step forward.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan instantly vanished from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Before the stone statue Shen Ji could react, he saw a figure appear in the end area of the third floor.</p><p></p><p>It was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This...?!" The stone statue Shen Ji was dumbfounded, stunned.</p>

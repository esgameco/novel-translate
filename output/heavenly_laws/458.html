        <h1>Chapter 458</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 458: Renowned Across the Universe (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>The Empress of Myriad Transformations was very straightforward. Seeing that the Lord of the Silver Galaxy had already reached the level of "undefeatable without using the Twelfth Realm", she decisively chose to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>If she didn't withdraw, it would only be a futile waste of the clan's foundation.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the Insect Clan had already paid enough for this super-large-scale battlefield war.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred top-tier weapons, numerous Eleventh Realm clones, and the activated life essence of balance - that was one-tenth of the life essence of ten Eleventh Realm perfected experts.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long it would take and how much effort and resources would be needed to recover from this.</p><p></p><p>Although it was said that as long as the Insect Clan's Empresses were unharmed, the clan would be as stable as Mount Tai, if there was a generational gap at the Eleventh Realm level, then for billions or trillions of years in the future, the Insect Clan might not be able to give birth to a new Twelfth Realm Empress.</p><p></p><p>And other peak clans would not just sit idle; perhaps they would give birth to one Twelfth Realm ultimate after another.</p><p></p><p>As the number of Twelfth Realm experts in other clans increased, if their own clan did not increase accordingly, it would mean decline.</p><p></p><p>Over time, the Insect Clan's position among the Twelve Great Peak Clans would decline.</p><p></p><p>As for the cost of admitting defeat?</p><p></p><p>It was simply one-ten-thousandth of their own territory, which the Insect Clan could still afford.</p><p></p><p>"This Lord of the Silver Galaxy is strong in all aspects, far exceeding the limits of the Eleventh Realm perfected, how did he achieve this? Could it be related to the ultimate opportunity obtained by human civilization?" </p><p></p><p>The Empress of Myriad Transformations gazed at Lin Yuan from afar, wanting to glimpse into some of the secrets, but unfortunately, they were all blocked by the Peerless Expert Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, the Peerless Expert Xuanyuan was in no way inferior to this ancient Insect Clan Empress, and in a desperate battle, the Empress of Myriad Transformations would even be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Among the dozens of Twelfth Realm ultimates in the universe, the only ones that the Peerless Expert Xuanyuan would be wary of were the two Twelfth Realm ultimates of the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>But the ultimates of the Calamity Clan did not dare to go all-out within the universe, as they risked being suppressed by the will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a victory or loss in this super-large-scale war. Next time the super-large-scale war opens, we'll just prohibit the Lord of the Silver Galaxy from participating," the Empress of Myriad Transformations thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale battlefield was opened up by the joint efforts of all the Twelfth Realm experts. The rules of the super-large-scale war were naturally also formulated by these Peerless Experts.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was a large-scale war or a super-large-scale war, the many Twelfth Realm ultimates would also formulate some rules, such as prohibiting the participation of the ultimates' clones and avatars.</p><p></p><p>The so-called battlefield was to confine the destruction caused by the slaughter to a certain range. If the Peerless Experts' clones and avatars could act freely, then the meaning of the battlefield would be lost.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter at the Twelfth Realm level was not something that could be contained by the battlefield; the destructive power would affect the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the Lord of the Silver Galaxy's strength, the Empress of Myriad Transformations had already decided to join hands with other peak clans to establish new battlefield rules, which was to include the Lord of the Silver Galaxy in the list of prohibited participants.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, I wonder if our Clan's Twelfth Realm weapons can be returned, don't worry, we can use other resources to exchange for them."</p><p></p><p>The Empress of Myriad Transformations thought for a moment and spoke.</p><p></p><p>The many Twelfth Realm weapons bestowed this time had all fallen into the hands of the Lord of the Silver Galaxy, and the Empress of Myriad Transformations planned to recover them through normal trade channels.</p><p></p><p>"That will depend on the Lord of the Silver Galaxy's thoughts," the Peerless Expert Xuanyuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>In order to encourage human evolution cultivators to go to the battlefield and fight, the Human Civilization Alliance had long had a rule that all the harvests of any cultivator on the battlefield belonged to the individual.</p><p></p><p>The Human Civilization could only suggest at most, but could not decide.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Silver Galaxy was even more so, as he had the highest right of disposition over everything he obtained.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the Silver Galaxy, what do you think? You can make a request, as long as our Insect Clan has it."</p><p></p><p>The Empress of Myriad Transformations looked at Lin Yuan, her gaze soft and her tone gentle. Even the strongest Eleventh Realm perfected experts would find it hard to resist.</p><p></p><p>"I'll think about it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>If the Insect Clan offered enough resources to satisfy him, he wouldn't mind exchanging the Twelfth Realm weapons.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was just one person and couldn't use so many Twelfth Realm weapons at the same time.</p><p></p><p>As for trading with the Human Civilization? The more than 600 Twelfth Realm weapons, the Human Civilization probably couldn't digest them in the short term either.</p><p></p><p>But if the Insect Clan regained these Twelfth Realm weapons, would it lead to the restoration of their foundation and pose a threat to the Human Civilization?</p><p></p><p>The real concern should be the Insect Clan. Once these more than 600 top-tier weapons were fully converted into the resources needed to cultivate the "Mysterious Yellow Body", Lin Yuan estimated that he could truly push it to the Eleventh Realm perfected.</p><p></p><p>An Eleventh Realm perfected "Mysterious Yellow Body" based on Lin Yuan's physical body, he estimated it could propel his physique to the Twelfth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>At that time, in addition to mental will, rule comprehension, Lin Yuan's physique would also enter the realm of the Peerless Experts.</p><p></p><p>"Consider?" The Empress of Myriad Transformations fell silent for a while, her figure disappearing and returning to the Nightmare Palace.</p><p></p><p>The strongest Eleventh Realm experts of the Insect Clan below looked at Lin Yuan with complex expressions, then resolutely turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Since the dawn of the universe, even the most powerful Eleventh Realm life forms would be fearful and trembling when facing the Twelfth Realm, the Mother of the Tree Realm and the peak period Four Divine Kings were no exception.</p><p></p><p>But the Lord of the Silver Galaxy was fearless, and while the backing of the Human Civilization was a factor, the Lord of the Silver Galaxy's own strength was also the key.</p><p></p><p>With the Insect Clan's withdrawal from the super-large-scale war, the other peak clan's Twelfth Realm ultimates also looked at each other and made their decisions.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Insect Clan, they withdrew from the war and ceded the first right to dominate the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice. The original alliance of the Eleven Great Peak Clan forces had been completely crushed by the Lord of the Silver Galaxy, and the weakened life essence of the balance had become almost useless.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Insect Clan had voluntarily withdrawn, facing the Lord of the Silver Galaxy, they had even less hope of resistance. Rather than continue to send their clan's strongest experts to the battlefield to die, it was better to decisively withdraw.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, everyone, please excuse us," the Peerless Expert Xuanyuan looked at the many Twelfth Realm ultimates, and the other eight human Peerless Experts did the same.</p><p></p><p>Since the Star Sea Era, although the Human Civilization had always held the upper hand in wars against other races, they had never been this relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The super-large-scale war in the spatial scale was completed in just ten years? This was because the various peak clan forces had spent these ten years preparing countermeasures against the Lord of the Silver Galaxy.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, don't be too complacent. No matter how strong the Lord of the Silver Galaxy is, when he attempts to break through to the ultimate, he still faces the risk of complete downfall."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, breaking through to the ultimate, even if the foundation is as strong as it can be, it's just an increase in the possibility. Whether he can actually cross over, still depends on luck."</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm ultimates, although they had ceded the right to dominate the battlefield, did not show any weakness.</p><p></p><p>For an Eleventh Realm life to break through to the ultimate, even if all the prerequisites were met, luck still played a significant factor.</p><p></p><p>If the Lord of the Silver Galaxy's luck was not good enough,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Even if he was ten or a hundred times stronger, he would still ultimately fail.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to trouble you all," the Xuanyuan Strongest One said calmly. "Please go back and quickly complete the territorial division with human civilization."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Yuan, you really didn't see the expressions on those old fellows' faces," the Strongest One Xia Qin said joyfully, looking at Lin Yuan in front of him, his delight barely concealed.</p><p></p><p>In the past many wars, the Human Civilization Alliance had won many victories, but this was the first time those peak group forces had retreated in such a dejected and defeated manner.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this opportunity only comes once," Xia Qin Strongest One sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Once?" Lin Yuan was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that the Xia Qin Strongest One had said that a super-large-scale battlefield would open up once every hundred thousand years for a super-large-scale war.</p><p></p><p>Although a hundred thousand years was not a short time, it was nothing to those at the Ninth Realm and above.</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's own plans, it would be best to comprehend the Chaos Rules first, and then assault the Ultimate, so he would stay at the Eleventh Realm for a while.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could even wait for the next super-large-scale war to open up.</p><p></p><p>"By the time the next super-large-scale war opens up, those old fellows will definitely not let you participate," Xia Qin Strongest One explained, as he could almost predict this.</p><p></p><p>"Not let me participate?" Lin Yuan was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Let you participate, and wait for you to lose?" Xia Qin Strongest One shook his head. "If the result of this war is certain defeat, who would still join?"</p><p></p><p>"So, before the next super-large-scale war opens up, those old fellows will definitely redefine the rules to prohibit your participation," Xia Qin Strongest One said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Before this super-large-scale war opened up, Lin Yuan had not displayed any remarkable strength, only just entering the Eleventh Realm. By the time he had annihilated tens of thousands at the Eleventh Realm, it would already be too late, as the war had already begun, and the rules could not be modified midway.</p><p></p><p>But by the time of the next super-large-scale war, the forces of the various peak groups would certainly add new rules, and Lin Yuan was almost certain that he would not be allowed to enter the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A war is like a gamble, the participants must be given a chance to win. If there was no hope of winning at all, naturally there would be no participants. If human civilization continued to allow Lin Yuan to participate in the super-large-scale war, the other Eleven Peak Group forces might not join the next super-large-scale war.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to influence the formulation of the rules of the super-large-scale war with a life at the Eleventh Realm, I suppose you are the first and last in this universe," Xia Qin Strongest One couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also relieved that Lin Yuan was an evolver of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>If other peak groups had a similar life form to Lin Yuan, he reckoned it would give him a massive headache, no different from the recent performance of those Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Xuanyuan asked me to ask you if you have any ideas on how to deal with those Twelfth Realm weapons. Those old fellows all want to use resources to exchange the weapons back."</p><p></p><p>Not only did the Insect Tribe's Wanhua Queen Mother have this plan, but the Twelfth Realm Ultimates of the other peak group forces were also preparing to use resources to exchange their own Twelfth Realm weapons.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan had obtained more than 600 Twelfth Realm weapons, a considerable portion of which were suitable for the strong ones of the corresponding groups. It was not as simple as losing one Twelfth Realm weapon and casually finding a new one.</p><p></p><p>Suitability was important. A Twelfth Realm Ultimate who was proficient in using guns, you let him use a sword? It would definitely affect his strength.</p><p></p><p>"What does the Strongest One think?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>If possible, Lin Yuan was still willing to consume these powerful weapons within human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"You'd better trade with those old fellows, our human civilization doesn't have that many resources to trade with you," Xia Qin Strongest One understood Lin Yuan's intention and immediately replied.</p><p></p><p>The resources that could be traded for more than 600 Strongest One weapons must be of a huge amount. It was estimated that only the other Eleven Peak Group forces combined could swallow it.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, these Strongest One weapons originally belonged to the Eleven Peak Group forces.</p><p></p><p>"Good. Tell me your requirements, and I'll pass them on to those old fellows," Xia Qin Strongest One said.</p><p></p><p>For the trade of more than 600 Strongest One weapons, it was the Eleven Peak Group forces who were begging Lin Yuan, so naturally the terms would be left to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The events that occurred on the super-large-scale battlefield, especially the entry of the Insect Tribe's Wanhua Queen Mother, who frankly stated that the Galactic Overlord had no reliance on any Ultimate foundation, but merely relied on his own strength to crush tens of thousands at the Eleventh Realm, began to spread wildly among numerous groups.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful groups, ordinary groups, and even weak groups of strong ones all learned of this news.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord, without relying on any external force, has killed tens of thousands at the Eleventh Realm?" </p><p></p><p>"Is this the Eleventh Realm? Are you sure the Galactic Overlord hasn't become an Ultimate?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible."</p><p></p><p>"The information should be true. The Twelfth Realm Ultimates have already abandoned the super-large-scale battlefield and voluntarily withdrawn from the war."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Galactic Overlord's mental will has already reached the Twelfth Realm level, as the Wanhua Queen Mother herself said."</p><p></p><p>"Mental will? Twelfth Realm level? How did the Galactic Overlord do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's extremely difficult for me to even raise my mental will a little bit, and he directly reached the Twelfth Realm level?"</p><p></p><p>Crazy.</p><p></p><p>The countless lives in the vast universe, including the special life groups in the secluded realms with blocked information, all learned of this news in the first time. To crush tens of thousands at the Eleventh Realm with one's own strength, including some who wielded Strongest One weapons, and to also reach the Twelfth Realm level of mental will, this event caused an even greater shock than the Galactic Overlord's ascension to the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were still some Twelfth Realm Ultimates in the vast universe, but a change like the Galactic Overlord's, many strong ones had never even heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>"How old is the Galactic Overlord again?"</p><p></p><p>"Less than a thousand years old."</p><p></p><p>"Less than a thousand years old, and he has this capability? Is the Galactic Overlord really not a Twelfth Realm Ultimate disguising himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I also feel that way. Is that Twelfth Realm Ultimate just joking with us?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you idiots? If the Galactic Overlord were truly a Twelfth Realm Ultimate, would he have been able to smoothly enter the super-large-scale battlefield? Would the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates have watched their own strong ones being slaughtered?"</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, billions of groups and countless lives were discussing the Galactic Overlord. Although there were some doubts, since the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates had voluntarily abandoned the battlefield, the information about the Galactic Overlord should not be false.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's initial entry into the Eleventh Realm had made him famous throughout the universe, making the myriad stars know the Galactic Overlord as a 500-year-old peerless genius who had crossed into the Eleventh Realm, then the events that had occurred on the super-large-scale battlefield had now made Lin Yuan's name shake the entire universe.</p>

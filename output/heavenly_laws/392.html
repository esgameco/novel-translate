        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The universe and starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the supremely powerful beings changed. </p><p></p><p>Everything that happened at the peak of the Celestial Mountains in the two-dimensional world, they were also aware of it instantly.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings, the scrawny old man and the other eleven perfected legendary-level powerful beings at the tenth stage, as soon as they came into contact with that human 'Bloodrain', were severely injured and on the verge of death.  </p><p></p><p>The two sides were completely on different levels, the former had no ability to resist or struggle in front of the latter.</p><p></p><p>Although they possessed defensive mystical artifacts to protect themselves, in the two-dimensional world, those defensive artifacts could only exert a tiny amount of their power, completely unable to block Lin Yuan's attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, quickly get your human evolver to stop." The supremely powerful beings of the Stellar Alliance could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings were the Stellar Alliance's most promising candidates to reach the ultimate eleventh stage. If they simply died like this in the two-dimensional world, suffering a fundamental loss of part of their spiritual will, who knows how long it would take to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>There was even a high possibility that they could never make up for it, reducing their hopes of reaching the ultimate stage.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, let's talk this through properly." The supremely powerful being of the Yu Clan immediately sent a voice transmission. The scrawny old man and the other five perfected legendary-level eleventh stage beings, two of them were from the Yu Clan.</p><p></p><p>A perfected legendary-level eleventh stage being, even for a peak clan, was a foundation, listed in the sequence of ultimate candidates. It was unknown how long it would take for one to be born.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just their avatars that fell in the two-dimensional world, the fundamental loss would reduce their chances of ultimately reaching the ultimate stage. There was not much difference from being completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The original chances of successfully reaching the ultimate stage were already infinitesimal. With this further reduction, trying to reach the ultimate stage would be no different from courting death.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>The supremely powerful Xia Qin glanced at the other ultimates who kept sending him voice transmissions.</p><p></p><p>"We had already agreed not to interfere with our clansmen's actions in the two-dimensional world. You're putting me in a difficult position by asking me like this," Xia Qin calmly said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to pay the price," the supreme being of the Stellar Alliance immediately said.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Stellar Alliance paid a price that left the supremely powerful Xia Qin quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let me ask first..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin glanced at the supreme being of the Yu Clan.</p><p></p><p>"My clan is also willing to pay," the Yu Clan supreme being said through gritted teeth, his tone stiff.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the personal world of the supreme being, looking up at Xia Qin sitting on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"The supreme being has told me to temporarily not kill the Four Celestial Kings and the others."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, vaguely guessing that Xia Qin might be making a deal with the other ultimate existences.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the face of Xia Qin, sitting on the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Hahahahaha."</p><p></p><p>"This will make those old fellows bleed quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>The supreme being Xia Qin spoke, his tone quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Bleed?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin nodded, "They had to pay a price to save their clansmen, didn't they?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin said this and looked at Lin Yuan with satisfaction, "You don't need to kill the Four Celestial Kings and the others. I'll give you eighty percent of those prices."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin had only told him to spare the lives of the Four Celestial Kings, the scrawny old man and the others, but didn't say anything about leaving their mystical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could completely take all the mystical artifacts possessed by the six powerful beings, and then spare their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, you don't need to forcibly extract the supreme weapon that has merged into the Four Celestial Kings' bodies."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin added, "The one from the Stellar Alliance has agreed to exchange it for two supreme weapons."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>That ultimate weapon of the Four Celestial Kings was no different from an ordinary artifact to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Exchanging one for two was a complete profit.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's aura of blood energy surged vastly, enveloping the entire mountain peak. The Four Celestial Kings, the scrawny old man and the other four powerful beings had completely lost the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>The myriad powerful beings of various races below the mountain were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The power displayed by Lin Yuan was simply too terrifying, the gap between him and the Four Celestial Kings and those tenth and eleventh stage powerful beings was even greater.</p><p></p><p>"Why has this 'Bloodrain' human from the human civilization stopped attacking?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, it must be because the ultimate existence behind the Four Celestial Kings has found the supreme being of the human civilization to negotiate."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the other special beings' avatars, even if they die in this two-dimensional world, the Stellar Alliance wouldn't care. But the Four Celestial Kings are different, he is the Stellar Alliance's most promising candidate to become an ultimate."</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings of the various races were inwardly amazed as they looked at Lin Yuan standing at the center of the mountain peak, their souls trembling.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't certain that only eleventh stage and below beings had descended into this two-dimensional world, some of them would have even suspected that Lin Yuan was a supreme being.</p><p></p><p>How could someone who wasn't a supreme being cultivate faster than the Four Celestial Kings in this world that suppressed everything, unless he was one?</p><p></p><p>They could still understand a difference of one or two realms, or maybe even three or four realms if they really stretched it.</p><p></p><p>But the gap between Lin Yuan and the Four Celestial Kings seemed to be ten or twenty realms! Many people would believe he was a supreme being based on that.</p><p></p><p>At the center of the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan opened his eyes and looked towards the Four Celestial Kings, the scrawny old man and the other four powerful beings, saying, "Hand over all your mystical artifacts, and you can leave."</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings and the others looked at each other, their hearts slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He took a breath of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although handing over the strange objects pained them immensely, at least this avatar was preserved. </p><p></p><p>"The supreme weapon that I fused into my body," the Four Celestial Kings said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at him. "You can keep that."</p><p></p><p>This was also specifically instructed by the supreme expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>The supreme weapon within the Four Celestial Kings' bodies was of little significance to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>The six experts handed over all the excess strange objects on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings possessed four strange objects, the skinny old man had five, and the other four added up to eighteen.</p><p></p><p>In just this battle, Lin Yuan acquired twenty-seven strange objects. Adding to what he had accumulated over the previous three hundred years, the number of strange objects on him exceeded thirty.</p><p></p><p>This did not include the price paid by those supreme experts from the outside world to buy the lives of the Four Celestial Kings and the other six experts from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In short, as long as Lin Yuan could leave this two-dimensional world safely, his gains would be unprecedentedâ€”wealth that even a tenth-level expert could not accumulate in ten lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>After storing all the strange objects in the mirror space, Lin Yuan voluntarily suppressed his aura, and the blood force field pervading the entire mountain peak gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"You can leave now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan turned and stood before the Heavenly Gate again.</p><p></p><p>From attacking the Four Celestial Kings and the other six experts to completely suppressing them, and receiving the instructions from the supreme expert Xia Qin, not much time had actually passed.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the Heavenly Gate in front of him had not fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a supreme expert?" the Four Celestial Kings suddenly asked before leaving.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was a supreme expert, he could feel a little better about being defeated by a supreme expert, which was not too disgraceful.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme expert?" Lin Yuan shook his head. "I'm not."</p><p></p><p>He was not only not a supreme expert, but not even a tenth-level life form.</p><p></p><p>Not a supreme expert... The Four Celestial Kings fell silent. With Lin Yuan's strength, he should not bother lying. He was probably a secluded tenth-level evolver from human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"I will remember this battle forever," the Four Celestial Kings said, looking deeply at Lin Yuan before leaving.</p><p></p><p>From his birth until now, the Four Celestial Kings had never been defeated so badly, so decisively.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' figure rapidly departed.</p><p></p><p>The injuries Lin Yuan had inflicted on him had mostly recovered, about sixty or seventy percent. For experts at the Shaman Ancestor Realm of the Thirty Levels, as long as their brain and heart were not shattered, injuries to other organs could heal rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"We'll leave too," said the skinny old man. The other five experts quickly left as well.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, only Lin Yuan remained on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, at the edge of the mountain peak were Xuanyuan Du and the other human evolvers.</p><p></p><p>Apart from them, all the powerful experts from various races, even the tenth-level experts, had retreated from the peak and could only observe from the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong," said Zhu of the Demon Race, standing in a corner near the peak as he looked at Lin Yuan before the Heavenly Gate. His heart was filled with utter despair.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought that with the profundities contained within the Blood-Colored Blade, after comprehending many killing techniques, he could try to seize some opportunities to enter when the Heavenly Gate opened this time.</p><p></p><p>But reality had given him a hard slap in the face.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention others, just the Four Celestial Kings, the skinny old man, and the other five experts could crush him. How could he compare to Lin Yuan, who had emerged from nowhere to crush those powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>"Is Blood Rain's strength really that powerful?" On the side of human civilization, Xuanyuan Du and the other evolvers were dazed. They felt the joy had come too suddenly.</p><p></p><p>How did they do nothing, yet Lin Yuan was already standing before the Heavenly Gate, waiting for it to fully manifest before entering?</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't the Galactic Sovereign arrived yet?" Among the tenth-level evolvers, Na Lan, the Vice Sect Master, calmed himself and began scanning the mountainside, trying to find the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heavenly Gate?" Unlike the shock of the experts from various races, Lin Yuan returned before the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Heavenly Gate had basically fully manifested, with mysterious and complex patterns as well as a faint imposing aura, causing Lin Yuan's expression to turn solemn.</p><p></p><p>Although the feeling the Heavenly Gate gave him was far from the Myriad Realms Gate, it was still somewhat stronger than the supreme expert Xia Qin.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Lin Yuan had personally witnessed Xia Qin reverse the flow of the river of time to revive lives that had perished.</p><p></p><p>Time passed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at a certain moment,</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The instant the Heavenly Gate manifested,</p><p></p><p>A terrifying imposing aura radiated outwards in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he could easily withstand this imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>But this was because Lin Yuan was at the Shaman Ancestor Realm of the Fifty Levels. This imposing aura had already exceeded the limit that ordinary Shaman Ancestor Realm experts of the Twenty Levels could endure.</p><p></p><p>If such an imposing aura accompanied every opening of the Heavenly Gate, how could the Shaman Emperors and Shaman Ancestors from the native lifeforms enter in the past?</p><p></p><p>"Let me push open the Heavenly Gate first."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts. After the Heavenly Gate fully manifested, all he needed was to push it open to enter.</p><p></p><p>This was also the 'step' the native powerful experts had to take before entering the Heavenly Gate when it opened in the past.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan raised both hands, placed them on the Heavenly Gate, and pushed with force.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't push open the Heavenly Gate?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

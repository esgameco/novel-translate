        <h1>Chapter 620</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan heard this and his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It was normal for the Xuan Huang Universe to emerge and attract a large number of Chaos Lords and Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>But Peerless Great Saints?</p><p></p><p>Firstly, compared to Chaos Great Saints, the number of Peerless Great Saints was far fewer.</p><p></p><p>Scattered across the Chaotic Void, the probability of having a Peerless Great Saint near the newly emerged Xuan Huang Universe was almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>Figures like the Black Obsidian Great Saint and the Dual Source Great Saint, powerful Chaos Great Saints, were able to rush over because they happened to be within the vicinity of the Xuan Huang Universe that had just emerged, within a myriad of void domains.</p><p></p><p>This allowed them to afford the cost of the Myriad Laws Eye and the Ancient Altar Spirit to transport them over. If the distance was greater, the cost would have skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of a myriad void domains, there were probably eight or nine Chaos Great Saints distributed.</p><p></p><p>As for Peerless Great Saints, even in ten thousand or a million void domains, it was almost impossible to find a single Peerless Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Most Peerless Great Saints hid in the mysterious and special places of the Chaotic Void, rarely making contact with the outside world.</p><p></p><p>And for Peerless Great Saints, they could create their own post-Heavenly Universes. Unless they were certain that this post-Heavenly Universe originated from the Peerless Great Saint, the Xuan Huang, they would most likely not come in person.</p><p></p><p>But according to the Myriad Laws Eye, at this moment, two Peerless Great Saints were about to rush over from outside the Xuan Huang Universe?</p><p></p><p>Peerless Great Saints? Two at once?</p><p></p><p>"Don't be puzzled, these two Peerless Great Saints have a grudge against that little Xuan Huang," the Myriad Laws Eye said, shaking his head slightly. "When Xuan Huang broke through to the Thirteenth Realm, after a thousand universe cycles, it was highly unlikely that he would succeed. It was these two Peerless Great Saints who pushed the decline of Xuan Huang's lineage."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lin Yuan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the specific exploits of the Emperor Xuan in the Chaotic Void, it was clear that he must have been extremely overbearing. To be addressed as "Your Majesty", how could he not be overbearing?</p><p></p><p>Since he was overbearing, he naturally made many enemies. These enemies did not dare to act against him when he was alive, but waited until he attempted to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, when he had no hope of escaping the time loop, to secretly orchestrate a wave of revenge.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the Demon Jade Pavilion Master's attempt to break through to the Thirteenth Realm was probably also due to this reason.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before each Great Saint attempted to break through to the Thirteenth Realm, they would arrange everything for their subordinates. Rather than saying that the lineage of Xuan Huang or the Demon Jade Pavilion was forced to decline, it was more accurate to say that they faded away into the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"These two Peerless Great Saints are coming, do they intend to completely erase the Xuan Huang Universe?" Lin Yuan asked.</p><p></p><p>"More or less," the Myriad Laws Eye nodded. "I didn't expect that even after three hundred million universe cycles, Hunxiao and Yulian still held a grudge."</p><p></p><p>Hunxiao Great Saint and Yulian Great Saint - these were the names of the two Peerless Great Saints, which had almost faded into the annals of history.</p><p></p><p>Only the Myriad Laws Eye, a unique existence, had witnessed the past and present of the Chaotic Void, and knew the details about them.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>He could suppress powerful Chaos Great Saints like Dual Source and Black Obsidian, but that did not mean he was equal to Peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's ability to achieve this was due to his near-flawless capabilities in areas like domain suppression and offensive techniques, which allowed him to completely dominate most Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>But if he truly faced off against Peerless Great Saints, Lin Yuan had no confidence at all.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Lin Yuan naturally would not choose to confront them head-on.</p><p></p><p>"What is your current location in the Xuan Huang Universe?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can get out within ten breaths, I can send you away before Hunxiao and Yulian arrive," the Myriad Laws Eye said.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye, as a unique existence, did not easily enter the areas governed by the rules set up by Emperor Xuan in the Xuan Huang Universe, and could only observe from the outside at most.</p><p></p><p>"Ten breaths?" Lin Yuan frowned, "I'm in the deepest part of the universe, I can't get out in ten breaths."</p><p></p><p>Not just ten breaths, even a hundred or a thousand breaths would not be enough for Lin Yuan to escape. It had taken him several months to travel from the entrance of the Xuan Huang Universe to the deepest mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>"Can't get out?" The Myriad Laws Eye looked at Lin Yuan. "You're still in the deepest part of the Xuan Huang Universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye also found this troublesome. "How were your gains in the Xuan Huang Universe?"</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye knew that Lin Yuan had obtained the inheritance of Emperor Xuan, and expected that he must have gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Not just "not bad", he had practically cleared out all the precious treasures and powerful weapons in the Xuan Huang Universe, even obtaining the personal weapon of Emperor Xuan himself.</p><p></p><p>"If it's just 'not bad', then I suggest you hand over all the gains you obtained in the Xuan Huang Universe. Then I'll step in, and Yulian and Hunxiao might give you a chance and let you go."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye said that even though Lin Yuan had obtained the inheritance of Emperor Xuan, he was ultimately not a member of Xuan Huang's lineage from that era.</p><p></p><p>As long as Yulian Great Saint and Hunxiao Great Saint took a step back and chose to have Lin Yuan hand over all his gains, they might not take drastic measures.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Laws Eye was related to the Thirteenth Realm of time life, so even if he could not directly intervene in the cause and effect of the Chaotic Void, the Peerless Great Saints would still be wary of him to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over all the gains?" Lin Yuan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The gains he had obtained in the Xuan Huang Universe were too great, how could he simply give them up? Lin Yuan naturally did not want to.</p><p></p><p>"If you really don't want to hand over the gains..."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Laws Eye also saw Lin Yuan's thoughts and immediately said, "Then I'll step in directly. But if you don't show any goodwill, Yulian and Hunxiao might not listen to me."</p><p></p><p>For Peerless Great Saints, the Myriad Laws Eye, as a unique existence, could at most be wary of, but not truly fear.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Myriad Laws Eye could not directly intervene, while the Peerless Great Saints had already reached the pinnacle of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Great Saints did not dare to provoke the Myriad Laws Eye, fearing it would draw the attention of the time life behind him, but the Myriad Laws Eye could not force a Peerless Great Saint to do anything.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to you," Lin Yuan said to the Myriad Laws Eye, his tone slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I can only try, I can't guarantee that Yulian and Hunxiao will listen to me," the Myriad Laws Eye said directly.</p><p></p><p>Over the long passage of time, he had formed good relations with many Peerless Great Saints, but to have them turn against two other Peerless Great Saints from over three hundred million universe cycles ago? It was difficult.</p><p></p><p>And it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Yulian Great Saint and Hunxiao Great Saint did not dare to cause trouble when Emperor Xuan was still alive, but this did not mean they were weak.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, Yulian Great Saint and Hunxiao Great Saint were considered powerful among the Peerless Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>To have persisted for so many universe cycles under the overwhelming pressure of an Emperor Xuan, this was not something an ordinary Peerless Great Saint could achieve.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xuan Huang Universe, two figures silently appeared.</p><p></p><p>These two figures stood there quietly, their presence undetected.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great Dao that governs the operation of the cosmos has all retreated, as a brand new great Dao originating from within has permeated and covered everything.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Sovereigns, shrouded in an invisible aura, are trembling and shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Yellow Universe?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the universe created by the Mysterious Emperor, it's been so long since we've felt such an aura."</p><p></p><p>The figure on the left, clad in a jade-like armor, with an ancient and weathered gaze, looked towards the entrance of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, and his voice resonated through the space-time, influencing the will and consciousness of all beings who heard it, causing them to become distorted, as if they were about to completely submit to the owner of the voice.</p><p></p><p>"Erase this Mysterious Yellow Universe, there won't be much of the Mysterious Emperor's remnants left in this Chaotic Void, and our fear in our hearts will also dissipate greatly, then we can attempt to breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm."</p><p></p><p>The other figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke first was the Jade Dragon Supremacy.</p><p>The next was the Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>"Attempting the breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm, the time loops we will face will not only be challenges we've never encountered before, but they will also target our mental weaknesses."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Dragon Supremacy said softly.</p><p></p><p>To these two peerless Supremacies, the Mysterious Emperor has become a demonic existence in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of tens of millions of universe cycles, the reason why these two peerless Supremacies have been relentlessly pushing for the annihilation of the Mysterious Yellow lineage is partly due to their hatred towards the Mysterious Emperor, and also to erase the traces of the Mysterious Emperor's existence, thereby weakening the obsession and demonic nature in their own minds.</p><p></p><p>Only by doing so can they increase the probability of successfully traversing the time loops.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's see what the Mysterious Emperor has left behind."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy looked at the Jade Dragon Supremacy and took the lead in entering the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Dragon Supremacy followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two peerless Supremacies entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, they were suppressed by the rules of the Mysterious Yellow Universe. But in an instant, the suppression originating from the source of the universe was diluted and neutralized.</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious Emperor, this is just one of the universes you've left behind, over the past tens of millions of universe cycles, the internal space-time has already begun to collapse, it's no longer a threat to us."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy's gaze was calm.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Emperor was still alive, they wouldn't dare to enter this created universe, no matter how bold they were.</p><p></p><p>But the Mysterious Emperor has already fallen into the time loops, and this created universe, relying on its innate operation and suppression, how could it possibly contend with them?</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, Lin Yuan's figure appeared, and at the same time, numerous avatars rapidly converged towards him from various parts of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan released the Mausoleum Spirit, "Can you still integrate the Mausoleum into the depths of space-time, just like before I arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"That kind of method of integrating into space-time can only be achieved if His Majesty personally intervenes."</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit hesitated slightly and shook its head, "Since you have already arrived and inherited everything from His Majesty, the Mausoleum naturally cannot be integrated anymore."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, has a problem arisen?"</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit also noticed the slight change in Lin Yuan's tone.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty's two adversaries, the Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy and the Jade Dragon Supremacy, have arrived." Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Those two?" The Mausoleum Spirit's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a 'spirit' created by the Mysterious Emperor, it also inherited some memories and was aware of the existence of these two peerless Supremacies.</p><p></p><p>"Before His Majesty's final breakthrough to the Thirteenth Realm, he had specifically sought them out and destroyed thirty-nine of their physical bodies, confirming the disappearance of their karmic ties before letting them go, but I didn't expect them to have survived."</p><p></p><p>The Mausoleum Spirit said.</p><p></p><p>"Does this universe have any other exits?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"I am only the Mausoleum Spirit, not the Spirit of the Universe." The Mausoleum Spirit said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could feel two auras different from the Mysterious Yellow Universe rapidly occupying the surrounding space-time, and in the blink of an eye, they had covered nearly half of it.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of Lin Yuan or the other Supremacies, after entering the Mysterious Yellow Universe, they had all merged their auras into the universe, but these two auras were making themselves superior to the universe, even beginning to replace the operation of the Mysterious Yellow Universe's great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately retracted the Mausoleum Spirit and began to contact the All-Dao Eye.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Jade Dragon Supremacy and the Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy descended to the deepest part of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, it's a remnant of the Mysterious Yellow." The Jade Dragon Supremacy glanced at Lin Yuan and immediately recognized the traces of the Mysterious Yellow evolutionary cultivation path on him.</p><p></p><p>From the moment they entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe until now, only ten breaths had passed, and the space-time suppression within the Mysterious Yellow Universe had not affected them at all.</p><p></p><p>"The two Supremacies." </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan spoke, with the universe's operation revolving around him, resisting the oppression of the two peerless Supremacies.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy looked down at Lin Yuan, a smile appearing on his face, "After so many universe cycles, we have erased many Mysterious Yellow remnants, and you are the strongest one."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spatial aura outlined a giant eye.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Empyrean, Jade Dragon." </p><p></p><p>The All-Dao Eye looked at the two peerless Supremacies.</p><p></p><p>It did not want to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe, but it was not unable to.</p><p></p><p>"The All-Dao Eye?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy's expression was puzzled. Other beings might not know the enmity between them and the Mysterious Yellow lineage, but the All-Dao Eye must be aware of it. "The Silver River and I have a karmic connection in the Myriad Dao Pavilion, can you let him go?"</p><p></p><p>The All-Dao Eye spoke, "Don't worry, I can make him swear that he will never participate in anything related to the Mysterious Yellow lineage in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Let him go?"</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy looked at the All-Dao Eye, his tone indifferent, "You really want to interfere in everything, don't you, All-Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Other matters can be negotiated, but not this one." </p><p></p><p>The Jade Dragon Supremacy said directly.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was not a peerless Supremacy, his strength was definitely at the peak of Chaotic Supremacies. Letting Lin Yuan go would be an unignorable hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>"We not only won't let him go, but we will also hunt down all of his true bodies and avatars."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy spoke.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because the Mysterious Emperor did not completely erase them that the two peerless Supremacies have been so relentlessly retaliating against the Mysterious Yellow lineage afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy naturally would not make the same mistake.</p><p></p><p>"Hunt down all of my true bodies and avatars?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to hand over his gains if he really had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Lin Yuan's growth rate, the Chaotic Empyrean Supremacy and the Jade Dragon Supremacy would at most be temporary custodians.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan breaks through to the Chaotic Realm and possesses the near-invincible strength of a Supremacy, he would naturally be able to easily reclaim them.</p><p></p><p>But to hunt down all of his true bodies and avatars?</p><p></p><p>"Do you really have to make things this absolute?" The All-Dao Eye did not expect the two peerless Supremacies to be so ruthless.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

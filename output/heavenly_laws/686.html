        <h1>Chapter 686</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The successful opening of the twelve particle worlds means that Lin Yuan can continue down this path.</p><p></p><p>Being able to open and maintain twelve particle worlds means he can open and maintain one hundred and twenty particle worlds, one hundred and twenty billion particle worlds, and even an infinite number of particle worlds.</p><p></p><p>However, this also gives rise to another problem.</p><p></p><p>That is the issue of resources.</p><p></p><p>The opening of these worlds is not done out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>It requires a massive amount of resources to support it.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the inner worlds and the universe, the particle worlds are much smaller, so the resource consumption will be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>But the sheer number of them is staggering.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has only opened twelve particle worlds, Lin Yuan can still support it, but what about one hundred and twenty particle worlds? Or one thousand two hundred particle worlds? "The Holy Sect of Azure Cloud?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of his own sect, the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud. Even though it had declined after the great calamity that shook the heavens and earth, its foundations were still very solid.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan could obtain all the resources of the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, it would indeed be able to support the opening of particle worlds for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>But this is only a temporary solution.</p><p></p><p>All the resources of one Holy Sect of Azure Cloud, even if they could support the opening of up to one thousand two hundred particle worlds, what then? Where would the resources come from to open ten thousand two hundred particle worlds, or one hundred and twenty thousand particle worlds?</p><p></p><p>And regardless, the Holy Sect of Azure Cloud is the sect of his original body, so Lin Yuan does not wish to take too much from it.</p><p></p><p>"I still need a stable way to obtain large amounts of resources," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>This Source World is naturally the most resource-abundant place in the heavens and earth, but now the Source World is also the place where the demonic energy is the most concentrated, with the traces of Source Demons often appearing there.</p><p></p><p>Before his strength has fully recovered to its peak, Lin Yuan is not too willing to go there.</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength has recovered to its peak, if he does not have the means to deal with the Source Demons, Lin Yuan is still not too willing to go there.</p><p></p><p>"The Door to the Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of using the resources from the first Source World to support his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He has an extraordinary status in the first Source World, and even the six Ancestral Founders would show him respect and help him obtain enough resources to open the particle worlds, which would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>But the key is that to transport items through the Door to the Myriad Realms as an "intermediary" to another dimensional space requires the expenditure of Dimensional Origin Force.</p><p></p><p>For example, Lin Yuan's previous several transits before reaching the twelfth level often involved transmitting the Origin Bell and the Mysterious Gourd to the transit world for his own cultivation, consuming a few strands of Dimensional Origin Force in the process.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a few strands of Dimensional Origin Force is not much, but it is limited to just sending in the Origin Bell and the Mysterious Gourd.</p><p></p><p>If the number of items increases, or the "quality" becomes greater, the consumption of Dimensional Origin Force will naturally skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>And the resources consumed in opening the particle worlds, how can it be compared to a mountain or an ocean? Relying solely on the Door to the Myriad Realms to transport them, the consumption of Dimensional Origin Force is estimated to be in the millions or even tens of millions of strands.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>How much Dimensional Origin Force has he painstakingly accumulated so far? Each strand is precious to him. If he has to consume so much Dimensional Origin Force just for opening the particle worlds, Lin Yuan would rather just cultivate directly in the first Source World.</p><p></p><p>"The resources for opening the particle worlds should still be obtained from this Source World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the cost of transporting resources through the Door to the Myriad Realms is simply too great, too much for him to bear.</p><p></p><p>"The resources of this Source World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the sky outside the Azure Cloud Holy Mountain. Since the great calamity that shook the heavens and earth, what has been the most abundant thing in this Source World? Demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Demonic energy permeating everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic energy?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became slightly grave. He had previously researched demonic energy and confirmed that it is an extremely high-level force. Otherwise, those who have fallen into demonic cultivation would not have seen such a sudden increase in their strength.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had not tried whether demonic energy could be transformed into energy and thus absorbed and consumed.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivators in this Source World had already tried it long ago, and demonic energy cannot be absorbed. Once forcibly absorbed, one would be corrupted by the demonic energy and become a demonic cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The hidden danger of demonic cultivation is something that all cultivators know about. As the degree of demonic corruption increases, the emotions of the demonic cultivator will gradually be eroded, until even their memories are quickly erased, turning them into a powerful, zombie-like "demon".</p><p></p><p>"Just because the cultivators in this Source World cannot absorb demonic energy, does not mean I cannot absorb it."</p><p></p><p>A strand of deep power began to weave between Lin Yuan's fingers, and it was demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Azure Cloud Holy Mountain, the dispersed demonic energy was everywhere, and Lin Yuan could easily obtain a strand of it.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed this strand of demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Direct absorption definitely won't work.</p><p></p><p>Demonic energy will directly erode one's mental will and determination.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's mental fortitude is strong enough to withstand it, there's no need to invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Taiji Diagram."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Yin-Yang Taiji Diagram appeared before him, a diagram of the Dao of Chaos that Lin Yuan had personally cultivated.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, he could directly catalyze and activate it.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum.</p><p></p><p>The black and white Taiji Diagram rotated, gradually permeating the surrounding layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan placed the strand of demonic energy right next to the Chaos Taiji Diagram.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji, with its black and white, like a grinding mill, began to devour that strand of demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji, originating from the Chaos, has the ability to transform all things into Chaos.</p><p></p><p>The strand of demonic energy was gradually ground and crushed by the black and white Taiji.</p><p></p><p>But after being ground, the demonic energy...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The essence had not changed, it was still demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>Then it was crushed again.</p><p></p><p>After repeating this process hundreds of times, that wisp of demonic qi finally transformed into a certain pure power.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the essence of demonic qi?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes gleamed as he carefully observed this pure power.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to absorb it.</p><p></p><p>"It can be absorbed and refined."</p><p></p><p>"It is very suitable for opening a particle world."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, and in this way, the biggest problem he faced in opening the endless sand particle world - the lack of resources - had been solved.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the pure power formed by the return of a wisp of demonic qi to its source is really too little."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the resources consumed in opening the endless sand particle world could not be supported by just a few wisps of demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that those demons..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind stirred, the so-called demons were essentially nurtured by concentrated demonic qi, the demons themselves were aggregates of extremely high-density demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>It could be predicted that the 'demons' refined by the Yin-Yang Great Grinding Wheel would be able to provide Lin Yuan with pure power far exceeding a few wisps of demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's go out and try it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved, and he immediately left Mount Qingyun silently.</p><p></p><p>During his years in the Qingyun Academy, with Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension, he had long since thoroughly researched the protective array of the Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Not only could he enter and exit Mount Qingyun without a sound, he could even directly master the entire Qingyun Array.</p><p></p><p>Outside Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>Demonic qi drifted.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully searched, and finally found a demonic spirit.</p><p></p><p>This demonic spirit, although not as majestic as the giant demon that attacked the mountain, was still hundreds of thousands of miles in size, crouching there, quietly inhaling and exhaling the demonic qi in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Not every demon likes to wander around, many 'demons' prefer to stay in a certain place and slowly exhale demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"It's you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the demonic spirit, a demonic spirit hundreds of thousands of miles in size? How many wisps of demonic qi did it contain?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the composition of the demonic spirit, which was a congregation of high-density demonic qi. Once this demon was refined by Lin Yuan, who knows how many resources it would be equivalent to.</p><p></p><p>"Quick victory."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the huge demonic spirit in the distance and directly activated the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji Diagram to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>This demonic spirit, which had been peacefully sleeping, suddenly felt its inhalation and exhalation of demonic qi being interrupted, and immediately became enraged.</p><p></p><p>'Demons' do not have thoughts, but they do have simple ideas and thoughts, such as curiosity? Such as anger? The so-called great demon attacking the mountain was the great demon's curiosity about Mount Qingyun, and then it tried to attack, but later found no change and lost interest and turned away.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan activated the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji Diagram, and as a disciple of the Qingyun Sect, his strength was already at the peak of the 11th level. In the past few years, after Lin Yuan took over the cultivation, his true strength had already recovered to the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the Sovereign Realm, activating the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji Diagram, not only this demonic spirit, even a great demon would have to flee.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>This demonic spirit hundreds of thousands of miles in size was suppressed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Refine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan brought the demonic spirit into his cosmic space, and immediately activated the Chaos Yin-Yang Taiji Diagram to continuously crush it.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The huge demonic body of the demonic spirit quickly disintegrated and was soon transformed into the purest power, which Lin Yuan quickly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually quite similar to those who have fallen into demons now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself as he swallowed and absorbed the pure power transformed from demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that while both are devouring demonic beings, the power Lin Yuan absorbs is the purest state after being crushed by the Chaos Taiji Great Grinding Wheel, which will not have any adverse effect on himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with the methods of this source world, there must be similar ways, like Lin Yuan, to refine demonic beings and then absorb them.</p><p></p><p>However, in this way, the demonic qi transformed into the purest power, there is no such effect of rapidly improving one's strength.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in this world lack not resources, but the strength to resist demonic beings.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan successfully refined that demonic spirit.</p><p></p><p>"It should be enough for me to open more than 300 particle worlds."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, just one demonic spirit had such an effect, then those great demons or even source demons? How much help would they be to Lin Yuan? Of course, for the time being, Lin Yuan would only target demonic spirits and great demons, as for source demons? Even if he recovered his full strength, Lin Yuan would not easily attack the source demons.</p><p></p><p>According to the conclusions Lin Yuan drew from the many ancient books and scrolls he had seen in the Qingyun Academy.</p><p></p><p>The so-called source demons are very likely to have some connection with the legendary Demon God.</p><p></p><p>Rashly refining the source demons might attract the attention of the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's guess is correct, the Demon God of this source world would be equivalent to a 13th level time life.</p><p></p><p>And judging from the performance of many demonic beings, the Demon God is probably not very intelligent either, not as smart as the Six Great Ancestors, who would observe Lin Yuan's future timeline in advance and choose to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately chose to return to Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>The demonic spirit he had just refined provided him with enough powerful energy to cultivate for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>And so it went.</p><p></p><p>Every now and then, Lin Yuan would quietly leave Mount Qingyun and go out to hunt 'demons' to provide for the opening of one particle world after another.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a thousand years had passed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

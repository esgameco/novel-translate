            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 489 Uploading the Eleventh Realm of the Martial Dao (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"Has it been discovered?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not panic and quickly retracted his perception. </p><p></p><p>As long as the other party's space-time fusion rule had not reached the seventh realm, at most they would only vaguely sense Lin Yuan's peeking, let alone locking onto Lin Yuan's position?</p><p></p><p>It was basically impossible to do so.</p><p></p><p>This was the advantage of the space-time fusion rule, the initiative was completely in Lin Yuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>If he was not worried that the Jie Clan might use some means to attack him through the space-time, Lin Yuan would not have even retracted his perception.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Jie Clan's domain, in the unknown land, in front of the mysterious wooden hut.</p><p></p><p>The figure that pushed the door open stood there, looking around with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from inside the wooden hut, as if in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that there is a powerful expert peeking at us." The figure standing outside the wooden hut said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Peeking at us?" The voice inside the wooden hut was silent for a while, "The ancestral hut is the foundation of our Jie Clan, the young Twelfth Realm experts in this universe era, do they have the ability to discover the existence of the ancestral hut?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestral hut was the strongest foundation of the Jie Clan, and it was also the reason why they had survived from the previous universe era to this one.</p><p></p><p>"I really feel that I have been peeked at." The figure outside the wooden hut affirmed, "To be able to discover the existence of the ancestral hut, it must be at least at the peak of the Depart Dao Realm, and they must also rely on a powerful space-time treasure to do so."</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Depart Dao Realm," the voice inside the wooden hut said solemnly, "it's still early before the end of the universe era, how could there already be Twelfth Realm experts at the peak of the Depart Dao Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Normally, it was very difficult for a complete universe era to produce a Twelfth Realm expert at the peak of the Depart Dao Realm. Even if one was produced, it would generally be near the end of the universe era, when the current time had not even passed one-tenth of a complete universe era, there was no condition for the birth of a peak Depart Dao Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"If it's not at the peak of the Depart Dao Realm, who else could discover the ancestral hut?" The figure outside the wooden hut said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Even if one possessed a powerful space-time treasure, they would still need to have the corresponding realm and space-time comprehension to activate it.</p><p></p><p>And the latter threshold was the peak of the Depart Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, reaching the seventh realm of space-time comprehension could also achieve this.</p><p></p><p>But the seventh realm of space-time comprehension was much more difficult than the peak of the Depart Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Neither the voice inside the wooden hut nor the figure outside it thought in this direction.</p><p></p><p>"The figure that walked out of the wooden hut should be one of the two Twelfth Realm experts of the Jie Clan," Lin Yuan quickly retracted his perception and thought quickly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Jie Clan only had two Twelfth Realm experts, but they suppressed the other eleven peak clans and groups, because these two Twelfth Realm experts were at the peak of the Depart Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Jie Clan poses no threat to me." Lin Yuan pondered for a while, the two Twelfth Realm experts of the Jie Clan, while having the strength to suppress other Twelfth Realm ultimate experts, did not dare to go all out.</p><p></p><p>Because the true enemies of the Jie Clan's two Twelfth Realm experts were the Cosmic Consciousness, if they went all out, they would be directly suppressed by the Cosmic Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm Consciousness could mobilize the power of the Immortal Realm to suppress even the Ancestor of the Dao of Immortals at the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The vastness of the cosmos was a hundred times that of the Immortal Realm, and the Cosmic Consciousness could easily suppress peak Depart Dao Realm life forms.</p><p></p><p>After gaining a general understanding of the cosmic starry sky, Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and he came to a large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Spatial Rift."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the rift that connected the outside of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"My perception can cross the spatial rift." Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and a figure emerged in the vast chaotic void outside the universe, which was Lin Yuan's avatar.</p><p></p><p>"It has not been affected by the backlash of the universe." Lin Yuan constantly observed the surrounding situation.</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm ultimate existences were not allowed to leave the cosmic starry sky, but that referred to their true body and main spirit.</p><p></p><p>If it was just an avatar, carrying little energy, it could still leave.</p><p></p><p>But the meaning was not very great.</p><p></p><p>Even for Twelfth Realm ultimate experts, if their space-time comprehension was only at the sixth realm, even if they sent out an avatar to leave the universe, they could not go too far.</p><p></p><p>Once they exceeded a certain range, the connection with their true body and main spirit would be cut off, and this avatar would collapse.</p><p></p><p>And in the chaotic void, there was pervasive chaotic qi, and relying solely on the power of the avatar, it would be difficult to resist the erosion of the chaotic qi, let alone maintain it for long.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was different.</p><p></p><p>The seventh realm of space-time comprehension allowed Lin Yuan to maintain the connection between the avatar and his true spirit even at a great distance.</p><p></p><p>And after mastering the Chaos Dao, Lin Yuan's avatar was actually condensed from chaotic qi, so entering the chaotic void would be like a fish in water, and he wouldn't have to worry about being eroded.</p><p></p><p>"I can use the avatar to explore the chaotic void." </p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face, the boundless chaotic void contained countless opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was that external cosmic light, or the white paper containing a two-dimensional world, or the many treasures that had fallen into the universe from long ago, they all originated from the chaotic void outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Once Lin Yuan could explore the chaotic void in advance, the help to himself would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the chaotic void did contain countless opportunities, but it was also very dangerous, but Lin Yuan was only using an avatar to explore, if he really encountered an unstoppable danger, he could just disperse the avatar.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the universe, Lin Yuan looked back at the huge celestial body.</p><p></p><p>Even in the vast chaotic void, the universe was an extremely huge celestial body, as powerful as the main...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Overlord of the Realm could not do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>In terms of scale, the universe was on the same level as the Chaos Realm Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan paused for a moment, immediately choosing a direction and exploring the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Primordial Spirit usually stationed here.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, his mind recalling the details of the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Immortal Realm, Lin Yuan had already fully developed and perfected the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>For the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao, Lin Yuan had specially established tens of thousands of spatio-temporal fusion rule models, as well as many other rule models.</p><p></p><p>This was one of Lin Yuan's greatest harvests in the Immortal Realm. The countless hundreds of millions of pillar-level fusion rules, and his understanding of the essence of many rules, surpassed that of the Almighty Ones of human civilization, allowing him to accomplish things that even the Almighty Ones had never done before.</p><p></p><p>Establishing spatio-temporal fusion rule models from the First Realm to the Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With these rule models, the cultivation path of future Martial Dao cultivators will be much easier."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, with rule models to guide the way, it was equivalent to having the right direction and taking a shortcut, making the journey unimaginably easier.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the spatio-temporal fusion rule models established by Lin Yuan were not only applicable to Martial Dao cultivators, but other evolutionary cultivators could also refer to and draw inspiration from them, though the effects might not be as significant as for Martial Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Lin Yuan could imagine the impact of the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao on human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Currently, human civilization had not even perfected a complete time rule model, and the existing time rule models, even if fully comprehended, could not penetrate the essence of time.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had taken it a step further, establishing spatio-temporal fusion rule models, from the First Realm to the Fifth Realm?</p><p></p><p>"It's about done."</p><p></p><p>After repeatedly contemplating and confirming that the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao had no omissions, Lin Yuan directly connected to the Wisdom Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Tenth-Level Citizen, the great scholar Lin Yuan, the Wisdom Goddess is honored to serve you."</p><p></p><p>The solemn and cold voice of the Wisdom Goddess rang out.</p><p></p><p>"I want to upload the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao." Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao," the Wisdom Goddess paused briefly before responding, "Esteemed Tenth-Level Citizen, the great scholar Lin Yuan, you can upload it now."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Wisdom Goddess finished speaking, Lin Yuan began uploading the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao that he had meticulously organized.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous First Tier to Tenth Tier of the Martial Dao, the upload speed of the Eleventh Tier was much slower, mainly because the content and information it contained were too vast.</p><p></p><p>Even the simplest spatio-temporal fusion rule model occupied information space that was thousands or even tens of thousands of times greater than the previous First Tier to Tenth Tier of the Martial Dao, let alone the more than 30,000 spatio-temporal fusion rule models established by Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>In addition to the spatio-temporal rule models, there were also various other rule models, including those that were more niche.</p><p></p><p>It took more than ten minutes for Lin Yuan to complete the upload of the entire Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Tenth-Level Citizen, the great scholar Lin Yuan, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Goddess, having received all the content of the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao, immediately began contacting the Almighty Ones of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Even when Lin Yuan had developed the Ninth Tier, the Wisdom Goddess was unable to make the most objective judgment on the Martial Dao cultivation path, and needed the opinions of the Almighty Ones.</p><p></p><p>The Eleventh Tier was even more so.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world, majestic figures gradually appeared on the nine thrones.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao? That little fellow, the Lord of the Milky Way, has already fully developed and perfected the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I'm curious to see what the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao developed by the Lord of the Milky Way is like."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the previous First Tier to Tenth Tier were truly impressive."</p><p></p><p>In no time, the nine Almighty Ones of human civilization had all gathered, their expressions filled with interest.</p><p></p><p>"You old fellows." Xia Qin, the Almighty One, rolled his eyes. "Don't put too much pressure on the Lord of the Milky Way, the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao is, after all, just the Eleventh Tier."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin was not belittling Lin Yuan, but compared to the boost that the upload of the Ninth Tier and Tenth Tier had brought to the Martial Dao cultivation path, the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao might not be as significant as imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao cultivation path was already ranked tenth on the human civilization evolution ranking, with the nine Almighty cultivation paths above it.</p><p></p><p>Even if the "updated" Eleventh Tier was added, the ranking would still be tenth, unable to surpass any of the Almighty cultivation paths.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin himself could not even imagine how the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao was developed and perfected to match the previous First Tier to Ninth Tier.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Qin, you do seem to be protective of the Lord of the Milky Way."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Deity Almighty One smiled and said, "Since that's the case, let's all just observe the Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao normally, without too many expectations."</p><p></p><p>The other Almighty Ones, hearing this, exchanged glances and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>While they were chatting, the Wisdom Goddess had already sent the complete Eleventh Tier of the Martial Dao to each of the Almighty Ones.</p><p></p><p>"The Eleventh Tier"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin, the Almighty One, was the first to observe it, and a trace of nervousness actually arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, after just a few breaths, Xia Qin's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"This?!"</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

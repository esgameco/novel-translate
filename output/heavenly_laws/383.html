        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Only able to reveal an insignificant trace of spirituality.</p><p></p><p>The bronze compass that Lin Yuan possessed was like this, as was Tuobagu Shen's inner armor, and Pei Shen's jet-black iron staff.</p><p></p><p>However, after carefully sensing this silver mirror, Lin Yuan discovered the vast fluctuations of space contained within.</p><p></p><p>"Space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn. To contain such a degree of spatial fluctuations in this two-dimensional world, what would it be like in the main universe?</p><p></p><p>"This mirror is quite extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"But what is the use of this mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried for a while, using methods like blood and others, but still made no discoveries.</p><p></p><p>"Tuobagu Shen must have only recently obtained this mirror," Lin Yuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had pursued Tuobagu Shen for so long, during which the other party desperately fled, never using this mirror.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be deduced that Tuobagu Shen also did not know the abilities of this mirror. Otherwise, in a life-or-death situation, what means would he not employ to stay alive?</p><p></p><p>"Slowly."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't figure it out here."</p><p></p><p>"Once I take it out, I'll eventually understand."</p><p></p><p>The silver mirror was suppressed by the two-dimensional world, unable to exhibit its many wondrous uses.</p><p></p><p>As long as Lin Yuan could take it out, all problems would naturally be solved.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan still couldn't figure it out, he could inquire with the spirits of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm and the humanoid stone statue Shen Ji in the Devil Jade Space.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Yuan solemnly put away the silver mirror and took out Tuobagu Shen's inner armor.</p><p></p><p>This inner armor was very light. Lin Yuan put it on and vaguely felt his limbs and torso being protected by some force.</p><p></p><p>Wearing the inner armor, any strikes on Lin Yuan's body would be blocked by the armor itself. Even the residual force that seeped through would be dispersed and diluted.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Tuobagu Shen was so hard to kill," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Wearing this inner armor practically maxed out his defensive abilities.</p><p></p><p>"If I take this inner armor to the outside world, who knows what kind of power it would have," Lin Yuan's spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>Among all types of weapons, defensive weapons are far more precious than offensive ones. After all, survival is always the top priority, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>"The only downside is that the head is not protected," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The inner armor only covered the limbs and torso, but not the head. Unless there was a corresponding helmet, the head would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>And in this two-dimensional world, there was no concept of reviving after decapitation. Once the head was blown apart, no matter how strong, one would die.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as a fatal weakness, every powerful being from the myriad races would pay attention. When facing Lin Yuan's pursuit, Tuobagu Shen had carefully protected his head.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the head was a fatal weakness, the skull was also the hardest bone in the body. When tempering their flesh, powerful beings from the myriad races placed great importance on tempering their bones.</p><p></p><p>To directly blast apart the skull and head, even beings of the same level would find it very difficult.</p><p></p><p>"There's also no avoiding penetration," Lin Yuan thought. He had killed Tuobagu Shen by penetrating his flesh before the final explosion.</p><p></p><p>"This silver mirror can serve as a heart protector."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the mirror and placed it on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't understand the use of the silver mirror, the mirror itself was extremely hard and indestructible, a common trait of all 'wondrous items' in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>With the silver mirror as a second layer of defense, at least Lin Yuan's heart would be better protected than other areas.</p><p></p><p>And with Lin Yuan's attainment in the 'Evergreen' cultivation method, as long as it wasn't his heart, head, or other vital organs, any other damaged organs could recover.</p><p></p><p>"Iron staff."</p><p></p><p>After donning the inner armor and heart mirror protector, Lin Yuan looked towards the jet-black iron staff.</p><p></p><p>The ability of the jet-black iron staff was simple - it was strength. With the same strike enhanced by the jet-black iron staff, the power would surge two to three times.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate this increase. In this two-dimensional world, improving strength was extremely difficult. A two to three-fold increase would allow a powerful being of the myriad races to raise their level by several ranks.</p><p></p><p>"It's just too big and conspicuous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked the jet-black iron staff, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the compact inner armor and silver mirror, the jet-black iron staff could not be concealed at all. Nearly two meters long, it would stand out no matter where it was placed.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why wondrous items in the two-dimensional world could not be refined. Otherwise, with the nature of these items, adjusting size at will would be the most basic ability.</p><p></p><p>"Being big doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment. After all, this iron staff provided the most direct boost to his strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the inner armor? Unless in dire straits, Lin Yuan didn't think he would need to use it.</p><p></p><p>The inner armor enhanced Lin Yuan's survival ability, but in this world, there were extremely few existences that could force Lin Yuan to retreat for his life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, Lin Yuan's strength would increase at an ever-faster pace, and such powerful beings would quickly disappear.</p><p></p><p>"This operation was a complete success."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan summed up the gains from this endeavor.</p><p></p><p>First, he had avenged his grievances, causing Tuobagu Shen to suffer a fundamental loss of part of his spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Tuobagu Shen was originally a special life form at the fifth rank of the eleventh stage. His chances of breaking through to the ultimate concept were already slim. Now that he had lost part of his spiritual will, it could be said that it was not unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Tuobagu Shen had cut off any hope of reaching the ultimate realm. Not that he couldn't try to break through, but any attempt would lead to death, with almost no chance of success.</p><p></p><p>This act of severing Tuobagu Shen's future path and hope was Lin Yuan's retaliation for being deceived before.</p><p></p><p>His good friend Fang Qing had practically died at Tuobagu Shen's hands as well. Although revived by a supreme being, the grievance had been sown.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had the ability, he naturally would not let the other party off.</p><p></p><p>Next were the three wondrous items he obtained, which comprehensively enhanced Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Defense, offense, plus the 'foresight' from the bronze compass - Lin Yuan had become an all-rounded warrior without any shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>If he could unlock the abilities of the silver mirror and wield spatial arts, then Lin Yuan could roam freely in this two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these gains were not limited to the two-dimensional world. As long as Lin Yuan could successfully return to the main universe, the gains would multiply tremendously.</p><p></p><p>The three wondrous items were equivalent to three twelve-star divine treasures and weapons. Just thinking about it filled Lin Yuan with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the nineteenth stage of the Shaman Ancestor realm is approaching."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought inwardly. He had already lingered at the eighteenth stage of the Shaman Ancestor realm for some time and had many insights into the nineteenth stage ahead.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan contacted Lin Yuan in time to inform him of the major events occurring in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>This was something Lin Yuan had requested, as he had been hiding in the Luochuan gathering place for a long time, far from the core circles of the two-dimensional world, and was not well-informed about much of the intelligence.</p><p></p><p>So he had asked Deputy Tower Master Nalan to do this.</p><p></p><p>Although confident that with his incredible comprehension he could surpass even those legendary lifeforms who had perfected the eleventh stage, Lin Yuan was not so arrogant as to ignore everything.</p><p></p><p>"A major event, a major event."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan's expression was grave. Upon seeing Lin Yuan, he quickly spoke, "A mysterious expert not weaker than the nine great experts has emerged in the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom was rather inconspicuous among the twelve ancient kingdoms, with many powerful beings of the myriad races scattered there but never producing any extraordinary experts.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Tuobagu Shen and the other special lifeforms had targeted the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to pick the softest persimmon.</p><p></p><p>And among the twelve ancient kingdoms, the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom was undoubtedly the soft persimmon.</p><p></p><p>However, they never expected that this time, Tuobagu Shen and the other special lifeforms would suffer such a major setback.</p><p></p><p>"That mysterious expert from the Bloodrain Ancient Kingdom is terrifyingly powerful. With bare hands, he killed Tuobagu Shen and Pei Shen, who both wielded wondrous items!"</p><p></p><p>Deputy Tower Master Nalan's tone was full of amazement. Although at the same eleventh stage, there was a vast gap between him and Tuobagu Shen and Pei Shen. If he encountered them in the two-dimensional world, he might not even be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened quietly on the side. He was the mysterious expert Deputy Tower Master Nalan spoke of, but he did not intend to reveal this for now.</p><p></p><p>There was no benefit, and it would only attract unwanted attention.</p><p></p><p>"This time, many powerful experts have also fallen into the two-dimensional world and are hiding to cultivate. Four..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings and the other eight powerful beings were just a small part of them."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Chief Nalan's expression was pensive. Over the past hundred-plus years, he had witnessed the Four Celestial Kings and the other eight powerful beings, as well as the recent battle from the ancient nation of Bloodrain. </p><p></p><p>Deputy Chief Nalan had almost given up on the idea of his avatar leaving the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>What a joke?</p><p></p><p>To leave the two-dimensional world, he would have to compete with the Four Celestial Kings and that mysterious powerful being from the ancient nation of Bloodrain.</p><p></p><p>But what did he, Deputy Chief Nalan, have to compete with those freaks?</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are many powerful beings hiding in the dark," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Among the many powerful beings who had fallen into the two-dimensional world, there were certainly many who shared similar thoughts as him.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful beings would focus solely on cultivation in the early stages, only revealing themselves after the Heavenly Gate opened.</p><p></p><p>"However, even though some powerful beings are hiding in the dark, the Four Celestial Kings, the mysterious powerful being, and others are undoubtedly the strongest circle in the two-dimensional world," Deputy Chief Nalan said.</p><p></p><p>Revealing one's identity prematurely did not necessarily make one weaker than those who hid their identities; it was just a different approach.</p><p></p><p>"Where does that mysterious powerful being rank among the current top powerful beings in the two-dimensional world?" Lin Yuan suddenly became curious and wanted to know his own strength level.</p><p></p><p>"I knew you would ask that," Deputy Chief Nalan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He was not puzzled by Lin Yuan's question. In fact, most of the powerful beings from various races in the two-dimensional world were curious about the mysterious powerful being from the ancient nation of Bloodrain.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't be curious about a powerful being who was unknown before revealing himself, but then suppressed everyone after emerging?</p><p></p><p>"According to the latest ranking of powerful beings, this mysterious powerful being is currently ranked sixth," Deputy Chief Nalan said as a virtual screen appeared in front of him, which he then pushed towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth?" Lin Yuan looked down at the ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Deputy Chief Nalan nodded. "In fact, I think this mysterious powerful being's ranking should be even higher because he has revealed himself too few times."</p><p></p><p>"He has never fought against any of the other top-tier powerful beings. His strength cannot be fully displayed based solely on the battle where he crushed the special lifeform Tuobagu Guishen."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Chief Nalan explained that the ranking of powerful beings in the two-dimensional world was based on multiple factors.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful beings had experienced countless great battles, allowing their true strength to be fully exhibited, so their rankings were more accurate.</p><p></p><p>However, the ranking of the mysterious powerful being from the ancient nation of Bloodrain was based solely on the battle where he pursued and crushed Tuobagu Guishen and other special lifeforms, so his ranking was bound to be lower.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, even with this, the mysterious powerful being was still ranked sixth, which showed the impact of that battle.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings?" Lin Yuan briefly scanned the ranking, where the top powerful being among all races was still the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>The ranking of powerful beings from various races had been around for over a hundred years. The top nine powerful beings from the early days were vastly different from the current top nine, with almost an entirely new set of beings.</p><p></p><p>Only the Four Celestial Kings had occupied the number one spot since the ranking first appeared, never wavering.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings' most famous battle was undoubtedly when they swept through the Tianyu race, even breaking through this peak race.</p><p></p><p>That battle also established the Four Celestial Kings' formidable reputation, with an even greater impact on the outside world, almost causing several Tianyu patriarchs to go berserk.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings are extremely powerful," Deputy Chief Nalan said. "And the Four Celestial Kings are different from us."</p><p></p><p>"Different?" Lin Yuan was slightly curious.</p><p></p><p>He knew very little about the Four Celestial Kings, these legendary eleventh-level perfected lifeforms from the Stellar Alliance who were currently the most promising candidates to become the ultimate eleventh-level lifeforms in the universe.</p><p></p><p>"I just heard about this," Deputy Chief Nalan pondered. "For us powerful beings, whether human evolvers or powerful beings from other races, our physical forms were reduced in dimension after falling into this two-dimensional world, taking on the appearance of the mainstream human race in that world."</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Some special lifeforms, whose original bodies were tens of thousands or even millions of miles in size, were directly suppressed to between one and three meters after falling into the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Their forms were also affected in this way.</p><p></p><p>They would not appear in any strange or bizarre shapes.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you know why the Four Celestial Kings have four arms?" Deputy Chief Nalan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Four arms?" Lin Yuan looked at Deputy Chief Nalan.</p><p></p><p>"All powerful beings from various races, after falling into the two-dimensional world, would conform to the appearance of the mainstream human race in that world – one head, two legs, two arms, two eyes, one nose, one mouth."</p><p></p><p>"But the Four Celestial Kings have four arms."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Chief Nalan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...?" Lin Yuan had a vague guess in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Four Celestial Kings' two extra arms, as well as their powerful weapons, are actually fused with their bodies as supreme weapons."</p><p></p><p>"Due to the spiritual nature of these supreme weapons, even the two-dimensional world could not completely suppress them, allowing the Four Celestial Kings to have four arms."</p><p></p><p>Deputy Chief Nalan said.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>When he first saw the Four Celestial Kings with four arms, Lin Yuan had been puzzled but didn't think too much about it, assuming the extra two arms were just an anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"So the Four Celestial Kings are different from us. Their power not only comes from their personal strength but also from the enhancement of their supreme weapons," Deputy Chief Nalan continued.</p><p></p><p>The biggest difference between the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapons and the black iron rod Lin Yuan obtained was that the former were perfectly suited for the Four Celestial Kings.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapons came from outside this world, rather than being obtained by chance within the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>A supreme weapon that was completely compatible with its wielder could unleash far greater power than other powerful beings could imagine.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why, despite not taking any action other than sweeping through the Tianyu race over a hundred years ago, the Four Celestial Kings had remained ranked first.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder," Lin Yuan now felt some pressure.</p><p></p><p>With two hundred years remaining until the Heavenly Gate opened, would he truly be able to surpass the Four Celestial Kings, who possessed supreme weapons that were perfectly matched to them?</p><p></p><p>"Over a hundred years ago, the Tianyu race must have realized this point, desperately wanting to kill the Four Celestial Kings when they were still relatively weak," Deputy Chief Nalan said. "That great battle involved not only the Tianyu race but also other peak races secretly instigating it."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, some powerful human civilization beings had also secretly asked us to observe and, if possible, take the opportunity to kill the Four Celestial Kings."</p><p></p><p>"But after witnessing the Tianyu race's defeat, the powerful human civilization beings lost their nerve and didn't take any further action."</p><p></p><p>"In this new ranking, the mysterious powerful being from the ancient nation of Bloodrain has squeezed into sixth place, while the 'Latter Zhu' from the Demon Race has dropped to tenth," Deputy Chief Nalan said, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Latter Zhu' from the Demon Race was merely an ordinary eleventh-level lifeform, but by relying on that blood-colored long blade, he had forcibly occupied one of the top nine positions for over a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>In a barren desert in the two-dimensional world, a man holding a blood-colored long blade sat there.</p><p></p><p>"My ranking has dropped to tenth, so it seems that in terms of publicly known strength, I'm no longer considered part of the top tier," said the man, who was the 'Latter Zhu' from the Demon Race.</p><p></p><p>"People outside think that I was able to become one of the top nine powerful beings purely by luck, borrowing the light of this strange object."</p><p></p><p>The Latter Zhu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings also relied on a supreme weapon, but other powerful beings accepted it.</p><p></p><p>Because even without the supreme weapon, the Four Celestial Kings' personal strength alone made them eleventh-level perfected legendary lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Four Celestial Kings' supreme weapon didn't come from the two-dimensional world but was brought in from the Stellar Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But him, the Latter Zhu?</p><p></p><p>He was just a lucky one.</p><p></p><p>Without this blood-colored long blade, he would be nothing.</p><p></p><p>So over the years, among the top nine powerful beings, the Latter Zhu from the Demon Race had been the subject of the most rumors and ridicule.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Latter Zhu had dropped out of the top nine, he could almost predict that he would face even more mockery.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, over these years, I've abandoned everything and devoted my entire mind and body to comprehending this blood-colored long blade. I've already comprehended nine great killing moves within it," the Latter Zhu sneered coldly. The profundity of this blood-colored long blade exceeded his expectations, and the terrifying killing intent contained within made even the Latter Zhu's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Just wait."</p><p></p><p>"Wait until two hundred years later, until the Heavenly Gate opens. I will make you all understand my true strength, the strength of the Latter Zhu."</p><p></p><p>The Latter Zhu took a deep breath. As an eleventh-level lifeform, he naturally understood the principle of patience. For all the powerful beings from various races who had fallen into this two-dimensional world, their only goal was the opening of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>And he, the Latter Zhu, was also waiting for that day.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

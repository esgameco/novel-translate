        <h1>Chapter 708</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the hidden world, several sect leaders and many high-level figures immediately became tense.</p><p></p><p>Even though the hidden world had various contingency plans set up by the Eternal Lords to deal with unexpected situations, at this moment everyone still felt uncertain. </p><p></p><p>After all, this was a Demon God.</p><p></p><p>The demon disaster, and even the Eternal Lords being trapped, were all deeply connected to it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>"The great Infinite Lord has already left measures in place. The Demon God cannot break in."</p><p></p><p>The sect leader of the Eternal Infinite Sect forced himself to calm down and said to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Before the great changes in heaven and earth, the Eternal Lords had observed countless future timelines, including many where Demon Gods descended outside the hidden world and launched attacks.</p><p></p><p>Preparations had been made for this long ago.</p><p></p><p>If Demon Gods could easily break through the hidden world and erase the contingency plans of the many Eternal Lords, this source world would have already fallen under the endless demonic energy long ago.</p><p></p><p>How could it have persisted until now?</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"The future Eternal Lords must have already predicted this scene."</p><p></p><p>"We just need to wait calmly. Once the Demon God realizes it can't do anything, it will surely leave."</p><p></p><p>The other Eternal Sect leaders also nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after experiencing the initial panic, everyone quickly regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God was certainly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But the Eternal Lords were not so easy to deal with either.</p><p></p><p>In a clash of schemes between 13th level time beings, it was difficult to determine a winner in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The most likely outcome was continued stalemate, waiting for variables to appear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood to the side, not overly worried.</p><p></p><p>He was very clear about the defensive capabilities of this hidden place.</p><p></p><p>Protected by at least eleven defensive Eternal Treasures, even a Demon God could not overcome it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God standing under the sky moved.</p><p></p><p>It took two light steps, black energy flows spreading between heaven and earth. The black flows surged, faintly carrying an extreme intent of destruction and annihilation, covering and enveloping the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>"This move?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>During the great changes of heaven and earth, the Demon God had relied on this move to shatter the attempts of several major Eternal Sects to expel the demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>Those black energy flows looked formless and intangible, but possessed extremely strong corrosive and destructive power. Anything that wasn't a defensive Eternal Treasure had to retreat in the face of these black flows.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Outside the hidden world, a black hole vortex faintly formed.</p><p></p><p>The black hole vortex slowly rotated, swallowing large amounts of black energy flows.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Treasure of Lord Black Void?" Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>That black hole vortex was indeed an Eternal Treasure, originating from the Eternal Lord Black Void.</p><p></p><p>Lord Black Void, like Lord Wushan, was an Eternal Lord who acted alone and had not established an Eternal Sect force.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, in order to help the beings of this source world resist the demon disaster, he still left many contingency plans in the hidden world. This black hole vortex that continuously devoured black energy flows was from Lord Black Void.</p><p></p><p>The black hole vortex was like an abyss, endlessly swallowing the black energy flows.</p><p></p><p>And under the protection of the black hole vortex, the hidden world naturally remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>If the black hole vortex could only be used for defense, the major Eternal Sects would not have been so hopelessly defeated in the face of the Demon God during the great changes of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky, the Demon God's empty gaze looked down, showing no reaction to the black hole vortex that continuously devoured the black energy flows.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum~</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's aura grew increasingly profound. The single horn on its forehead suddenly condensed into an extremely heavy black dot. The moment the black dot condensed, the surrounding space-time began to collapse and be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"This move?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the hidden world, several Eternal Sect leaders were slightly uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Among the arrangements left by the Eternal Lords, there were also means to block this move of the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>But now this Demon God first used black energy flows, then the profound black dot, making the sect leaders sense something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>The black dot on the Demon God's horn transformed into a deep black light, piercing towards the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Outside the hidden world, a green barrier immediately rose up, vast and mighty, blocking this deep black light.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's expression was indifferent. The pitch-black giant tail behind it swung, lashing towards the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a simple lash, without any profound rules or mysteries, space-time was shattering. Under absolute power, any rules or laws would be easily broken.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire hidden world shook slightly under the gentle lash of the Demon God's pitch-black giant tail, but quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>The hidden world itself was a defensive Eternal Treasure, able to greatly resist external attacks, especially as this defensive treasure was specifically aimed at Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>First were the black energy flows.</p><p></p><p>Then the black light from the horn.</p><p></p><p>Finally the lash of the giant tail.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God then launched dozens more attacks.</p><p></p><p>However, they were all blocked by the defensive contingencies arranged by the Eternal Lords inside the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the many high-level figures of the Eternal Sects finally breathed a huge sigh of relief. It seemed the Eternal Lords were still a step ahead. No matter how powerful the Demon God was, it was still firmly blocked by the contingency plans arranged by the Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom boom boom!!</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's relentless...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the attack was temporarily unable to shake the hidden world, its aftershocks spread in all directions across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of power?" In a supreme holy sect, the sect master and several senior elders looked at the center of the world with shocked gazes.</p><p></p><p>Even though separated by an infinite distance, they could clearly feel the terrifying power spreading.</p><p></p><p>"Demon God, it's the Demon God taking action," the supreme holy sect master said with certainty.</p><p></p><p>They didn't have eternal treasures to lock onto the Demon God's aura, but based on the power erupting at this moment, there was basically no other possibility besides the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope the eternal sects can withstand it."</p><p></p><p>The supreme holy sect master thought silently to himself. Not long ago, because of Lord Yinhe's appearance sweeping away various "demons" in all directions, their supreme holy sect had barely managed to catch a breath.</p><p></p><p>"I hope nothing happens to Lord Yinhe," the supreme holy sect master's gaze showed concern.</p><p></p><p>With the Demon God emerging, it probably wouldn't last long. The great demons in this world would still have to rely on Lord Yinhe.</p><p></p><p>As for those eternal sect forces? It would be extremely good if they didn't draw strong experts from their holy sects and supreme holy sects.</p><p></p><p>"Demon God."</p><p></p><p>On Qingyun Holy Mountain, the holy sect master sensed the terrifying fluctuations at the center of the world from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yinhe shouldn't have gone to the center of the world. Now that the Demon God has taken action, who knows if those few eternal sects can resist."</p><p></p><p>The holy sect master sighed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had protected Qingyun Holy Sect for thousands of years. The holy sect master had long treated Lin Yuan like an ancestral patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Now with the situation at the center of the world becoming extremely dangerous due to the Demon God's actions, if anything happened to Lin Yuan, the consequences would be so severe that the holy sect master didn't dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God's descent and continued attacks caused tremors that drew the attention of holy sects and supreme holy sects scattered across the world.</p><p></p><p>But for now, these forces could only pray in their hearts - pray that the eternal sects could endure, and that the Demon God would quickly go back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>As for doing more?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>With the foundations of holy sects and supreme holy sects, even if they went all out, they probably couldn't even get close to the center of the world. They would be overwhelmed and suppressed by endless demonic qi along the way.</p><p></p><p>In the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the several eternal sect masters and many high-level members were quite calm.</p><p></p><p>So far, all of the Demon God's attack methods were within the predictions of the various Eternal Lords.</p><p></p><p>And the arrangements of the hidden world proved this point - all of the Demon God's attacks had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the several sect masters began to change.</p><p></p><p>Because the Demon God under the sky showed no signs of stopping at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it kept attacking the hidden world.</p><p></p><p>The sect masters knew their own situation well.</p><p></p><p>Although each of the Demon God's attacks had been blocked,</p><p></p><p>And the hidden world itself seemed flawless,</p><p></p><p>The cost to the several great eternal sects for blocking each of the Demon God's attacks was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the black hole vortex or the cyan barrier, activating and operating them required mountain-like and sea-like resources to support.</p><p></p><p>At the Demon God's current attack intensity, it would only take several million or tens of millions of years to exhaust the several great eternal sects to death.</p><p></p><p>By then, even with numerous eternal treasures, there wouldn't be enough resources to activate them.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>"In the scenes predicted by the great Eternal Lords, there was no scene of the Demon God attacking continuously for so long."</p><p></p><p>"Right, the longest attack time was only a few days. Now it's been several months, how is the Demon God still attacking?"</p><p></p><p>The several sect masters were starting to panic internally.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still a long time until the day their foundations would be exhausted after several million or tens of millions of years,</p><p></p><p>If the Demon God really persisted in attacking like this, it was only a matter of time before the hidden world was broken.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood quietly to the side, listening to the low discussions of the several sect masters.</p><p></p><p>The sect masters did not avoid discussing these things in front of Lin Yuan, so Lin Yuan also understood the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"The many Eternal Lords did not see a future timeline of the Demon God's sustained attacks?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful. "Is it because I caused the future timeline to change?"</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan had descended over ten thousand years ago, that was long after the Eternal Lords could no longer interfere with the outside world. Their observations of future timelines were based on before the great changes in the world.</p><p></p><p>So they couldn't see traces of Lin Yuan's existence.</p><p></p><p>Even less could they observe the timeline of Lin Yuan sweeping away countless demons.</p><p></p><p>And sweeping away countless demons caused the Demon God to become enraged, abandoning its instinctive method of suppressing the origin world, and attacking the hidden world with full force.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Yinhe, deep in the hidden world, there is a teleportation array connected to the edge of the world. You should leave first."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Infinite Sect Master turned to look at Lin Yuan and said.</p><p></p><p>In the many timelines seen by the Eternal Lords, there were scenes of the hidden world being breached.</p><p></p><p>It was just in the very, very distant future.</p><p></p><p>So based on this situation, some arrangements were also made.</p><p></p><p>Namely, setting up teleportation arrays to transfer the sect elites before the hidden world was breached.</p><p></p><p>"Leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Demon God standing under the sky outside, pondered for a moment, and said: "Actually, there is a way to deal with the Demon God."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

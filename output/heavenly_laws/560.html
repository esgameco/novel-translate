            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>King Lingwei was thinking to himself, "In another million years, the Emperor will abdicate, and a new Emperor will be selected from among the various royal princes."</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Yidao Boundary realm basically do not have a lifespan limit, and to become the Emperor of an ancient country, their strength must be far beyond the Yidao Boundary, no matter how weak they may seem.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Emperors of the various ancient countries in this source world can only reign for a maximum of 300 million years. Beyond 300 million years, they must abdicate, and a new Emperor will be selected from the candidates.</p><p></p><p>"I have no prestige, no strength, and only a million years' time. I can't possibly become an Emperor candidate."</p><p></p><p>King Lingwei has always harbored the ambition to become the Emperor of an ancient country. The ancient country's Emperor wields the priceless treasures bestowed by the Ancestor, which greatly benefits their own cultivation and the continued refinement of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The Tianzun-level experts may not value the royal clan, but they absolutely dare not look down on the ancient country's Emperor, as that is almost equivalent to being the 'spokesperson' of the Ancestor in the ancient country.</p><p></p><p>"If I lack prestige, I'll have to increase my prestige, and the simplest way is to expand the territory of the ancient country."</p><p></p><p>King Lingwei's gaze was deep, and he set his sights on Qingfan City, which was the center of dozens of large domains he had been arranging for many years.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qingfan Domain falls into his hands, it will quickly sweep across the surrounding dozens, even hundreds of large domains.</p><p></p><p>By then, having conquered dozens or hundreds of large domains for the ancient country, even with his limited experience, he will become the most formidable Emperor candidate.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness wants to start a war?" Zihui Marquis asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" King Lingwei glanced at Zihui Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, it's just that war requires a lot of time to prepare," Zihui Marquis said.</p><p></p><p>If they had followed the original plan, they would have taken Qingfan City in half a day or even less. But war? The mobilization and other preparations for war would require a huge amount of time, and the other side would also make preparations, leading to repeated clashes. Even with the highest efficiency, from preparing for war to launching it, it would still take hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>"Then hurry up and make the preparations," King Lingwei frowned, then looked at the other figures, "All of you be ready to take action in this war."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The various figures immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>As a royal prince, King Lingwei has the right to initiate a war. Of course, having the right to start a war is one thing, but if the war is ultimately lost, causing great damage to the ancient country, King Lingwei will have to bear all the responsibility. On the other hand, if the war is won, King Lingwei will also reap great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Even so, none of the royal princes take the decision to start a war lightly, as the risk is too great, and whether they can actually win is another matter. King Lingwei is resorting to this risky move in order to quickly increase his own prestige.</p><p></p><p>In Qingfan City, Lin Yuan was cultivating in the Fentian Courtyard when he was suddenly summoned by Qingfan Marquis to the Marquis' Residence.</p><p></p><p>There, Lin Yuan saw two figures engaged in a friendly conversation - Qingfan Marquis and a middle-aged man with a calm and serene aura, who Lin Yuan recognized as the renowned Daxun, Red Leaf.</p><p></p><p>Red Leaf Daxun was not a feudal lord of any ancient country, as he did not like to be constrained. His cultivation had reached the peak of the Daxun realm, having mastered the Dao of Chaotic Fire and Chaotic Life.</p><p></p><p>"Virtuous One, Red Leaf Daxun is quite interested in your Myriad Formation Crystal," Qingfan Marquis said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan greeted Red Leaf Daxun respectfully. He could sense the two powerful auras within the Daxun - the scorching heat of the Chaotic Fire and the vibrant life force.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Dao of Chaotic Life as fuel to ignite the Chaotic Fire, the strength of this Red Leaf Daxun is truly formidable," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had reached the Daxun realm through various foundational methods, his understanding of the Dao was still inferior to these true Daxun experts. Especially Red Leaf Daxun, who was at the peak of the Daxun realm and not far from the Tianzun level.</p><p></p><p>The three Daxun-level experts exchanged some pleasantries, then sat down. Lin Yuan presented the Myriad Formation Crystal, and Red Leaf Daxun examined it with great interest, recognizing it as the legendary artifact.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction was completed smoothly, Red Leaf Daxun said to Qingfan Marquis before leaving, "Qingfan, you must have put in a lot of effort to cultivate such an outstanding disciple."</p><p></p><p>Qingfan Marquis was suddenly a bit evasive, as in reality, he had not put in much effort at all, only providing resources.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I should also find a disciple to inherit what I have learned," the Venerable Red Leaf sighed with a touch of emotion.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan completed the transaction and returned to the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>"These resources will be enough for me to cultivate for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan scanned the abundant resources in his bracelet. The Venerable Red Leaf was indeed willing to part with them to obtain the Crystal of the Ten Thousand Arrays.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was only at the Qi Dao realm, the consumption of resources by someone at his level was countless times more than a cultivator of the same realm. The stronger the cultivation, the more energy one needs to consume - this was an iron law.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will begin closed-door cultivation until I break through to the Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts gathered. After witnessing the Venerable Red Leaf's strength, he still felt considerable pressure.</p><p></p><p>His own strength had reached the Venerable realm, but it was still not enough compared to a peak Venerable like the Venerable Red Leaf.</p><p></p><p>"The Sovereign Realm, with my strength, as long as I break through to the Sovereign Realm, I won't be too far behind the Venerable Red Leaf."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's confidence surged. If he could break through to the Chaos Realm and refine all the inherited legacies to the extreme, he might even be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Heavenly Venerable Saints.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void.</p><p>The ancient Minghe Chaos Continent, the Star Tear 'Shard World'.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and every detail of the world entered his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I have perfected ninety-nine cultivation paths, each of which can reach the Twelfth Realm, and a small portion even have the potential to break through to the Sovereign Realm or even the Chaos Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. So far, he had given nine of these cultivation paths to the nine strongest experts of human civilization, and the remaining ninety paths had already begun to spread among the countless citizens of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Ninety-nine cultivation paths, covering almost half the directions, would be enough for human civilization to use for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Spreading the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes closed, and in the depths, he seemed to sense another space. It was filled with countless points of light, each representing a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, far from enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. As his strength increased and his realm advanced, he felt more and more that the so-called cultivation path and the path of evolution were essentially progressing in the dark.</p><p></p><p>Those who came later had the paths opened up by their predecessors to guide them, but what about the pioneers who opened those paths? They had no so-called direction, no so-called correct path, and everything was a groping advance in the dark, with the risk of losing their way at any time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, locking onto one's own 'anchor' becomes extremely important, and the countless cultivators are a kind of 'anchor' for Lin Yuan, transcending time and space, and even life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Spreading the cultivation paths only within human civilization is still too slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought. How many citizens did the entire human civilization have? Even if they all cultivated the Dao, it would be difficult to form an 'anchor' large enough to fix Lin Yuan, this vast life form.</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of All Paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of this mysterious force, spread across countless Chaos Continents, even crossing numerous Void Domains.</p><p></p><p>If he could leverage the influence of the Hall of All Paths, it would be much easier to spread the cultivation paths.</p><p></p><p>"I should go to the Hall of All Paths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made up his mind. The Hall of All Paths not only sold various cultivation paths, but also collected them.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>In the Star Tear 'Shard World', Lin Yuan condensed a clone and descended towards the ancient Minghe Chaos Continent below.</p><p></p><p>"The Hall of All Paths?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly approached the Hall of All Paths, gazing at the magnificent pavilion before him.</p><p></p><p>"Formidable."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined the Hall of All Paths. Each time he observed it, he had a different experience. After breaking through to the Twelfth Realm, his essence of life had transcended, and he could sense the terrifying nature of the Hall of All Paths even more.</p><p></p><p>The records left by the Xuanhuang lineage described the Hall of All Paths as something to be avoided at all costs, unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>Even the peerless Heavenly Venerable Emperor was extremely wary of the Hall of All Paths.</p><p></p><p>Of course, as long as any being follows the rules set by the Hall of All Paths, they will generally not have any problems, which is why Lin Yuan dared to come.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the Hall of All Paths is terrifying, but at its core, it is a place of fair trade.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly entered the Hall of All Paths.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Hall of All Paths was bustling with activity. Many Twelfth Realm beings were coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Some Twelfth Realm beings entered the Hall to find a suitable cultivation path for their future generations, while others wanted to exchange their current path for a new one.</p><p></p><p>Many Twelfth Realm beings were stuck in bottlenecks, unable to break through to the next level, even though their understanding of the rules, their physical bodies, and their souls had all reached the threshold of advancement. The main reason was that their current cultivation path was not perfectly suited to them.</p><p></p><p>If they could exchange for a more suitable path, although they would have to bear the risk of 'scattering the Dao', they would have a better chance of further advancement.</p><p></p><p>Rustling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued walking deeper, and the heaven and earth transformed. Soon, he arrived in an independent space, with countless runes floating in the surrounding void.</p><p></p><p>"Please select your purpose: 1. Purchase cultivation paths, 2. Sell cultivation paths, 3. Other."</p><p></p><p>A flat, emotionless voice sounded in Lin Yuan's ear.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Sell cultivation paths."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chose the second option.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the emotionless voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"Place the cultivation path you wish to sell on the platform."</p><p></p><p>In front of Lin Yuan, a platform entirely made of black stone appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought for a moment and took out a jade slip, which recorded a certain cultivation path of the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation path, called the Dao of Life and Death, was specially perfected by Lin Yuan, different from the Dao paths he had created for human civilization. It was almost applicable to any being with a physical body and flesh.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The jade slip floated on the black stone platform.</p><p></p><p>The deeper layer of the Hall of All Paths.</p><p></p><p>An old man holding a wine gourd was soundly asleep.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old man seemed to be awakened, muttering, "Another cultivation path with the potential to reach the Sovereign Realm has appeared, I need to confirm it."</p><p></p><p>As the hall master of this Hall of All Paths branch, the old man usually didn't bother with most matters, but when it came to collecting cultivation paths, he needed to personally confirm any that had reached a certain level.</p><p></p><p>The Hall of All Paths required the payment of Chaos Stones to collect cultivation paths, so he had to conduct multiple confirmations.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The old man stretched and yawned. "This cultivation path is called the Dao of Life and Death? Cultivating the power of life and the power of death to evolve the physical body and spirit."</p><p></p><p>The old man became more and more interested as he examined it. He vaguely felt that this cultivation path might have potential beyond just the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it doesn't have the ultimate Twelfth Realm foundation."</p><p></p><p>The old man sensed it roughly, thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not quite sure about this." The old man was slightly puzzled. He could feel that this cultivation path was perfect in the details, so it shouldn't have just Sovereign Realm potential.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a Chaos Realm cultivation path?"</p><p></p><p>The old man estimated. "No, since it involves the Chaos Realm, I'd better have the All-Seeing Eye examine it."</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye, which controlled the operation of all the Hall of All Paths branches, had the ability to project the gaze of the All-Seeing Eye in every Hall of All Paths branch.</p><p></p><p>The main Hall of All Paths Pavilion was located in the most mysterious part of the Chaotic Void, and it was said to be the place where the All-Seeing Eye was established.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable Emperor had made many conjectures about the All-Seeing Eye, ultimately believing that it might be a secret treasure left behind by a certain Thirteenth Realm time being.</p><p></p><p>"The myriad laws, the myriad paths, nothing is beyond its reach."</p><p></p><p>The old man holding the wine gourd stood up and entered an octagonal hall, then activated the runes floating in the void.</p><p></p><p>In no time, a vortex gradually appeared in front of him, and from within the vortex, a massive eye gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The All-Seeing Eye."</p><p></p><p>The old man greeted it respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The massive eye, with golden pupils, looked down upon the old man.</p><p></p><p>"This is a cultivation path."</p><p></p><p>The old man did not waste any words, directly placing the Dao of Life and Death in front of himself.</p><p></p><p>The massive pupils of the All-Seeing Eye slowly rotated, gazing at the Dao of Life and Death.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the golden pupils of the All-Seeing Eye deepened, and a timeline of the Dao of Life and Death began to unfold, extending endlessly into the Chaos.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation path?"</p><p></p><p>The All-Seeing Eye seemed to have sensed something, and its massive pupils slightly contracted.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 560</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan looked at the two perplexed ancestral gods and casually said, "Your knowledge is still too limited."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever heard of wave-particle duality?"</p><p></p><p>"In a world called the Blue Star, many ordinary men and women have mastered this skill."</p><p></p><p>"I can be the Yin God, the Realm Lord, or even the Purple Palace... Why can't I coexist?"</p><p></p><p>It's just like the Tang Nui inequality - accepting a gift does not mean agreeing.</p><p></p><p>I am the Realm Lord, but that does not mean I am only the Realm Lord, I can also be the Purple Palace! You cannot define me!</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao were even more bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Has Qi Yuan's brain been cultivated to madness?</p><p></p><p>At this point, this is the only explanation.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't think too much about it, as a vast and mighty aura swept through at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, fifteen majestic figures descended from the heavens, each emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these fifteen people, Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao's faces tensed up.</p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods! </p><p></p><p>The Yang Gods of the Black Heaven and Black Earth had arrived! Fifteen mighty Yang Gods hovered in the sky, their presence shaking the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Such a large-scale battle was rarely seen in the Stellar Realm, apart from the frontlines of the Void Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Qi Yuan? Come out and meet your death!" a solemn, undeniable voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant, before the people of the Kui Jin Realm could react, a lazy voice covered them.</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct my mortal transformation, I shall kill without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a kitchen knife slashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, the Chaotic Stellar Realm... is under my control!"</p><p></p><p>The ordinary kitchen knife cut down, but the earth did not crack, the mountains and rivers did not crumble, not even a ripple stirred the wind.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the fifteen mighty Yang Gods were shattered and fell.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies reformed, but they were met with the same unrelenting knife strike.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan glanced at the fifteen Yang Gods with disdain: "They're too useless, with so little Ominous Qi, they can be killed with just a stick of incense."</p><p></p><p>The kitchen knife hung in the sky, slashing down one by one, killing the fifteen Yang Gods.</p><p></p><p>If these fifteen Yang Gods had enough Ominous Qi to continuously revive, this single knife strike could last for three thousand years, endlessly slaying and resurrecting the Yang Gods until they were utterly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This place would become a forbidden land or a cosmic wonder, worthy of mankind's reverence.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao's pupils shrank dramatically.</p><p></p><p>What had they seen? What was this? He... was truly the Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>How was that possible?</p><p></p><p>"How can you be so strong?" Shangguan Qingmiao blurted out involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Wood Universe, there could not possibly be a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>To prove one's status as a Realm Lord, one must sacrifice all the Mandate Bearers.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... from another universe? Even more impossible.</p><p></p><p>His mind was in turmoil, unable to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Why am I so strong?" Qi Yuan paused, then said, "Because I understand the Art of War, and I excel at using strength to overcome weakness, so I am undefeatable in battle."</p><p></p><p>Shangguan Qingteng and Shangguan Qingmiao felt the air suddenly grow colder, not just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Because after telling his cold joke, Qi Yuan would deliberately make the air colder to match.</p><p></p><p>Without further addressing the two, Qi Yuan said indifferently, "Those who obstruct my mortal transformation, I shall kill without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Yuan's figure became hazy and ethereal.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Stellar Realm, hundreds and thousands of worlds overlapped or were hidden in the dust motes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mighty Dao voice echoed from countless worlds.</p><p></p><p>"From this day on, I shall have the final say in the Chaotic Stellar Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The vast voice resounded across the land, heard by all living beings in the Chaotic Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many were puzzled, including the Crimson Thorn Blood members.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to be so bold?"</p><p></p><p>Black Heaven and Black Earth Yang Gods surged into the sky, like flowing light.</p><p></p><p>However, they were met with a colossal hand.</p><p></p><p>The hand came from nowhere, covering the sky and sky, as if space and time flowed through it.</p><p></p><p>The Black Heaven and Black Earth Yang God turned deathly pale, his aura instantly extinguished, only to revive and be extinguished again.</p><p></p><p>This occurred in countless realms in the Chaotic Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Mighty hands descended, slaughtering all Ominous Spirits and Ominous Gods.</p><p></p><p>Even Yang Gods with infinite Ominous Qi revival were slain by Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked up at the sky, their faces filled with shock and amazement.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>They did not understand, but they knew that from this day on, the heavens above the Chaotic Stellar Realm had changed.</p><p></p><p>In the Qing Shan Realm, the game had begun.</p><p></p><p>A colossal hand descended, and all Ominous Spirits were crushed and destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"So you dared to steal my drone, seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's palm slapped down, instantly reducing a Heaven-level Ominous Spirit to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, the Ominous Spirits that had once terrorized the Qing Shan Realm were all slaughtered and exterminated.</p><p></p><p>Many looked up at the sky, their eyes filled with fear and horror.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mighty existence is this?"</p><p>"A celestial being?"</p><p>"A god has descended?"</p><p>"Brother-in-law? Is that Brother-in-law's voice?" someone exclaimed joyfully, like a fool.</p><p></p><p>Others were amazed, for the overbearing and extraordinary voice in the sky was indeed too familiar.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Imperial City, a beautiful and petite woman heard the voice in the sky, her eyes flashing with wild delight: "Cai Lao?"</p><p></p><p>As the one who had transformed into the Realm Lord, Qi Yuan could hear any voice related to him, even if he was countless miles away.</p><p></p><p>When he heard "Cai Lao", he couldn't help but make a face.</p><p></p><p>However, being a person of quality, he couldn't be bothered to pay attention.</p><p></p><p>His gaze seemed to transcend time and space, falling on Shen Lingfeng in Feng Shan Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Tell my mother-in-law that Ling Xuan is safe with me now."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng's eyes shone with joy: "It really is you, Brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and tell my mother-in-law that I'm no longer the small, useless son-in-law I used to be, I won't be fetching her bathwater anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Brother-in-law!" Shen Lingfeng was very excited.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Shen Residence, the Shen Family patriarch and his wife saw the giant hand in the sky, and like ordinary people, they were filled with fear of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, the Shen Family matriarch had a strange feeling: "Dear, do you feel like that voice sounds familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"Careful with your words, don't provoke this mighty existence!" the Shen patriarch hurriedly said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence could not be fathomed by common logic.</p><p></p><p>The Shen matriarch saw this and did not speak further, but she was still puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shen Lingfeng rushed in.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother... Brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Shen matriarch immediately understood that her foolish son had also recognized that the voice sounded like Qi Yuan's.</p><p></p><p>The Shen matriarch quickly said, "Don't talk nonsense, that's not your brother-in-law!"</p><p></p><p>"It is Brother-in-law! It's definitely him!" Shen Lingfeng said happily. "Just now, Brother-in-law told me that the voice in the sky is his!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Lady of the Shen Family and the Master were both stunned, their bodies frozen.</p><p></p><p>"So it really is Qi Yuan?" "Your brother-in-law also said that he is no longer the small son-in-law from before, and won't be pouring your bathwater anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a spiritual manifestation appeared, falling into the Sunset Cliff and ultimately entering the Mystic Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's spiritual manifestation looked at the magnificent and desolate Mystic Wood Abyss, an odd expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Blind girl?"</p><p></p><p>He softly called out.</p><p></p><p>This voice contained the Domain Lord's understanding of the rules, a sound that could reach any corner and awaken the comatose.</p><p></p><p>But just like last time, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual manifestation swept its gaze across everything, finally revealing a look of helplessness in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, even after becoming a Domain Lord, I still cannot uncover the truth."</p><p></p><p>At the Domain Lord realm, one controls the universal rules.</p><p></p><p>Nothing in the universe can evade detection.</p><p></p><p>But in the Mystic Wood Abyss, all that Qi Yuan's eyes saw was the unknown. </p><p></p><p>Broken colorful lines, overlapping digital chaos, messy and disorderly, like primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand to touch it, but alas, it was all illusory.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan closed his eyes, listening intently.</p><p></p><p>"The eyes cannot see, but what about the ears?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan recalled the soundless voice.</p><p></p><p>It did not exist in the world, as if no one could hear it.</p><p></p><p>Only his special abilities might be able to faintly perceive it.</p><p></p><p>Clad in white robes, he stood in the Mystic Wood Abyss.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he murmured, "I hear the sounds of the clouds, the rain, and the soundless thunder."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan opened his eyes, his gaze turning desolate.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he inexplicably felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Qi Yuan flipped his hand. </p><p></p><p>A tree leaf fell into his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This leaf was obtained in the Anomalous Realm, a primal fragment for forging luminous divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the leaf, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Radiant Hall.</p><p></p><p>Jade towers and palaces, like an immortal abode.</p><p></p><p>"That fool Wu Dong... actually died in the Mystic Wood Universe."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's gaze flickered like stars.</p><p></p><p>She hailed from the Radiant Universe, the second strongest of the Stepping Heaven Five.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Little Fengti, is that Qi Yuan really that powerful?" the tall woman asked Fengti.</p><p></p><p>The Fengti before her was not the true Fengti, only a copy, a copy of the Stepping Heaven Five's Fengti.</p><p></p><p>So the tall woman called him "Little".</p><p></p><p>Fengti's gaze was profound: "If you want to know, go challenge him yourself."</p><p></p><p>He had no memory of the previous events.</p><p></p><p>But even he, bearing the Nine Lives, was slain. This meant Qi Yuan's strength far surpassed his own.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for having to obstruct those wastes of the Black Firmament, this young lady would have gone to challenge that so-called Qi Yuan long ago. You... have really brought shame to our Radiant Universe." the tall woman said.</p><p></p><p>At their level, having lived for so many years, their thoughts were free and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>"You're afraid." Fengti said, "Wu Dong died for no reason, even the Domain Lord of the Eon couldn't save him."</p><p></p><p>"Have you gone senile from cultivation? Wu Dong's death is definitely related to the Black Heavens, how could you think a native of the Mystic Wood Universe could..."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's words were abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>A hoarse, desolate voice resounded through the Radiant Hall.</p><p></p><p>"All members, prepare to evacuate, leave the Chaotic Star Realm immediately."</p><p></p><p>The tall woman's face showed confusion: "Old man, what's wrong? Have the Black Heavens and Black Firmament broken through the Void Sea defenses and invaded the Chaotic Star Realm?"</p><p></p><p>As a noble, she could naturally ask the Palace Master of this Radiant Hall.</p><p></p><p>"A Domain Lord has appeared in the Chaotic Star Realm, staying here would only lead to our deaths." the Palace Master replied.</p><p></p><p>"A Domain Lord... how is that possible? Has the Domain Lord of the Black Heavens and Black Firmament arrived? Is Yuanshi dead?" the tall woman was astonished, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Although her talents were extraordinary, Domain Lords were still beings she had to look up to.</p><p></p><p>A Domain Lord's will could easily annihilate her.</p><p></p><p>"It is not the Domain Lord of the Black Heavens, but a Domain Lord born in the Mystic Wood Universe. His name is Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Fengti has even encountered him before, when Fengti went to the Azure Mountain Realm, he was slain by him."</p><p></p><p>"The Lord of the Eon has confirmed this? Wait... slain Fengti?" the tall woman was filled with a sense of absurdity.</p><p></p><p>The person she wanted to challenge... was a Domain Lord?</p><p></p><p>And the Mystic Wood Universe... how could it produce a Domain Lord?</p><p></p><p>All of this was too bizarre, or rather, beyond her comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry and leave this place, otherwise... even a Domain Lord's intervention won't be able to save us!"</p><p></p><p>The tall woman did not hesitate, she also knew that retreat was the wisest choice now.</p><p></p><p>If she was too late, she might not even make it out alive.</p><p></p><p>That was a Domain Lord, in some ordinary universes, the Domain Lord could be the strongest being.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Domain Lord Three Wood had a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Fengti, stop cultivating, there is an important matter."</p><p></p><p>Fengti emerged from his cultivation, looking at Three Wood: "Old Three Wood, what's the matter this time?"</p><p></p><p>He was cultivating well, preparing to break through to the third layer of the Yang God Realm, the Domain Lord Realm.</p><p></p><p>But this old Three Wood kept coming to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember the person I told you about last time, the one who defeated... your copy?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the native of the Mystic Wood Universe. A true genius." Fengti said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Not just a genius... he has already broken through to the Domain Lord Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple was defeated?" Fengti's calm eyes revealed a gloating expression.</p><p></p><p>"Not just defeated, he died. Moreover, I sought the help of the Domain Lord of the Eon, but could not retrieve his true spirit." Three Wood said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you came to find me, this matter is indeed strange." Fengti said.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a minor matter, the most important thing is, that person... named Qi Yuan, has now reached the Domain Lord Realm."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" Fengti's eyes showed shock.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the special true spirit residing in Fengti's body also trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>Fengti's divine light flickered as he sensed something: "Such a major event... the Dao Patriarch will likely be interested, but it has nothing to do with me, who hasn't even reached the third layer of the Yang God Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fengti waved his sleeve, as if sending someone away.</p><p></p><p>Three Wood left grumbling.</p><p></p><p>A puzzled voice rang in Fengti's ears:</p><p></p><p>"Strange... why didn't I know the Mystic Wood Universe produced a new Domain Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this something special?"</p><p></p><p>"Very special, very strange." the voice echoed faintly, "The more special and strange, the more dangerous. Fengti... you should leave the Radiant with me."</p><p></p><p>"Staying in the Radiant, you can never step into the Domain Lord Realm."</p><p></p><p>"You've been stuck at the second layer of the Yang God Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Just like... the destruction of the Mystic Wood Universe has already been determined."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

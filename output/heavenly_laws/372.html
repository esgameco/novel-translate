        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan finally regained consciousness. </p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed his surroundings and found himself lying in a narrow room.</p><p></p><p>"Me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan massaged his brow. Before his consciousness fell into a coma, he saw a 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>A 'white paper' that squeezed in from the permanent space crack.</p><p></p><p>Then after that.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt a violent change in space-time, some kind of supporting point was collapsing.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan restored the connection with his true original self, feeling slightly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What about the space layers?"</p><p></p><p>"And the numerous fluctuations in rules?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan found it hard to believe that at this moment, he could not sense the slightest fluctuation of rules.</p><p></p><p>And the space layers? Not only could he not perceive any trace of space rules, there were no space layers at all.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this realm only had an extremely thin single layer of space.</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>If there were no space layers, it meant the world was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>How could an incomplete world accommodate the descent of a tenth-rank life form like himself?</p><p></p><p>Even if it could barely contain him, with just a thought from him, it should be enough to tear everything apart, but now, Lin Yuan did not have that feeling at all.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>"There are still many space fluctuations, the space layers still exist."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was puzzled in his heart. How could the place where the Sun Primordial Mind resided not even have fluctuations of space rules?</p><p></p><p>It should be known that time and space are the basic pillars that constitute the space world, other rule fluctuations can be shielded and suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But time and space cannot be shielded or suppressed.</p><p></p><p>For example, inside the Black Planet, one could only sense the corresponding fused rule fluctuations, but apart from that, one could still vaguely sense space fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"The Paramount One."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately contacted the Paramount One.</p><p></p><p>"You and all the lifeforms on the battlefield have fallen into that white paper," the Paramount One Xia Qin said upon seeing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Everything near that white paper will automatically 'descend dimensions'. Only twelfth-rank lifeforms can resist it," Xia Qin said. "But don't worry, I'm trying to find a way to pull you out."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Paramount One."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan roughly understood the predicament of the Sun Primordial Mind.</p><p></p><p>Inside the white paper scroll.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded.</p><p></p><p>"So now I'm inside that white paper, forcibly descended in dimensions, no wonder I can't sense any rule fluctuations," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"Even the inner world within my body has been directly compressed into a plane," Lin Yuan examined himself and found that his inner world had completely disappeared, leaving only a faint trace.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body, my power, my soul, have all been forcibly reduced to the extreme," Lin Yuan carefully sensed for a moment, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"However...the Door of All Realms is still there," Lin Yuan's consciousness sank into his mind, gazing at the still towering and majestic Door of All Realms.</p><p></p><p>Even in this two-dimensional world inside the white paper, the Door of All Realms still emanated a supreme aura, completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>"A two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lin Yuan had encountered such a world.</p><p></p><p>In the previous nine traversals through the Door of All Realms, although he went to other dimensions, the dimensional levels he traversed to were on the same level as the main universe's dimension. As for lower dimensions, Lin Yuan had never come into contact with them before.</p><p></p><p>"That white paper, actually able to automatically reduce everything around it to two dimensions, the Primordial Chaos is truly wondrous, even having such an extraordinary object."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not panic, but waited for the Paramount One's reply instead.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if he had not invested a great deal of resources into this Sun Primordial Mind body, Lin Yuan would have wanted to simply annihilate this avatar and leave right away.</p><p></p><p>However, being pulled out by the Paramount One was naturally a better outcome.</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waited for a moment.</p><p></p><p>And saw the Paramount One Xia Qin again.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his initial calmness, Xia Qin's expression was now grave.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is a bit troublesome."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount One looked at Lin Yuan and said solemnly, "The level of that 'white paper' is too high, we cannot refine it, nor can we interfere with it."</p><p></p><p>The implication was:</p><p></p><p>He could not pull Lin Yuan out.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just abandon that avatar."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although he was quite curious about the two-dimensional world inside the white paper,</p><p></p><p>In the current situation without detailed information, Lin Yuan naturally dared not linger inside.</p><p></p><p>What if he encountered the karmic killing force of that Extracosmic Aurora? That would be even more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Although that Extracosmic Aurora could only curse lifeforms below the tenth rank, and Lin Yuan had left behind a good deal of his essence blood in the Xuanhuang Secret Territory,</p><p></p><p>With the Xuanhuang Secret Territory's ability to block karma, even if the Paramount One tried to curse him, he could easily block it.</p><p></p><p>But who could say for sure about matters of the Primordial Chaos?</p><p></p><p>So it was better to leave as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>A noble person does not stand beneath a precarious wall.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely do not do that," the Paramount One shook his head. "Some other races have already tried it, self-detonating the avatars that fell into the white paper."</p><p></p><p>"But the result..."</p><p></p><p>The Paramount One paused here, then continued, "They found that those self-detonated avatars could never be recovered."</p><p></p><p>"Never be recovered?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was startled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the avatar method was to split off a portion of one's own spiritual will, and then use that spiritual will as the core to derive a second physical body.</p><p></p><p>For any lifeform, the spiritual will was the most core part. Only with the same spiritual will could there be shared memories and a unified consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Enjoy.</p><p></p><p>But in order to maintain the connection between the separated spiritual will and the true self, </p><p></p><p>The total amount of spiritual will is fixed.</p><p></p><p>For example, a tenth-level expert has ten points of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>Separating two points of spiritual will forms a spiritual clone.</p><p></p><p>After that, the true self's spiritual will will be eight points. </p><p></p><p>The spiritual clone's spiritual will is two points.</p><p></p><p>If another two points of spiritual will are separated to form a second spiritual clone,</p><p></p><p>Then the true self's spiritual will becomes six points.</p><p></p><p>The two spiritual clones each have two points of spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why most experts only have one spiritual clone.</p><p></p><p>The more clones formed, the weaker the true self's spiritual will becomes.</p><p></p><p>The weakening of spiritual will affects everything - the comprehension of rules, the exertion of one's own combat strength, etc.</p><p></p><p>All suffer a great decline.</p><p></p><p>If a spiritual clone is destroyed out there,</p><p></p><p>Then the true self's spiritual will will recover.</p><p></p><p>And it can continue separating spiritual will to form new clones.</p><p></p><p>But the meaning of the supreme expert Xia Qinzhi is that the clone exposed in the two-dimensional world within the white paper will be permanently lost?</p><p></p><p>In other words, the spiritual will carried by the clone cannot be recovered, and the true self will permanently lose part of its spiritual will?</p><p></p><p>In a flash of inspiration,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately realized what that meant.</p><p></p><p>Tragic.</p><p></p><p>The cost was too tragic.</p><p></p><p>Permanently losing part of one's spiritual will could cause this expert's potential and strength to drop by several levels.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a spiritual clone also requires separating part of one's spiritual will, but as long as the clone is reclaimed, that part of spiritual will can be recovered.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>It can never be recovered?</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of himself.</p><p></p><p>If the Yang spirit died in the two-dimensional world within the white paper,</p><p></p><p>Does that mean he would be unable to re-condense this spirit?</p><p></p><p>The Yin spirit and Yang spirit were the foundation of Lin Yuan's martial path, supporting his towering martial way.</p><p></p><p>Permanently losing the Yang spirit would have a serious impact on Lin Yuan's martial evolution system.</p><p></p><p>With only the Yin spirit remaining, his martial way would be unable to achieve the balance of Yin and Yang, and could potentially collapse.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of Myriad Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness immediately sank into his mind, gazing at that towering Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>If his spiritual will entered the Gate of Myriad Realms and descended into other dimensional worlds, waiting for the Yang spirit to die in the two-dimensional world, could the spiritual will belonging to the Yang spirit then return to the true self?</p><p></p><p>That way, perhaps he could avoid permanently losing the Yang spirit's influence?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not dare confirm it - this method could only be used as an absolute last resort.</p><p></p><p>"The best choice is naturally to escape from this two-dimensional world, but how to escape?" Lin Yuan's thoughts surged.</p><p></p><p>The supreme experts of human civilization knew nothing about that 'white paper', only that it was related to the Taixuan ruins.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Ask them."</p><p></p><p>With a shift of Lin Yuan's thoughts, his conscious avatar descended into the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master," the six-armed figure bowed slightly and respectfully addressed Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about this 'white paper'?" Lin Yuan wasted no words, directly manifesting the appearance of the 'white paper'.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure was the spirit of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, created by the Xuanhuang Sovereign. It certainly knew far more than the nine supreme experts of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Xuanhuang Sovereign had an immense reputation even in the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>"This 'white paper' contains a two-dimensional world. Any surrounding matter will be forcibly reduced in dimension and fall into the white paper," Lin Yuan explained what he understood as best he could.</p><p></p><p>"Two-dimensional world?"</p><p></p><p>"White paper?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Does the master speak of a 'low-dimensional space'?" the six-armed figure immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>"Low-dimensional space?" Lin Yuan's mind stirred. "Explain in detail."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The six-armed figure did not dare hesitate, seeing this was very important to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The so-called low-dimensional space comes from some records His Majesty obtained from a perilous place long ago."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure quickly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Low-dimensional spaces were created by those existences approaching perfect spacetime and life, in order to explore other dimensional spaces."</p><p></p><p>"However, later some experts discovered that low-dimensional spaces could allow two beings of different strengths to start from the same point. They would separate a sliver of spiritual will as an avatar to descend into the low-dimensional space and start over from scratch."</p><p></p><p>"Discarding everything - bloodlines, secret arts, comprehension of rules - the greatest use of low-dimensional spaces is to test one's 'insight'."</p><p></p><p>"From the same starting point and environment, within a fixed time, whoever's strength increases the fastest has the strongest insight."</p><p></p><p>"Later, low-dimensional spaces gradually became a form of entertainment. Beings of different levels would often separate a sliver of spiritual will to enter a low-dimensional space and battle."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure paused, seeming to recall something. "Of course, there are two types of low-dimensional spaces."</p><p></p><p>"One is purely for entertainment, with no restrictions."</p><p></p><p>"The other is a wager-type low-dimensional space. This type has many rules - leaving midway incurs severe punishment. But if you defeat your opponent in the end, you receive generous rewards."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure's tone carried a hint of emotion:</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty once said the ultimate victor of a low-dimensional space would take all."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 604</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nine Chaos Supremes patiently waited for the space-time storm in the Xuanhuang Universe to subside.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Supremes remained motionless, and the surrounding Chaos Nobles naturally did not dare to approach.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Chaos Nobles had gathered here, but even if they joined forces, their power could not be perfectly integrated, and they could not pose a threat to any of the Chaos Supremes.</p><p></p><p>In the Source World, with the help of the war machines containing the Chaos Runes, the Supremes might have the potential to threaten the Celestial Supremes.</p><p></p><p>But in the Chaos Void? There was no such possibility.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! At a certain momentâ€”</p><p></p><p>The exposed corner of the Xuanhuang Universe completely fell into tranquility, the surrounding space-time disappeared, revealing an entrance leading to the interior of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, we can go in now." The Obsidian Supreme's eyes were filled with endless darkness, and he stepped forward, with the darkness spreading and covering everything.</p><p></p><p>Where the darkness enveloped, there was absolute silence, and even the Chaos Qi no longer existed.</p><p></p><p>The path of Chaos Power that the Obsidian Supreme had evolved was called Chaos Darkness, and the Chaos Darkness here was an extremely pure darkness, equivalent to an enhanced version of the Chaos Shadow mastered by the Shadow Supreme.</p><p></p><p>"The Obsidian Domain, this is an extension of the Obsidian Supreme's own power. If ordinary Nobles are enveloped by this domain, they will find it difficult to break free and will basically be suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Obsidian Supreme definitely won't specifically suppress you. His enemies are the other eight Supremes."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Chaos Nobles trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there were some Nobles who had the idea of sneaking in the moment the space-time storm subsided.</p><p></p><p>But under the coverage of the Obsidian Domain, this possibility was basically cut off.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Supreme in the distance was about to be the first to rush into the Xuanhuang Universe, but he was also enveloped by the Obsidian Domain, and suddenly felt that the surrounding space-time was like amber, firmly restraining him.</p><p></p><p>The Obsidian Domain could not completely bind a Chaos Supreme, but suppressing and restraining was very simple. At least for now, the Shadow Supreme noticed that his speed had dropped sharply, and he could not use the space-time teleportation technique to enter the Xuanhuang Universe, so he could only fly in slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'll go first then."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on the Obsidian Supreme's face. Under the coverage of the Obsidian Domain, the other Supremes could not use space-time teleportation, but he could.</p><p></p><p>So he could be the first to enter the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate being the first to enter the Xuanhuang Universe. Even being half a step ahead of the peerless Supremes who opened and left their mark on this universe would give a huge advantage.</p><p></p><p>Let alone being the first to go in? Suddenly, two streams of gray-blue energy rapidly spread and collided with the Obsidian Domain, causing the space-time to shatter repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>The Obsidian Supreme's expression changed, and under the tremors of the gray-blue energy, he could not perform space-time teleportation either.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for space-time teleportation was that the space-time had to be relatively stable, but now the space-time had been completely disrupted. At this moment, if he forcefully tried to teleport, it would be an indiscriminate teleportation, and there was a high chance of being far away from the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, the Obsidian Supreme immediately abandoned the idea of space-time teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Now, if he forced the teleportation, he might be the first to enter the Xuanhuang Universe, or he might teleport to another location. Even if the distance was not far, by the time he returned, the other eight Supremes might have already entered, and even some of the Chaos Nobles might have gone in.</p><p></p><p>And if he did not perform the space-time teleportation, the Obsidian Supreme was at least confident that he would be among the top three to enter the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Obsidian, you want to be the first? Did you ask me?" The Double-Horned Supreme sneered, and at this moment, his two horns, one blue and one gray, were continuously shaking the space-time.</p><p></p><p>He was also bound by the Obsidian Domain and could not perform space-time teleportation.</p><p></p><p>But even though the Double-Source Supreme could not teleport himself, he had a way to prevent Obsidian from teleporting.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Obsidian, why don't you try teleporting now?" The Savage Supreme immediately laughed out loud.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not confident that he was weaker than the Obsidian Supreme, the latter's methods were indeed more than his own. If it weren't for the Double-Source Supreme, the Savage Supreme might have had to watch helplessly as the Obsidian Supreme entered the Xuanhuang Universe first.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Obsidian and Double-Source restraining each other, it naturally worked in the Savage Supreme's favor.</p><p></p><p>"Obsidian Supreme." Under the endless darkness, Lin Yuan was also present, and he too felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>In terms of space-time attainments, he was not stronger than the Chaos Supremes present, so he could not perform space-time teleportation either. If he wanted to enter the Xuanhuang Universe, he could only fly in.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Supremes have all evolved their own paths of power from the Chaos, mastering various mysterious techniques. In this aspect, I am indeed not as good as them," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Throughout his growth, Lin Yuan's strongest ability was his understanding of the Rules, and compared to the Chaos Supremes, he did not have much of an advantage.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, let's each rely on our own abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Obsidian Supreme sneered and had no intention of withdrawing the Obsidian Domain.</p><p></p><p>Although the Double-Source Supreme had disrupted the space-time with his own power, making it impossible for Obsidian to perform space-time teleportation, with the Obsidian Domain's enhancement, even if he had to fly slowly, he would still be faster than the other Supremes.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Obsidian Supreme transformed into a pure darkness and fled towards the Xuanhuang Universe.</p><p></p><p>"Obsidian, have you forgotten about me?" The Savage Supreme let out a loud laugh, clenching his fist.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rushing towards the direction where the Black Jade Sage had retreated.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The space-time was violently shattered again, and the Black Jade Sage had no choice but to stop, turning around to look at the rampaging Savage Sage approaching with big strides.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no."</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Sage frowned, "I was too hasty, revealing the first ability to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe, and ended up being targeted by the Dual Source and Savage Sages."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Black Jade Sage also realized the key issue. In terms of strength, he was not much stronger than the Savage and Dual Source Sages, but the Black Jade Domain was very suitable for this kind of contest for treasures.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the Savage and Dual Source Sages of the same level would naturally instinctively join forces, even if they had not discussed it beforehand, and would work together to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, none of you are getting in."</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Sage became determined in his heart, fully activating the Black Jade Domain, even abandoning the enhancement of his own power, just to suppress the Savage and Dual Source Sages.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The three Sages attacked each other, and the terrifying aftershocks spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"I can't even squeeze in." The Heavenly Blessing Sage behind them wanted to try to surpass the Black Jade, Dual Source, and Savage Sages and be the first to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>But he found that not only could he not be the first, he couldn't even get close.</p><p></p><p>The closer he approached the space-time where the three Sages were, the greater the binding pressure he felt.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Blessing Sage even had the feeling that if he forcefully delved in, he might even face a joint attack from the three Sages.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade, Dual Source, and Savage Sages were restraining each other, but if any other Sage dared to take advantage of the situation, they would certainly face a strike from the three in front.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to rush to be the first to go in."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Blessing Sage thought about it for a while and gave up.</p><p></p><p>With his life-saving abilities, any one of the Black Jade, Dual Source, and Savage Sages would not be able to harm him.</p><p></p><p>But if the three of them joined forces? Even just a single strike could severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of entering the Mysterious Yellow Universe, if he was severely injured, not only would he no longer have the qualifications to compete with the three Sages in front, but even the newly promoted Sages behind him might be able to ride on his head.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the Sage realm."</p><p></p><p>Among the many Chaos Venerable Ones, the Spiritual Wind Venerable One had a rather pensive expression. The struggle of the nine Chaos Sages was something the Chaos Venerable Ones couldn't even get involved in.</p><p></p><p>They could only wait until the nine Chaos Sages had all entered, then the Venerable Ones would dare to go in.</p><p></p><p>This was also why there were more than a hundred Venerable Ones gathered on the scene, yet they had no intention of competing with the Sages.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was simply too large.</p><p></p><p>Even if it weren't for the fact that the nine Sages didn't look down on them and were restraining each other, perhaps a single one of them would be enough to wipe out all the Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Stay close together."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Wind Venerable One transmitted a message to the more than ten Venerable Ones around him.</p><p></p><p>They certainly didn't dare to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe ahead of the Sages, nor could they even enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe together with the Sages.</p><p></p><p>But after all the Sages had entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, who followed closely behind would be very important.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Black Jade Domain would still linger even after the Black Jade Sage entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, and the Venerable Ones would still be unable to achieve space-time traversal.</p><p></p><p>So when the Sages entered the Mysterious Yellow Universe, whoever was closest to the entrance would have the chance to be the first to go in.</p><p></p><p>But this "staying close" also required a sense of propriety, not too close, or they would fall behind the other Venerable Ones, and not too close either, or they might provoke the displeasure of a certain Sage and face retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Even Venerable Ones at the peak of the Chaos Realm could not withstand a casual strike from a Sage.</p><p></p><p>"This Black Jade Domain..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was also flying towards the entrance of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, and he too was suppressed and constrained by the Black Jade Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Fly slowly, I will definitely be one of the last to enter the Mysterious Yellow Universe." Lin Yuan frowned, although he had the "map" of the Mysterious Yellow Universe, being the first to enter would definitely be the best.</p><p></p><p>"The Dual Source Sage's space-time disruption, even without the Black Jade Domain, I would not be able to achieve space-time traversal."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Dual Source Sage who was already very close to the entrance of the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>"The power of Chaos Evolution? Indeed, it's difficult to deal with." Lin Yuan rarely felt so comprehensively suppressed, his aura gradually brewing, "No choice, I'll have to meet force with force."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! Lin Yuan seemed to transform into an eternal blazing sun, and the spatial and temporal attributes within tens of millions, hundreds of millions, and even millions of light-years were all twisted, and under the cover of the blazing sun's brilliance, they were all subdued.</p><p></p><p>The Black Jade Domain of the Black Jade Sage and the gray-blue power of the Dual Source Sage quickly retreated under the all-encompassing brilliance of the blazing sun.</p><p></p><p>At least in the space-time where Lin Yuan was located, these two forces were quickly driven out.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The space-time regained stability,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tore open the void in front of him with his right hand, and then stepped in.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he appeared in front of the Black Jade, Dual Source, and Savage Sages who were in the midst of their struggle and suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The three Sages in the midst of their confrontation and suppression were startled, looking at Lin Yuan who was about to tear open the void again and step into the Mysterious Yellow Universe.</p><p></p><p>(The last three lines are not part of the translation)</p>

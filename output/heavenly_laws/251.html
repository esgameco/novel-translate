            <p>Chapter 251: The Divine Radiance of the Martial Ancestor (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Dazed and confused.</p><p></p><p>In a trance.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan regained consciousness, he found himself lying on a bed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a human." Lin Yuan breathed a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>With the experience of the sixth crossing, Lin Yuan realized that the carrier of his crossing was not necessarily human, but could be other species.</p><p></p><p>Although there was nothing wrong with other life forms, the human body was more vast and boundless for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If he were to cross into some special life forms, he might not even be able to cultivate the martial way.</p><p></p><p>"My current situation..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to browse the memories of his "original body".</p><p></p><p>He had successfully descended into the Spirit Realm and was currently in Xiaoyao City, Xuanwang Domain, Dongyun Province.</p><p></p><p>"Dongyun Province, Xuanwang Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Basic information about the Spirit Realm surfaced in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was all learned from the Daode Immortal Sect. The Spirit Realm was vast and endless, with the most prosperous regions being home to three thousand Daozhu.</p><p></p><p>And Dongyun Daozhu was one of the three thousand Daozhu.</p><p></p><p>Dongyun Daozhu encompassed more than twenty thousand major domains, of which Xuanwang Domain was one.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanwang Domain..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, the Daode Immortal Sect was located in Xuanwang Domain, one of the three major powers in this domain.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this kind of start..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. The Daode Immortal Sect here was naturally the force established by the True Immortal Patriarchs of the Daode Immortal Sect in the Middle Land Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao City..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a strange expression. In the memories of his "original body", Xiaoyao City had another name.</p><p></p><p>Martial Ancestor City.</p><p></p><p>It was a city carved out under the orders of a major figure from the Daode Immortal Sect.</p><p></p><p>The numerous cultivators in Martial Ancestor City did not cultivate using the external immortal cultivation system, but the martial cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>"Martial way?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could almost be certain that the martial way here was the martial way he had spread in the Middle Land Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>In the deal with Cangqing Immortal, Lin Yuan proposed that if martial cultivators of later generations in the Middle Land world could enter the sixth stage, they could also use the ascension platform to ascend to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's been at least several hundred thousand years..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>After the sixth crossing, he experienced the seventh crossing and cultivated for a period of time in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Although it added up to no more than thirty years.</p><p></p><p>But this was thirty years in the main world. Under the huge time flow speed difference between the two realms, at least several hundred thousand years had passed in the Middle Land Divine Continent world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be impossible for a sixth stage martial cultivator to be born and ascend to the Spirit Realm to establish Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao City... Martial Ancestor City..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a strange expression. During the sixth crossing, he had spread the martial way and was called the ancestor of the martial way under heaven. Moreover, his name was Jun Xiaoyao.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that this Xiaoyao City might have been established by the few disciples he had taken in back then.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it couldn't be such a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I can still see those old acquaintances..." Lin Yuan's thoughts wandered. According to the arrangements he made before leaving, it wouldn't be difficult for his parents and elder brother and second sister to enter the sixth stage.</p><p></p><p>There was a high possibility that they had also ascended to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown if they were still alive now. With only sixth stage, which was the Refining Void realm strength, it was uncertain if they could live for several hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"My current identity is the eldest young master of the Lin family, and the Lin family is a family with some renown in Xiaoyao City."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat up from the bed and took a light breath.</p><p></p><p>"Such abundant spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was slightly amazed in his heart. There were no spiritual veins near Xiaoyao City, after all, martial cultivators occupied the majority in this city.</p><p></p><p>The demand for spiritual veins was not as indispensable as those immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the concentration of spiritual energy Lin Yuan sensed was not inferior to the Daode Immortal Mountain that occupied the largest spiritual vein in the Middle Land Divine Continent world.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder those ancient Refining Void sages all yearn to ascend to the Spirit Realm, with such a cultivation environment..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>This was only Xiaoyao City. If one were in those cultivation holy lands, the concentration of spiritual energy would only be higher.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy would even begin to transform into higher-level energy.</p><p></p><p>That was the "immortal energy" that only existed in legends in the Middle Land Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>To enter the immortal cultivation system, one must have spiritual roots. This was an iron rule.</p><p></p><p>But even in the Spirit Realm, the vast majority of creatures still did not have spiritual roots, and most of the creatures with spiritual roots had very low quality spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>Even if they forcibly entered the Qi Refining stage, they would be limited to the Foundation Establishment stage at most.</p><p></p><p>This was why Xiaoyao City had a foothold.</p><p></p><p>The martial cultivation system had no requirements for spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>As long as your qi and blood were sufficient, you could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>This gave hope to a large portion of mortals without spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>Even some cultivators with low-quality spiritual roots, upon determining that they had quite a talent in the martial way, would switch to cultivating the martial way.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the current martial cultivation system was only a relatively niche cultivation system, spreading at most only in Xuanwang Domain. Outside of Xuanwang Domain, no one knew about it at all.</p><p></p><p>This was also very normal.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial cultivation system did not require spiritual roots, its upper limit was far inferior to the immortal way.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators with potential would definitely choose the immortal way first. Only after determining that they had no hope in the immortal way would they consider the martial way.</p><p></p><p>If one could cultivate immortality, who would practice martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Before I left, I left behind twelve directions to break through to the seventh stage of the martial way. These directions were not perfect and could hardly contend with the Harmonious Dao stage of the immortal way."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The seventh stage he was currently cultivating was the perfect seventh stage that he had comprehended and integrated in the main world.</p><p></p><p>It was countless times stronger than the twelve seventh stage paths he had left behind in the Middle Land Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>And even so, the seventh stage was the upper limit of the martial way. Compared to the immortal cultivation system with unlimited potential, it was naturally far inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao City is under the protection of the Daode Immortal Sect. Currently, there are numerous families in the city, but the strongest is still the 'Martial Temple'."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Temple was the holy land of Xiaoyao City and was said to be related to the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the establishment of Xiaoyao City, several seventh stage martial cultivators joined forces to open up the Martial Temple and promote the martial cultivation system, until this day.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Martial Temple as the foundation, constantly cultivating martial cultivators, it would be questionable whether the martial cultivation system would still exist now.</p><p></p><p>"The first thing I need to do now is to improve my strength." Lin Yuan's thoughts converged.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for a while.</p><p></p><p>After "correcting" many of the original body's mistakes in cultivation, Lin Yuan walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>The martial way did not have an indispensable craving for spiritual energy like the immortal way, but this did not mean that martial cultivation did not require resources.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the martial way had a great demand for resources, especially at the sixth stage, where it was necessary to open up an inner world, consuming resources that could be described as mountains and seas.</p><p></p><p>Of course, opening up an inner world at the peak of the sixth stage was Lin Yuan's creation.</p><p></p><p>The Perfect Seven-Stage Path established by Lin Yuan has now become the martial arts cultivation system in the Spirit Realm, stopping at the seventh stage. Without Lin Yuan's subsequent supplements, it is already considered good to be able to live in peace in a corner.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm is vast, and the immortal cultivation system occupies the mainstream, with many other cultivation systems coexisting. The existence of martial arts is not prominent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan walked out of the courtyard and was quickly discovered by a maid.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, you're awake?" This maid had the strength of the Foundation Establishment stage and was cultivated by the Lin family from a young age.</p><p></p><p>Even for a family like the Lin family, whose foundation is in Xiaoyao City, they value the immortal cultivation system more from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's parents rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, are you alright?" A beautiful woman walked over, looked at Lin Yuan carefully, and said with a happy expression on her face, "How do you feel now?"</p><p></p><p>"It's okay." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, the original body was very enthusiastic about the martial arts cultivation system, but unfortunately, due to the desire for quick success and instant benefits, problems occurred during cultivation, and he fell into a coma.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Lin Yuan's consciousness gradually awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Chang'er, you have spiritual roots. Even if you only have three spiritual roots, you can still cultivate the immortal way. Why do you have to put all your thoughts on martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>The original father's name was "Lin Jianping", who started the Lin family from scratch and was considered a model of counterattack in Xiaoyao City.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family's business has opened more than a dozen branches in Xiaoyao City, and Lin Jianping is knowledgeable and knows that the advantages of the immortal cultivation system are far stronger than those of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Profound King Realm, in the three thousand Dao states, the real stage is still those proud children of heaven who cultivate the immortal cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping did not have high expectations for his son, but at least he should not suffer from martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating martial arts requires tempering and refining the body, and the suffering is definitely greater than cultivating the immortal way.</p><p></p><p>"I like martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>This was also the original body's idea.</p><p></p><p>As for the immortal way? It can indeed be used for reference later, but the foundation must still be based on martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Like martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping was a little worried.</p><p></p><p>His son was good in everything and was extremely sensible when he was young, but he was very stubborn. Once he decided on something, no one could pull him back.</p><p></p><p>Those martial arts cultivators basically had no spiritual roots, or the quality of their spiritual roots was too low, so they had no choice but to choose to cultivate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? Although the talent of three spiritual roots is not considered strong, it is not weak either. If he is lucky, he has the hope of stepping into the Golden Core stage.</p><p></p><p>"A Da."</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping raised his right hand, and a figure immediately walked out from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Take out some hundred-year-old and thousand-year-old blood lingzhi, white jade ginseng and other spiritual medicines from each branch and give them to Chang'er for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>In the early stage of martial arts cultivation, the main focus is on tempering the physical body and blood, and this stage can be shortened through external objects.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The figure named "A Da" bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"A Da?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the figure behind Lin Jianping.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts third stage?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In Xiaoyao City, martial arts cultivators are the most numerous. Although Lin Jianping is unwilling to let his son cultivate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But compared with the immortal way, in fact, the martial arts cultivation system still has a lot of influence in the Profound King Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, it has given birth to several martial arts seventh-stage experts comparable to the Harmonious Dao stage true immortals.</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping was worried that his son would not understand martial arts cultivation and would also ruin his body.</p><p></p><p>"Son, you should study your martial arts carefully. Your father will find you a master in the next few days." Lin Jianping patted Lin Yuan's shoulder, then left with his beautiful wife.</p><p></p><p>"Find a master?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought about it and didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>With the previous example of practicing martial arts until he fell into a coma, if he refused again, it would probably cause his parents to worry.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful wife Shen Zhen glared at Lin Jianping, "What kind of master do you want to find for Chang'er?"</p><p></p><p>In Xiaoyao City, martial arts cultivators are like carp crossing the river, but there are still very few real martial arts masters. There are only a handful of martial arts fourth stage and above.</p><p></p><p>"My son Lin Jianping, since he wants to practice martial arts, he must have the best."</p><p></p><p>Lin Jianping thought for a while and made a decision in his heart, "I plan to let Chang'er go to the Martial Temple to experience the 'Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance'."</p><p></p><p>"Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance?"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful wife Shen Zhen blinked her eyes, and then reacted immediately, "Okay, Old Lin, you're really willing to give it up?"</p><p></p><p>In the entire Xiaoyao City, the place where martial arts cultivators are most concentrated is undoubtedly the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>As the foundation of martial arts cultivators, the several martial arts seventh-stage experts who established the Martial Temple back then specially left several divine brilliances in order to ensure that the martial arts cultivation system would be passed down.</p><p></p><p>These divine brilliances explain the essence of martial arts understood by those several martial arts seventh-stage experts, and they are also related to the mysterious Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>So it is also known as the Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance has two functions. One is to let the perceiver experience the essence understood by those several martial arts seventh-stage experts at close range.</p><p></p><p>The second is to determine which aspect of the martial arts cultivation system the perceiver is good at.</p><p></p><p>Especially the first function is equivalent to indirectly receiving guidance from those several martial arts seventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts seventh stage, comparable to the Harmonious Dao stage true immortals. At this level, whether they are immortal cultivators or not, they are all big shots overlooking the Profound King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Martial Temple.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend the Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance, unless one has amazing talent and is valued by the Martial Temple, otherwise one can only go through the back door.</p><p></p><p>The so-called back door is to pay an additional price to let people follow the disciples with amazing martial arts talent through the back door and take the opportunity to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Take advantage of the leftover Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance from others.</p><p></p><p>Even so, with the scale of the Lin family, letting Lin Yuan experience the Martial Ancestor's Divine Brilliance once would probably cost most of the family's assets.</p><p></p><p>This is still the case when the Lin family has been rooted in Xiaoyao City for many years. Otherwise, even if foreign forces want to go through the back door, they won't have the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Lin Chang (Lin Yuan)]</p><p></p><p>[Identity: Wielder of the Gate of Myriad Realms]</p><p></p><p>[Innate Talent: Defying Heaven's Perception]</p><p></p><p>[Divine Ability: Rebirth by Dripping Blood]</p><p></p><p>[Current State: Consciousness Descending]</p><p></p><p>[Remaining Stay Time: Nine Hundred and Twenty Years]</p><p></p><p>In the room.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the illusory text in the lower left corner of the reality.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the stay time is nine hundred and twenty years?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite satisfied in his heart. With such a long time, he couldn't guarantee anything else, but he could probably open up the eighth stage of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak now. To recover to the eighth stage level, I need a lot of resources."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan grabbed a large half of the thousand-year-old lingzhi and swallowed it into his stomach. The surging aura was quickly absorbed.</p><p></p><p>"From the first stage to the sixth stage, there is no need to worry, but the peak of the sixth stage? Seventh stage? That requires opening up an inner world, and it must rely on a large amount of resources."</p><p></p><p>In the main world, in order to open up the inner world, Lin Yuan consumed countless tons of "Scarlet Spirit Liquid".</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"Let's take it one step at a time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged, and he continued to cultivate.</p>

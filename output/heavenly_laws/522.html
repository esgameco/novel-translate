        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Source World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn as he looked towards the coordinates of the Source World deep within the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've descended and traversed, I don't need to expend extra realm-breaking source power anymore," Lin Yuan thought to himself. Since advancing to the twelfth level, the essence of his life had undergone a leap. Not only did he no longer need realm-breaking source power for worlds he had already traversed, but even for worlds he had not yet traversed, he no longer needed realm-breaking source power. He only needed to have the correct world coordinates.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the realm-breaking source power expended in previous traversals was used to protect my true spirit consciousness?" Lin Yuan speculated. After becoming twelfth level, his life essence was strong enough, and consequently his true spirit consciousness was also strong enough, no longer needing extra protection from the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds. This also saved a sum of realm-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>"I'll still choose to traverse with my true spirit consciousness," Lin Yuan thought to himself. </p><p></p><p>The only flaw with traversing via true spirit will was the existence of a weak period. But this flaw had basically been compensated for since Lin Yuan advanced to the twelfth level. </p><p></p><p>A weak period? At worst he could just return to the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds and continue with the next traversal. After all, it didn't require expending realm-breaking source power anymore.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Lin Yuan's current mastery of realm-breaking source power, even if he encountered some dangers during the weak period, he could fend them off.</p><p></p><p>Small dangers could be avoided using realm-breaking source power. </p><p></p><p>For major dangers, there was no need to resist - he could simply give up and start the next traversal.</p><p></p><p>As for his true body? It would remain stationed in the cosmic starry sky, where safety was unquestionable. Especially while inside the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, even if the universe were to be destroyed, Lin Yuan could ignore it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately separated out a portion of his true spirit will and poured it into the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the twelfth level, when Lin Yuan traversed, he no longer needed to pour in his entire true spirit will - a portion was sufficient. This also meant his body in the cosmic starry sky could act simultaneously with the traversed world.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, he could also utilize numerous avatars.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Nearly one-third of my true spirit will?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds. At this moment, a small portion of his true spirit will had poured into the Gate, descending upon that Source World, preparing to merge.</p><p></p><p>In a daze,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's sleeping consciousness began to awaken.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, don't die, you absolutely must not die, it's all my fault. If I hadn't carelessly left, you wouldn't be in this state."</p><p></p><p>"Dongyang family, if something really happens to the Young Master, even if the Master and Mistress can restrain themselves, I won't let you off!"</p><p></p><p>"We're almost there, almost home. As long as we get home, Young Master, you'll be saved."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's consciousness vaguely sensed the spatial fluctuations from the outside world. Clearly someone was carrying him and performing large-scale spatial jumps and transfers.</p><p></p><p>"The fief of the Marquis of Qingfen in Qingfen Domain? The Marquis of Qingfen is a Great Venerable level existence, an enfeoffed marquis of the Lieyang Ancient Country, with terrifying strength. And I am the most promising disciple of the Yu family, competing with the Dongyang family for the position of disciple under the Marquis of Qingfen... The Dongyang family, in order to become disciples under the Marquis of Qingfen, took the opportunity while I was out to secretly assassinate me..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quickly received a large amount of memories in his mind, understanding his current situation.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Yu family or the Dongyang family, they were both only second-tier families in the Qingfen Domain. If they could establish a connection with the Marquis of Qingfen, they would at least have the hope of advancing to a first-tier family.</p><p></p><p>And a first-tier family... meant vast resources and status.</p><p></p><p>"Dongyang Meng..." A stunningly beautiful figure flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>In the competition between the Yu family and the Dongyang family for the position of disciple under the Marquis of Qingfen, the original body had the best chance from the Yu family, while Dongyang Meng represented the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the original body and Dongyang Meng had a very good relationship in secret, and the original body even had feelings for Dongyang Meng.</p><p></p><p>At this time, when the competition between the two families was most intense, the original body should have stayed within the family to prevent any accidents from occurring.</p><p></p><p>But Dongyang Meng contacted him, wanting to meet, claiming to have a way to ease relations between the two families and resolve the current tense situation between the Yu family and the Dongyang family.</p><p></p><p>"So, your so-called solution was to eliminate me?"</p><p></p><p>The original body's final thoughts flashed through Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Dongyang Meng wanted to meet, the original body, disregarding everything, secretly slipped out of the family, bringing only an old servant.</p><p></p><p>Then he met with Dongyang Meng, and to prevent their conversation from leaking out, he even sent the old servant away.</p><p></p><p>However, what awaited the original body in the end were powerful experts from the Dongyang family lying in ambush.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the numerous life-saving measures the original body carried, plus the old servant sensing something was wrong and rushing back quickly, he would have likely been completely destroyed in body and soul.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body and soul..." Lin Yuan sensed his current state.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his physical body and soul were being eroded by a dark force, rapidly weakening.</p><p></p><p>However, deep within his physical body and soul, there was still a force full of vitality protecting him, though it was clearly losing ground.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, in at most five breaths, the original body's soul and physical body would be completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"What to do?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>Having just descended and arrived, he hadn't set up any measures and had no ability to resist that constantly eroding dark force.</p><p></p><p>As for mental will? Mental will also needed a sufficiently strong physical body and soul to carry it in order to exert its power, and mental will also couldn't directly resist that dark eroding force.</p><p></p><p>"Now..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Now he had two choices.</p><p></p><p>One was to give up directly, returning the descended portion of consciousness to his true body.</p><p></p><p>However, this would be equivalent to wasting this traversal opportunity. Although Lin Yuan didn't need to expend realm-breaking source power to traverse to the Source World, there was still a "cooldown time".</p><p></p><p>He could only descend once every 333 years.</p><p></p><p>If he gave up this chance, Lin Yuan would have to wait 333 years for the next descent.</p><p></p><p>The second choice was to use realm-breaking source power to resist that dark force.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't need to completely resolve this dark force, he just needed to hold on until returning to the Yu family. At that time, there would be powerful experts from the Yu family to save him.</p><p></p><p>"To temporarily resist this dark force requires a hundred strands of realm-breaking source power..."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Lin Yuan's thoughts rapidly turned as he began to weigh his options.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the identity from this descent and traversal is not bad, at least I won't have to worry about cultivation resources in the early stages," Lin Yuan pondered for just one breath before making his decision.</p><p></p><p>The most outstanding child of the Yu family, with parents who held high positions of power in the Yu family - such an identity and starting point was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>It could allow Lin Yuan to avoid many detours in the early stages.</p><p></p><p>A second-tier family in the Qingfen Domain, while not considered core upper echelons, still ruled over an area and existed at a level worthy of Lin Yuan's investment.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a hundred realm-breaking source power."</p><p></p><p>With a slight mental movement from Lin Yuan, an invisible force began to appear within his body. This force quickly suppressed and delayed the dark eroding force, slowing its erosion speed and extending Lin Yuan's survival time. Most crucially, this force would not leave any traces in his body, and even less likely to be detected by others.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The space-time was distorting.</p><p></p><p>An elderly servant with white hair quickly brought Lin Yuan to a magnificent mansion.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" A tall man appeared, looking at the white-haired old servant while noticing Lin Yuan who was barely breathing.</p><p></p><p>"Ayan." The tall man's expression changed. With a wave of his hand, the surroundings transformed, and the white-haired old servant and Lin Yuan were instantly transported to the deepest part of the mansion.</p><p></p><p>Here sat several elders cross-legged, their auras deep and mysterious. They simultaneously opened their eyes and looked at the tall man.</p><p></p><p>"Honored ancestors, my son needs your help," said the tall man without wasting words. At this moment, he didn't even ask in detail why Lin Yuan was injured.</p><p></p><p>"This is the work of the East Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"How bold, the East Yang family dares to lay hands on a disciple of our Yu family."</p><p></p><p>The elders with profound auras looked displeased. They immediately took action to stop the dark corrosive force spreading inside Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Quite lucky, he came back just in time. If it had been a few breaths later, it would have been really troublesome," said the leading elder. He looked at the tall man with a frown and asked, "What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, honored elders," the white-haired old servant, seeing that Lin Yuan was out of danger, let out a heavy sigh of relief and immediately explained how East Yang Meng from the East Yang family had plotted against their young master.</p><p></p><p>"To become a disciple of the Blue Flame Marquis, the East Yang family has resorted to any means necessary," the tall man added promptly.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a disciple of the Blue Flame Marquis is a chance to ascend to heaven in one step. Who wouldn't go all out?" The leading Yu family elder looked somewhat dissatisfied. </p><p></p><p>He wasn't angry at the East Yang family, but at Yu Yan. Knowing it was the most intense period of competition between the two great families, how could he still go out to meet East Yang Meng privately? Wasn't that foolish?</p><p></p><p>"The elder is right," the tall man immediately said.</p><p></p><p>He also knew his son was at fault. The East Yang family ambushing his son? If Yu Yan had been more competent and taken advantage of this private meeting with East Yang Meng to bring many of the Yu family's powerful members along and kill East Yang Meng instead, how could the outcome have been like this?</p><p></p><p>In that case, with East Yang Meng dead, Yu Yan's chances of becoming the Blue Flame Marquis's disciple would have greatly increased, and the Yu family would have soared, becoming a first-class family under the Blue Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, my son now..." the tall man asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Although his life has been saved, it will take at least several decades for him to fully recover. And in a year's time, it will be time to go to Blue Flame City," said the Yu family elder. Without full recovery, there was basically no chance of competing with East Yang Meng, which was tantamount to giving up the opportunity to become a disciple of the Blue Flame Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"That's good," the tall man let out a sigh of relief, then immediately thought of something and said, "I'll go back right away to properly guide Ayan."</p><p></p><p>With that, he quickly left with Lin Yuan and the old servant.</p><p></p><p>"Finally made it through," Lin Yuan steadied himself. The Realm-Breaking Source Power was truly miraculous, formless and intangible. Except for Lin Yuan, no one else could detect it.</p><p></p><p>"Do those Yu family elders all have twelfth-level strength?" Lin Yuan marveled to himself. Although it was only the twelfth-level Path-Breaking realm, it was still the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family was only a second-class family in the Blue Flame Domain, yet they had several Path-Breaking realm elders presiding. What about the first-class families then? And what about the Blue Flame Marquis who overlooked the entire Blue Flame Domain?</p><p></p><p>"This is the Source World," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of world levels, the Source World was no weaker than the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>"The most urgent task now is to recover from the injuries to my physical body and soul," Lin Yuan gathered his thoughts and began to examine himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the dark corrosive force in his body had been completely eliminated, the injuries remained. Moreover, these injuries were extremely difficult to heal. External forces had little effect, and he could only rely on his own essence to slowly repair them.</p><p></p><p>This was also why the Yu family elders determined that it would take Lin Yuan decades to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Decades?" Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. That's how long Yu Yan would need to recover, but not himself.</p><p></p><p>Inside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"The situation in the Source World has finally stabilized," a smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. For his first descent into the Source World, he was unwilling to return empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"Now I just need to wait for the Source World to develop normally," Lin Yuan thought to himself. From the intelligence gathered so far, the vastness of that Source World was simply terrifying, especially the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom, which was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Guming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>An avatar of Lin Yuan appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This time I arrived much faster," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The first time he reached the Guming Chaos Continent, Lin Yuan was only at the eleventh level, and it took a full four to five months to approach.</p><p></p><p>But now? From leaving the main universe until now, it had only been a matter of days.</p><p></p><p>"If I could reach the eighth level of space-time, I estimate I could arrive in just a few breaths," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the eighth level of space-time belonged to the space-time comprehension of Chaos Venerable Ones, while the ninth level of space-time was the domain of Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty the Mystic Emperor had reached the peak of the ninth level of space-time in his attainments, unrivaled as he traversed the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Treasures Convention is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately headed towards the Guming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten his purpose for coming this time - to bring many weapons, artifacts, and treasures to sell, and then buy that golden box at the Thousand Treasures Convention.</p><p></p><p>The golden box bore the mark of the Xuanhuang lineage. Only Lin Yuan knew that it should contain treasures from the original Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>The golden box itself was nearly indestructible, which was why it had been passed down until now. And the treasures stored in such a box must be extraordinary, their true value far exceeding 30,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan drew closer to the Guming Chaos Continent, he immediately sensed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he first arrived outside the Guming Chaos Continent, the atmosphere on this Chaos Continent was now noticeably tenser, with the number of patrollers having increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the continent, that black mountain peak that had pierced the sky like an inverted thorn had disappeared at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>"Has something happened?" Lin Yuan speculated. The Guming Chaos Venerable One had quite a reputation in the surrounding area. For the Guming Chaos Continent to change like this, if it was truly an incident, it must not be small.</p><p></p><p>"The Chaos Void is full of crises. Even Chaos Continents presided over by Chaos Venerable Ones can't be considered absolutely safe, let alone the void outside the Chaos Continents, which is even more dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>However, the Guming Chaos Continent had existed for over a hundred universe cycles, during which it had experienced many calamities but had weathered them all under the protection of the Guming Chaos Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever has happened, it's none of my business. As long as I can buy that golden box, I can leave immediately."</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts, Lin Yuan arrived at the entrance of the Guming Chaos Continent and successfully entered.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>The two avatars merged and headed towards the trading area of Mingchuan City, intending to sell the many weapons, artifacts, and treasures to exchange for enough chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

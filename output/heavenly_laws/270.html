        <h1>Chapter 270</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The reverse chaos immortal kings and many other supreme immortal kings were all dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>Originally they thought that after the Martial Ancestor defeated the opponent in the first layer with one strike, when facing the opponents layer by layer afterwards, he would need to engage in a dragged-out struggle and collision. </p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, for the Martial Ancestor, the first layer opponent was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The second layer, the third layer - he penetrated through all the opponents with just one strike each.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the strength of all the opponents in the first, second and third layers was the same?</p><p></p><p>After some careful thought, many immortal kings knew this couldn't be the case. </p><p></p><p>The only possibility was that the Martial Ancestor was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Just like the reverse chaos immortal king, an unsurpassed immortal king - when facing ordinary immortal kings crossing the tribulation, whether they were at the initial or peak stage, he could defeat them all with one strike.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, that's the Dragon Ancestor, the progenitor of the true dragons in the Spirit Realm, born since the Spirit Realm's inception and disappeared countless eons ago."</p><p></p><p>One unsurpassed immortal king saw that the Martial Ancestor's seventh layer opponent was a true dragon hundreds of thousands of zhang long, with golden horns emanating a noble aura.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Ancestor was the progenitor of all beings with true dragon bloodlines in the Spirit Realm. It was said the Dragon Ancestor intended to infuse his own bloodline into all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Thus, even though the Dragon Ancestor disappeared countless years ago, the true dragon bloodline was still being passed down.</p><p></p><p>In the Three Thousand Realms, the Nine River Domain was one of the 'Dragon Rising Lands', where a dragon king at the tribulation-crossing stage was born before.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that dragon king could not compare at all to the Dragon Ancestor. The former would be suppressed and immobilized by the innate bloodline gap before the latter without even needing to take action.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Ancestor was too famous, with his bloodline spreading in the Spirit Realm, never disappearing into history. So many unsurpassed immortal kings recognized him at first glance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Dragon Ancestor's strength was indeed formidable, residing in the seventh layer at the entrance to the Ninth Heaven Passage. </p><p></p><p>In other words, in the Spirit Realm's evaluation, the Dragon Ancestor could be considered the fourth strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception.</p><p></p><p>However, the true dragon progenitor, seen as supremely powerful by the many unsurpassed immortal kings, was penetrated by just one punch from Lin Yuan, the force's remnant waves shattering its remaining body.</p><p></p><p>The many immortal kings fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The reverse chaos immortal king stared blankly.</p><p></p><p>"That's the Celestial Phoenix Progenitor...Didn't expect the Celestial Phoenix Progenitor to be even stronger than the Dragon Ancestor, residing in the third layer."</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan entered the eighth layer, the many unsurpassed immortal kings regained their attention and looked towards this layer's opponent, beginning to discuss.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Phoenix Progenitor was similar to the true Dragon Ancestor, both powerful life forms born at the Spirit Realm's inception, and the Celestial Phoenix Progenitor also infused its bloodline into living beings.</p><p></p><p>In many places of the Three Thousand Realms, there existed many phoenix nests, nurturing life forms with phoenix bloodlines.  </p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Phoenix Progenitor sparked discussion among the many unsurpassed immortal kings, thinking of the true Dragon Ancestor's outcome earlier, they could only sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough.</p><p></p><p>Facing the formidable might of the Celestial Phoenix Progenitor, Lin Yuan once again only threw one punch, tearing through the phoenix body to enter the ninth layer.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>He entered the tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>Until this layer, all the unsurpassed immortal kings, including the reverse chaos immortal king who had fallen into self-doubt, were shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>The tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>This was the final layer leading to the entrance of the Ninth Heaven Passage.</p><p></p><p>It was also the layer containing the life imprint of the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception.</p><p></p><p>To pass through this layer, one must defeat the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of this was extremely high!</p><p></p><p>This was not the strongest life form of an era or age.</p><p></p><p>But rather, the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception?</p><p></p><p>One could deduce that the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception must have opened up an immense gap with the second and third strongest life forms.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what form the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception will take?"</p><p></p><p>The many unsurpassed immortal kings focused intently on the tenth layer while conversing.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be from the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably not, look at the seventh, eighth and ninth layers - those life forms were not of the human race. Compared to innately powerful life forms like the dragon and phoenix progenitors, the human race has no advantages."</p><p></p><p>The unsurpassed immortal kings voiced their views.</p><p></p><p>If not for the passage of eras causing those powerful progenitor bloodlines to disappear, the rulers of recent eras may not necessarily have been human immortal kings.</p><p></p><p>"I reckon it's probably like the dragon and phoenix clans - a powerful life form born at the universe's inception."</p><p></p><p>One immortal king spoke up, drawing nods of agreement from the others.</p><p></p><p>Just as the unsurpassed immortal kings were conversing,</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out from the mists at the tenth layer entrance.</p><p></p><p>This humanoid figure's sleeves fluttered, its mere presence exuding an incomparably terrifying aura, vital energy circulating to cover the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor...this is the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>"The life imprint of the tenth layer is actually the Martial Ancestor?"  </p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor is...the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception?"</p><p></p><p>The many unsurpassed immortal kings on the scene were instantly in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception - what a lofty evaluation! To the extent that they had never imagined this strongest life form would be the Martial Ancestor from their same era.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he easily penetrated through the previous nine layers of opponents."</p><p></p><p>The reverse chaos immortal king muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The first nine layers of opponents were no match for the Martial Ancestor's single strike.</p><p></p><p>If the Martial Ancestor was not the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception, who was?</p><p></p><p>"The strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception...never thought I'd have the honor of witnessing such a peerless expert."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, surpassing the dragon and phoenix progenitors, the Martial Ancestor is too monstrous."</p><p></p><p>The unsurpassed immortal kings marveled.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after,</p><p></p><p>The many unsurpassed immortal kings then realized,</p><p></p><p>The Martial Ancestor was the strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception, possessing unquestionably supreme combat and killing power.</p><p></p><p>But could such combat and killing power defeat the Martial Ancestor himself?</p><p></p><p>"Unfair, there's simply no way to pass through this Ninth Heaven entrance."</p><p></p><p>"Right, anyone not among the top ten strongest life forms since the Spirit Realm's inception can't even get past the first layer."</p><p></p><p>"The strongest life form since the Spirit Realm's inception, yet he has to fight his own life imprint?"</p><p></p><p>"How can he win?"</p><p></p><p>All the unsurpassed immortal kings discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>The life imprint manifested as an opponent would not suffer any depletion in strength. The original's techniques, abilities, talents, divine powers etc. could all be unleashed.</p><p></p><p>So the unsurpassed immortal kings reacted so strongly because for any expert, while defeating an enemy was possible through various means, how could one defeat oneself?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the life imprint manifested as an opponent lacked any emotion, only a combat instinct, making it even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, since both sides' techniques and abilities were identical, it was almost impossible for the opponent to defeat the Martial Ancestor. But the Martial Ancestor also had almost no way to defeat the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"This Ninth Heaven simply doesn't intend to let us pass through." The reverse chaos immortal king sighed, gazing at the Martial Ancestor standing in the tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>In the tenth layer,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at this layer's opponent.</p><p></p><p>Completely identical to himself - the aura, circulating vital force fluctuations, even faintly emanating the aura of his inner world.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Even though the other party's gaze was indifferent and cold, like a machine. </p><p></p><p>"This Spiritual Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. Although he did not actively integrate his life imprint into the Spiritual Realm, as long as he had existed in the Spiritual Realm and taken action, reaching a certain level of strength, the Spiritual Realm would automatically record his life imprint.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there for a while. </p><p></p><p>The 'Martial Ancestor' condensed from his life imprint took action first. </p><p></p><p>These powerful beings condensed from life imprints had no emotions or thoughts, only one idea - to defeat Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura pierced through the nine layer passage entrance in front, spreading and covering the eighth heavenly realm. </p><p></p><p>"So strong?"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor broke through the first eight layers without much effort."</p><p></p><p>The peerless immortal kings' scalps went numb, and they immediately started putting in full effort to resist.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves from the Martial Ancestor at the tenth layer exchanging blows with the 'Martial Ancestor' imprint, after passing through and weakening across nine layers before reaching the eighth heavenly realm, still felt like the heavens and earth were collapsing.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine, if the battlefield was not at the tenth layer but in the eighth heavenly realm instead, the entire eighth realm might be destroyed. </p><p></p><p>It might even spread to the seventh and sixth realms.</p><p></p><p>This was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that even when the prehistoric era ended and peerless immortal kings like the Reverse Chaos Immortal King fought to the death, they only impacted the surface of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the nine heavens, not even the first heaven was affected.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>On the tenth layer battlefield, Lin Yuan and the 'Martial Ancestor' imprint exchanged blows hundreds of times in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Martial cultivation systems, various forces of creation, even that strand of primordial force transcending higher creation forces, the power of his inner world spanning nearly a billion miles, etc.</p><p></p><p>Whatever abilities Lin Yuan possessed, the opponent had them all.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite troublesome," Lin Yuan's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The opponent 'Martial Ancestor' was strong yet not strong.  </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt it was not strong because it was an imprint of himself - who in this world understood him better than himself?</p><p></p><p>But in this situation, the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent had no chance of defeating Lin Yuan, yet for Lin Yuan to defeat the opponent was also difficult.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity my strength is still too low," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The life imprint replication at the ninth heaven passage entrance also had an upper limit.</p><p></p><p>For example, it definitely could not replicate a complete supreme being.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Lin Yuan's current strength could not compare to the entire mass of the Spiritual Realm. His inner world spanning nearly a billion miles did not even measure up to one of the Spiritual Realm's great domains, so replicating all of Lin Yuan's abilities was quite easy.</p><p></p><p>"Should I try the 'Reinforcement' physical divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The 'Reinforcement' physical divine ability was awakened by the fleshly body Lin Yuan descended with this time.</p><p></p><p>Once used, everything about him - his fleshly body, blood energy, soul, mind, etc. - would all increase tenfold in power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it could only last for ten breaths, after which Lin Yuan would fall into a period of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening this divine ability, Lin Yuan had never tried using it because there was no need. None of the opponents he encountered had ever forced him to use this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Due to the side effects of the 'Reinforcement' divine ability, it could only be used as a last resort.</p><p></p><p>"What if the opponent also replicated the 'Reinforcement' divine ability?" Lin Yuan looked towards the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent.</p><p></p><p>He then erupted suddenly, sacrificing his left arm to shatter the opponent's right arm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>The 'Blood Rebirth' physical divine ability activated automatically, quickly restoring Lin Yuan's left arm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent and saw its right arm was also rapidly regenerating.</p><p></p><p>"It even replicated Blood Rebirth, so it likely replicated Reinforcement too," Lin Yuan immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that if he used the 'Reinforcement' divine ability, the opponent would likely instantly use its own 'Reinforcement' ability.</p><p></p><p>Although this ability increased all of one's abilities tenfold, if both sides increased tenfold, it was the same as not increasing at all.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance to the ninth heaven from the eighth heaven realm, although the shockwaves from the two 'Martial Ancestors' fighting reached here, since everyone present was a peerless immortal king, by joining forces they could still withstand it for now. No one wanted to give up watching the battle on the tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>This was the battle of the strongest life form since the birth of the Spiritual Realm. Perhaps after today, there might never be another chance, so all the peerless immortal kings were willing to risk their fleshly bodies to watch it through to the end.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Martial Ancestor has not gained the upper hand, he also does not have the disadvantage. If this drags on, the battle will only end in a stalemate," the Reverse Chaos Immortal King said softly.</p><p></p><p>Although the level of the two Martial Ancestors' battle was too high, the most basic advantages and disadvantages could still be judged.</p><p></p><p>"There are those beyond mortals, those beyond the heavens. Above the ninth heaven, there are celestial beings. But this ninth heaven simply cannot be reached. If even the Martial Ancestor, the strongest life form in history, is struggling so much, who else could go up there?"</p><p></p><p>A peerless immortal king spoke in a dejected tone, feeling that the ninth heaven he pursued was nothing but an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"There are those beyond mortals, those beyond the heavens. Above the ninth heaven, there are celestial beings," the Reverse Chaos Immortal King remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This rumor had existed for who knows how long, even extending to have another meaning in the Three Thousand Realms - that beyond powerful beings, there are even more powerful beings. Even as peerless immortal kings, they were not invincible.</p><p></p><p>And now, using it here was quite fitting. Even the strongest life form in history, the Martial Ancestor, was blocked at the tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Martial Ancestor broke through the tenth layer and entered the ninth heaven, he might encounter even more powerful opponents.</p><p></p><p>On the tenth layer, Lin Yuan was still battling the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent.</p><p></p><p>"To defeat the opponent, the only possibility is to use abilities it cannot replicate," Lin Yuan's mind was calm, but his eyes were shining.</p><p></p><p>"Cannot replicate..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent. "You possess everything of mine, but can you possess my comprehension?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's transcendent comprehension came from the Myriad Realms Gate, which transcended even supreme beings. If the Spiritual Realm could not even replicate a supreme being, how could it replicate the Myriad Realms Gate?</p><p></p><p>[With your transcendent comprehension, battling the opponent, you gradually comprehend its weaknesses]</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent's flaws appeared in Lin Yuan's realization.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial force..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan channeled the power of his inner world, fusing it with the primordial force transcending higher creation forces, forming a terrifying strike that instantly pierced through the 'Martial Ancestor' opponent.</p><p></p><p>With that, the battle ended.</p><p></p><p>The 'Martial Ancestor' opponent stood dazed in place.</p><p></p><p>Its inner world began collapsing, rapidly crumbling from Lin Yuan's strike, and its fleshly body started turning to dust.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh...</p><p></p><p>The opponent on the tenth layer vanished.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a step forward and disappeared from the tenth layer.</p><p></p><p>The ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>Billowing sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Endless.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood alone atop a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"They say there are those beyond the heavens, those beyond mortals. Above the ninth heaven, there are celestial beings."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. All living beings were beneath his feet. Standing alone atop the peak, looking down from above, it seemed the vast world had only him.</p><p></p><p>"But where are the celestial beings?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Give it to him?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies maintained a calm smile on the surface, but his heart was churning with shock.</p><p></p><p>Give it to him? That "Fragment World" worth 1.2 million chaos stones, just give it directly to Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>But the one who sent the message was his master Elder Gu Ming, the ruler of this Chaos Continent. If Elder Gu Ming said to give it to Lin Yuan, then it must be given.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how should I give it?" </p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies hurriedly sent a mental message to inquire.</p><p></p><p>As Elder Gu Ming's disciple, the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies had ways to directly contact his master.</p><p></p><p>"Just find some excuse to give it to him. Remember, don't make it seem too deliberate," that voice continued to sound in the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies' ear.</p><p></p><p>This left the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>He discreetly sized up Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>From his master's tone of voice, the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies could tell he wanted to befriend, or even curry favor with, Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>A "Fragment World" worth 1.2 million, given away just like that, and they even had to find a suitable excuse to give it, for fear of making Lin Yuan suspicious and wary.</p><p></p><p>If this wasn't befriending and currying favor, what was it? The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies was very familiar with this tone - as a disciple of an Elder, he was often on the receiving end of other powerful beings trying to curry favor with him.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was Elder Gu Ming taking the initiative to curry favor with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming was a Chaos Elder, and quite powerful even among Chaos Elders. What kind of being would even Elder Gu Ming need to curry favor with?</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies' mind trembled, not daring to think further.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Brother Yinhe has some incredible background?"</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies' understanding led him to only consider whether Lin Yuan had some great background.</p><p></p><p>"These 'Fragment Worlds'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully examined the other dozens of "Fragment Worlds".</p><p></p><p>In terms of quality, they all met Lin Yuan's requirements. Although far inferior to the Star Tear Stone "Fragment World", the prices were there, at least within Lin Yuan's budget.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take this one."</p><p></p><p>After much comparison, Lin Yuan finally selected a "Fragment World".</p><p></p><p>This "Fragment World" was only about one hundred-thousandth the size of a normal universe, but its advantage was that it had no radiation and would not negatively impact weak and frail human citizens.</p><p></p><p>"Yinhe."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies waved his hand, and all the miniature "Fragment World" projections in front of him disappeared, leaving only that Star Tear "Fragment World".</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ten Thousand Melodies?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I've known Brother Yinhe for years. If Brother Yinhe wants this Star Tear 'Fragment World', I can make the decision to trade it to you first."</p><p></p><p>"As for the chaos stones? You can give them whenever you have them in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies said.</p><p></p><p>"Trade it to me first?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was shocked after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Give the chaos stones whenever he has them in the future, but trade the "Fragment World" to him first?</p><p></p><p>No matter where, money and goods changing hands simultaneously is the most basic principle of transactions. Some places even require paying a "deposit" in advance.</p><p></p><p>As for taking the goods first and paying whenever you have the money in the future, how was this any different from giving it away for free?</p><p></p><p>"There's no other way. This Star Tear 'Fragment World' is too expensive, probably won't have any buyers. Rather than letting it sit empty, might as well give it to Brother Yinhe first."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies said with a smile: "Don't worry, Brother Yinhe. This is a normal transaction. You don't need to bear any karmic burden or feel any pressure."</p><p></p><p>"A normal transaction?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Feeling quite strange inside.</p><p></p><p>He also understood the meaning behind the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies' words.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful a being, the more they care about karma, and the more unwilling they are to owe favors.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies was practically giving away this "Fragment World" for free. Without that sentence, Lin Yuan would probably have considered whether he would owe a karmic debt.</p><p></p><p>First giving away the "Fragment World" for free.</p><p></p><p>Then promising no karmic burden.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Lin Yuan didn't know what the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies' purpose was.</p><p></p><p>"Is it Elder Gu Ming?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>As an Elder's disciple, the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies had great authority.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how great, there were still limits. Giving away a "Fragment World" worth 1.2 million chaos stones for free? If Elder Gu Ming hadn't nodded and agreed behind the scenes,</p><p></p><p>This simply wouldn't be possible.</p><p></p><p>"What do you say? If Brother Yinhe agrees, we can settle this matter now. The ownership of the Star Tear 'Fragment World' can be transferred over immediately."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>A "Fragment World" worth 1.2 million - even with karmic restrictions, Lin Yuan would consider it, let alone without any karmic burden?</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to picking it up for free, so why not take it? After all, the human civilization had just left their universe. The better the environment of their new home, the more beneficial it would be for the future development of human civilization. Lin Yuan wouldn't have any reservations about this.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"This is the core control formation for the Star Tear 'Fragment World'."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies produced a crystal with a flip of his hand. Earlier, when the Chaos Dragon Beast's roar shattered countless massive meteorites that collapsed into many "Fragment Worlds", he had taken the initiative to organize them and integrate them into the grand formation of the Gu Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>This crystal represented the control rights to that Star Tear "Fragment World".</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took the crystal and briefly examined it, his heart slightly settling.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies chatted with Lin Yuan for a while longer, mainly introducing some uses of the "Fragment World".</p><p></p><p>After parting with the Lord of Ten Thousand Melodies, Lin Yuan got up and left the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Elder Gu Ming give me such a 'Fragment World'?" Lin Yuan walked in the trading area, pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>First of all, Elder Gu Ming certainly had no hostility towards him.</p><p></p><p>With Elder Gu Ming's status as a Chaos Elder, if he had any killing intent, this avatar of Lin Yuan would have been destroyed long ago, with no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>There was also no hatred between Lin Yuan and Elder Gu Ming, and it was even more impossible for there to be any grudges.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could sense Elder Gu Ming's goodwill towards him. If he had even slightly ulterior motives, he wouldn't have absolved Lin Yuan of any karmic debt.</p><p></p><p>"At least the clan's new home is settled for now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at that Star Tear "Fragment World", thinking to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought he would have to settle for second best, choosing those slightly inferior "Fragment Worlds". He didn't expect the most satisfying Star Tear "Fragment World" would still end up in his hands, and in an almost "free" way.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Ming and the black-robed youth were watching the scenes in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"That 'Yinhe' accepted the Fragment World." Elder Gu Ming let out a slight sigh of relief, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>According to the black-robed youth's "foresight" talent, he predicted that Lin Yuan would very likely become a Chaos Great Saint in the future. Faced with such a being of limitless potential, not offending him was the most basic approach - to do otherwise would be seeking death.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to consider how to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>This befriending required great finesse. First, they couldn't make the other party feel any pressure or discomfort. For example, if Elder Gu Ming appeared directly and offered various treasures, it would instead make Lin Yuan wary.</p><p></p><p>This would be somewhat counterproductive.</p><p></p><p>So when the other party needed something</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The most appropriate approach is to quietly push things forward from behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe beside him spoke up, "This Galaxy person definitely knows it was you, Gu Ming, who instructed Wan Qu to act that way behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>No one who has cultivated to the twelfth level is a fool. How could Wan Qu Sovereign give such a gift for no reason without Venerable Gu Ming's instructions from behind?</p><p></p><p>"That's natural," Venerable Gu Ming nodded.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's truly incredible that with your 'precognition', you sensed an unavoidable crisis of death," Venerable Gu Ming was still amazed.</p><p></p><p>The future is uncertain, and any change can produce countless timelines.</p><p></p><p>The young man in the black robe was no stranger to encountering cultivation geniuses with immense potential, such as those descendants and heirs of great saints.</p><p></p><p>But when facing these cultivation geniuses, the black-robed youth would only sense a faint crisis, indicating that these geniuses only had a minuscule probability of growing to threaten him in the future.</p><p></p><p>Out of a million future timelines, perhaps only one or two would allow them to reach the level of a great saint.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>That intense sense of crisis was almost overflowing. If the black-robed youth wasn't certain that Lin Yuan was right in front of him, still at the peak of the Path-breaking realm, he would have believed that Lin Yuan could become a Chaos Great Saint in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"It is incredible," the black-robed youth nodded. At the time, he was also frightened and even doubted whether his 'precognition' talent had malfunctioned.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that your 'precognition' ability can only sense crises, unable to capture more specifics. Otherwise, it would have been possible to use this opportunity to form a good relationship with this 'Galaxy'," Venerable Gu Ming sighed, somewhat regretfully.</p><p></p><p>What he could do now was to try to befriend Lin Yuan as much as possible without offending him. As for a good relationship? That was still far off.</p><p></p><p>Good relationships aren't easily formed. Without understanding Lin Yuan's temperament, Venerable Gu Ming didn't dare to overdo it. What if he accidentally displeased Lin Yuan? Wouldn't that ruin everything? He only gave that 'fragment world' because he saw that Lin Yuan truly wanted it, otherwise Venerable Gu Ming wouldn't have done so lightly.</p><p></p><p>"If I could 'foresee' scenes beyond crises, would I still be at the peak of the Sovereign realm now?" The black-robed youth rolled his eyes.</p><p></p><p>'Precognition' is an ability on the time dimension. Normally, it belongs to the domain of thirteenth-level time lifeforms. The fact that he could barely foresee crises was already due to his exceptionally strong bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that those thirteenth-level time lifeforms can see one timeline after another. For them, it's entirely possible to plan for the future they want by arranging the present," Venerable Gu Ming mused dreamily.</p><p></p><p>This was just for thirteenth-level time lifeforms. If it were a perfect fourteenth-level time lifeform, they could customize the future. If they were unsatisfied with the future, they could return to the past to make changes until the future was satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteenth-level time lifeforms are too distant. They are beings that many peerless great saints seek for universe after universe, traversing half the chaos void, yet still unable to find," the black-robed youth said.</p><p></p><p>Many peerless great saints spend their entire lives pursuing the footsteps of a thirteenth-level time lifeform.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, too distant," Venerable Gu Ming nodded, "But this 'Galaxy' is quite close."</p><p></p><p>Being able to get so close to a future Chaos Great Saint, as long as they took it slow and provided help when needed, it would be infinitely beneficial.</p><p></p><p>In the main universe.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat calmly under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully. His space-time comprehension had now reached the peak of the seventh level, just a hair's breadth away from the eighth level, which he could break through at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that after the universe's great collapse, when it begins anew, there will be scenes of chaos giving birth to all things, which is very helpful for comprehending powers that evolve from chaos rules as their foundation," Lin Yuan thought to himself. However, this scene could only be seen from within the universe. As for outside the universe? It would just be a gray, hazy mass.</p><p></p><p>"When the universe collapses, I'll leave an avatar in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to watch how the universe is reborn," Lin Yuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't watch the universe's rebirth, Lin Yuan would still leave an avatar in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm as one of his life-saving measures.</p><p></p><p>After all, the safety of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was beyond doubt. Plus, it was isolated from causality and space-time. Even if Lin Yuan encountered insurmountable dangers in the chaos void in the future, he would still have the life-saving measure of his avatar in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight Supreme Beings appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The migration of our race is basically complete. However, recently those alien powerhouses all want to fully integrate into our human civilization, only asking us to take them out," Supreme Being Xia Qin looked at Lin Yuan and asked, "What do you think about this matter, Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>"Take them out," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>No matter which universe collapses, the vast majority of life forms will perish along with the universe's collapse, and even most of the twelfth-level ultimates will be left behind.</p><p></p><p>The human civilization's ability to bring everyone out completely relied on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So it was only natural for those alien powerhouses who were left behind to choose to completely sell themselves to human civilization in order to survive.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had no reservations about this. This kind of complete integration and selling oneself was no different from slavery. They would certainly be implanted with various measures, with no possibility of rebellion.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight Supreme Beings nodded, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Not far from where Lin Yuan was sitting, two figures condensed again.</p><p></p><p>It was the two ultimates from the Calamity race.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>The two Calamity race ultimates bowed slightly towards Lin Yuan, speaking respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan opened his eyes to look at them.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the two Calamity race ultimates trembled. When Lin Yuan's gaze fell upon them, they had an illusion of their souls continuously falling.</p><p></p><p>"Just a single glance makes our souls fall. If Supreme Being Galaxy wanted to kill us, even with the protection of our ancestral house, we couldn't withstand it," the two Calamity race ultimates swallowed and secretly speculated.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a Great Saint's reincarnation, still so terrifying even under the universe's suppression."</p><p></p><p>The Calamity race originally came from a Great Saint-level power in the chaos void, so the two ultimates knew many secret intelligence reports and were very clear about the difficulty of Lin Yuan reaching his current level.</p><p></p><p>"Without the universe's suppression, Supreme Being Galaxy could probably soar to great heights, returning to the Great Saint realm in an extremely short time," the two Calamity race ultimates secretly marveled. "With Supreme Being Galaxy's strength, he doesn't need to reincarnate at all. Could it be for the sake of breaking through to that step?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Lin Yuan looked at the two Calamity race ultimates and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>He already knew all the secrets about the Calamity race, and even had a seven or eight out of ten understanding of that wooden house.</p><p></p><p>"Supreme Being Galaxy, the universe's great collapse is imminent. With your strength, blocking the destructive calamity of the great collapse shouldn't be a problem, but you still need to be careful," the Calamity race ultimate standing on the left said in a slightly solemn tone, looking outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful of what's outside the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also looked out, his expression thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 428: Refining the Strongest Weapon (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Lin Yuan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the immeasurable fluctuations of the rules in the main universe, a smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>In the last twenty-odd years in the Boundless Void, Lin Yuan's comprehension of the rules had progressed slowly. </p><p></p><p>One of the main reasons was that the ocean of rules in the Boundless Void was too shallow.</p><p></p><p>One could see the bottom with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>But the main universe?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan saw hope for a significant improvement in his comprehension of the rules.</p><p></p><p>"In the Boundless Void, the Six Realms of Space-Time was already the limit, theoretically it was impossible to achieve the Seven Realms of Space-Time," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the Six Realms of Space-Time was extremely difficult to attain.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the creators of the secret realms and the Children of the Void were able to cross into the tenth stage was due to their innate talents and aptitudes.</p><p></p><p>However, now, Lin Yuan sensed the even more vast and profound fluctuations of space-time beyond the Six Realms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, sensing it was one thing, being able to comprehend it was another.</p><p></p><p>It was like an ordinary person seeing a towering mountain in the distance - seeing it and reaching it were two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the Six Realms of Space-Time, Lin Yuan did not delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the limitations of the Boundless Void, it was also because his own level was too low.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Six Realms at the tenth stage? At least in the main universe, he did not know if there were any predecessors, but he was definitely unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>As for comprehending the Seven Realms of Space-Time? Lin Yuan did not have that thought for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"The space-time of the cosmic starry sky is too vast."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's understanding of the cosmic starry sky had changed greatly compared to before the tenth traversal.</p><p></p><p>Before the tenth traversal, Lin Yuan's boundary of space-time was only at the Second Realm, but now he had reached the Six Realms, with every detail of space-time flooding into his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's too vast, too magnificent."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, marveling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the entire cosmic starry sky was a football field, even with the comprehension of the Six Realms of Space-Time, he could not achieve the "travel by thought" ability he had in the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference in the vastness of space-time between the main universe and the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky, not to mention Lin Yuan who had merely reached the Six Realms of Space-Time comprehension, even a Paramount Realm expert at the twelfth stage could not "travel by thought."</p><p></p><p>Within the vast domains of the main universe, there were occasionally scattered space-time hazards.</p><p></p><p>There existed layer upon layer of space-time labyrinths.</p><p></p><p>Even with the comprehension of the Six Realms of Space-Time, one could not traverse them directly.</p><p></p><p>"However, with my current control over space-time, coupled with the 'Nine Steps of Space-Time'..."</p><p></p><p>"Unless a Paramount expert personally pursues me, I would be standing on undefeatable ground."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was certain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not achieve the "omnipresence" of the Boundless Void in the main universe, his ability to traverse space was far beyond what it was before the traversal.</p><p></p><p>Add to that the "Nine Steps of Space-Time"...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention those below the Paramount Realm, Lin Yuan had a feeling that even Paramount experts would have to wait until the fifth or sixth step to have a chance of catching up to him, or they might as well wait until he completed all nine steps.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Sect's life-escaping secret technique, the "Nine Steps of Space-Time," was unquestionably formidable in terms of escape speed.</p><p></p><p>This was a Dharma-protecting secret technique created by the Xuanhuang Emperor himself specifically for the disciples of the Xuanhuang Sect while traversing the Chaos Void.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan believed that Paramount experts could not necessarily catch up to him within the nine steps when it came to escaping, he would not be foolish enough to offend a Paramount expert.</p><p></p><p>If a Paramount expert wanted to kill a life form below the twelfth stage, did they need to personally catch up? A soul attack would be enough.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan began to evaluate himself.</p><p></p><p>But now, even a Legendary Realm expert at the perfected eleventh stage like the Four Celestial Kings, if they did not wield a Paramount weapon, Lin Yuan could easily suppress them.</p><p></p><p>The Six Realms of Space-Time was simply overwhelming compared to the Five Realms.</p><p></p><p>If the combat power of a perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert was 10, and the combat power of the Evil Deities at the tenth stage in the Boundless Void was between 15 and 20, then Lin Yuan's combat power would be around 100.</p><p></p><p>As for the combat power of a twelfth stage Paramount expert, using this as a standard, it would be in the range of millions to hundreds of millions.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan was still far from matching a twelfth stage Paramount expert, he had now surpassed ordinary perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan was able to overwhelm those perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts by taking advantage of the environmental limitations of the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>In reality, however, he had merely taken a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's true combat power had fully surpassed perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>By "fully surpassed," he meant those Legendary Realm experts relying solely on their own abilities, not including external factors.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Evil Deities at the tenth stage in the Boundless Void, the perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts in the main universe had a huge advantage - weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Kings could integrate with a Paramount weapon, causing a significant increase in their combat power.</p><p></p><p>Other perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts also had the opportunity to obtain a Paramount weapon.</p><p></p><p>Most perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts in the main universe were backed by either a paramount clan or a Paramount expert.</p><p></p><p>In order to increase their chances of breaking through to the ultimate realm, the paramount clans or Paramount experts would bestow a Paramount weapon, allowing these Legendary Realm experts to comprehend the power of the twelfth stage in advance.</p><p></p><p>These Paramount weapons were only temporarily granted. If they successfully crossed into the twelfth stage, they would keep the weapon. If they failed to break through, the weapon would return to the clan.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Four Celestial Kings had such a great reputation among the many perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts in the main universe was because of the Paramount weapon they possessed, which was highly compatible with their own abilities.</p><p></p><p>A Paramount weapon that was compatible with oneself not only allowed the comprehension of more power from the twelfth stage but also enabled the profound exploitation of the weapon's capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Paramount weapon possessed by the Four Celestial Kings was lost in the two-dimensional world, along with the departure of that "blank sheet of paper," resulting in the loss of their fundamental spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>This caused the Four Celestial Kings to fall from the pinnacle of perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to elaborate on the enhancement of combat power provided by Paramount weapons.</p><p></p><p>When fully activated, they could unleash a combat power of hundreds, and this activation was solely through one's own power, without any backup from a Paramount expert within the Paramount weapon.</p><p></p><p>Based on the combat power of 10 for a perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert, unleashing a combat power of hundreds meant that a Legendary expert wielding a Paramount weapon could easily overwhelm a group of Legendary experts without Paramount weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, a perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert wielding a Paramount weapon could unleash power far beyond their own limits.</p><p></p><p>However, the cost of activating a Paramount weapon was also terrifyingly high. With the foundation of a perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert, they could not activate a Paramount weapon for more than a few moves.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount weapons... I have many."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan's Solar Celestial Spirit entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the cosmic starry sky of the main universe, if one were to discuss the quantity of Paramount weapons, Lin Yuan ranked first among those below the twelfth stage, and no one dared claim second place.</p><p></p><p>During the journey in the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had acquired nearly a hundred wondrous items.</p><p></p><p>Even if half of these wondrous items were just twelfth-grade precious materials, the number of Paramount weapons still exceeded thirty.</p><p></p><p>Thirty Paramount weapons? Although not as many as the treasuries of paramount clans, it was enough to make any perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert look up in awe.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they could not even look up.</p><p></p><p>Almost all perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm experts had only temporarily "borrowed" the Paramount weapon they possessed from their clans.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared in the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was also where many wondrous items were stored.</p><p></p><p>"Paramount weapons..."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, thirty-two Paramount weapons appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-two Paramount weapons were neatly arranged, including swords, guns, cauldrons, and towers, with various types.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can choose a few Paramount weapons."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stroked his chin.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Lin Yuan had not chosen any Paramount weapons because he wanted to refine them.</p><p></p><p>Even for a preliminary refinement, it required the boundary of comprehension at the Five Realms of Space-Time.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Five Realms of Space-Time, it was impossible to activate the vast space-time within a Paramount weapon, let alone refine it.</p><p></p><p>This was the case even for a perfected eleventh stage Legendary Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's tenth spatial shuttle, his comprehension of space-time was only at the second level. Naturally, he had no thoughts of refining supreme weapons. </p><p></p><p>But now? Lin Yuan's comprehension of space-time had reached the sixth level. Not only could he refine supreme weapons, but in terms of speed, he could absolutely crush those eleventh level perfected legendary lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a higher comprehension of space-time would also be very helpful in excavating the power of supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>A supreme weapon, in the hands of a supreme being, could unleash a might of millions or even hundreds of millions of combat forces.</p><p></p><p>But in the hands of an eleventh level perfected legendary lifeform, it could only unleash a combat force of a few hundred? The excavation of supreme weapons by eleventh level perfected lifeforms could not even be considered a tiny fraction.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully selected thirty-two supreme weapons, which required careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Although in Lin Yuan's heart, the most suitable supreme weapon was the Primordial Bell, but at present, the Primordial Bell was still far from metamorphosing into a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Lin Yuan didn't mind taking a few supreme weapons to get by.</p><p></p><p>Even if these supreme weapons were not very suitable for himself, their inherently high level could still greatly enhance his combat force.</p><p></p><p>"This black iron rod."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards a jet-black iron rod.</p><p></p><p>This iron rod was the first offensive weapon Lin Yuan obtained in the two-dimensional world.</p><p></p><p>Although he was in the two-dimensional world, suppressed by the dimension reduction, the aura exuded by the iron rod was extremely powerful, filled with an overbearing heaviness.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the two-dimensional world and arriving in the main universe, the might of the iron rod itself began to recover. Holding this iron rod, Lin Yuan estimated that the force he exerted could lift tens of thousands of stars.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if it's handy."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan arrived in the high skies of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had used this jet-black iron rod many times, but the jet-black iron rod in the two-dimensional world was completely different from the current one.</p><p></p><p>With the recovery of the twelfth level power, just holding the iron rod in his hand gave Lin Yuan a posture of crushing the galaxies.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually waved the jet-black iron rod forward.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying jet-black rod shadow tore through the void of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, creating a tens of millions of miles long black spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Before initially refining a supreme weapon, if one's comprehension of the fusion of space-time rules was high enough, one could unleash a small portion of the supreme weapon's might in advance.</p><p></p><p>But for Lin Yuan, this was nothing. He did not fully activate this supreme weapon, merely trying it out to see if it was handy.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>One black spatial rift after another appeared, and everything that came into contact with these black spatial rifts was annihilated.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked on curiously, not knowing what Lin Yuan was about to do.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the six-armed figure vaguely sensed something amiss about Lin Yuan's descent this time, but was unclear about what exactly was off.</p><p></p><p>Until—</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, holding that jet-black iron rod, gave a casual wave, tearing open a tens of millions of miles long black rift.</p><p></p><p>This black rift made the six-armed figure's heart tremble in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the main universe, the space in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was more stable.</p><p></p><p>To tear space in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm required at least the peak of the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>But even for a ninth level peak, the number of spatial layers that could be torn apart in an instant was at most a few tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>Even those with a special boundary of millions of layers at the ninth level could not tear more spatial layers than that with their full power.</p><p></p><p>The same went for tenth and eleventh level experts. If they were in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the number of spatial layers they could tear apart in an instant would not exceed a million.</p><p></p><p>But the rift that Lin Yuan just waved out with that iron rod was black.</p><p></p><p>Normal spatial rifts were mostly grayish. As for black rifts, that was a sign of almost tearing through all spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, with a bit more power from Lin Yuan's strike, he could probably pierce through the entire Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could the six-armed figure not be shaken? The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was opened by His Majesty the Xuanhuang Emperor. Even within the secret realm, the defenses were not as strong as the outside, but to break through the secret realm was not an easy feat.</p><p></p><p>At least those eleventh level perfected legendary lifeforms could not do it. Even with supreme weapons in hand, it would be very difficult for them to tear through so many spatial layers in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan tearing open one black rift after another, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of miles long, and his heart trembled violently.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how could you unleash the might of a supreme weapon to such an extent?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure could not believe it. He had also noticed that Lin Yuan's ability to tear open black spatial rifts came from the iron rod supreme weapon in his hand.</p><p></p><p>But activating a supreme weapon required sufficient comprehension of space-time, especially since Lin Yuan had not yet refined those supreme weapons. Even if he could activate them, the might he could unleash would be extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure had already guessed in his heart that Lin Yuan's comprehension of space-time was very high, perhaps reaching the twelfth level realm? But this young master of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was only at the tenth level!</p><p></p><p>In the high skies of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan casually waved the jet-black iron rod, feeling the might it unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, if I go all out and initially refine this supreme weapon, I can completely create a permanent spatial rift within the Xuanhuang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for a permanent spatial rift to appear was tearing through all spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Currently, with Lin Yuan holding the supreme weapon, even without initial refinement, he could unleash a might of over a thousand combat forces. The number of spatial layers in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was far less than the main universe, so it was possible to be completely torn open.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yuan could only do this in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm. To create a permanent spatial rift in the main universe would require at least a million combat force might.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the battle strength threshold of the twelfth level.</p><p></p><p>Only then could one tear through all the spatial layers of the main universe in one strike.</p><p></p><p>"This iron rod is still not suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>After trying it out for a while, Lin Yuan gave up on refining the iron rod.</p><p></p><p>The might of the iron rod was indeed great, but it did not match Lin Yuan's fighting style.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the two-dimensional world, Lin Yuan had used this supreme weapon against the experts of the myriad races many times.</p><p></p><p>If he chose to refine this jet-black iron rod now, as soon as he used it outside, the experts of the myriad races in the starry void would quickly recognize it.</p><p></p><p>They would then conclude that the human evolver called "Blood Rain" in the two-dimensional world was Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Supreme weapons may not be unique, but there were only so many. With a rod-shaped supreme weapon, the selection was very small.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued trying out the other thirty-one supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>In the end, for offensive supreme weapons, he chose a silver-white battle blade.</p><p></p><p>This silver-white battle blade contained the complete laws of the spatial dao, not just spatial rules. With one slash, it reached the pinnacle of sharpness.</p><p></p><p>As for physical defense, Lin Yuan chose a golden armor, the premium physical defense weapon among the thirty-two supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>For soul defense, Lin Yuan's choice was very limited, because among the thirty-two supreme weapons, there was only one for soul defense.</p><p></p><p>It was a deep blue bead.</p><p></p><p>Three supreme weapons - one for attack, two for defense.</p><p></p><p>Armed to the teeth. Other eleventh level perfected legendary lifeforms could only obtain one supreme weapon bestowed by their race, but Lin Yuan equipped three at once.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that with my comprehension of space-time, even if I can quickly refine supreme weapons, the energy required to activate them means I can only possess three at most."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>If possible, he would naturally want to refine all the supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>But it was unrealistic. If one was not a supreme being, the burden of activating supreme weapons was immense. Even if Lin Yuan crossed into the eleventh level, he could not simultaneously activate too many supreme weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Just these three."</p><p></p><p>"Now, let's begin refining."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reappeared in the deepest part of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, picked up the silver-white battle blade, and his spiritual will began to permeate it, rapidly refining it.</p><p></p><p>Refining a supreme weapon was no simple matter. Normally, for an eleventh level perfected being to initially refine a supreme weapon would take at least thousands or tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was much faster - at most a few years to refine one.</p>

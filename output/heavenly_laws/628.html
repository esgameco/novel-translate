        <h1>Chapter 628</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The myriad great Dao rules, with time and space as supreme, as for the chaotic rules? When the world was opened, the chaotic rules evolved into the myriad great Dao rules, not included in this.</p><p></p><p>As a 13th-tier weapon, the small cauldron had long since transcended the simple category of a weapon, it also has a vast world within, with numerous great Dao rules operating.</p><p></p><p>These operating great Dao rules are all based on the understanding of the great Dao rules by the master of this small cauldron - that is, the time life's understanding of the great Dao rules is different from the chaotic void's great Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>Especially the way the time-space interweaving, for Lin Yuan, is an unprecedented touch.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The time and space in Lin Yuan's eyes suddenly became simple and orderly, as if the originally messy threads had been thoroughly combed through.</p><p></p><p>【Your transcendent insight, observing the operation of the world's rules, has greatly enhanced your understanding of the time-space fusion rules】</p><p></p><p>A large amount of time-space understanding converged, Lin Yuan's eyes shone, as if he had seen through the essence of countless time-spaces in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"The nine realms of time-space, this is the nine realms of time-space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was full of vigor, originally his understanding of time and space had reached the peak of the eighth realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, after being touched by the vast world of time-space operation within the small cauldron, he naturally crossed into the ninth realm of time-space.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, those chaotic saints, their attainments in time-space understanding, basically remained at the eighth realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the ninth realm? That is the exclusive domain of the supreme saints, only a small number of supreme saints, or simply the invincible saints who dominate an era, can reach the peak of the ninth realm in time-space understanding.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder in the late period, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor's attainments in time-space understanding seemed to surpass the ninth realm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought of the way the Mysterious Emperor's mausoleum was integrated with time and space, that method of using time and space had reached an inconceivable level.</p><p></p><p>At least at that time, Lin Yuan couldn't see through it at all.</p><p></p><p>Now thinking about it, it should be the harvest of His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor after contemplating this small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was able to have a great harvest in the initial contemplation stage, pushing his time-space understanding to the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>For His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor, the invincible saint, even if his insight was far inferior to Lin Yuan's, but after contemplating for a period of time, he would eventually have a harvest.</p><p></p><p>And when reaching the peak of the ninth realm of time-space, each step forward is difficult, but the improvement in the mastery of time and space will also surge greatly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated that in the end, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor's attainments in time-space understanding had one foot across the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, no matter how high the time-space understanding is, it is of no use for breaking through the time cycle, and even because of the proficiency in time-space understanding, it will face challenges within the time cycle, which will have nothing to do with time and space."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, this is also one of the reasons why His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor did not continue to contemplate the small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>If he could cross into the 13th tier, with the surge in the level of life, the time-space understanding would naturally reach beyond the ninth realm.</p><p></p><p>"But I don't need to consider these things now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly, the other reason why His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor rushed to break through to the 13th tier at that time was that the small cauldron was about to be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>After being suppressed by His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor for more than 30 million cosmic eras, this small cauldron will not break free within the next hundred cosmic eras.</p><p></p><p>And a hundred cosmic eras?</p><p></p><p>From Lin Yuan's birth to the present, even including the time he traveled through, it is only about ten thousand years. If a cosmic era is an endless vast ocean, then the time Lin Yuan has experienced is just a drop of water, or even a billionth of a drop of water.</p><p></p><p>From the Sovereign Realm to the Chaotic Realm, His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor's expectation for Lin Yuan is to reach it within a hundred cosmic eras, based on the premise that he is unaware of Lin Yuan's true cultivation time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to contemplate the small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Lin Yuan dimly saw a blurry figure of a bald and majestic figure, and in front of him, more than ten weapons were floating, including the small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>As the small cauldron floated, the endless power aura spread in all directions, and everything within the range of tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of void domains was completely annihilated under the power of the small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"That should be the true master of the small cauldron, the mark left by the 13th-tier time life."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood, naturally not daring to touch it, for fear of attracting the attention of that 13th-tier time life.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the reason why this 13th-tier time life has not taken back the small cauldron for a long time may not be that he has forgotten, but that the time concept of the 13th-tier life is fundamentally different from that of the 12th-tier life.</p><p></p><p>30 million cosmic eras? 300 million cosmic eras? Perhaps in the eyes of the 13th-tier time life, it is just a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The 13th-tier time life can see through many future timelines, and for them, perhaps they will only recall the small cauldron at a certain point in the future when they need it.</p><p></p><p>As for what the small cauldron will experience during this period and whose hands it will fall into, that time life doesn't really care.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Void Cauldron?"</p><p></p><p>During the in-depth contemplation of the small cauldron, Lin Yuan learned the name of the small cauldron.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Void Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>This is also the mark left within the small cauldron, and he can know it with a little contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the 13th-tier time life?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts were very complex.</p><p></p><p>Just the residual power emanating from a 13th-tier weapon can easily annihilate the range of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of void domains.</p><p></p><p>If that 13th-tier time life exerted its full power, wouldn't it be able to destroy half of the chaotic void? And this is just in terms of sheer power, for the 13th-tier life, the most important thing is the mastery of the future timelines.</p><p></p><p>The 13th-tier life can see through the future timelines, and then choose a predetermined timeline to follow, of course, subject to the interference of other 13th-tier lives.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional gap that His Majesty the Mysterious Emperor experienced was the place where two time lives intervened, perhaps at a critical time node, the two time lives acted greatly for the future they wanted.</p><p></p><p>For the time lives, all existences below the 13th-tier are just chess pieces, only the same-tier time lives are opponents, they are the ones playing the chess game.</p><p></p><p>The inner cosmos.</p><p></p><p>While contemplating the Heavenly Void Cauldron, Lin Yuan also sent a thread of consciousness to descend into his inner cosmos.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious places of the origin things."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the floating life source stone, primordial ore crystal, nine heavens thunder core and other things.</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask the senior, see if I can integrate them into the inner cosmos."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred, appearing next to the jade gourd, taking out more than ten origin things.</p><p></p><p>Although when he obtained these origin things, Lin Yuan had the idea of integrating them into the inner cosmos.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he still decided to ask for the opinion of the red-robed girl.</p><p></p><p>After all, she is the spirit created by the 13th-tier time life, and is specifically used to guide the "Infinite Void" 13th-tier inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Through the contemplation of the Heavenly Void Cauldron, Lin Yuan has a clear understanding of the greatness of the 13th-tier life, and increasingly realizes his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>"These?" </p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tong opened his eyes wide when he saw more than a dozen origin objects.</p><p></p><p>The origin objects were the foundations of a great mysterious realm, and the spirits of those mysterious realms would never willingly throw them out.</p><p></p><p>Even the invincible great saints who dominated an era would find it difficult to obtain an origin object. The life source stone that the Mysterious Emperor obtained earlier was not obtained through normal means, but rather 'stolen' through a certain opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"What did you do? How did those guys end up handing over so many origin objects?" </p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child found it hard to believe. Over the long years, even the cultivators of previous generations of the "Infinite Void" had produced invincible great saints.</p><p></p><p>They had naturally entered many mysterious realms, but they did not dare to provoke the spirits of those mysterious realms too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, if they pushed the other party too hard, they would have to seek help from the time life behind them, and no Twelfth Heavenly Realm cultivator could bear the consequences, not even the invincible great saints who cultivated the Thirteenth Heavenly Realm inheritance.</p><p></p><p>To make the other party honestly hand over these origin objects, one would need an extremely powerful background that was not afraid of the threat of the Thirteenth Heavenly Realm time life. But if one had such a powerful backer, they would not even care about these origin objects.</p><p></p><p>"It was just lucky," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Now he also had a rough idea of how Emperor Xuan went to see those 'old friends'.</p><p></p><p>If Emperor Xuan was destined to perish, forcibly entering the mysterious realms would naturally not care about the Thirteenth Heavenly Realm time life.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was going to die anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Can they be integrated into the internal universe?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>This was also his biggest concern.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they can."</p><p></p><p>"Of course they can," the red-robed girl child immediately jumped up. "These origin objects don't mean much to other Chaotic Realm Perfected cultivators, at most they can form environments similar to those mysterious realms."</p><p></p><p>"Because their internal universes have a fixed upper limit, they can't fully utilize the potential of these origin objects."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child looked at Lin Yuan, "But you're different, your internal universe is evolving towards the Chaotic Void, if you nurture these origin objects in advance, allowing them to form mysterious realms, you will naturally gain great benefits, immense benefits."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child exclaimed in amazement, "Originally I planned to wait until you reached Chaotic Realm Perfection or had the strength of an invincible great saint, and then try to obtain these origin objects from those mysterious realms."</p><p></p><p>"With your strength, when you reach Chaotic Realm Perfection, you should surpass the normal invincible great saints. At that time, by going to those mysterious realms and using threats and temptation, there is a good chance you would succeed."</p><p></p><p>"But now..."</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child looked at the origin objects in front of her.</p><p></p><p>She felt that she had underestimated Lin Yuan, he didn't even need to wait until Chaotic Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I'll start integrating them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said. Unlike the fusion and devouring of the Blazing Sun Source, which was Lin Yuan's spiritual power, these origin objects ultimately belonged to external objects, so he had to consider it more carefully before the fusion and devouring.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," the red-robed girl child nodded, looking at Lin Yuan: "I'm getting more and more excited to see how far your internal universe will grow, whether it can reach the theoretical Seventh Layer of the 'Infinite Void'."</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Layer of the 'Infinite Void'?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts expanded. According to the creator of this inheritance, that is, the Time Life, the Seventh Layer of the 'Infinite Void' nurtured in the internal universe would be comparable to the Chaotic Void, perhaps able to rival the Thirteenth Heavenly Realm Time Life in terms of the internal universe. Of course, this comparison is limited to the internal universe alone.</p><p></p><p>The internal universe was vast and boundless. </p><p></p><p>After his time-space comprehension reached the Ninth Realm, Lin Yuan's internal universe once again underwent frenzied expansion.</p><p></p><p>From a diameter of tens of billions of light-years, it directly expanded to a radius of 180 billion light-years.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that Lin Yuan's internal universe has never been focused on size and area, but on the level of quality.</p><p></p><p>A universe with a diameter of tens of billions of light-years is enough to shake those with trillions or quadrillions of light-years of internal universes.</p><p></p><p>Now reaching 180 billion light-years, the foundational potential can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>"Integrate."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took out the life source stone.</p><p></p><p>This life source stone was only the size of a fist, but it faintly exuded a powerful life aura, like a vast and mighty ocean.</p><p></p><p>Splash, splash.</p><p></p><p>The life source stone was thrown out by Lin Yuan, and the primal universe essence immediately surged forth, quickly devouring and integrating the source stone.</p><p></p><p>Splash, splash.</p><p></p><p>After devouring and integrating the external life source stone, Lin Yuan vaguely felt that he could grasp a strand of the most fundamental power of life.</p><p></p><p>"Gather."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind moved.</p><p></p><p>That strand of the most fundamental power of life began to spread, vaguely forming a 'pond' completely composed of life essence.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked down at the small pond, "The mysterious realm 'Sea of Life' is vast and boundless, but the result is that I have now formed a small pond using its origin object?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't find this surprising. The Sea of Life was left behind by the Thirteenth Heavenly Realm Time Life, and Lin Yuan was not as powerful as the Time Life, so the mysterious realm nurtured by the life source stone would naturally be far inferior to the former.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this inferiority is only temporary.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's strength increases and his internal universe continues to evolve, these 'mysterious realms' that he has nurtured will also continue to grow.</p><p></p><p>Next, </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan used this to integrate the primal crystal and the Nine Heavens Thunder Core into his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>The various origin objects continued to evolve within Lin Yuan's internal universe, forming a series of 'micro' mysterious realms.</p><p></p><p>"Void Golden Leaf?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the last origin object.</p><p></p><p>This origin object came from a mysterious realm called the Void Divine Tree, and it was the core leaf of the tree. It gave Lin Yuan a feeling as if he was observing the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Void Divine Tree is towering and vast, with each leaf the size of a void domain. This Void Golden Leaf is from the treetop, and since ancient times, no peerless great saint has ever come into contact with it, and no relevant information has been passed down."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The origin objects that Emperor Xuan had obtained for him, Lin Yuan had chosen to integrate them all into his internal universe. Not only could this produce the most direct and far-reaching improvements for himself,</p><p></p><p>but there was also another reason - he didn't know what use these origin objects had. Trade?</p><p></p><p>Even peerless great saints would find it difficult to offer a price worthy of trading for such origin objects.</p><p></p><p>And if Lin Yuan rashly revealed that he possessed these origin objects, it would also bring him a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just integrate it directly."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tossed the Void Golden Leaf, and a vast amount of primal universe essence surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The Void Golden Leaf was quickly devoured and integrated, and the golden power containing boundless space immediately began to spread throughout the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

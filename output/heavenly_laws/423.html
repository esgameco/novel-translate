            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 423 The Deceased Founder of the Void Secret Realm (Extra Update, Seeking Monthly Ticket Support at Start of Month)</p><p></p><p>The boundless void was vast and expansive, but in Yuan Lin's eyes, with a thought, he could appear anywhere. </p><p></p><p>This was an ability that came from attaining a certain profound understanding of space-time.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin, who had reached the sixth level of mastery in the Space-Time Fusion Laws, had crossed the threshold into the realm of the supremely powerful in his comprehension of space-time.</p><p></p><p>The Void Secret Realm was located in the deepest layers of space within the boundless void, surrounded by space-time labyrinths.  </p><p></p><p>Even a ninth-level perfected Demon Sovereign would need maps and guidance to enter.</p><p></p><p>But those space-time labyrinths could not hinder Yuan Lin at all.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the fifth level of the Space-Time Fusion Laws, Yuan Lin could forcibly enter the Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now at the sixth level, the entire Void Secret Realm, inside and out, every region, held no secrets before Yuan Lin - it was like his own backyard.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin could even create an entirely new "Void Secret Realm" if he wished, more perfect and grander than the original.</p><p></p><p>The tenth-level Demon Sovereigns of the boundless void had, to a certain extent, attained an understanding of space-time approaching the sixth level based on their innate talents.</p><p></p><p>But this sixth level was vastly different from Yuan Lin's, which was comprehended purely through insight, from nothing to mastery.</p><p></p><p>"Enter by myself?" The Child of the Void was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>The Void Secret Realm was painstakingly opened by its founder through tremendous effort.</p><p></p><p>While the Child did not doubt that Yuan Lin, having crossed into the tenth level, could forcibly enter, he could not fathom how Yuan Lin could descend into the core region without his permission, treating the hard-won secret realm like mere paper.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the next moment, the Child, as the realm's custodian, sensed the Martial Ancestor's presence descending into the deepest core region, appearing at its heart without any indication - as if he too was the realm's custodian.</p><p></p><p>The myriad space-time barriers and traps never even activated before the Martial Ancestor, as though he was one with the Child.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>Even knowing the Martial Ancestor had crossed the tenth level, the Child of the Void had some confidence.  </p><p></p><p>If the Martial Ancestor made excessive demands, like trying to enslave him, or harbored thoughts of killing him to seize the Void Secret Realm, he would refuse.</p><p></p><p>He could simply retreat to the deepest core, which not even a tenth-level existence could forcibly enter, according to the scant information left by the realm's founder.  </p><p></p><p>The opening of the Void Secret Realm was rooted in the boundless void itself. Unless one's space-time comprehension utterly surpassed the founder's, even at the same tenth level, one could not completely dominate the realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Child realized how laughable his final trump card was before the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Were it not for his lingering authority over the realm, the Child would have thought the Void Secret Realm had changed hands.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunate I did not say more earlier."  The Child was immensely relieved he had immediately agreed to the Martial Ancestor's terms instead of trying to use the Void Secret Realm as a final retreat to bargain. The outcome would likely have been far worse.</p><p></p><p>The Child had no doubt the Martial Ancestor would have killed him - what supreme expert was not utterly domineering? The previous custodian before the Martial Ancestor had been the same.</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Ancestor did not notice me?" The True Sovereign of Heavenly Intelligence beside him exhaled deeply. Of all the Demon Sovereigns present, he could be considered having the greatest connection to the Martial Ancestor.  </p><p></p><p>Not only had his avatar infiltrated the Azure Heavens realm and been suppressed by the Martial Ancestor, he had also schemed with many Demon Sovereigns to try to kill the Lord of the Yin-Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Given the Martial Ancestor's relationship with the Lord, killing the True Sovereign would be completely justified.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps in the Martial Ancestor's eyes, I was never worth noticing." The True Sovereign could not tell if he felt joy or loss - he had always prided himself on his "wisdom", but before the Martial Ancestor's absolute power, even the highest wisdom paled.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest region of the Void Secret Realm, Yuan Lin was casually observing his surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the sixth level of space-time mastery, his Solar Celestial Spirit had roamed the realm for years but could not break through the final barriers sealing the deepest areas.</p><p></p><p>"At the tenth level, Demon Sovereigns' mastery of space-time is about equal to the sixth level, but in subtle aspects, they still fall short."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Yuan Lin concluded that this was the difference between innate talent and self-cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>In the early stages, Demon Sovereigns could crush martial cultivators through sheer advantage.  </p><p></p><p>But as the realm increased, this gap would rapidly shrink until the tables turned.</p><p></p><p>"But where has the realm's founder gone?"  </p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin wondered briefly. A tenth-level existence like the founder stood between the eleventh perfected level and twelfth level of the prime cosmos.  </p><p></p><p>Such a powerful life could live from the opening of a cosmos until its collapse, spanning an entire cosmic cycle.</p><p></p><p>This boundless void clearly had not undergone destruction and rebirth, as legends of the founder persisted and the Void Secret Realm remained. So in theory, the founder should still be alive.  </p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin had initially thought the founder was sleeping in some hidden corner, but after crossing the sixth space-time level and surveying the boundless void, he found no trace of the founder's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Here?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin looked around. This was the core region at the deepest part of the Void Secret Realm, a vast desert environment.  </p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin stood at its center, facing several towering stone pillars.  </p><p></p><p>Yuan Lin's gaze...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Scanning across those few massive stone pillars, some information was left on them, all from the creator of this secret realm, simply leaving instructions for future overseers of the secret realm on certain matters. </p><p></p><p>Regarding the refinement and overseeing methods of the Void Secret Realm, as well as allowing future overseers to continue opening the secret realm, enhancing the spiritual will of the myriad evil gods of the boundless void, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"This creator of the secret realm was rather benevolent."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. The creation of the Void Secret Realm basically had no benefits for a creator at the tenth stage. The ones who benefited were those evil gods at the eighth and ninth stages.</p><p></p><p>After all, killing the void creatures inside the secret realm could truly and substantially enhance one's spiritual will.</p><p></p><p>And the evil gods were already filled with all kinds of madness. With a powerful spiritual will, it would be easier for them to maintain rationality.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Very soon, Lin Yuan finished browsing all the stone pillars, and his gaze fell back on the first one.</p><p></p><p>This pillar had no specific information, only a complex pattern. Lin Yuan had not paid much attention to it at first.</p><p></p><p>"Behind this pattern, it's connected to a hidden space?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed carefully, and finally operated his space-time power to activate the force of the pattern.</p><p></p><p>A faint suction force enveloped Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, he could break free from this suction force with just a thought, but he did not.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan appeared on a mountain peak, with a figure sitting on a boulder in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The figure wore a gray robe and was only four to five meters tall. At first glance, it seemed lifeless like a withered tree, with no ears or nose, only five eyes and a mouth.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to discover this hidden space, you must have also crossed into the tenth stage," the gray-robed figure said slowly.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the creator of the secret realm?" Lin Yuan looked at the gray-robed figure and realized it was just a remnant impression, similar to the "programs" of the human civilization in the main universe, which would be triggered whenever a life form entered.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know which era it is now, but for the boundless void to give birth to a second being at the tenth stage is a good thing, a fortunate event," the gray-robed figure continued.</p><p></p><p>The words spoken by the gray-robed figure were not in any language but rather spiritual undulations that any life form could comprehend the meaning of.</p><p></p><p>"The second tenth-stage being?" Lin Yuan's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"After crossing into the tenth stage, I could sense the suppression from the boundless void, as well as a sense of fear from the distant eons to come. I will die; if not now, then in the future," the gray-robed figure said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan listened silently.</p><p></p><p>Even in the main universe, unless one could make the ultimate leap and break free from the shackles of the river of time, even the most powerful life forms would eventually die.</p><p></p><p>This was not a matter of lifespan but rather the collapse and destruction of the universe. The river of time would also collapse, and at that time, any life within the river of time that had not broken free from its shackles would perish along with it.</p><p></p><p>The fear of death and oppression that this creator of the secret realm sensed must have come from the distant eons when this boundless void would enter destruction, and the river of time would also enter destruction.</p><p></p><p>"My intuition told me that to continue living, I had to break through to that step," the gray-robed figure said, his tone subtly wavering with anticipation and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Break through to that step?" Lin Yuan pondered. It should refer to breaking through to the ultimate realm, but since this boundless void had no predecessors, the gray-robed figure did not know what realm he wanted to break through to, so he used the vague term "that step" instead.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to that step, I could sense the danger, but if I don't break through, I will definitely die, so I have no choice," the gray-robed figure continued.</p><p></p><p>"He must have failed," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally understood why he could not find any trace of the creator of the secret realm throughout this boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to break through to the ultimate realm would propel one's entire being, including the imprint of one's life on this void, out of the river of time. If one failed, one's self would disappear completely, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Since there had been no news of him for so long, he must have failed.</p><p></p><p>"So before attempting the breakthrough, I decided to leave something behind for this boundless void. I expended great effort to create this Void Secret Realm, sealing away those gap creatures from outside the void."</p><p></p><p>"And—"</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed figure looked at Lin Yuan. "I have also prepared a gift for you. Consider it a celebratory present."</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed figure gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood there in silence.</p><p></p><p>Attempting to break through to the ultimate realm, if one failed, it meant complete annihilation, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>The creator of the Void Secret Realm was a tenth-stage evil god whose foundation was even above those legendary eleventh-stage perfected beings in the main universe. Yet he had also failed in his attempt to break through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>His entire existence had vanished, leaving behind only this lonely Void Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Will I end up the same way in the future?" Lin Yuan wondered silently.</p><p></p><p>But in an instant, Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was different from the creator of the Void Secret Realm. That creator had no predecessors and could only forge ahead blindly, so failure was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had the human civilization behind him, with the experiences of countless paramount experts, as well as some treasures and methods that could increase his chances of breaking through to the ultimate realm. His chances of success would undoubtedly be far greater than that of the creator of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Lin Yuan was only at the tenth stage now. When he crossed into the eleventh stage, his foundation would undergo another complete metamorphosis, which would also directly increase his chances of breaking through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with his inverse transcendent comprehension...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan did not dare guarantee that he would definitely succeed in breaking through to the ultimate realm.</p><p></p><p>But he could definitely raise the chances of his breakthrough to the highest level.</p><p></p><p>"This creator of the secret realm also left behind a gift? A celebratory present?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked toward the boulder where the gray-robed figure had been, which also contained a vast space within.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan sent a strand of consciousness to probe it, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"These things...?"</p>

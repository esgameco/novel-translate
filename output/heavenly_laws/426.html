        <h1>Chapter 426</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 426: As if Falling into an Ice Cellar (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>[Remaining Residence Time: One Year]</p><p></p><p>In the hidden space of the Void Secret Realm, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on a huge rock, opening his eyes and glancing at the illusory text in the lower left of his vision.</p><p></p><p>"Time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. This time descending into the Boundless Void for six hundred years was about to end. </p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan spent another one-third of a strand of Realm-Crossing Primal Force, otherwise when the residence time was up, he would automatically return to the main world.</p><p></p><p>One-third of a strand of Realm-Crossing Primal Force was basically nothing to Lin Yuan. In exchange for six hundred years of peaceful cultivation time, it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>Butâ€”</p><p></p><p>In the recent twenty years, Lin Yuan had felt this Boundless Universe's limitations on him.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, the efficiency of his comprehension of rules was slowly decreasing.</p><p></p><p>To put it in more understandable terms, the Boundless Void had been emptied out by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Worlds of different sizes contain different profundities of innate rules.</p><p></p><p>Take the rules of time for example. Compared to the time rules of the Central Earth World and Spirit Realm that Lin Yuan had traversed before, the time rules of the main universe were vastly more vast, by who knows how many times.</p><p></p><p>So the upper limit of the main universe was far beyond that of the Central Earth World and Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because the living beings in those latter worlds were innately unable to sense the more complex and profound essence of rules.</p><p></p><p>Now, to Lin Yuan, the Boundless Void was more or less the same reasoning.  </p><p></p><p>Continuing to cultivate in the Boundless Void, unless he completely gave up comprehending rules, was basically meaningless, just a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yuan could cross into the eleventh or twelfth stages, the profundities of rules he comprehended would probably surpass the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if Lin Yuan descended into the Boundless Void again, it would be the Boundless Void trying to leech off Lin Yuan's comprehension of rules.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the reason that the opener of this secret realm failed to reach the ultimate in the long years before was not just due to insufficient foundation or bad luck, but because of the inherent limitations of the Boundless Void itself?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated inwardly. At least from what he could see currently, there had never appeared a twelfth stage supreme being in the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>The only one who had tried to break through to the twelfth stage, the opener of this secret realm, had ultimately failed as well, with all traces of his existence wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't really affect me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was calm. If the Boundless Void could no longer allow him to comprehend rules, he would just return to the main universe to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>And if one day the main universe also could not provide him comprehension of rules, then he would use the Myriad Realms Gate to go to even higher dimensional spaces to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>For almost all living beings, their limits were predetermined by the world. But Lin Yuan was different - he had no such shackles of limits.</p><p></p><p>"A hundred years of bitter cultivation, although the speed has slowed down in the recent twenty years, the overall result is still not bad."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the entire resources of the Boundless Void, Lin Yuan had cultivated the 'Profound Yellow Body' of the Martial Ancestor's Body to the perfect tenth stage level.</p><p></p><p>The reason he invested such a huge cost into the Martial Ancestor's Body was because Lin Yuan had long treated the Martial Ancestor's Body as his permanent physical body when descending into this Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>Although the Boundless Void could not provide much help for Lin Yuan's comprehension of rules, cultivation was not just about comprehending rules.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan planned to rest and not comprehend any rules in the future, the Boundless Void was actually not a bad choice. With the Martial Ancestor's Body, once he descended he could directly take it over, saving a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivating the 'Profound Yellow Body' of the Martial Ancestor's Body to the perfect stage used the resources of the Boundless Void, without Lin Yuan having to spend any of his own.</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Bell." With a thought from Lin Yuan, a palm-sized golden bell hovered in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After taking over the Martial Ancestor's Body when descending into this Boundless Void, the first thing Lin Yuan did was summon this weapon that he had been nurturing along the way until now.</p><p></p><p>Six hundred years of uninterrupted nurturing, plus constantly providing abundant resources, the might of the Primal Bell was no weaker than any eleventh stage secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>If used by Lin Yuan, the power it could unleash was incalculable.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Primal Bell was nurtured from scratch by Lin Yuan himself, perfectly compatible with him. Lin Yuan could unleash its full might with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>For the same strike, other secret treasures would need full power to activate, but the Primal Bell only needed a fraction of Lin Yuan's power.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Lin Yuan planned to shatter all those miraculous objects he obtained from the two-dimensional world into primal forces to feed back into the Primal Bell.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Primal Bell could reach the twelfth stage, the help it provided Lin Yuan would be greater than ten twelfth stage weapons, or even dozens of twelfth stage weapons combined.</p><p></p><p>A weapon suited for oneself was already extremely rare, not to mention one as perfectly compatible as the Primal Bell.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad rules..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze deepened.</p><p></p><p>This journey's biggest gain for Lin Yuan was his spiritual will.  </p><p></p><p>Before descending, Lin Yuan's spiritual will index was only a few hundred million. But now, his spiritual will index had reached over three billion three hundred and thirty million.</p><p></p><p>The improvement of spiritual will was not as simple as multiplying by a number - the higher it went, the more difficult it became.  </p><p></p><p>The spiritual will index threshold for a Supreme Being was 1.8 billion. The spiritual will index of eleventh stage perfected legendary beings was generally over 1 billion.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to believe that a Supreme Being's spiritual will is only about 1.8 times stronger than those eleventh stage perfected legendary beings, right?</p><p></p><p>Besides spiritual will, Lin Yuan's biggest improvement was in his comprehension of rules.</p><p></p><p>Especially after comprehending the sixth level of the Space-Time Fusion Rules, in the past hundred years of contemplating other fusion rules, Lin Yuan had made meteoric progress.</p><p></p><p>"Namely the Reincarnation Rules, Great Destruction Rules, Causality Fluctuation Rules, Space-Time Dissolution Rules, Endless Celestial Rules, Space-Time River Rules, Void Tidal Rules, Cosmic Crevice Rules, Five Phases Cycle Rules, Spatial Annihilation Rules..."</p><p></p><p>The sixth level of the Space-Time Fusion Rules belonged to the Supreme Being realm.  </p><p></p><p>For the supporting pillar-level rules below this, one needed to reach the seventh level to be considered the ultimate stage.</p><p></p><p>Among the eighty-three pillar-level fusion rules, although none had reached the Supreme Being realm and were all at the peak of the sixth level, the sheer number was immense.</p><p></p><p>Even for a Supreme Being, it was probably very difficult to simultaneously comprehend so many pillar-level fusion rules and raise all of them to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>After all, Supreme Beings also had limited time, and needed to allocate more mental energy to comprehending their own paths.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's comprehension ability, if he focused on a single pillar-level fusion rule, he could likely raise one or two of them to the seventh level within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>But it wouldn't mean much. Without first comprehending the sixth level of Space-Time Rules, raising a pillar-level fusion rule to the seventh level, while giving Lin Yuan a significant power increase, would not be that remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, comprehending more sixth level peak pillar-level fusion rules would be more helpful for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>It would also prepare him for eventually comprehending the Chaos Rules.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the specifics of how to comprehend the Chaos Rules, based on the information Lin Yuan currently understood, the more rules he comprehended, the better.</p><p></p><p>Without a sufficient number of comprehended rules, he would be unable to ultimately integrate everything and return to the origin, becoming Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the pillar-level fusion rules, Lin Yuan had also comprehended a great number of ordinary fusion rules, numbering in the hundreds or even thousands.</p><p></p><p>These ordinary fusion rules were basically not ones Lin Yuan intentionally comprehended, but ones he touched upon as side paths while comprehending other pillar-level fusion rules, and comprehended them along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about it now, my tenth stage compared to the tenth stages of the myriad races of the cosmic universe..." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>For the tenth stage evolved beings of the human civilization in the main universe, as well as the tenth stage experts of other races, comprehending a single pillar-level fusion rule made them a top-grade tenth stage. Comprehending that pillar-level fusion rule to the second level allowed them to attempt the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>The second level? Not to mention the sixth level Space-Time Fusion Rules, just the pillar-level fusion rules, he had eighty-three at the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>In terms of pure comprehension of rules, even those eleventh stage perfected legendary beings couldn't catch up to Lin Yuan no matter how hard they tried.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength, compared to a hundred years ago when I had just comprehended the sixth level of Space-Time Rules, has improved greatly." Lin Yuan felt quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>Having reached the sixth level in so many rules...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The pinnacle fusion rules acting as pillars complemented each other, coupled with the mastery of the six-fold space-time realm, unleashing a might that surpassed the power of a single six-fold space-time realm.</p><p></p><p>After examining his own state, Lin Yuan gazed into the boundless void. </p><p></p><p>"For the past hundred years, the two great Primordial Souls have continuously transported numerous martial cultivators to other worlds. Now the number of martial cultivators in this boundless void has already exceeded that of the martial evolutionary beings in the main universe."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The main universe was vastly larger than the boundless void, even the domain of human civilization alone exceeded the boundless void by a great deal. </p><p></p><p>But now the entire boundless void was under Lin Yuan's dominion, and after six hundred years of propagation and development, the number of martial cultivators surpassed that of the martial evolutionary beings, which did not come as a surprise to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the domain of human civilization, countless citizens had many choices, such as the other nine supreme evolutionary paths, as well as evolutionary paths more suited to themselves, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, an evolutionary path suited to oneself was more important than a powerful evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>However, in the boundless void, martial arts was the only path, the supreme path. All beings would naturally cultivate martial arts if they could, and even attempt to cultivate martial arts if they could not.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are not many high-level martial cultivators," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was also an inevitable consequence of the rapid development of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>For any cultivation system to give birth to high-level experts, a long period of time was required. Lin Yuan could only allow martial arts to spread more widely.</p><p></p><p>But as for high-level martial cultivators? He could not intervene too much, unless Lin Yuan stopped cultivating himself and appeared in person to preach and expound the Dao to those martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>That would be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p></p><p>At any time, one's own cultivation was the foundation. As for propagating martial arts, its essence was also for the sake of one's own better future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"One more year remaining," Lin Yuan pondered, wondering if there were any loose ends he needed to tie up.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, at that moment, Lin Yuan seemed to sense something - a space-time ripple, vast and boundless, sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>A hint of astonishment appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>"Has an evil god advanced to the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>After a brief perception, Lin Yuan clearly sensed that the evil god who had crossed into the tenth stage was the Child of the Void.</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void had been trapped in the perfect ninth stage for hundreds of billions of years, unable to take that final step. Yet shortly after Lin Yuan's descent, he had broken through.</p><p></p><p>The vice-tower master Nalan of the human civilization in the main universe was able to break through to the eleventh stage because he lost to Lin Yuan, who was still at the ninth stage, in a contest of their most adept time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rose and took a step, vanishing from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Deep in the Void Secret Realm, the Child of the Void's aura was terrifying, space-time ripples sweeping in all directions. All evil god sovereigns in the boundless void who had reached the perfect ninth stage could sense it.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth stage!"</p><p></p><p>"I have finally entered the tenth stage!"</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in the Child of the Void's eyes. He had been trapped in the perfect ninth stage for so long that if not for the existence of the Void Secret Realm, he might have doubted whether the boundless void had ever produced a tenth stage evil god.</p><p></p><p>"Now I can be considered standing at the pinnacle height of the boundless void throughout ancient and modern times."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void wantonly emanated his space-time aura, a wild ambition surfacing in his eyes. "I no longer need to be too wary of that Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Having crossed into the tenth stage, the Child of the Void's confidence was fully boosted. In his view, even if the Martial Ancestor was also a tenth stage evil god, and stronger than the tenth stage evil gods he knew of, as long as he had reached the same level, he did not need to be overly deferential.</p><p></p><p>According to the message left by the founder of the secret realm, ordinary tenth stage evil gods could not treat the Void Secret Realm as nothing.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he was now on equal footing with the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void had no intention of fighting the Martial Ancestor. Even ninth stage evil gods rarely fought each other, let alone those at the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>Powerful beings were not fools - having painstakingly cultivated to such a realm, how could they recklessly fight those at the same level?</p><p></p><p>But in terms of status, the Child of the Void felt he should still strive for it.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he no longer needed to be as deferential as before.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the space-time ripples caused by the Child of the Void crossing into the tenth stage also alarmed many of the perfect evil god sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time ripples? Another powerful being has entered the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it the great Child of the Void?"</p><p></p><p>"The Child of the Void has broken through to the tenth stage?"</p><p></p><p>Initially astonished, one perfect evil god sovereign after another soon became exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, they, as perfect evil god sovereigns, had lived rather oppressed under the Martial Ancestor's dominance.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Child of the Void had also entered the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Martial Ancestor whose temperament was unknown, the Child of the Void was at least the leader of all evil god sovereigns. Before the Martial Ancestor crossed the tenth stage, many perfect evil god sovereigns followed the Child of the Void's commands.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the unpredictable Martial Ancestor, the many perfect evil god sovereigns naturally hoped more for the Child of the Void to reach the tenth stage.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"We should go and congratulate the Child of the Void now."</p><p></p><p>"The great Child of the Void is destined to remain great forever."</p><p></p><p>All the perfect evil god sovereigns immediately rushed towards the Child of the Void's location.</p><p></p><p>In a vast palace hall, the Child of the Void sat high on the throne, with ranks of perfect evil god sovereigns below.</p><p></p><p>"Great Child of the Void, your crossing into the tenth stage means your brilliance is destined to envelop the boundless void, and all life will submit under your radiance."</p><p></p><p>One perfect evil god sovereign after another offered extremely respectful congratulations to the Child of the Void.</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void sat silently on the throne, having heard such congratulatory flattery countless times before. But at this moment, having crossed into the tenth stage, hearing it again brought a different feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Great Child of the Void, from this day onward, we evil gods no longer need to watch the Martial Ancestor's expression when acting."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, these past few hundred years, I have lived in trepidation, fearing offending the Martial Ancestor one day."</p><p></p><p>"It's good now, with your great self here, the Martial Ancestor dare not go too far either."</p><p></p><p>The many perfect evil god sovereigns soon brought up the Martial Ancestor, which was inevitable. Before the Child of the Void broke through to the tenth stage, the Martial Ancestor was the ruler of the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Even the Child of the Void had to submit to his authority.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything was different.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the boundless void had gained two rulers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the many perfect evil god sovereigns present did not delude themselves into thinking the Child of the Void would truly jeopardize his relationship with the Martial Ancestor for their sake.</p><p></p><p>That was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>But at the very least, he could serve as their solid backing, instilling a sense of wariness in the Martial Ancestor's heart, elevating the status of the perfect evil god sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>Before the Child of the Void could finish speaking, the space-time in all directions fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>This silence was utterly, utterly silent. Even the Child of the Void, a tenth stage evil god, could not sense any space-time fluctuations, as if he had reverted to the weakest first stage, no, even weaker than that.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared noiselessly, his aura utterly ordinary, emanating no aura at all. But in this environment of complete space-time silence, he seemed out of place, as if all space-time was trampled underfoot.</p><p></p><p>This figure was none other than Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>His mere appearance caused space-time to fall silent. The Child of the Void, whose aura had previously been like a vast ocean, now seemed like a toothless old tiger, struggling just to remain seated, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Mar...Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void looked up at the towering Martial Ancestor high above, realizing at this moment that the changes around him originated from the Martial Ancestor. He had thought crossing into the tenth stage would give him the ability to stand alongside the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed like a joke. The Martial Ancestor did not even need to act, and he could barely hold on. How could this be considered standing alongside?</p><p></p><p>"I see you have crossed into the tenth stage," Lin Yuan looked down at the Child of the Void, his tone calm. "So I came to congratulate you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"For your kind attention."</p><p></p><p>The Child of the Void forced a smile and replied deferentially.</p><p></p><p>The many perfect evil god sovereigns below also felt the utterly silent space-time.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to the changes in space-time, it was the exchange and postures between the Child of the Void and the Martial Ancestor that made all the perfect evil god sovereigns' souls tremble.</p><p></p><p>As if plunged into icy waters.</p>

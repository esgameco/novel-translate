        <h1>Chapter 527</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the future, the chances of surviving the great destruction of the universe would drop significantly.</p><p></p><p>But if they didn't hand over their treasures, they wouldn't even have a chance to survive the universe's destruction.</p><p></p><p>The many ultimate twelfth-level beings naturally knew how to choose.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during the time they were suppressed in the palace, many twelfth-level ultimate beings were already very dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>If they had agreed to the Milky Way Star Lord's conditions earlier, handing over 90% of their twelfth-level weapons, treasures and rarities, and submitting to human civilization, nothing would have happened.</p><p></p><p>Some twelfth-level ultimate beings were unwilling and wanted to resist.</p><p></p><p>Resist? </p><p></p><p>What was the result? Therefore,</p><p></p><p>When faced with Lin Yuan's new conditions, not a single twelfth-level ultimate being dared to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Hand them over first," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings in the palace were like chicken ribs to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When the great destruction of the universe arrives, if Lin Yuan continues to carry the palace and the dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings inside with him, he would face the backlash and suppression of most of the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>It would be equivalent to Lin Yuan helping dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings resist the universe's destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Hand them over first?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace, dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings hesitated slightly.</p><p></p><p>If they handed over their treasures and weapons first, what if the Milky Way's supreme being went back on his word and didn't let them out?</p><p></p><p>"I trust the Milky Way's supreme being."</p><p></p><p>The twelfth-level ultimate being from the Starry Sky Alliance thought for a moment, then decisively took out all his treasures and weapons.</p><p></p><p>Now they had no leverage to negotiate with the Milky Way's supreme being. He even felt that the Milky Way's supreme being's willingness to give them a chance and let them out was a kind of grace.</p><p></p><p>"Go out," said Lin Yuan, putting away the treasures and weapons, and directly teleporting the ultimate being from the Starry Sky Alliance out.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Milky Way Supreme Being," the ultimate being from the Starry Sky Alliance said with wild joy in his voice. After repeatedly bowing in thanks, his form immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the twelfth-level ultimate beings in the palace immediately offered up all their treasures and rarities, and were successively teleported out.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, the current universe is the territory of human civilization," Lin Yuan rarely reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Milky Way Supreme Being, we will absolutely not violate the rules of human civilization," the many twelfth-level ultimate beings hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Violate the rules?</p><p></p><p>If the Milky Way Star Lord could suppress them once, he could suppress them twice or thrice.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the twelfth-level ultimate beings successively disappearing, Lin Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Having lost their weapons and treasures, these twelfth-level ultimate beings probably only had a 20-30% chance of surviving the universe's destruction.</p><p></p><p>And even if they could survive, if they dared to show any malice,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan still had dozens of avatars waiting outside the universe.</p><p></p><p>Compared to inside the universe, those twelfth-level ultimate beings would face a Lin Yuan whose various aspects were greatly suppressed by the universe's origin.</p><p></p><p>Outside the universe, even just one avatar could use methods far beyond those inside the universe. That would be true despair.</p><p></p><p>"These weapons, treasures and rarities..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the things offered by those dozens of twelfth-level ultimate beings and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The total value of all the weapons, treasures and rarities added up to nearly 100,000 chaos stones, equivalent to the wealth of a normal Sovereign realm powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>At the Thousand Treasures Convention on the Ancient Mingchaos Continent, Lin Yuan spent 30,000 chaos stones to buy that golden box. Now he had recouped some of that.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Void..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was deep.</p><p></p><p>After the universe's great destruction, what the human civilization needed to do was to quickly find a new home in the Chaos Void, then establish a foothold and develop.</p><p></p><p>As for continuing to live in the inner universe? The inner universe could not nurture truly powerful beings. In terms of origin, the inner universe was far inferior to the real universe and starry sky, let alone the Chaos Void. So far, any twelfth-level life in the universe, whether special life or racial life, was nurtured from within the universe. As for the inner universe? The upper limit was directly set.</p><p></p><p>"With human civilization's current foundation, it shouldn't be a problem to buy a continent fragment next to the Ancient Mingchaos Continent," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The new home of human civilization would naturally prioritize safety, and the safest large area nearby would naturally be the Ancient Mingchaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Mingchaos Continent was equivalent in size to dozens of universes, and naturally had some continent fragments revolving around it.</p><p></p><p>As part of the Ancient Mingchaos Continent, even if the Ancient Mingchaos Continent moved and set sail, it would carry the surrounding revolving fragments with it.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong, husband and wife, were full of worry. Lin Yi also stood obediently beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yuan, what's going on now? Why are many citizens of Canglan Star starting to migrate?" Lu Qiong asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, migrate? Migrate to where?" Lin Shoucheng couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan formulated by Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings, only about 1% of all citizens of human civilization could be migrated into the inner universe.</p><p></p><p>But because of Lin Yuan, all citizens of Canglan Star could obtain migration rights.</p><p></p><p>"Migrate to another universe," Lin Yuan said simply.</p><p></p><p>To prevent extreme reactions from citizens, Supreme Being Xuanyuan and the other eight supreme beings did not announce the reason for the migration.</p><p></p><p>After all, the universe's great destruction was really inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Why do we need to migrate to another universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qiong still didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell others about this," Lin Yuan looked at his parents. Under his protection, his parents would definitely survive safely.</p><p></p><p>Not just his parents...</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Family members, even the entire Canglan Star and Chikun Star Region, under Lin Yuan's influence, reduced or even avoided fierce competition.</p><p></p><p>"This universe is about to be destroyed," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"The universe is about to be destroyed?" Lin Shoucheng and Lu Qiong were a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the universe was vast and endless. Even if there was a day of destruction, it would be unimaginably far in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Due to influences from outside the universe, I will send you into my universe after some time. It won't be much different from life on Canglan Star," Lin Yuan said. The universe within his body was currently close to 8 million light-years in diameter. For the vast majority of human civilization citizens, 8 million light-years was no different from the complete universe of stars.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, even you can't prevent the destruction of the universe?" Lin Yi said softly beside him.</p><p></p><p>She had previously received some information about the universe's destruction from the Xia family. Hearing it directly from Lin Yuan, although shocked, she quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>"It can't be prevented," Lin Yuan said after a moment of silence, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>As he was now, he was too insignificant before the two Chaos Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, but the Shadow Demon Great Saint and Nine Phoenix Great Saint had been fighting all the way, causing countless universes to collapse and be destroyed prematurely.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jade Gourd.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn as he reached out to take a rune and placed it in front of him to observe carefully.</p><p></p><p>Originally, facing the great destruction of the universe, 99% of the human civilization group was destined to die. But these 3,333 runes in front of him gave Lin Yuan hope.</p><p></p><p>Integrating the advantages of all rune universe structures would not only allow more human citizens to survive, but also have an unimaginable effect on improving Lin Yuan's strength.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Path-breaking Realm, to have an internal universe approaching the Chaos Realm? What concept was this? If not comparable to a Chaos Venerable, it would at least be invincible in the Sovereign Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>"Universe structure..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immersed all his spirit into it. At this moment, he no longer comprehended rules, and even temporarily stopped perfecting the Martial Dao Sovereign Chapter. All his mental energy was focused on comprehending the complex runes before him.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension is extraordinary. Observing the mysterious runes, your understanding of universe structure has greatly improved]</p><p></p><p>New inspirations and insights constantly burst forth in Lin Yuan's mind, and a complete universe structure model appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was rapidly perfected and took shape.</p><p></p><p>Not far away.</p><p></p><p>The girl in red clothes was lying idly by a huge rock, legs crossed, glancing at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"It's so boring, I really want to find someone to talk to."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl was a bit distressed. Actually, she really wanted Lin Yuan to chat with her when he wasn't comprehending the runes.</p><p></p><p>But she also knew this would delay the progress of comprehension. To comprehend 3,333 runes in one universe era was an extremely arduous task.</p><p></p><p>"Just endure it for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Better not disturb him."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl struggled for a while but still gave up on finding Lin Yuan to chat.</p><p></p><p>What if she caused Lin Yuan to fail at the last moment? Wouldn't that mean being trapped in this place for endless ages?</p><p></p><p>"The first rune is the simplest of all the runes. Normally, to comprehend it thoroughly would take about ten million years," the red-clothed girl thought as she looked at Lin Yuan and the floating rune in front of him.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the red-clothed girl's gaze, the rune in front of Lin Yuan slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl was stunned. The rune dissipated?</p><p></p><p>The runes were left by her old master. Unless comprehended thoroughly, they couldn't possibly dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Comprehended thoroughly? Did Lin Yuan comprehend the first rune? The red-clothed girl suddenly realized, then showed an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>How long had it been? He had already comprehended the first rune?</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Coincidence, it must be a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the home universe he's from also has a similar universe structure."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl thought quickly. Although these 3,333 runes were all created by the Jade Gourd's master,</p><p></p><p>Among the countless universes nurtured by the Chaos Void, there were bound to be universes with similar structures.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan happened to be born in such a universe, comprehending the first rune so quickly could be barely explained.</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl continued to watch Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>The second rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Could Lin Yuan be so lucky to have encountered universes similar to two runes?</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>The third rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Five hours later.</p><p></p><p>The fourth rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>The fifty-eighth rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>One month later.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred and sixty-second rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Half a year later.</p><p></p><p>The two thousandth rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>One year later.</p><p></p><p>The three thousand three hundredth rune disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Yuan quickly comprehended the first rune, the red-clothed girl's posture changed from leaning against the boulder to sitting, then standing, and finally observing with extreme seriousness.</p><p></p><p>She watched with her own eyes as the runes quickly disappeared one by one.</p><p></p><p>The thousands of runes that originally floated around the world had now become empty.</p><p></p><p>Only a few dozen runes floated lonely.</p><p></p><p>"One year."</p><p></p><p>The red-clothed girl calculated the time.</p><p></p><p>At the rate and efficiency Lin Yuan was comprehending the runes, the remaining few dozen runes probably wouldn't take much time.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Gourd's master had originally set one universe era as the standard for testing those with affinity, but Lin Yuan had comprehended it in one year?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

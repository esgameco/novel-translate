        <h1>Chapter 553</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wings were filled with a strong sense of technology, yet they were also dazzling, multicolored, and stylishly cool.</p><p></p><p>With the opening and closing of the wings, Qi Yuan's figure soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan He's face revealed a shocked expression: "What kind of divine artifact is this?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen many divine artifacts before. </p><p></p><p>He was even an artifact forger, having crafted numerous divine artifacts himself.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in this Cloud Blood City, no one understood divine artifacts better than him.</p><p></p><p>But this strangely-shaped wing, it was truly too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>"Divine artifact? This is a flight wing, it's a mecha!" Qi Yuan directly denied.</p><p></p><p>He was in the process of becoming mortal, not slacking off.</p><p></p><p>To cope with this transformation into a mortal, he had specially prepared many technological creations along the way.</p><p></p><p>Things like drones, technological wings. </p><p></p><p>The technology provided by Zero One was truly too abundant.</p><p></p><p>Spatial compression technology, nano technology, anti-gravity technology, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in forging these technological creations, he had also utilized a tiny bit of his artifact forging abilities.</p><p></p><p>But it was truly just a tiny bit, and he had even painted them! When government officials buy imported cars, they just paint them and claim they are domestic. </p><p></p><p>Was it too much for him to paint them and pass them off as technological creations?</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his figure suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>"Watch my supersonic attack!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan let out a loud roar, his speed suddenly increasing to exceed the speed of sound.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, this speed would not be considered much, but this was the Divine Wood Universe. </p><p></p><p>This speed was enough to move even Heavenly Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"Ten times the speed of sound!"</p><p></p><p>Powerful fists, a robust physique, and lightning-fast speed.</p><p></p><p>With just this one punch, relying solely on the force of his body's impact, Qi Yuan could easily kill a Heavenly Realm Armored Soldier.</p><p></p><p>"The power of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qi Yuan charging in, the Thorn Blood Elder hastily unleashed the power of Heaven and Earth. </p><p></p><p>Instantly, the surrounding power of Heaven and Earth converged, coalescing into a barrier in front of him, giving him a slight sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The terrifying figure collided, and the Elder's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The power of Heaven and Earth... it couldn't stop him!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his mind was limited, and he could only think of this before his body shattered into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Elder is dead?"</p><p></p><p>"You claim you are not transcendent, yet the power of Heaven and Earth cannot stop you! " Jin Dan He roared.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors of Heavenly Realm Armored Soldiers who could control the power of Heaven and Earth to the extreme, using special techniques to make it yield.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the white-haired man before them was such a special existence.</p><p></p><p>Openly transcendent, yet claiming not to be, toying with them? "Damn it, how dare you falsely accuse me! I'm not transcendent at all!" Qi Yuan said as he fought, "I just... have a good relationship with the power of Heaven and Earth, so it doesn't obstruct me."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you lot are a bunch of twisted and deformed misfits, neither human nor beast, strange and bizarre. You don't have the troubles that us handsome fellows do.</p><p></p><p>When you all become as good-looking as me, you'll know... how enthusiastic this world is towards us!"</p><p></p><p>As Qi Yuan's words fell, his unparalleled speed unleashed another punch.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, another Thorn Blood Elder was slain.</p><p></p><p>"E-everyone... let's unite..." stammered a Thorn Blood Elder.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan was getting impatient.</p><p></p><p>"You're still stammering and living in this world, taking up memory space?</p><p>I'll help the Divine Wood Universe clear some memory!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan still had an aggressive attitude, instantly slaying that stammering Thorn Blood Elder.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three Thorn Blood Elders had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan He, seeing this, was livid: "Who are you? This is the domain of the Enigmatic Deity, offending the Deity will surely lead to your death!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Dan He could not understand how someone dared to act so recklessly and kill innocents in Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>This was the territory controlled by the Enigmatic Deity, belonging to the Black Heaven and Black Earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were from the Human Awakening Society, coming here, they could only tuck their tails and behave. But this bold and unrestrained display was unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although Qi Yuan had white hair, his spirit and vitality seemed excellent. The Human Awakening Society would not have placed such a talented genius in enemy territory. </p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just sending him to his death? In the Exquisite Gold Realm, there was no coming back once you entered!</p><p></p><p>Enemies who came in, had only one path - death!</p><p></p><p>"What Enigmatic Deity? If you don't let me become mortal, you all have to die?" Qi Yuan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>His current greatest goal was to become mortal.</p><p>Anything that obstructed his transformation, was a potential enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can run? Did you ask my wings?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's speed was extremely fast, killing gods and buddhas alike.</p><p>These lofty Heavenly Realm experts were no match for Qi Yuan at all.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill! </p><p>A completely one-sided battle, with no suspense whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>In just over a dozen breaths, all the Heavenly Realm experts had been slain.</p><p></p><p>As for Jin Dan He, although he fled quickly, without wings, he was no match for Qi Yuan's speed.</p><p></p><p>"They're all dead, but... the battle is not over yet."</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze turned to the Blood Tiger below, his expression grave.</p><p>That was the true great enemy, the others were just appetizers.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw that person, Qi Yuan's gaze suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>How could it be...?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Blood Tiger's appearance was utterly miserable, the backlash from the battle with a Heavenly Realm expert had shattered his body, his blood flowing, his life down to just a sliver.</p><p></p><p>That last sliver, he used it to send a message through a communication artifact, cursing the Blood Tiger Clan's boss.</p><p></p><p>After sending that message, the Blood Tiger's pupils had long since dispersed.</p><p></p><p>He was so angry! Utterly furious at that group of scum from the Blood Tiger Clan, actually sending him to deal with such a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he see how those Heavenly Realm Elders were slaughtered like vegetables in his hands? The Blood Tiger's neck twisted in a characteristic manner, his breath exhausted, dying without peace.</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's figure descended, his face filled with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he sighed, "Truly a gentleman, he should have seen me in action and realized he was no match, so he chose to end his own life!"</p><p></p><p>As for being hit by the backlash? That was definitely just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"The enigmatic spirits in this inner city... are quite numerous, it seems I need to help the Exquisite Gold Realm clear some memory!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Yuan's gaze turned fierce.</p><p>All these enigmatic spirits in the inner city were potential criminals obstructing his transformation, they all had to be killed.</p><p></p><p>And in slaying these enigmatic spirits, he could also gain a considerable amount of valuable experience points, a win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>If he could kill all the enigmatic spirits in this world, the amount of experience points he'd gain would likely be massive.</p><p>A few more such instances, and he might not even need to undergo the transformation, and could directly become an Ancestral God.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Qi Yuan's figure disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The slaughter... had only just begun!</p><p></p><p>In an unknown space, the Immortal Talent frowned, his expression complex. The elder smiled cheerfully, "What's wrong, did this mission's failure hit you hard?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Talent shook his head, his mind once again recalling Qi Yuan's words, as well as Qi Yuan's various extraordinary performances.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, could it be... that the Divine Wood Universe harbors... a Mortal Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The elder before him was the Grand Elder of the Immortal Talent Clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Elder, apart from the Ancestor Sun God of the clan, had the strongest power.</p><p></p><p>And his generation was actually older than that of the Ancestor Sun God.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "What nonsense are you talking about? How could the Divine Wood Universe possibly have a Realm Lord who has transcended the mortal realm?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Universe... the waters are deep, and there are even Ancestral Gods that can rival the Second Realm of the Sun God.</p><p></p><p>But the Third Realm of the Sun God, that is absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The Second Realm and Third Realm of the Sun God were a threshold.</p><p></p><p>To become a Third Realm Sun God, one needs to comprehend the Universal Laws and fuse with them.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Wood Universe is merely a nascent universe, and a special one at that.</p><p></p><p>The Universal Laws... are somewhat peculiar, seemingly scattered among the Mandate Bearers.</p><p></p><p>This also means that even if one reaches the Second Realm of the Sun God, they cannot step into the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unless... through special means, all the Mandate Bearers are sacrificed to the Universe.</p><p></p><p>And now, the strongest expert in the Divine Wood Universe is the Mandate Bearer, Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If not for his support, the Divine Wood Universe would have already fallen.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, if Yuan had not gone alone to confront the enemy that was dozens of times stronger than the Bright Divine Treasure, a half-finished product, in the Void Sea, the disaster would have been averted.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he made the enemy wary, preventing a calamity.</p><p></p><p>Such a pillar, how could the Elders cut him down?</p><p></p><p>And even if they did, can they guarantee someone else can reach the Realm Lord realm?</p><p></p><p>Even if there were a few more Realm Lord experts, could they withstand the Black Sky and Black Earth?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shared his thoughts with Xian Ling Ying Jiu.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jiu fell silent, then slowly said, "Is it possible that it's from another universe?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Divine Wood Universe lacks the conditions to produce a Realm Lord, but other universes might?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "Even less likely in other universes. While one can venture into other universes at the Second Realm of the Sun God, if they reach the Third Realm and fuse with the Universe, rashly going to other universes would be seen as hostile, a collision between universes, and would invite the annihilation of the Universe's will!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xian Ling Ying Jiu fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>It seems his speculation was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"I know you may have seen some astonishing geniuses and couldn't help but fantasize.</p><p></p><p>The universe is so vast, even I have not been able to traverse it all in my lifetime, and there are countless peerless talents like fleeting clouds. </p><p></p><p>Without becoming a Sun God or a Realm Lord, they are ultimately just passing guests, specks of dust in the universe."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder said.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jiu nodded: "Thank you, Grand Elder."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of something, he asked, "Does the Grand Elder know... the origin of the Black Sky?"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and terrifying Black Sky, Xian Ling Ying Jiu had long heard of its great name.</p><p></p><p>But he never knew the origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>In the Void Garden, there was also no information about the true origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "This old one is weak and of low status, how could I know such secrets?"</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jiu sighed: "It seems only the Void Realm Lords would know the origin of the Black Sky."</p><p></p><p>To become the top of the Void Garden's point ranking, one could ask a Void Realm Lord a question.</p><p></p><p>Xian Ling Ying Jiu knew that the Elders had once used the power of the entire universe to help a Void Cultivator complete a task and become the top of the point ranking.</p><p></p><p>That Void Cultivator asked the Void Realm Lord about information regarding the Black Sky on behalf of the Divine Wood Universe.</p><p></p><p>According to the rumors, the Void Realm Lord told that Void Cultivator the origin of the Black Sky.</p><p></p><p>However, in just a moment, that Void Cultivator forgot the information about the Black Sky's origin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Kui Jin Realm, Cloud Blood City.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan's leader's face was pale as he looked at the message in the transmission talisman, his heart pounding with fear.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"How could Blood Tiger Lord, who is usually so gentle, curse me like that?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan leader was terrified by that one sentence from Blood Tiger Lord: "I fuck your mother."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be..." </p><p></p><p>He suddenly had a terrifying thought.</p><p></p><p>"Minister, where is my mother's grave?" the Blood Tiger Clan leader asked.</p><p></p><p>The minister quickly replied: "In the Purple Dawn Forest!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go and dig up my mother's remains, and bring them to me. I will personally give them to Blood Tiger Lord!" the Blood Tiger Clan leader said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The gentle-tempered Blood Tiger Lord would definitely not curse someone like that.</p><p></p><p>So, he must really want to... (have sex with his mother)!</p><p></p><p>"Mother, your son did not let you enjoy life when you were alive, but in death... let you have your fun!" the Blood Tiger Clan leader thought, comforting himself.</p><p></p><p>This was not unfilial, but a filial act.</p><p></p><p>After all, his mother was also proud to serve the Thorn Blood, a half-human, half-demonic being.</p><p></p><p>Now that the old lady has died, let her have her moment of glory.</p><p></p><p>Just then, his expression changed slightly: "What deity dares to trespass on my Blood Tiger Clan!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a man shrouded in darkness appeared, emanating a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to take someone... Where is Qi Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>The white-haired cultivator, also known as Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving Wu Xiang's message, the dark-robed man immediately rushed to the Blood Tiger Clan, wanting to rescue Qi Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he thought there would be a great battle here.</p><p></p><p>He would wait for the right moment to strike and rescue Qi Yuan, then invite Qi Yuan to join the rebels.</p><p></p><p>But on the way, he suddenly heard a thunderous roar, like an earthquake.</p><p></p><p>The source of the sound was in the inner city, and he was afraid something had happened, so he did not dare to go to the inner city to investigate, hesitating for a long time before finally choosing to come here.</p><p></p><p>And so, the current scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Tiger Clan leader looked at the dark-robed man with a wary expression: "He's not here, he's now in the inner city, probably already captured by Blood Tiger Lord!"</p><p></p><p>He did not want to fight this mysterious man.</p><p></p><p>The dark-robed man narrowed his eyes, somewhat surprised, but more disappointed: "He went to the inner city?"</p><p></p><p>Since he went to the inner city, he would definitely be unable to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>"What happened in the inner city?" the dark-robed man tentatively asked the Blood Tiger Clan leader, not really expecting an answer.</p><p></p><p>"I..." the Blood Tiger Clan leader had not yet spoken.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his minister's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, master, a murderous demonic cultivator has appeared in the inner city!" the minister exclaimed frantically.</p><p></p><p>Just now, his transmission talisman had received the news that someone had barged into the inner city, causing a massacre.</p><p></p><p>"Causing a slaughter in the inner city, that's courting death!" the Blood Tiger Clan leader said loudly, not at all anxious.</p><p></p><p>Although the previous tremor was terrifying,</p><p></p><p>Cloud Blood City had the Thorn Blood guarding it, and the Demonic God Darkened Eyes could descend at any time.</p><p></p><p>There was no way a major disaster could occur.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I panicked for no reason, the inner city is as secure as a fortress, how could anything major happen!" the minister said.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still curious why that person had not responded to his message. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was taking a bath?</p><p></p><p>The dark-robed man's eyes flashed with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Someone is unleashing a massacre in the inner city? What kind of expert is this? He hesitated for a moment, looking towards the direction of the inner city, and finally decided to sneak over and take a look.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if the human hero dies, there should be an audience to witness it and record this scene, so that he does not die in silence!

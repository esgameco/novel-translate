        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a path of martial arts evolution," said the powerful Xuanyuan cultivator next to him, after reading it over a few times.</p><p></p><p>He then said solemnly, "However, it is based on thunder and lightning. I can feel that this thunder and lightning martial arts path does not yet have the ultimate 12th stage cultivation."</p><p></p><p>An evolutionary path means a cultivation path, and the existence of the 12th stage can be sensed with careful perception.</p><p></p><p>This allows one to judge whether this evolutionary path has the potential to produce 12th stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, this thunder and lightning martial arts evolutionary path is extremely similar to the martial arts evolutionary path that Lin Yuan walked, yet it does not seem to have any 12th stage cultivators?</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"This evolutionary path is a branch of the martial arts that I have opened up and perfected. It can definitely give rise to new 12th stage cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable," the ancient powerful cultivator exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>They had heard that some extremely broad evolutionary paths could accommodate multiple parallel branches, all of which could give rise to new 12th stage cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But such evolutionary paths were extremely rare, requiring perfection in all aspects, with the foundation and profundity reaching the limit. Otherwise, if the path itself was not broad enough, how could it accommodate other evolutionary branches? Furthermore, it needed to be in perfect harmony with the Chaotic Void and its Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, even if everything was perfect, if it did not align with the Dao of the Chaotic Void, it could not extend into branches.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we have underestimated the martial arts before," the Xia Qin powerful cultivator said, equally shocked after reading it.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that this thunder and lightning martial arts, even if just a branch of the true martial arts, had greater potential than the 12th stage evolutionary path he cultivated.</p><p></p><p>If the branch was like this, how about the main path?</p><p></p><p>"Yes," the Xuanyuan powerful cultivator nodded.</p><p></p><p>Evolutionary paths that could extend branches were all those with the potential to become 13th stage Dao paths.</p><p></p><p>"The ability to open up branches is not apparent below the 12th stage," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was not the fault of the nine human powerful cultivators. Even for Chaotic Sovereign cultivators, merely observing the martial arts evolutionary path from the 1st to the 11th stage would make it difficult to judge whether the martial arts could extend branches.</p><p></p><p>"Silver, are you planning to publicly reveal this thunder and lightning martial arts in the clan?" the Feather Butterfly powerful cultivator asked tentatively.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lin Yuan nodded, as he also longed for the thunder and lightning martial arts to produce a 12th stage cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of a great tree does not lie in its thick and tall trunk, but in the countless roots that spread underground. The more powerful cultivators of the martial arts branches, the more they will nourish the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, our human civilization will be equivalent to having an additional 12th stage evolutionary path."</p><p></p><p>The Feather Butterfly powerful cultivator nodded slightly. Even if the Chaotic Void could obtain 12th stage evolutionary paths, where would they have one as reliable as this thunder and lightning martial arts?</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I did not walk the path of thunder and lightning, otherwise I might have directly transitioned to this evolutionary path," the ancient powerful cultivator sighed.</p><p></p><p>Within the universe, any evolving cultivator who has chosen an evolutionary path would find it very difficult to switch to another path after reaching the 6th stage.</p><p></p><p>But that was for cultivators below the 12th stage. For a 12th stage cultivator, to switch to another evolutionary path, they only needed to "scatter the Dao."</p><p></p><p>To disperse their cultivated Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no 12th stage cultivator would casually "scatter the Dao," as the risk was too great.</p><p></p><p>A 12th stage life whose "Dao" has been scattered would have their qi, blood, and soul at the 12th stage level, but without a path to stand on, their combat power would not be even one-tenth or one-thousandth of their full potential.</p><p></p><p>And to cultivate another evolutionary path to the 12th stage? That would also require a tremendous amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, unless they encountered an evolutionary path that was extremely suitable for them, no 12th stage life would be willing to "scatter the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Even if they encountered a highly suitable evolutionary path, the matter of "scattering the Dao" would be approached with utmost caution. If they were attacked by enemies during the "scattering" process, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this branch is more suitable for you, Ancient," Lin Yuan smiled slightly, and transmitted the "Strength Martial Arts" he had opened up and perfected.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had awakened the physical divine ability "Moving Mountains" long ago, and had a deep understanding of the Dao of Strength. Naturally, the martial arts had also extended a Strength Martial Arts branch related to the Dao of Strength.</p><p></p><p>"This branch?" </p><p></p><p>The Ancient cultivator was momentarily confused. In addition to the thunder and lightning martial arts, there was another branch? But the next moment, the Ancient cultivator was stunned, as all the details about the Strength Martial Arts flooded into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This, this, this..." the Ancient cultivator was dumbfounded, muttering, "I never imagined the path of Strength could be cultivated in this way, in this manner."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient cultivator's eyes shone brightly, "The Dao of Strength is not just about power, but also involves space-time. If I had taken this cultivation path earlier, I might have already approached the peak of the Dao-Severing Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient cultivator was the second powerful cultivator to emerge in human civilization, on par with the Xuanyuan powerful cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Different paths lead to the same Dao. To cross into the Chaotic Realm, one must encompass myriad rules and give birth to Chaotic rules," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Yuan was in seclusion, extending and perfecting the various martial arts branches, he naturally prioritized the paths walked by the nine powerful cultivators of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Strength Dao of the Ancient cultivator, the Dream Dao of the Feather Butterfly cultivator, the Profound Dao of the Xia Qin cultivator - the paths of the nine powerful cultivators were all included in the martial arts branches.</p><p></p><p>"This Strength Martial Arts is indeed more promising than the evolutionary path the Ancient cultivated, and more suitable for him," the Xuanyuan powerful cultivator said after reviewing it.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>How could it not be suitable?</p><p></p><p>This Strength Martial Arts was specifically perfected by Lin Yuan for the Ancient cultivator.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's realm, he had long since seen the strengths and weaknesses of the Ancient cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Based on the martial arts as the foundation, perfecting a Strength Martial Arts suitable for the Ancient cultivator's cultivation was as simple as could be.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not created out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient, I suggest you transition to this Strength Martial Arts," the Xia Qin powerful cultivator said beside him.</p><p></p><p>"I think so too," the Ancient cultivator said excitedly, then tentatively asked Lin Yuan, "Silver, can I transition to this Strength Martial Arts?"</p><p></p><p>Since this Strength Martial Arts was brought out by Lin Yuan, and was a branch of the path Lin Yuan walked, he naturally needed to ask Lin Yuan's opinion before transitioning to it.</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lin Yuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient cultivator transitioning to the Strength Martial Arts would also greatly benefit Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Normally, even if the Strength Martial Arts was opened up to all the citizens of human civilization, it was unknown how long it would take to produce a 12th stage cultivator in this path.</p><p></p><p>Just having an evolutionary path does not mean it will definitely produce a 12th stage cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But the Ancient cultivator? He was already at the 12th stage realm. If he chose to "scatter the Dao" and cultivate the Strength Martial Arts, he would likely have no bottleneck in re-entering the 12th stage realm.</p><p></p><p>"If the Ancient transitions to the Strength Martial Arts, he might become the second Dao-Severing Realm peak expert in our human civilization," the Virtual God powerful cultivator sighed, "The future of our human civilization will become even more prosperous."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be hasty," Lin Yuan said beside them, "I've also prepared some branches for you all."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan, Xia Qin, Feather Butterfly and the other six powerful cultivators were slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then transmitted the "Profound Martial Arts," "Dream Martial Arts" and other eight martial arts branches to them.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>The eight powerful cultivators took a deep breath, and then quickly began to read and review them.</p><p></p><p>After a long while,</p><p></p><p>The Xia Qin powerful cultivator suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze deep and dark, but then quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>"Silver, this evolutionary path..." Xia Qin's voice trembled slightly as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Dream Martial Arts, blurring the line between illusion and reality. This evolutionary path should have no problem reaching the Mastery Realm," the Feather Butterfly powerful cultivator's eyes shone with unprecedented brilliance, "Cultivated to the extreme, I will become an illusory life form. Even Chaotic Sovereigns would have to put in considerable effort to deal with me."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed," the other powerful cultivators also nodded in agreement, equally shocked by the martial arts branches Lin Yuan had transmitted.</p><p></p><p>"Silver, these..." the Xuanyuan powerful cultivator looked at Lin Yuan, his gaze filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"You can all cultivate them," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Extending and perfecting specialized martial arts branches for the nine powerful cultivators of human civilization was mutually beneficial.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's martial arts foundation was deeper, and the nine powerful cultivators of human civilization also had a higher and more distant future.</p><p></p><p>"There are dozens more martial arts branches that can serve as entirely new 12th stage evolutionary paths," Lin Yuan brought out all the martial arts branches he had opened up and perfected - a total of seventy-three.</p><p></p><p>The nine powerful cultivators looked at each other, and their shock was slightly diminished.</p><p></p><p>At least they had the previous thunder and lightning martial arts, as well as the martial arts branches perfectly suited for the nine of them, as a foundation. With dozens more 12th stage martial arts branches added, it was not an overwhelming amount.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What is the matter that puzzles you? Let's move on.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan chatted with the nine supreme experts for a while, and the supreme experts of Xia Qin and Xuanyuan began to discuss who would be the first to 'scatter the Dao' and turn to cultivate the martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Twelfth-Tier Life is, whether it's the Parting the Dao Realm, the Sovereign Realm, or the Chaotic Realm, once they scatter the Dao, their strength will plummet. Therefore, the nine supreme experts of human civilization will definitely not 'scatter the Dao' at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Although human civilization has Lin Yuan as the 'Stabilizing Pillar of the Sea', it can't be that Lin Yuan has to take care of everything. The result of the discussion is that at most, only two supreme experts can be allowed to 'scatter the Dao' at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Before these two supreme experts re-enter the Twelfth-Tier, the other seven supreme experts still need to undertake the task of maintaining the order of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Unlike other Twelfth-Tier Lives, the nine supreme experts of human civilization have grown up together from a weak period, and they trust each other extremely, so they dare to be the first to 'scatter the Dao'.</p><p></p><p>After all, after 'scattering the Dao', the Twelfth-Tier Lives will lose their foundation and be powerless, which is a unique 'great tonic' for any expert at the same level.</p><p></p><p>No matter how they are swallowed or smelted, they can greatly benefit themselves.</p><p></p><p>After making the martial arts paths public in human civilization, Lin Yuan continued to enter seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"After refining these resources, my 'Mysterious Yellow Body' should be able to reach the peak of the Sovereign Realm." Lin Yuan took out the purple cloth bag.</p><p></p><p>Inside were the resources obtained by selling eighteen Sovereign Realm rare trees.</p><p></p><p>These resource materials, combined with what Lin Yuan had accumulated at other times, as well as the gains from killing the Sovereign Realm experts Snake Demon Sovereign and Blood Blessing Sovereign, can be considered Lin Yuan's entire wealth.</p><p></p><p>Snake Demon Sovereign and Blood Blessing Sovereign were notorious plunderers, and their wealth far exceeded that of ordinary peak Sovereign Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Source World.</p><p>Qingfan Domain, Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged on the thirteenth floor, cultivating in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a disciple of the Qingfan Marquis, the treatment will be much better than continuing to stay in the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, not that the Yu family was bad, but by joining the Qingfan Marquis, he could greatly save the time Lin Yuan spent dealing with trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>All his mental energy and focus could be devoted to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan was very satisfied with his current situation.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, Lin Yuan in the Source World was more privileged than in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan had no backing, but in the Source World, as a peak Sovereign Realm expert under the Qingfan Marquis, he could be fully protected.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Qingfan Marquis, Lin Yuan should belong to the camp of the Liye Ancient Country, and his background needs no further explanation.</p><p></p><p>"I have now recovered my Twelfth-Tier Parting the Dao Realm strength."</p><p></p><p>Since the last time he saw the Qingfan Marquis, Lin Yuan's cultivation resources have been uninterrupted, so the recovery of his strength has been smooth without any bottlenecks or twists.</p><p></p><p>"The Liye Sparks are also about to condense three ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan has never given up on the condensation of the Liye Sparks. This matter does not pose any difficulty for him and does not require much mental energy. In his spare time, he just does it casually.</p><p></p><p>"The depth of my understanding of the rules has also increased a bit, but not much." Lin Yuan thought to himself, which was not unexpected.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Qingfan Marquis' suggestion was not wrong. After condensing tens of thousands of Liye Sparks, the physical body will undergo a transformation, and there is no need to spend mental energy on continuing to condense the Liye Sparks, as the input and output are not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Other people are not like Lin Yuan. After condensing tens of thousands of Liye Sparks, to condense one more, the mental energy and effort required are beyond imagination, just to improve the depth of understanding of the rules by a tiny fraction?</p><p></p><p>"I want to see what will happen after I condense thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Liye Sparks."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was quite looking forward to it. Thirty-three hundred and thirty-three Liye Sparks can transform the physical body into a Liye Divine Body. Thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three Sparks? In terms of condensation difficulty, the latter must be far beyond the former. Perhaps only those ancient country royal families who can condense Liye Sparks in their sleep would dare to try such a quantity.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"The master has sent me a message?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred, and he took out a red jade slip on which a message had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Don't leave the Fengtianyuan for the time being."</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis' message was very brief, but for a peak Sovereign Realm existence to personally remind him, it must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>The Qingfan Marquis is stationed in Qingfan City, and every detail of the entire city is under the observation of this peak Sovereign Realm expert. Normally, even if Lin Yuan leaves the Fengtianyuan, as long as he doesn't leave Qingfan City, he doesn't need to worry about anything, as the Qingfan Marquis can instantly descend.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the threat from the Zimenghuan Domain?" Lin Yuan guessed.</p><p></p><p>Recently, even though Lin Yuan was immersed in closed-door cultivation, he occasionally heard about some events. The experts from the Zimenghuan Domain often appeared near Qingfan City, vaguely observing something.</p><p></p><p>The Zimenghuan Domain is a large domain neighboring the Qingfan Domain, originating from an opposing ancient country.</p><p></p><p>The vast continent of the Source World is like a huge ancient country, with the Liye Ancient Country being supreme, but it is not the only one, and there are still opposing ancient countries.</p><p></p><p>There are often collisions and frictions between ancient countries, especially in the border domains.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Zimenghuan Sovereign is not much weaker than the Qingfan Marquis. The Qingfan Marquis asked Lin Yuan not to leave the Fengtianyuan, considering the most extreme situation.</p><p></p><p>If the Zimenghuan Sovereign were to make a move, and the Qingfan Marquis was preoccupied, he would not be able to guarantee Lin Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>Asking Lin Yuan to stay in the Fengtianyuan is because the Fengtianyuan is the core of the Qingfan City formation. Even for a peak Sovereign Realm expert like the Zimenghuan Sovereign, it would take a considerable amount of time to invade the Fengtianyuan.</p><p></p><p>If such an event were to occur, the Fengtianyuan's teleportation restriction would instantly teleport Lin Yuan to another location, which is the secret lair personally prepared by the Qingfan Marquis, extremely safe.</p><p></p><p>So, as long as Lin Yuan obediently stays in the Fengtianyuan, even Sovereign Realm experts would not be able to harm him.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just stay here for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan is quite obedient. Since the Qingfan Marquis told him not to go out, he definitely won't go out.</p><p></p><p>Although this physical body, even if it perishes, does not truly mean Lin Yuan's death, as he can start over, but it would still be a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>And it's not certain that the next time his consciousness transmigrates, he can have such a good starting condition.</p><p></p><p>Not every peak Sovereign Realm expert is as caring about their disciples as the Qingfan Marquis. Many Sovereigns are selfish and even specifically cultivate disciples as 'resources' for their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The Cosmic Universe."</p><p></p><p>After re-entering the Twelfth-Tier, Lin Yuan's Cosmic Universe has been evolving on its own, beginning to reconstruct the 'Infinite Void' according to the Thirteenth-Tier inheritance.</p><p></p><p>"This Source World has a weak foundation and does not have the concept of a Cosmic Universe." Lin Yuan thought while re-cultivating the 'Infinite Void'.</p><p></p><p>The 'Infinite Void' is not a path of martial arts evolution, but more like a secret technique, a method of transforming the Cosmic Universe. So even in this Source World dimension outside the Chaotic Void, it can still be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Or rather, it's not that the experts in this Source World have a weak foundation, but that the experts in the Chaotic Void have too strong a foundation?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, when one enters the Twelfth-Tier, they will receive the infusion of the Chaotic Void's origin, which can accelerate the transformation of the Cosmic Universe.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World, there is no such 'benefit'. If Lin Yuan did not rely on the abundant resources provided by the Qingfan Marquis, for his Cosmic World to transform into a Cosmic Universe, it would probably require a huge amount of time and mental effort.</p><p></p><p>If it's like this for Lin Yuan, not to mention other experts.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>One day, Lin Yuan's Cosmic Universe was vast and grand, having completely cultivated the first layer of the 'Infinite Void', on par with Chaotic Sovereign-level Cosmic Universes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yuan's foundation is so strong that it absolutely surpasses the peak Sovereign Realm expert Qingfan Marquis.</p><p></p><p>"The Liye Sparks."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed, and he looked inward.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his physical body, from limbs to every pore, was filled with countless Liye Sparks, like an endless Liye Spark sea. And with the passage of time, new Liye Sparks were still condensing.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan condensed another Liye Spark.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the countless Liye Sparks formed a vague grand cycle, suddenly bursting forth with dazzling brilliance.</p>

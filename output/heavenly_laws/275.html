            <p>Chapter 275: Breaking the Myth (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>The moment the five invincible eighth-level alien races emerged from the depths of the spatial layers, the space around them began to solidify, as if a flowing river had suddenly frozen. The creatures in the river seemed to be deeply trapped in amber.</p><p></p><p>To capture Lin Yuan alive, the first thing to do was to prevent him from escaping. In this regard, sealing the space was the most suitable method. Once the surrounding void was sealed, all means of movement would be rendered useless.</p><p></p><p>With the capabilities of the five invincible eighth-level beings and their comprehension of spatial laws, there were only two possibilities for Lin Yuan to break through their spatial seal. One was to fully comprehend the complete spatial laws and leave with absolute control over them. The other was to possess power far surpassing the combined strength of the five, proving that breaking through with force was not just empty talk. Even space could be shattered by absolute power.</p><p></p><p>"It's done," Sala of the Dark Rhino Clan felt relieved. Before they made their move, Lin Yuan's only chance of survival was to escape before the space was sealed. As a disciple of the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, who had a profound understanding of spatial laws, it was possible that Lin Yuan had been granted some means of instant teleportation and sent away in advance.</p><p></p><p>But now? The spatial seal had been formed, and Lin Yuan had not left. Sala of the Dark Rhino Clan immediately felt that everything was under control. Under the joint sealing of the five invincible eighth-level beings, even the Scarlet Roc Star Lord would be suppressed if he didn't leave beforehand.</p><p></p><p>"Quicksand," Sala's eyes turned cold. Misty yellow sand particles gathered and swept in from all directions, rapidly accumulating and increasing in power.</p><p></p><p>The power of quicksand was a cosmic force mastered by Sala of the Dark Rhino Clan. This kind of cosmic force was neither offensive nor defensive, but rather a domain-like cosmic force with endless suppressive and controlling abilities. This time, with him leading the five invincible eighth-level beings, it was precisely because of this cosmic force.</p><p></p><p>The Insectoid Clan wanted to use the poison of memories to thoroughly kill the Galaxy Star Lord, and the prerequisite was to suppress and control the opponent. The cosmic force mastered by Sala of the Dark Rhino Clan was very suitable. With the power of quicksand dominating the battlefield, the other four invincible eighth-level beings could basically lock down any resistance from the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the resistance mentioned here referred to the combat power previously displayed by the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>The moment the quicksand power swept across, the other four invincible eighth-level beings also made their move. The cosmic forces wielded by the invincible eighth-level beings shook while reserving strength. Their goal was to control the Galaxy Star Lord, not to directly kill him.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galaxy Star...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, space solidified. Before Captain Nolan could react, a thick layer of quicksand power enveloped him. Captain Nolan was also an eighth-level evolved being, close to the peak of the eighth level, but at this moment, he couldn't even move. He could only sense that four unmatched auras had descended.</p><p></p><p>"It's four invincible eighth-level beings. No, it's five invincible eighth-level beings." Captain Nolan's scalp tingled. Usually, it was rare to see even one invincible eighth-level being. Now there were five directly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the killing intent emanating from these five invincible eighth-level beings was undisguised. Even though it wasn't directed at him, Captain Nolan felt his soul trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord!" Captain Nolan looked at Lin Yuan, realizing that the target of these five invincible eighth-level beings was the Galaxy Star Lord. Apart from the Galaxy Star Lord, who else could be worthy of the joint efforts of five invincible eighth-level beings?</p><p></p><p>"So there were five more bugs hiding outside?" Lin Yuan glanced at Sala and the other invincible eighth-level beings. Before Lin Yuan stepped out of the Galaxy Star, these five invincible eighth-level beings were hidden in layers of deep spatial layers, extremely secretive. Unless deliberately checked, they were difficult to discover.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan was now at the eighth level, considered to be at the same realm as the invincible eighth-level beings.</p><p></p><p>Buzz!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, with Lin Yuan at the center, a black and white yin-yang force expanded in all directions. Wherever the black and white yin-yang force expanded, the solidified space returned to normal. The five cosmic forces, including the quicksand power, were all shattered. Even the four invincible eighth-level beings who charged forward began to retreat, their eyes revealing a hint of fear as they looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"This power..." Sala's expression turned solemn. "Cosmic force, it's definitely a cosmic force. Galaxy Star Lord, you have comprehended a cosmic force?"</p><p></p><p>Sala found it hard to believe. Just over twenty years ago, Lin Yuan had just entered the eighth level, and now he had comprehended a certain cosmic force and become an invincible eighth-level being?</p><p></p><p>What... what kind of monster was he?</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had just entered the eighth level not long ago, he had cleansed the Galaxy Star Domain and displayed the combat power of the peak eighth level. However, the peak eighth level and the invincible eighth level were completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Sala could sense that the cosmic force comprehended by the Galaxy Star Lord was definitely not simple. It belonged to the level of high-grade cosmic forces and was even much stronger than normal high-grade cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>Just as the five invincible eighth-level alien races appeared, billions of miles away from the Galaxy Star, a bald man in white robes appeared, looking in the direction of the Galaxy Star. "Those alien races have indeed made their move."</p><p></p><p>This bald man in white robes was none other than the White Light Star Lord, a good friend of the Scarlet Roc Star Lord. Not long ago, he had even traded the cosmic treasure "Heart of Thunder" with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The White Light Star Lord was a senior at the peak of the eighth level, and his comprehension of spatial laws was not inferior to the Scarlet Roc Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the White Light Star Lord had a strong ability to save his life. The deeper the comprehension of space, the farther one could cross billions of miles in a single step and hide in layers of space, equivalent to being invincible from the start.</p><p></p><p>As a result, although the White Light Star Lord's combat power was not as strong as the invincible eighth-level beings, his means of escape were superior to them.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful aspect of the invincible eighth-level beings lay in their cosmic forces, but cosmic forces were just a kind of power. Unless they were cosmic forces specialized in escaping, they were indeed not as good as the White Light Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>After trading the Heart of Thunder with Lin Yuan, the White Light Star Lord mentioned it to the Scarlet Roc Star Lord, who then requested the White Light Star Lord to stay outside the Galaxy Star for a while to protect Lin Yuan's safety.</p><p></p><p>"Five invincible eighth-level beings?" The White Light Star Lord's expression changed slightly. If it were only one or two invincible eighth-level beings assassinating Lin Yuan, he could intervene and save him as long as Lin Yuan held on for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But five invincible eighth-level beings...</p><p></p><p>Even if these five invincible eighth-level beings' comprehension of spatial laws was not as good as his, quantitative changes led to qualitative changes. What he needed to do was not just escape but rescue Lin Yuan and then escape.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only use that treasure." The White Light Star Lord raised his right hand, and a cluster of white flames began to burn.</p><p></p><p>As the pinnacle race, human civilization had countless treasures. The White Light Star Lord, as a senior at the peak of the eighth level, naturally possessed many hidden techniques.</p><p></p><p>The white flames burning on his hand were a one-time treasure. Once activated, it would unleash a basic power close to the ninth level...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Enough.</p><p></p><p>Enough to temporarily retreat from those five invincible Eighth Stage experts.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan shattered the killing formation jointly formed by the five invincible Eighth Stage experts, easily repelling four of them, leaving the Star Lord of Baiguang somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Star Lord of the Galaxy in a desperate situation?</p><p></p><p>Before he could even lend a helping hand, how did the situation change?</p><p></p><p>"Eighth Stage invincibles, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galaxy's main star, after confirming that Lin Yuan had already comprehended a kind of cosmic power, Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan decisively planned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the cosmic power Lin Yuan comprehended surpassed normal advanced cosmic powers, even if it was just ordinary cosmic power, their plan could be considered a failure.</p><p></p><p>With the five of them, Eighth Stage invincibles, joining forces, they could naturally suppress one Eighth Stage invincible, but it was only suppression. To thoroughly render an Eighth Stage invincible completely defenseless and infuse them with the 'Memory Poison' was undoubtedly a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, dragging it out further would just be a waste of time. If other powerful experts from human civilization rushed over, leaving would come at a price.</p><p></p><p>"Did I let you leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood under the starry sky, looking towards the five retreating Eighth Stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The hazy black and white Yin-Yang Taiji power silently spread and extended.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord of the Galaxy, don't tell me you want us to stay?" Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan was slightly stunned, feeling it was a bit absurd.</p><p></p><p>The Star Lord of the Galaxy comprehending cosmic power indeed exceeded his expectations, but at most, it meant the mission failed. He and the other four Eighth Stage invincible aliens could retreat unscathed.</p><p></p><p>They were all Eighth Stage invincibles. Even if the cosmic power the Star Lord of the Galaxy comprehended was stronger than theirs, it was nearly impossible for him to make them stay.</p><p></p><p>Among Eighth Stage invincibles, there were indeed differences in strength, but the gap wouldn't be too big. One side couldn't even thoroughly defeat the other, let alone kill and capture them.</p><p></p><p>If Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan wasn't wary of the powerful experts from human civilization rushing over, he would definitely continue probing the Star Lord of the Galaxy with the other four Eighth Stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>"He's probably just saying it."</p><p></p><p>"No need to haggle with the Star Lord of the Galaxy."</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan retracted his thoughts and began to accelerate his departure from the Galaxy's star domain.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Before escaping too far, Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan sensed the black and white Yin-Yang Taiji power permeating all directions.</p><p></p><p>"The cosmic power mastered by the Star Lord of the Galaxy?"</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan immediately activated his Flowing Sand Power, wanting to resist.</p><p></p><p>It was very obvious.</p><p></p><p>The Star Lord of the Galaxy had caught up.</p><p></p><p>But Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan wasn't very afraid. Even if he wasn't as good as the Star Lord of the Galaxy, at most he would be suppressed. He couldn't even be restricted from escaping.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before long.</p><p></p><p>This power was immeasurable, boundless, endless.</p><p></p><p>"Another kind of cosmic power? An advanced cosmic power at that?"</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan was shocked and horrified, and a sense of crisis arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This Star Lord of the Galaxy has mastered two kinds of cosmic powers, and they're both advanced cosmic powers?" Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan vaguely felt a great terror.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>An aura that could destroy all things swept over. Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan was shocked and his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"A third advanced cosmic power?"</p><p></p><p>"This Star Lord of the Galaxy..."</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan's eyes revealed horror. His figure began to dissolve and his consciousness fell into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood where Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan's figure dissolved, catching his spatial bracelet and storing it in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>With the Taiji Power, the Immeasurable Power, and the Destruction Power, three kinds of advanced cosmic powers that could complement each other, and enhanced by the world power extended from the inner world spanning millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's combat power had already pulled far ahead from that of a normal Eighth Stage invincible. Killing Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan was not a difficult matter.</p><p></p><p>This was still with Lin Yuan holding back with all his might, only revealing three kinds of cosmic powers. The remaining dozens of cosmic powers had not been used, and that wisp of Primordial Power surpassing advanced cosmic powers was not revealed either.</p><p></p><p>In a certain star domain deep in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan's true body suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"That Star Lord of the Galaxy?!"</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan's expression was full of horror. As an Eighth Stage invincible, he naturally also had avatars. The one usually venturing outside was an avatar.</p><p></p><p>After all, even Eighth Stage invincibles were not absolutely safe. Encountering certain powerful Ninth Stage experts, even Eighth Stage invincibles had to die.</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan had thought about his avatar perishing, but he didn't expect to die at the hands of a human evolver who was also at the Eighth Stage.</p><p></p><p>"That Star Lord of the Galaxy, how is he so strong? He actually comprehended three kinds of advanced cosmic powers?"</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan's heart trembled. He vaguely felt that something was amiss. If it was only three kinds of advanced cosmic powers, even if they could kill him, it shouldn't have been an "instant kill" like just now. Very clearly, besides those three cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>The Star Lord of the Galaxy must have mastered another powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"Star Lord of the Galaxy... The Insect Race is going to have a headache," Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan silently thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he lost an avatar, which could be considered a heavy loss, based on the Star Lord of the Galaxy's performance just now, he would likely become a thorn in the side of the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>Sala of the Dark Unicorn Clan had a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Galaxy's Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan enveloped all directions with the Taiji Power, assisted by the Immeasurable Power and Destruction Power. He quickly killed another Eighth Stage invincible alien.</p><p></p><p>"Three escaped."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at three completely different directions.</p><p></p><p>The escape directions of the five Eighth Stage invincibles were naturally not consistent, but scattered.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan killed two of them, the other three had already run far away.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing Lin Yuan killing Eighth Stage invincibles like slaughtering chickens with their own eyes, these three Eighth Stage invincible aliens were so scared their scalps exploded. They all spared no effort to use various means to get far away.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with Lin Yuan's current strength, even if he was far from recovering to his peak period, he could still capture those five Eighth Stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he would inevitably expose more cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>He possessed dozens of cosmic powers, including the Primordial Power that surpassed advanced cosmic powers. These should be considered hidden trump cards.</p><p></p><p>To expose them just to kill a few mere Eighth Stage invincibles, Lin Yuan felt it wasn't worth it.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't even be considered killing. Lin Yuan could sense that the two Eighth Stage invincibles he had already killed still had karmic ties with him, which meant they hadn't truly died. Their true bodies should still be alive.</p><p></p><p>"Although Eighth Stage invincibles are at the same level as the Supreme Immortal Kings of the Spirit Realm in terms of combat power, they far surpass the latter in terms of escape methods."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>As for the reason, it wasn't hard to understand. In the Spirit Realm, Supreme Immortal Kings were basically at the ceiling, but in the main world, Eighth Stage invincibles couldn't even be considered the peak.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Eighth Stage invincibles placed great importance on methods of preserving their lives, and most of them had backgrounds, able to receive bestowals from even stronger existences.</p><p></p><p>This point alone was something the Supreme Immortal Kings of the Spirit Realm couldn't compare to.</p>

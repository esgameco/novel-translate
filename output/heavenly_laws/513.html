        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin's strong and brilliant smile, as Lin Yuan reappeared before them, meant that he had successfully crossed into the Twelfth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just getting Lin Yuan's personal acknowledgment made Xia Qin feel an unprecedented sense of comfort in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After more than a million years, human civilization had finally given birth to the tenth Supremacy? No, that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's existence was far beyond what the Supremacies could describe.</p><p></p><p>"Admirable, admirable," the Void Deity Supremacy said in a low voice: "Silver Galaxy Lord, you have become an Evolver in less than a thousand years, and have already crossed into the Ultimate, which I would not have dared to imagine in the past."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Lin Yuan's battle prowess, the speed at which he crossed into the Twelfth Realm alone was enough to set countless precedents in the history of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the evolutionary path that Lin Yuan had taken was one that he had carved out from nothing, which was infinitely more difficult than those Twelfth Realm Ultimates who had followed stable cultivation paths.</p><p></p><p>"Less than a thousand years? When I was a thousand years old, I was not even at the Eighth Realm." A human Supremacy sighed, sounding self-deprecating, but his expression was quite good.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan was an Evolver of their human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"It was just luck," Lin Yuan said humbly.</p><p></p><p>"Strength is strength, what are you talking about luck?" Xuanyuan Supremacy shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Silver Galaxy Lord, you need not be so modest, we are far inferior to you." The Void Deity Supremacy nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord, there is one thing I hope you will agree to," at this time, the Ancient Power Supremacy looked at Lin Yuan and couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>"Please go on," Lin Yuan said with a slightly solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord, when you were at the Eleventh Realm, you already had the strength of the Twelfth Realm, and now that you have crossed into the Twelfth Realm, what level of strength have you reached?" The Ancient Power Supremacy's gaze was filled with fighting intent.</p><p></p><p>He was one who had reached the Ultimate through the path of power, and his combat strength was almost on par with Xia Qin, so he was naturally curious about Lin Yuan's true strength at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Silver Galaxy Lord, what is your current strength exactly?" The Void Deity Supremacy was also quite eager to know.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Ancient Power Supremacy or the Void Deity Supremacy, they did not have any issues with Lin Yuan, nor were they dissatisfied with anything, they simply wanted to know what level Lin Yuan had reached.</p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe, there were only a few dozen Twelfth Realm Ultimates, and most of them could not really harm each other.</p><p></p><p>"Within this universe, it's roughly at the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Parting the Dao Realm, because of the suppression of the universe, if it were in the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan could easily unleash the strength of the Mastery Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Parting the Dao Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"You've just crossed into the Twelfth Realm and you're already at the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supremacy was extremely shocked. Like the other Twelfth Realm Ultimates, the nine Supremacies of human civilization had also determined that after Lin Yuan crossed into the Twelfth Realm, he would quickly reach the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>But to reach the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm right after crossing into the Twelfth Realm?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it said that the Ultimates who had just crossed into the Twelfth Realm were at their weakest?</p><p></p><p>"We can spar a bit." Lin Yuan smiled, not minding satisfying the curiosity of the Supremacies of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Then let me go first."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supremacy was extremely excited and said directly.</p><p></p><p>Within the universe, only the two from the Calamity Tribe had reached the peak of the Parting the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, these two had many restrictions on using their full strength. They would not act unless provoked, and once they did, they would face the suppression of the Cosmic Consciousness and have to go all out.</p><p></p><p>A peak Parting the Dao Realm Supremacy going all out, the Ancient Power Supremacy was not stupid, naturally he would not provoke them.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was also a Supremacy of human civilization, so the Ancient Power Supremacy felt that Lin Yuan would not be able to hold back against him.</p><p></p><p>"You first or me first?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan asked with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"You go first." The Ancient Power Supremacy was extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>To engage with a peak Parting the Dao Realm expert, he would have to focus on defense, only in this way could he experience the power of the peak Parting the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I'll only use my physical strength."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand and casually pressed it towards the Ancient Power Supremacy.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying physical strength power began to affect the space-time, the Ancient Power Supremacy's scalp went numb as he strained to resist, trying to affect Lin Yuan's slowly descending right hand, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Ancient Power Supremacy also tried to escape, but found that the space-time had already formed a cage, the powerful physical strength, the blood qi casually emanating, was enough to draw the space-time, forming a domain that belonged to Lin Yuan alone.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Yuan's palm slowly descended, in the eyes of the Ancient Power Supremacy, it was the collapse and destruction of the universe, all his vision was filled with that palm.</p><p></p><p>"Stop, stop, stop."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Power Supremacy immediately shouted.</p><p></p><p>He still had many trump card techniques that he had not used, but if he used those trump card techniques, it would no longer be a sparring session, so the Ancient Power Supremacy directly admitted defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Galaxy Lord, please stop quickly."</p><p></p><p>The Void Deity Supremacy steadied himself and quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to wait until the Ancient Power Supremacy's sparring was over, and then go up and exchange a few moves with the Silver Galaxy Lord himself.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no need to humiliate himself like that.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Parting the Dao Realm, it's so terrifying?" As Lin Yuan withdrew his right hand, the Ancient Power Supremacy couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Under that palm, the Ancient Power Supremacy felt that even if he used his strongest trump card techniques, he would still be injured, and this was just Lin Yuan casually pressing down with one palm.</p><p></p><p>"The peak of the Parting the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Strongest looked deeply at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Pili Dao Realm was not actually that terrifying. What was terrifying was the Milky Way Overlord. "Since the Milky Way Overlord has smoothly crossed into the Twelfth Realm, then we shall take our leave."  Xuanyuan the Strongest spoke.</p><p></p><p>The nine of them originally planned to stay a bit longer, after all, the initial entry into the Twelfth Realm was often the weakest time. </p><p></p><p>If other Twelfth Realm Ultimates took the opportunity to strike, it would be quite troublesome. </p><p></p><p>That's why they, the Nine Strongest, needed to be there to protect, to prevent those Twelfth Realm Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>But now, after witnessing Lin Yuan's palm strike just now, Xuanyuan the Strongest and the other Strongest had extinguished the idea of needing to protect.</p><p></p><p>Protect? </p><p></p><p>Who was protecting whom?</p><p></p><p>Were they protecting the Milky Way Overlord, or was the Milky Way Overlord protecting them?</p><p></p><p>"I will come find you all after some time," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the Twelfth Realm, he also had many things to do.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Strongest looked at Lin Yuan, as if recalling something, and immediately said, "Milky Way Overlord, now that you have crossed into the Twelfth Realm, you must quickly go to the Time River Realm and disembark."</p><p></p><p>Reaching perfection in the Eleventh Realm and assaulting the Ultimate, if successful, the essence of life would be transformed, allowing one to completely break free from the suppression of the Time River, and be able to directly enter the realm where the Time River resides.</p><p></p><p>The next thing every newly ascended Twelfth Realm Ultimate must do is to disembark.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>Disembarking was also the first thing he needed to do next. Although the newly ascended Twelfth Realm life was minimally affected by the Time River due to the just completed transformation, it was still better to disembark as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan the Strongest and the other Eight Strongest successively departed.</p><p></p><p>Leaving only Lin Yuan standing alone under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed many watchful gazes, those of numerous Twelfth Realm Ultimates carefully peering at him.</p><p></p><p>"The Calamity Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze turned towards the Calamity Tribe domain. At this moment, with his life realm having leapt, he was now able to see more. The ordinary wooden house contained much information that left him quite astonished.</p><p></p><p>"The origins of the Calamity Tribe are definitely not simple, is this wooden house a treasure of the Chaos Realm level?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Milky Way Overlord on crossing into the Twelfth Realm." Just then, the voice of a Calamity Tribe Ultimate transmitted, from half a universe away, congratulating him.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Milky Way Overlord on crossing into the Twelfth Realm." The voice of another Calamity Tribe Ultimate also came.</p><p></p><p>"The tone of these two..." Lin Yuan faintly detected a hint of reverence in the voices of these two Calamity Tribe Ultimates.</p><p></p><p>This was quite unbelievable, the two Calamity Tribe Ultimates were also at the peak of the Pili Dao Realm, even if they could not directly engage, they should not be so fearful of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that wooden house was of the Chaos Realm level?</p><p></p><p>"Milky Way Overlord, if you have time, you can come to our place and sit for a while, we will surely speak without holding back." The Calamity Tribe Ultimate standing outside the wooden house immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, not worried that there would be any traps or the like.</p><p></p><p>After crossing into the Twelfth Realm, Lin Yuan had no opponents in this universe, and even if he went to the Calamity Tribe domain, he would not go in person, at most he would condense a projection to go.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to disembark."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved, and he entered the Time River Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the shores of the Time River.</p><p></p><p>A group of Twelfth Realm Ultimates stood there, all focused on the interior of the Time River.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Milky Way Overlord had smoothly crossed into the Twelfth Realm, next he would surely disembark? The many alien Twelfth Realm experts could not directly understand Lin Yuan's strength like the human civilization's Strongest, they could only judge from the scene of Lin Yuan's disembarkation.</p><p></p><p>Within the Time River, any life manifested in its most essential form, whether below or above the Time River, it was always so.</p><p></p><p>The higher the essence of life, the more massive the form within the Time River.</p><p></p><p>"That is—"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a certain Ultimate from the Prison Tribe was filled with shock as he looked at the central position of the Time River.</p><p></p><p>There was the figure of a majestic giant, slowly rising up, this giant was so massive, so towering, that even as he stood up, his two legs were still within the Time River.</p><p></p><p>Yet the waters of the Time River only reached up to his thighs, the width of his two legs alone filled the entire Time River.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom.</p><p></p><p>After this giant stood up, he lifted his right foot and began to stride towards the shores of the Time River.</p><p></p><p>The giant's body size was so massive that the Twelfth Realm Ultimates at the shore only reached up to his knees.</p><p></p><p>During the disembarkation, the massive size meant absolute weight, the entire shores of the Time River trembled under the giant's pressure.</p><p></p><p>Slight tremors, accompanying each step the giant took, spreading along the Time River, towards the distant reaches.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>The tremors from the Time River where the giant stood, transmitted to the other tributary Time Rivers, passing through other universes.</p><p></p><p>The Twelfth Realm Ultimates in those universes, likewise felt these tremors, their hearts surging with towering waves, all simultaneously harboring the same thought: "Who is disembarking?"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 272</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The main star of the galaxy. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat in the depths of the main hall, slowly opening his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Finally back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked around. This time traversing, he spent nine hundred and twenty years in the spiritual realm. </p><p></p><p>In the main world, less than two years had passed. </p><p></p><p>It was a time flow speed ratio of about one to five hundred.</p><p></p><p>One year in the main world was equal to five hundred years in the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>"If it was the immortal realm above the spiritual realm, the time flow speed may decrease to one to a hundred? Or even one to tens."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently speculated. </p><p></p><p>This was already very close to the time flow speed of the main world. Even if the immortal realm had ultimate immortal existences like the Dao Ancestor, its scale was definitely not as large as the main world.</p><p></p><p>In the entire immortal realm, how many experts were on the same level as the Dao Ancestor? But in the main world, there were still some supreme experts, just the human civilization alone had nine supreme experts presiding.</p><p></p><p>"Primordial Golden Essence."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, revealing a palm-sized 'bell-shaped' treasure.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan nurtured it in the spiritual realm for hundreds of years, and finally used the primordial force to turn his flesh and everything into initial force and fuse it into the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>This 'bell-shaped' treasure underwent a major metamorphosis. Lin Yuan's flesh body tempered in the spiritual realm for nearly a thousand years, how terrifying, when turned into initial force, it almost 'burst' the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>This was also the only 'shortcut' method Lin Yuan could think of to utilize his traversing flesh body.</p><p></p><p>Since the traversing flesh body could not be brought back, or rather, bringing it back would require a price Lin Yuan could not afford, he might as well transform it into part of the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>Then he could just bring the Primordial Golden Essence back.</p><p></p><p>After all, to go back and forth only required a shred of realm-breaking primordial force, it would not increase with the strengthening of the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>"The current Primordial Golden Essence is no worse than a ninth-grade weapon. Once I break through to the ninth grade and nurture it for a while, it can become a ninth-grade weapon."</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing it, Lin Yuan slightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>With the flesh body he tempered in the spiritual realm and the primordial force formed from the years in his inner world, it was almost no different from a true ninth-grade expert. </p><p></p><p>The gap with ninth-grade experts was only in the comprehension of rules, which did not affect the enhancement of the Primordial Golden Essence.</p><p></p><p>"Saved me quite some effort."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt quite satisfied in his heart. Although the Gate of Myriad Realms could bring items from the traversing world back, the flesh body was also considered an 'item'.</p><p></p><p>But the primordial force consumed, Lin Yuan could not afford it.</p><p></p><p>This solution was perfect, at least it did not waste the flesh body in the traversing world.</p><p></p><p>"The gains from this traversal far exceeded expectations."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan put away the Primordial Golden Essence and checked the mysterious gourd.</p><p></p><p>He began to tally the gains.</p><p></p><p>First was the comprehension of the core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>Before the traversal, Lin Yuan had only comprehended two thousand nine hundred and thirty-two core spatial models.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's comprehension of core spatial models had reached over five thousand five hundred.</p><p></p><p>Nearly doubled, and the difficulty was far more than just twice as simple, it was increasing exponentially.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of seven thousand seven hundred and eighty-two core spatial models. In theory, as long as one comprehended three thousand core spatial models, one could attempt to fuse other rules.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan comprehending over five thousand five hundred core spatial models, even among the many peak eighth-grade experts in the main world, he would be considered extremely dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Those who could suppress Lin Yuan were probably those 'favored sons' of the primordial spatial origin, like the Crimson Kun Peng Starlord.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Kun Peng Starlord had comprehended over six thousand core spatial rule models, but that was relying on the racial talents of the Kun Peng of the star sea.</p><p></p><p>Whereas Lin Yuan relied entirely on himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how many millions of years had the Crimson Kun Peng Starlord cultivated? Lin Yuan had only cultivated for how many years?</p><p></p><p>Most crucially, comprehending spatial rules was just one of Lin Yuan's many pursuits, the time and effort he devoted to it probably did not even account for one-tenth of his total time and effort.</p><p></p><p>"Inner World."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind entered his inner world.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his inner world was still at the size before the traversalâ€”</p><p></p><p>A million square miles.</p><p></p><p>But following the return of Lin Yuan's spiritual will, his comprehension of space also quickly synchronized to his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Causing his inner world to start expanding rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Five thousand five hundred and fifty core spatial models were enough to support an inner world of seventy-five million square miles.</p><p></p><p>Adding the five-fold increase in absorption of the liquid from the mysterious gourd before the traversal.</p><p></p><p>So under normal circumstances, Lin Yuan's inner world would expand to three hundred and seventy-five million square miles before stopping.</p><p></p><p>On top of the existing one million square miles, it still needed to expand two hundred and seventy-five million square miles.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the inner world required the intake of a huge amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly, and he immediately began suppressing his inner world, causing it to stop expanding.</p><p></p><p>If he allowed the inner world to expand unchecked, it probably wouldn't take long before Lin Yuan himself was drained dry.</p><p></p><p>The energy required for two hundred and seventy-five million square miles was too terrifying. In the spiritual realm, it took Lin Yuan two to three hundred years to slowly increase it.</p><p></p><p>Now compressing that two to three hundred years into a short period, even Lin Yuan could barely withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I can't rely on my teacher this time," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>For the previous expansions of his inner world, Lin Yuan had relied on applying for 'Crimson Spirit Liquid'.</p><p></p><p>This was also a benefit of being one of the thirteen peak lords of the Crimson Kun Peng lineage, able to apply for 'Crimson Spirit Liquid' without limit.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Lin Yuan had lost this benefit.</p><p></p><p>Rather, expanding the inner world to three hundred and seventy-five million square miles would require an amount of 'Crimson Spirit Liquid' probably heavier than the Crimson Kun Peng's main star.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Crimson Kun Peng Starlord could produce it, he would probably have to sell everything he owned.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan didn't want to make the Crimson Kun Peng Starlord pay such a huge price.</p><p></p><p>"Still have to rely on myself," Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He currently had the energy to support the expansion of his inner world - the cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>It's just that cosmic crystals were too precious, using them as fuel for the inner world expansion was too extravagant.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan planned to use cosmic crystals to purchase another type of pure energy similar to the Crimson Spirit Liquid.</p><p></p><p>One cosmic crystal could purchase hundreds of tons of this pure energy, which for expanding the inner world, could have the effect of devouring hundreds of cosmic crystals.</p><p></p><p>The reason cosmic crystals were so expensive was because they contained extremely pure and high-grade cosmic energy, but for expanding the inner world, as long as there was energy, the purity requirement wasn't very high.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, using cosmic crystals to provide for the inner world expansion was an act of desperation - normally no cultivator would do this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the expansion of Lin Yuan's inner world wasn't just tens or hundreds of miles, but millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>"Not the force of creation, but the cosmic force."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the sky of his inner world. The yin-yang force formed from black and white occupied one area, while twelve other higher forces of creation occupied another area. </p><p></p><p>Finally, over sixty ordinary forces of creation occupied the third area.</p><p></p><p>And in the center of all the forces of creation, the primordial force reigned supreme.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There was a primordial force that suppressed more than ten higher forces of creation and over sixty ordinary forces of creation, which dared not approach. </p><p></p><p>Among them was even the Taiji force that had reached the third realm.</p><p></p><p>Om.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan gazed at layer after layer of creative forces. </p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a mysterious fluctuation converged towards Lin Yuan's physical body from the outer universe and starry space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a feeling that if he opened up the isolation between his inner world and the outside world, these creative forces would leave their imprints in the cosmic starry space, metamorphosing into cosmic forces that would belong solely to Lin Yuan thereafter.</p><p></p><p>"Am I considered an invincible at the eighth stage now or not?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was strange. </p><p></p><p>Theoretically, as long as one comprehended a cosmic force, one would be an invincible at the eighth stage.</p><p></p><p>But now, the cosmic forces Lin Yuan had comprehended were close to a hundred kinds, among which more than a dozen were higher-level cosmic forces, and there was even the primordial force, a power beyond higher cosmic forces whose depths were unknown.</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual realm, the supreme immortal kings mastered the complete forces of creation, cultivating them to at least the first realm, on par with the invincibles of the eighth stage in the main world.  </p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current strength in the spiritual realm, he could kill as many ordinary eighth stage invincibles as he wanted.</p><p></p><p>This was killing, not suppressing or repelling.</p><p></p><p>Even now, with his strength not fully recovered, relying on the dozens of cosmic forces he mastered, it would not be difficult for Lin Yuan to kill eighth stage invincibles.</p><p></p><p>Even if he only mastered one cosmic force, with his inner world spanning millions of miles, Lin Yuan would definitely be considered a powerful one among the eighth stage invincibles, let alone mastering dozens of cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>Among them was even the Taiji force, a higher cosmic force cultivated to the third realm.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel the so-called cosmic forces affecting my inner world," Lin Yuan felt carefully. Even back in the spiritual realm, he had discovered that cosmic forces could make his inner world more stable.</p><p></p><p>Comparable to the Thunder Star, an eight-star premium cosmic wonder.</p><p></p><p>That was just an ordinary cosmic force. Higher cosmic forces were even more so, and that mysterious primordial force directly made Lin Yuan's inner world much more stable.</p><p></p><p>This was a qualitative change.</p><p></p><p>The more stable the inner world, the more powerful the extended world force. When two eighth stage experts fought and their world forces collided, their inner worlds also collided.</p><p></p><p>With the current stability of Lin Yuan's inner world, a light touch would cause other eighth stage experts' inner worlds to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"My current combat strength, at full burst, is at least not weaker than the ninth stage," Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>If even invincibles of the eighth stage could survive in front of ninth stage experts, Lin Yuan believed he could contend with true ninth stage experts.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right."</p><p></p><p>"There's also the body technique imprint of 'Reinforcement'."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Lin Yuan condensed an extremely complex imprint.</p><p></p><p>The body technique 'Reinforcement' was the technique Lin Yuan's physical body had awakened in the spiritual realm. Although it was not a passive technique like 'Rebirth from a Drop of Blood', this technique could be considered Lin Yuan's trump card.</p><p></p><p>Once 'Reinforcement' was activated, Lin Yuan would gain a tenfold increase in power, which was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The only downside was that it could only last for ten breaths, and after activation, he would fall into a brief period of weakness.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Lin Yuan attached great importance to this technique and spent nearly thirty years comprehending it thoroughly. Using his physical body in the main world as a model, he formed a technique imprint and brought it back to the main world.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh world I descended into was too low-level, otherwise I should have been able to awaken another body technique," Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The seventh descent was a contingency he had made specifically to face the heart demon tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I possess three body techniques: Rebirth from a Drop of Blood, Relocating Mountains, and Reinforcement. Among them, I have yet to comprehend the technique imprint of Relocating Mountains."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he had stayed in the main world for too short a time and had many things to comprehend, so he didn't spend much time analyzing the Relocating Mountains technique.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the path of martial arts evolution," Lin Yuan's mind returned to his physical body, his expression slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual realm for over 920 years, Lin Yuan had long completed the opening of the eighth stage chapter of martial arts and was even contemplating the fusion of rules.</p><p></p><p>"The eighth stage chapter," Lin Yuan's mind stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the main world, the eighth stage was a very important stage. Whether one could establish a stable path of eighth stage evolution was even regarded as an important mark of becoming a great evolutionary scholar.</p><p></p><p>"I'll organize the eighth stage chapter first, then upload it to the Goddess of Wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself. He had basically perfected the main body of the eighth stage chapter, with only minor adjustments remaining.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't take much time.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan directly linked to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Respected Galactic Sovereign, the Goddess of Wisdom is pleased to serve you."</p><p></p><p>A solemn and chilly voice came.</p><p></p><p>"I want to upload the eighth stage chapter of martial arts," Lin Yuan said directly.</p><p></p><p>Upon these words.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Wisdom was briefly silent.</p><p></p><p>Then she immediately responded, "Galactic Sovereign, you may upload at any time."</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan uploaded the complete eighth stage chapter to the Goddess of Wisdom.</p><p></p><p>For the eighth stage chapter of martial arts, Lin Yuan had even drawn inspiration from the essence of the forces of creation in the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts cultivators entering the eighth stage would find it easier to comprehend a certain cosmic force compared to evolutionary cultivators of other paths.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "easier" only meant a reduced difficulty - in Lin Yuan's conception, the vast majority of eighth stage martial artists would still be unable to comprehend cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Lin Yuan believed the eighth stage chapter of martial arts was extremely valuable because it involved cosmic forces.</p><p></p><p>How many of the eighth stage or higher evolutionary paths recorded by human civilization touched upon cosmic forces?</p><p></p><p>In the descriptions of cosmic forces by human civilization and other apex races, they were basically regarded as unreplicable and completely random.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan finished uploading the eighth stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>On a mysterious planet extremely far from the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Huge screens flashed frantically, beginning to evaluate the potential and details of the eighth stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>"Detected 'Eighth Stage Chapter' involving numerous unknown cosmic forces, potential depth greatly increased, re-evaluating the martial arts evolutionary path..."</p><p></p><p>"Found 'Eighth Stage Chapter' enhancing the interpretation of rules' essence, overall evaluation of martial arts evolutionary path increased..."</p><p></p><p>"Found..."</p><p></p><p>"Triggering core contingency of human civilization, contacting the Goddess of Freedom, Goddess of Justice..."</p><p></p><p>"Triggering core contingency of human civilization, contacting the paramount experts Xia Qin, Yudie..."</p><p></p><p>The three Goddesses spared no computational power, repeatedly evaluating the various implications of the eighth stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the three Goddesses' evaluation of the eighth stage chapter will be?"</p><p></p><p>On the Galactic Sovereign planet, Lin Yuan felt some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He had put in a lot of effort to open up the eighth stage chapter.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Galactic Sovereign planet.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer of deep space.</p><p></p><p>Led by the eighth stage invincible Sala of the Dark Unicorn race, five invincibles patiently waited.</p><p></p><p>They were like cunning hunters lurking in the dark, waiting for their prey to appear.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

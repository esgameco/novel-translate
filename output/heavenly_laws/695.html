        <h1>Chapter 695</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The test space trembled, and countless runes quickly condensed.</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented spiritual mechanisms intertwined, vast spaces and demonic qi were extinguished.</p><p></p><p>But it still resisted with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the space, the golden figure's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>As the 'spirit' of the test space, he was well aware of the pressure the entire test space was facing at the moment.</p><p></p><p>It was on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>It could crumble at any moment.</p><p></p><p>But how could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>The test space was opened up by the great Lord of Wushan.</p><p></p><p>As the Eternal Sovereign, the space he opened, even if it was casually created, should not be shaken by beings at the level of the Carefree Three Realms.</p><p></p><p>This was a difference in 'quality'.</p><p></p><p>"Primal Demons?"</p><p></p><p>"A group of Primal Demons?"</p><p></p><p>The golden figure could only speculate towards the direction of the Primal Demons, guessing that perhaps a group of Primal Demons were attacking.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, he denied this possibility. The Primal Demons were indeed very powerful, surpassing the Eternal Scions, but to shake this test space? The strength of the Primal Demons came from the source of the Demonic Calamity, which was innately powerful.</p><p></p><p>But this test space was shrouded in secrecy, involving the essence of space-time. The Primal Demons couldn't even find it, let alone shake it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Demonic Deities?</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Deities needed to suppress the several Eternal Sects in the center of the Heavens and Earth. They had neither the energy nor the need to come and destroy this test space.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the Lord of Wushan had foreseen the arrival of the 'Demonic' Calamity in advance, the test spaces he opened up were certainly not just this one.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had only explored for hundreds or thousands of years, yet he had discovered this test space. It was indeed partly due to luck, but the number of test spaces was truly not small.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Lord of Wushan, the other Eternal Sovereigns had also made their own arrangements.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the test spaces was a 'transit' space, leading to the final inheritance left by the Lord of Wushan.</p><p></p><p>This 'transit' space, this source world had many, with the purpose of screening as many cultivators as possible who could reach the test threshold.</p><p></p><p>Destroying one 'transit' space would have almost no impact on the Lord of Wushan's arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Because the inheritance still existed, and the other 'transit' test spaces were still there.</p><p></p><p>So even if the Demonic Deities abandoned the Eternal Sects in the center of the Heavens and Earth, they would not specifically come to destroy this test space.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it is a space opened up by the Eternal Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the golden figure's panic, Lin Yuan was somewhat in awe.</p><p></p><p>His true body used this solar divine spirit as a 'beacon', wanting to directly descend, but was blocked by the endless runes outside the test space.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be said that he was blocked.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan's true body really wanted to forcibly squeeze in, he could do it.</p><p></p><p>But the consequence would be the complete collapse of this test space.</p><p></p><p>This would be contrary to Lin Yuan's purpose.</p><p></p><p>His true body came in person to obtain the inheritance left by the Lord of Wushan.</p><p></p><p>Not to destroy this test space.</p><p></p><p>"This test space, the energy fluctuations involved, are just at the level of the Carefree Third Realm and below, but it was casually opened up by the Lord of Wushan, yet it can reach this level?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how much stronger his true body was compared to the Carefree Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet he still couldn't smoothly squeeze in.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen how high the rules and operations of the test space were.</p><p></p><p>"Runes?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the countless runes around the test space. Each rune alone was not very powerful, but when gathered together, they unleashed power that surpassed their own by tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of times.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Wushan."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan became even more eager for the inheritance left by this Eternal Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Little guy, this test space is probably not going to last."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure turned to look at Lin Yuan, saying solemnly, "While you still have the ability, immediately extinguish your physical body."</p><p></p><p>Although the golden figure did not believe that the Primal Demons could lock onto this test space, he could only make the worst-case scenario.</p><p></p><p>And if he was killed by the Demons, even if it was just a clone that was killed, his spiritual will would be contaminated by demonic qi, and the rest of his true body would perish.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, faced with the unstoppable Demons, the best solution was to directly extinguish the physical body, to avoid contact with the Demons.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why the golden figure asked Lin Yuan to actively extinguish his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Extinguish the physical body?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if this test space is destroyed, there are other test spaces. Keep going in this direction, and you will find the next test space."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Wushan had opened up many test spaces, and even if one was destroyed, it would not affect the overall arrangement.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's talent and qualifications, he had a slim chance of transcending the space-time fusion rules and passing the Lord of Wushan's tests, being one of the hopes among the cultivators in this realm.</p><p></p><p>The golden figure naturally wanted to preserve such a seedling.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately realized that the dynamic of his true body's descent had caused the 'spirit' of the test space to perceive a crisis, thinking that powerful Primal Demons were attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstood?"</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The trembling of the test space was not only something he could perceive, but Lin Yuan as a test taker should also have felt the shock and panic.</p><p></p><p>Yet he showed no such emotions.</p><p></p><p>"It's my true body that has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said, "My true body wanted to directly descend, so that you wouldn't have to keep moving back and forth, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the golden figure fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The force that was shaking the test space, making it on the verge of collapse, was not the 'Demons', but the Lin Yuan in front of him? A cultivator? The golden figure was momentarily unable to react.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator could be so powerful?</p><p></p><p>"If Senior doesn't believe me, my true body is right outside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly descending would lead to the collapse of the test space, so Lin Yuan still wanted to enter through the normal way.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan's statement seemed incredible, as soon as he finished speaking, the dynamic of forceful entry from the outside quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>This made the golden figure feel that perhaps Lin Yuan's words were true.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the golden figure disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Appearing in the sky above the mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>The golden figure looked around, and found a young man standing there quietly.</p><p></p><p>The young man's appearance was exactly the same as the Lin Yuan inside the space, but the aura was vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the perception of the test space, the golden figure vaguely sensed the terrifying power of this young man.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was nurturing countless vast worlds within his body.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true body looked at the golden figure and greeted him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>The golden figure took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Lin Yuan's true body, he knew that the Lin Yuan outside and the Lin Yuan inside the space were different.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For the same living being, the cause and effect are interconnected.</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist, I'll take you in."</p><p></p><p>The thoughts were tumultuous, the golden figure was silent for a while, and could only open his mouth and say,</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>A spatial-temporal disturbance swept across.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was directly transported into the test space.</p><p></p><p>The Solar Primordial Spirit looked at the true body master, and transformed into a scorching force to merge with him.</p><p></p><p>"How can he be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>The golden figure was repeatedly observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>First, Lin Yuan was not a 'demon', but a normal cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators and 'demons' have significant differences, like clear water and ink.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator absorbs demonic qi, it is equivalent to becoming a demon, just like a drop of ink in clear water, which is very easy to distinguish.</p><p></p><p>In the golden figure's vision, Lin Yuan's aura was pure, and apart from being somewhat unfathomably thick, it had nothing to do with 'demons' at all.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why the golden figure brought Lin Yuan's true body master into the test space.</p><p></p><p>After clearly sensing the tremors and shakes in the test space, originating from Lin Yuan's true body master.</p><p></p><p>Then bringing Lin Yuan's true body master in, was to repeatedly confirm Lin Yuan's identity as a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if it was a demon, such a powerful 'demon', smoothly entering the test space, it would not be as simple as destroying a test space.</p><p></p><p>It would affect the inheritance of the Lord of Wu Mountain, and even this layout would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Which Eternal Son are you?"</p><p></p><p>The golden figure was silent for a while, but still couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Eternal Son is the strongest heir of the Eternal Sect's forces, and also the object of cultivation by the Lord of Eternity.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Eternal Son is close to the limit of the Carefree Immortal Realm, and some extremely monstrous Eternal Sons have even reached the limit of the Carefree Immortal Realm, not weaker than the strong ones in the first two giant paintings of this test space.</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Son?"</p><p></p><p>"I am not an Eternal Son."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure and said.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to lie about this, Lin Yuan has not yet mastered any Eternal Sect's Dao inheritance, nor could he pretend to be an Eternal Son.</p><p></p><p>"Not an Eternal Son."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had just asked casually, and actually did not think that Lin Yuan was an Eternal Son.</p><p></p><p>If the Eternal Sect had produced such a monstrous Eternal Son, how could he appear outside this test space? The various Lords of Eternity have left behind one after another backup plan to deal with the situation after the 'demonic' disaster.</p><p></p><p>And as the mainstay of the Eternal Sect forces, it must have a more complete inheritance to choose from.</p><p></p><p>Even if it also encompasses the inheritance of the Lord of Wu Mountain, the test space it enters would not be here.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, let me try again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the golden figure and immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>The golden figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a sense of expectation arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the strength Lin Yuan just displayed, the first two giant paintings would definitely not stop him.</p><p></p><p>As for the third one? It should not stop him either, but the strong one in the third giant painting, based on the prototype of the Lord of Heavenly Light, is the strongest and most perfect among the many living beings painted by the Lord of Wu Mountain.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I don't know how strong it is compared to the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the golden figure is looking forward to the strong one in the third giant painting, and who would be stronger between him and Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>There is no doubt that Lin Yuan has passed the test, even if the strong ones in the three giant paintings come out together, they cannot stop Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan can't even pass the test, then there is no cultivator in this world who can.</p><p></p><p>But not being able to stop him does not mean he is weaker.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of miles away from the central entrance of the world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered again.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the first time he entered.</p><p></p><p>This time, Lin Yuan was not the Solar Primordial Spirit, but his true body master.</p><p></p><p>Rustling.</p><p></p><p>The first giant painting rippled like flowing water.</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth strode out of the painting.</p><p></p><p>"It's you again?" </p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth glanced at Lin Yuan, "I told you, you are far from..."</p><p></p><p>Before the golden-armored youth could finish speaking, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, he also noticed that the current Lin Yuan was different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth's eyes flashed with golden light as he carefully examined Lin Yuan: "Interesting, I actually sense danger from you?"</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth found it unbelievable. As a life at the limit of the Carefree Immortal Realm created by the Lord of Wu Mountain, the golden-armored youth had no shortcomings in any aspect, especially in dealing with enemies, and could detect the slightest crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Now I am the true body master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said, looking at the golden-armored youth: "Next, I will go all out once."</p><p></p><p>In order to quickly obtain the inheritance of the Lord of Wu Mountain, Lin Yuan did not intend to fight the three giant painting strong ones for three hundred rounds and comprehend the essence of their techniques.</p><p></p><p>These three giant paintings were all painted by the Lord of Wu Mountain, and obtaining the inheritance left behind by the Lord of Wu Mountain would be far more efficient than comprehending the paintings.</p><p></p><p>"Come then."</p><p></p><p>The golden-armored youth's face showed no trace of contempt.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless golden runes appeared from all directions, forming a huge barrier.</p><p></p><p>After sensing the danger in Lin Yuan, the golden-armored youth had no intention of taking the initiative to attack, but focused on blocking.</p><p></p><p>His purpose was to block any challenger from approaching the central entrance.</p><p></p><p>As for the previous initiative to attack Lin Yuan, it was simply because he felt that the other party did not pose a great threat to his life.</p><p></p><p>Without any threat, the golden-armored youth felt that Lin Yuan could not possibly cross him and approach the entrance, so he attacked just for fun.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood in the void, quietly watching the golden-armored youth who was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, the fingers loosely grasped, and a dazzling white light appeared in the palm, rapidly expanding and transforming into a slender sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's left hand was the same, but the sword beams turned into pitch-black ones.</p><p></p><p>The black and white sword beams formed the Yin-Yang Taiji diagram.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Yin-Yang Taiji diagram transformed into a Yin-Yang Taiji Sword.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji could not only take the form of the Taiji diagram, but could also evolve into anything Lin Yuan could conceive of. </p><p></p><p>However, the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji diagram was good at suppression, which was why Lin Yuan used it the most, while the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji Sword was good at offense.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Chaotic Yin-Yang Taiji Sword, Lin Yuan lightly slashed towards the golden-armored youth.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Creation, Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>Like the moment of the universe's initial chaos, a flash of black and white sword light came and went.</p><p></p><p>The endless golden runes that the golden-armored youth had gathered with all his strength were all cut off.</p><p></p><p>Along with the golden-armored youth being slashed into two halves, his aura dissipated and he returned to the painting.</p><p></p><p>The black and white sword light continued to slash.</p><p></p><p>In the second giant painting, the extremely beautiful woman walked out of the painting, and a sword mark appeared from top to bottom on her brow, her form disintegrating and returning to the giant painting.</p><p></p><p>The third giant painting.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows the great dream, a millennium passes in a single moment."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed man lazily stepped out of the giant painting, saying in a languid tone, "You are the ninth challenger to reach me."</p><p></p><p>Before the white-robed man could finish speaking, he saw a sword light from the Heavenly Dao slashing towards him.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

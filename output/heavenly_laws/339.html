        <h1>Chapter 339</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 339: Great Harvest (5,200 words, please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>From a certain perspective, the 'Xuanhuang Strike' is more like a "passive" secret technique. </p><p></p><p>Of course, activating the 'Xuanhuang Strike' consumes a lot, but what Lin Yuan fears least now is consumption. </p><p></p><p>That vast inner world, whether judged by its intuitive size or spatial depth, is unknown multiples larger than an ordinary ninth-level cultivator's.</p><p></p><p>"If I combine the 'Xuanhuang Strike' with the divine ability 'Augmentation', my instantaneous explosive attack power..." Lin Yuan's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan's defensive means far exceeded his offensive means, after all, the divine ability 'Augmentation' cannot be used at will.</p><p></p><p>But with the 'Xuanhuang Strike', it can greatly make up for Lin Yuan's offensive capabilities.</p><p></p><p>As for the defensive secret technique 'Xuanhuang Body', it is a body refining secret technique.  </p><p></p><p>The body becomes like the mystic yellow, indestructible and imperishable.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique is also divided into four stages.</p><p></p><p>Once cultivated to perfection,</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood permeates trillions of light years, even if facing an ultimate existence, it would be extremely difficult to destroy.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan remembered that among the secret techniques left by the master of the Demon Jade Pavilion, there was one called the 'Undying Demon Jade Body', which was also an extremely formidable body refining method.</p><p></p><p>It's just unknown whether it is stronger or weaker compared to the 'Xuanhuang Body'.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan rejoiced in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he had two powerful physical divine abilities protecting his body, as well as the Origin Bell guarding his physical body, soul and spirit,</p><p></p><p>The ability to revive from a drop of blood only enhances his revival power, and does not increase his physical strength. The elemental body only has an immunity effect, and also does not increase physical strength.</p><p></p><p>The liquid in the mysterious gourd does increase his physical strength, but that is not a secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, secret techniques can be universally cultivated, even his primordial spirit can cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Like the Origin Bell, it can only be used as a trump card for his main body. Lin Yuan is unwilling to give the Origin Bell to his primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>If his primordial spirit dies, so be it, Lin Yuan doesn't care. But if he loses the Origin Bell, he would definitely feel heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, there are no taboos for cultivating the 'Xuanhuang Strike' and 'Xuanhuang Body'. Cultivate them according to your own situation. But for the 'Spacetime Steps', even if you cultivate it, you must use it cautiously."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"'Spacetime Steps'?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression turned solemn, and information about this secret technique surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This is an escape secret technique. The most precious aspect is that this escape technique combines the rules of time and space.</p><p></p><p>The rules of time and space are the two major pillars of rules. Especially the rule of time, which is abstruse and difficult to understand, let alone creating a secret technique based on the combination of these two major rules.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Spacetime Steps' can allow you to instantly traverse vast distances in space. But you must be clear, you can only take nine steps at most, even the strongest can only take nine steps."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan understood.</p><p></p><p>If the 'Xuanhuang Strike' consumes his power by "quantity", then the 'Spacetime Steps' consumes by "proportion".</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what realm a cultivator is in, activating this secret technique and taking one step will consume one-ninth of all their power - blood, soul, spirit and everything.</p><p></p><p>Taking nine consecutive steps will deplete all of one's power completely.</p><p></p><p>If another step is taken at this point, it will cause irreversible damage.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the price is huge. But the effect is also astonishing.</p><p></p><p>At Lin Yuan's current realm and strength, activating the 'Spacetime Steps' would allow him to traverse hundreds of millions of light-years with each step.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of light-years, in just one step?</p><p></p><p>One should know that with an ordinary great translocation technique, even if Lin Yuan exhausts all his power, he can only traverse thousands of light-years in one step.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of light-years? Lin Yuan would need to take a thousand consecutive steps without pause.</p><p></p><p>Even if it takes one breath per step, that's still a thousand breaths for a thousand steps.</p><p></p><p>With this secret technique, even facing an eleventh-level expert, as long as Lin Yuan has not taken all nine steps, the opponent cannot catch up.</p><p></p><p>By the time Lin Yuan finishes the nine steps, he would have likely reached a safe place. One step is hundreds of millions of light-years, nine steps is equivalent to billions of light-years.</p><p></p><p>Even in the vast cosmic starry sky, billions of light-years is no short distance.</p><p></p><p>"If an ultimate expert uses this secret technique, they can descend upon any location in the universe with just one casual step." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The stronger one's strength and realm, the greater the distance traversed with each step of this secret technique. Lin Yuan can travel hundreds of millions of light-years per step, while an ultimate expert can likely traverse half the universe in a single step.</p><p></p><p>No matter how far, they could reach it in just two steps.</p><p></p><p>However, for an ultimate expert, the consumption of one-ninth or two-ninths of their total power is no small amount either.</p><p></p><p>"You have fully obtained the inheritance of the Sovereign." The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan. "Next, there is one more thing you need to do."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Lin Yuan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>If the three secret techniques of offense, defense and escape were known to many, they would inevitably target their weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>No secret technique is perfect. For example, the 'Spacetime Steps' seems invincible, but its flaw is also obvious - it can only take nine steps.</p><p></p><p>After nine steps, one would fall into absolute weakness.</p><p></p><p>If the enemy doesn't know about this, it's fine. But once they find out, they could specifically wait until after the ninth step to pursue and attack when one is vulnerable. What then?</p><p></p><p>The 'Xuanhuang Strike' and 'Xuanhuang Body' also have weaknesses and flaws, though not as glaring as the 'Spacetime Steps'. But they absolutely cannot be spread externally.</p><p></p><p>This is not just about Lin Yuan, the Xuanhuang inheritor, but about the other Xuanhuang inheritors across the universe.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lin Yuan agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Just don't spread them externally.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan never intended to spread them in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Spreading such extremely personal life-protecting secret techniques is like actively revealing one's weaknesses, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Good." The six-armed figure nodded. "Repeat after me."</p><p></p><p>"I, a disciple of the Sovereign Xuanhuang, swear by the Xuanhuang's mark that I will absolutely not spread the protective secret techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage. If I violate this oath, my soul will be extinguished."</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I, a disciple of the Sovereign Xuanhuang, swear by the Xuanhuang's mark that I will absolutely not spread the protective secret techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage. If I violate this oath, my soul will be extinguished."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered for a moment, then repeated the oath.</p><p></p><p>The instant he finished reciting it, a towering yellow mountain-like mark emerged from the depths of his soul, then quickly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanhuang's mark?" Lin Yuan's heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Xuanhuang's mark, he also had the Demon Jade's mark deep in his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The six-armed figure seemed to relax a bit.</p><p></p><p>"You naturally formed the Xuanhuang's mark by cultivating the Xuanhuang's evolutionary path. I know you are a life form from within the universe that can be revived by ultimate existences. But this oath is rooted in the depths of your memory. If you die because of this oath, even if revived, as long as the memory remains, you will continue dying endlessly."</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured." Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But you can be at ease, as long as you don't spread the secret techniques, nothing will happen." The six-armed figure added.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lin Yuan also understood clearly.</p><p></p><p>After taking that oath, a wealth of information surged into his mind, every single word was definite and without any doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Refine the secret realm's core."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan exhaled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He then sat cross-legged, took out the yellow crystal, and began infusing it with the power of the world, slowly refining it.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"So this is what the entire Xuanhuang secret realm looks like?" Through the secret realm's core, Lin Yuan saw the true full appearance of the Xuanhuang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The full appearance of the Xuanhuang secret realm consisted of three vast continents. The many ninth-level experts from the cosmic starry sky that entered only accessed one of those continents.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two continents, they remained unopened, shrouded in dense mists. Apart from Lin Yuan and the six-armed figure, not a single expert had detected them.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang secret realm is too inconceivable, no wonder it evaded the lockdown of all the ultimate experts." As he continued refining the secret realm's core, Lin Yuan understood more about the Xuanhuang secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang secret realm did not exist in any particular spatial layer, but rather in the gaps between spatial layers, changing positions as the countless spatial layers of the universe flowed and shifted.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Xuanhuang secret realm's location changed every moment, which is why the ultimate experts could not accurately lock onto it.</p><p></p><p>At the Galaxy Prime Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The primordial spirit at the Xuanhuang secret realm's sun was furiously refining the secret realm's core, striving to master the entire Xuanhuang secret realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Lin Yuan's true main body was comprehending the three protective secret techniques of the Xuanhuang lineage.</p><p></p><p>As for the rules of time, that could wait - breaking through from the ninth to tenth level did not require much understanding of the time rules.</p><p></p><p>But the three secret techniques, every stage he cultivated would grant Lin Yuan a boost in strength.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuanhuang Body' requires refinement, needing a great deal of..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"The 'Source of Xuan-Huang'? That is the 'Xuan-Huang Crystal'." Lin Yuan's face showed a smile. </p><p></p><p>Currently, he had the most Xuan-Huang Crystals. With the accumulation of the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm over so many millions of years, the Xuan-Huang Crystals were as big as small mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Once I fully control the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm, I'll have the Sun Yuanshen bring out a portion of the Xuan-Huang Crystals," Lin Yuan decided in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As long as these Xuan-Huang Crystals did not circulate, there would be no impact. If only he cultivated with them, how would others know?</p><p></p><p>Time passed. </p><p></p><p>Two years went by in a blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the personal space.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan and Xi Lan sat facing each other, savoring delicious food.</p><p></p><p>"This Scorching Dragon meat, even in the virtual world, it's not cheap right? At least it costs dozens of universe crystals to eat?" Xi Lan said, looking at the half-meter large meat leg in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Dragon was a special life form from the depths of the universe's starry sky. When mature, it was at the fifth rank. </p><p></p><p>The Scorching Dragon was most famous for its blood and meat. Its meat was delicious, and after special preparation, its taste was unmatched in the entire human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Scorching Dragons could not be domesticated, so every pound of Scorching Dragon meat required hunting and killing them.</p><p></p><p>This led to the consistently high price of Scorching Dragon meat.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Dragon meat in the virtual world only retained the delicious taste without any real-world effects, yet it still cost dozens of universe crystals per dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha." Lin Yuan took a bite of the Scorching Dragon meat, his face showing an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this Scorching Dragon meat in front of them was not bought by Lin Yuan, but was given by the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the implicit benefits for level 8 citizens - they received it every month. Not only virtual Scorching Dragon meat, but even real Scorching Dragon meat would be sent, though in smaller quantities.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Sovereign, your reputation in the ninth-rank circle is now unparalleled. Those special ninth-ranks look unsightly when they see you. The ninth-rank xenoraces in the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm don't dare show themselves now," Xi Lan said with a smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>So many times the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm had opened, the ninth-rank evolutionary cultivators of human civilization had neither gained nor lost much.</p><p></p><p>Even if human civilization gave birth to a powerful ninth-rank evolutionary cultivator during special periods, they would provoke joint opposition from other special ninth-ranks within the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan?</p><p></p><p>Did those special ninth-ranks dare to challenge him?</p><p></p><p>"By the way, there's something I need to tell you," Xi Lan seemed to remember something and said, "Duo Ke and some of the special ninth-ranks of our human civilization want me to ask you if you're willing to join forces to completely drive out the other xenoraces from the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's tone carried a sense of amazement.</p><p></p><p>In the past, an ordinary ninth-rank evolutionary cultivator like himself would never have caught the attention of those special ninth-ranks of human civilization, let alone Duo Ke, the former strongest ninth-rank of the human era.</p><p></p><p>But because of Lin Yuan, because of his good relationship with the Galaxy Sovereign, Duo Ke personally contacted him and spoke to him politely and as an equal.</p><p></p><p>What Xi Lan regretted most at this moment was those two or three years he spent with the Galaxy Sovereign, hiding from the pursuit of the Hundun in the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Drive out the xenoraces from the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm?" Lin Yuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>As a member of human civilization, he was naturally opposed to those hostile xenoraces, so Lin Yuan had no psychological burden in doing such things.</p><p></p><p>"But it can't be done in the next few years," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>His Sun Yuanshen was focused entirely on refining the core of the secret realm and had no time for other matters.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Duo Ke said as long as it's within twenty years, it's fine," Xi Lan smiled. The Xuan-Huang Secret Realm would be closed for another forty years. As long as they started driving out those ninth-rank xenoraces within twenty years, the timing would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>The ninth-rank experts of human civilization and its allied tribes could join forces to search for the locations of those ninth-rank xenoraces, which was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>They had not done so before to avoid provoking the other ninth-rank xenoraces into joining forces. But now, with the Galaxy Sovereign present, the more those ninth-rank xenoraces banded together, the greater their losses would be.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm's core floating in front of him had already been half-refined.</p><p></p><p>"Right now..." Lin Yuan opened his eyes while refining, sensing his own state.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not completely refined the secret realm's core, Lin Yuan now had many privileges within the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Such as instant transmission and movement.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan-Huang Secret Realm suppressed all forms of instant transmission and movement. Even for Lin Yuan, an invincible ninth-rank who had opened more than 20 billion layers of space, he had to fly slowly to travel.</p><p></p><p>This was not because Lin Yuan's spatial comprehension was lacking, but because of the rules.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the main universe, the maximum flight speed could only reach light speed; anything faster required entering a wormhole.</p><p></p><p>These were the rules of the world.</p><p></p><p>But now, as his control over the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm gradually increased, many limitations from the world had disappeared. This was a "privilege" that the master of the secret realm should have.</p><p></p><p>In the virtual world.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of ninth-rank evolutionary cultivators gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the Galaxy Sovereign will agree to our plan?" One ninth-rank cultivator with a million-fold realm could not help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Although the Galaxy Sovereign was also a ninth-rank like them, at this moment, the many ninth-rank evolutionary cultivators present had already treated Lin Yuan as a tenth-rank expert.</p><p></p><p>That level of strength capable of instantly killing special ninth-ranks, who else could achieve that besides a true tenth-rank?</p><p></p><p>"Unclear," Duo Ke shook his head slightly. He had asked Xi Lan to pass on his request to join forces and drive out the other ninth-rank xenoraces, but it was only his own plan, not an arrangement of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>So the Galaxy Sovereign could agree or disagree.</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xi Lan's figure appeared in this personal space.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xi Lan, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>"What did the Galaxy Sovereign say?"</p><p></p><p>One by one, at least ninth-rank cultivators with million-fold realms looked towards Xi Lan.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Having never been the focus of so many powerful experts before, Xi Lan felt some pressure for a moment. He paused, then said solemnly, "The Galaxy Sovereign agreed, but it has to be done in a few years."</p><p></p><p>"He agreed?"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Sovereign agreed?"</p><p></p><p>"A few years is no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-rank cultivators with million-fold realms heaved sighs of relief. Although the Galaxy Sovereign's age didn't even match the first digit of theirs, among evolutionary cultivators, strength was respected. The Galaxy Sovereign's strength had already earned him the respect of all evolutionary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Just one thing, the Galaxy Sovereign said that if he takes action, he must get ninety percent of the gains," Xi Lan added.</p><p></p><p>Although Xi Lan had not discussed the distribution of gains in detail with Lin Yuan, he could not possibly concede on this.</p><p></p><p>"Ninety percent?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, not to mention ninety percent, even ninety-five percent is fine."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-rank evolutionary cultivators had no objections. Without the Galaxy Sovereign, this matter could not be accomplished at all. Did they think they could drive out the ninth-rank xenoraces from the secret realm on their own? That was simply a pipe dream.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what conditions the Galaxy Sovereign proposed, they would agree.</p><p></p><p>On the Galaxy Sovereign Star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The first stage of the 'Xuan-Huang Strike' has been cultivated."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his right hand, a hazy glow flickering, and with a casual strike, he erupted with double his full strength.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan-Huang secret technique 'Xuan-Huang Strike' was divided into four stages. Cultivating the first stage allowed one to casually erupt with double their strength, while the fourth stage allowed erupting with five times one's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Too powerful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan kept circulating the 'Xuan-Huang Strike'. With the same strike, catalyzed and circulated through the secret technique 'Xuan-Huang Strike', he could unleash strength far exceeding his limits. This complex and mysterious transformation and augmentation left Lin Yuan somewhat amazed.</p><p></p><p>In the Xuan-Huang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Yuanshen refining the secret realm's core also opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"'Xuan-Huang Strike'." While refining, Lin Yuan also tried out this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>There was no difficulty in refining the secret realm's core, it just took time. Lin Yuan would sometimes do other things while refining.</p><p></p><p>Weng weng weng.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura rippled on the surface of Lin Yuan's body.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"The 'Xuan-Huang Strike' actually has a promoting effect on refining the secret realm's core too?" Lin Yuan's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, not far away, the six-armed figure was observing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>When a yellowish glow appeared on Lin Yuan's body, the six-armed figure's face showed an astonished look: "'Xuan-Huang Strike'... this kid has already cultivated the first stage of the 'Xuan-Huang Strike'?"</p><p></p><p>"When did the protective secret technique of my Xuan-Huang lineage become so simple?"</p><p></p><p>The six-armed figure could not believe it.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The 33,333rd seed of the Blazing Sun, like the final brushstroke that brings a dragon painting to life.</p><p></p><p>The moment it took form, it resonated with the many Blazing Sun seeds that had previously coalesced, forming a perfect whole.</p><p></p><p>"It has finally coalesced."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>Even during the war between the Azure Flame Realm and the Purple Dream Realm, he had been trapped in the process of coalescing the final Blazing Sun seed.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he had broken through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>It was not that Lin Yuan lacked the insight, but the coalescence of the final Blazing Sun seed required the absorption of sufficient Blazing Sun Qi from the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Without enough Blazing Sun Qi, it could not be coalesced.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Lin Yuan had gathered from the records of the many imperial clan members of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, even the core imperial clan members who could coalesce Blazing Sun seeds as easily as drinking water or eating, could generally only coalesce a little over 20,000 Blazing Sun seeds at most.</p><p></p><p>In the entire history of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom, there were only 18 imperial clan members who had coalesced 33,333 Blazing Sun seeds.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for this manor, the time it would have taken me to coalesce the final Blazing Sun seed would have been delayed by hundreds or even thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, the imperial manor prepared for him by the Emperor was located near the largest Blazing Sun vein of the ancient kingdom, with an abundance of Blazing Sun Qi.</p><p></p><p>In other places, the efficiency of absorbing Blazing Sun Qi would have been much lower.</p><p></p><p>"33,333 Blazing Sun seeds will form a perfect Blazing Sun grand circulation, greatly enhancing my various aspects, such as strength, rule comprehension, and more."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The 18 imperial clan members in the history of the Ancient Blazing Sun Kingdom who possessed the Blazing Sun grand circulation, even if they had not fully unlocked their bloodline to the Celestial Venerable level, were still able to smoothly comprehend the principles of the Chaotic Evolutionary Force and enter the realm of Celestial Venerables through their comprehension of the Grand Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully sensed the fluctuations of the Grand Dao rules and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before coalescing the final Blazing Sun seed, his comprehension of the rules had indeed increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>"The creatures of this Source World are truly blessed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. Even with just a few Blazing Sun seeds, their comprehension of the Grand Dao rules would surpass the mighty experts of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The creatures of the Six Ancient Kingdoms could comprehend the Grand Dao rules much more easily than the creatures of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The peerless Great Saints of the Chaotic Void and the pinnacle Celestial Venerables of the Six Ancient Kingdoms were roughly at the same level, but the latter had a deeper comprehension of the path of the Chaotic Evolutionary Force.</p><p></p><p>This easily bridged the gap in their innate foundations.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to sense the impact of the Blazing Sun grand circulation on his own body.</p><p></p><p>"My Blazing Sun Divine Body has been greatly enhanced, and the divine ability 'World' has been strengthened."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly activated the divine ability 'World', transforming himself into a blazing sun that illuminated the surrounding space-time, which became his domain.</p><p></p><p>Since the manor had independent space-time, Lin Yuan could activate the 'World' divine ability here without much concern for the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun."</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the center of the world, Lin Yuan faintly sensed each of the Blazing Sun seeds within him emitting light.</p><p></p><p>With each Blazing Sun seed glowing, an additional blazing sun appeared in the sky of this world.</p><p></p><p>Soon, 33,333 blazing suns were arrayed across the celestial dome, and combined with the sun formed by Lin Yuan's physical body, there were a total of 33,334 blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lin Yuan felt the power of the 'World' divine ability skyrocket. If he wished, he could easily break through the suppression of the manor and envelop the entire capital city within his world.</p><p></p><p>However, if he dared to do so, the next moment he would be crushed by the foundational power of the capital.</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Sun grand circulation can actually have such an impact on the 'World' divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was astonished, as this was something the 18 imperial clan members with the Blazing Sun grand circulation had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the 'Blazing Sun World Creation'?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the 'brand new' divine world around him and speculated.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to understand why the Blazing Sun grand circulation could have such an influence, as his divine world had assimilated and devoured the Blazing Sun source.</p><p></p><p>As for why the previous 18 imperial clan members did not possess this change, it was because they lacked the foundational inner universe, the divine ability 'World', the divine ability 'Blazing Sun World Creation', and the cultivation of the 'Infinite Void' legacy that Lin Yuan had attained. There were too many things that could not be replicated.</p><p></p><p>"However, my current divine world is far stronger than before."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan collected his thoughts and felt the astonishing control he now had over the surrounding space-time.</p><p></p><p>With the Blazing Sun source integrated into the core of his divine world, Lin Yuan would transform into a blazing sun when he unleashed it. And now, there were 33,334 such blazing suns, the power of which was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Although the blazing suns formed from the Blazing Sun seeds were not as powerful as the one formed by Lin Yuan's physical body, their sheer number at least increased the might of the divine world by dozens or even hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>"The consumption is also much greater, but I can support it."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the current state of his divine world, Lin Yuan sensed that as his domain extended, the Grand Dao rules of this Source World quickly retreated from the areas under his influence.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lin Yuan retracted the divine world and began to delve deeper into its research.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, if I fully activate the divine world, I should be able to easily suppress experts like the Crimson Lotus Celestial Venerable. As for the Scarlet Flame Celestial Venerable and other pinnacle Celestial Venerables..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan pondered, unable to make an accurate comparison.</p><p></p><p>In this Source World, an ordinary Celestial Venerable was equivalent to a Chaotic Great Saint in the Chaotic Void, while the pinnacle Celestial Venerables were on par with the Invincible Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Scarlet Flame Celestial Venerable was essentially approaching that of the Invincible Great Saints of the Chaotic Void. In fact, among the pinnacle Celestial Venerables of the Six Ancient Kingdoms, there were surely some who could rival the Invincible Great Saints.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, it was extremely rare to have even one Invincible Great Saint, but in this Source World? The profound nurturing power of the 13th Ancestral Lineages was too high.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, as long as a Peerless Great Saint could cultivate a 13th Ancestral Lineage, they would essentially have the strength of an Invincible Great Saint, like the Patriarch of the Demon Jade Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But in this Source World? Which Celestial Venerable did not have access to the 13th Ancestral Lineages? Although the difficulty in cultivating them was extremely high, the probability of producing Invincible Great Saint-level Celestial Venerables was undoubtedly much higher than in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>The time-based life forms of the Chaotic Void could only obtain the 13th Ancestral Lineages by chance, and they were even prohibited from spreading them, relying entirely on luck.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will continue to coalesce more Blazing Sun seeds."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan divided his mental focus and attempted to coalesce even more Blazing Sun seeds. This technique would greatly enhance his combat power, surpassing many who had coalesced large numbers of Blazing Sun seeds in the past.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The members of the royal family of the Sun Clan were naturally very important to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, news of the birth of a new first-grade treasure land quickly spread throughout the ancient Scorching Sun Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Many grand Saint-Emperor level experts were greatly excited, even though the rare treasures produced by the first-grade treasure land would definitely be prioritized for supply to the Saint-Emperor realm experts of the ancient kingdom. As long as the ancient Scorching Sun Kingdom could seize this first-grade treasure land, the Saint-Emperors would get the meat, and the Grand Saints would also be able to drink the soup.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the list of the twelve Saint-Emperors representing the ancient Scorching Sun Kingdom to go and compete for the new treasure land was made public.</p><p></p><p>Among them, eleven Saint-Emperors did not cause much of a stir - they were all veteran peak Saint-Emperors, such as the veteran expert Red Lotus Saint-Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But the last one was the recently rising Silver River Saint-Emperor?</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Saint-Emperor? Hasn't he just recently entered the Saint-Emperor realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Silver River Saint-Emperor is the first royal clansman to achieve the Saint-Emperor realm through the Ancestor's bloodline, letting him participate in the competition for the first-grade treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. Before the list was finalized, the Silver River Saint-Emperor had sparred with the Red Lotus Saint-Emperor, and although they did not determine a winner, the Red Lotus Saint-Emperor had publicly stated that the Silver River Saint-Emperor's strength was not inferior to his."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness? The Silver River Saint-Emperor has only been in the Saint-Emperor realm for a short while, and he can already match the peak Saint-Emperor Red Lotus?"</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is the power of the Ancestor's bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Many Grand Saint level experts discussed this in an uproar. Although many Grand Saints had doubts about the Silver River Saint-Emperor being on the list, upon learning of the results of his sparring with the Red Lotus Saint-Emperor, they were all greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>In the Silver River Palace, Lin Yuan was sitting face-to-face with the Crimson Treasure King.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Saint-Emperor Silver River." The Crimson Treasure King's expression was slightly reverential: "When I first met you, I even fought with you."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Just call me Silver River." Lin Yuan shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Crimson Treasure King taking care of him many times after he entered the capital, he might have taken many detours.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do. Now that you are a Saint-Emperor, if I call you Silver River, how will the other Saint-Emperors address me?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Treasure King immediately said.</p><p></p><p>Although he was also a member of the royal core clan and could exchange a few moves with a Saint-Emperor, that referred to ordinary Saint-Emperors. As for the peak Saint-Emperors, he was naturally far from being their match. Lin Yuan's strength was on par with the peak Saint-Emperor Red Lotus, and his power was unknown how far it surpassed the current Crimson Treasure King.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that when I was ordered to support the Azure Burn Domain, I would end up bringing something back for the ancient kingdom," the Crimson Treasure King said with a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>In fact, since Lin Yuan entered the capital of the Scorching Sun Kingdom and took up residence in the Silver River Palace, many members of the royal clan had come to visit him.</p><p></p><p>A considerable portion of them were planning to depend on Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning for me to establish the 18th royal clan branch?" Lin Yuan smiled at the middle-aged man in white robes before him.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man had a powerful aura, at the peak Grand Saint realm. At the moment, he was extremely respectful towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Saint-Emperor, with your strength, as long as you are willing, the 18th branch you establish will surely surpass the other seventeen branches and have a huge impact within the ancient kingdom."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Scorching Sun Kingdom currently had seventeen royal clan branches, each with a peak royal clansman at its core. Besides the seventeen royal clan branches, there were also many scattered royal clansmen who were on the periphery of the kingdom's core. Seeing Lin Yuan, a core royal clansman who had ascended to the Saint-Emperor realm through the Ancestor's bloodline, they were eager to cling to his coattails.</p><p></p><p>"I have no interest in establishing a royal clan branch," Lin Yuan said directly. Currently, he only planned to focus all his efforts on cultivation, in order to better breakthrough to the 13th Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for establishing a royal clan branch? If Lin Yuan could break through to the 13th Realm, it would not be establishing a branch, but opening the 7th ancient kingdom in this source world.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to break through to the 13th Realm, with Lin Yuan's cultivation growth rate, the power he could establish would not be able to keep up with himself.</p><p></p><p>Before breaking through to the 13th Realm, Lin Yuan would also make various arrangements to ensure the continuation of human civilization in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>"But..." The middle-aged man in white still wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>"Withdraw." Lin Yuan waved his hand, and the middle-aged man was directly teleported away.</p><p></p><p>Many members of the royal clan visited Lin Yuan. Besides seeking to depend on him, more of them came to seek guidance and advice.</p><p></p><p>"Saint-Emperor, how can we, the Ancestor's bloodline, break through the shackles of our limits?" A royal clansman who had realized the path of Chaotic Evolution Power humbly asked Lin Yuan for advice.</p><p></p><p>This royal clansman had the title of Crimson Radiance King, and he was also a core royal clansman. After reaching his limit, he found that he could not break through the shackles of his bloodline, so he turned to cultivate the Dao rules and eventually realized the Chaotic Evolution Power, crossing into the Saint-Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>"Continuously nourish the fundamental power within your bloodline," Lin Yuan did not hide it, as the path of Martial Dao Evolution was rooted in the refinement of the bloodline, which was the essence of the Body Cultivation Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Fundamental power?" The Crimson Radiance King fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific methods of nourishment, after this competition for the treasure land is over, I will carefully explain them to you," Lin Yuan looked at the Crimson Radiance King.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also planned to spread the details of the Martial Dao Evolution path after the competition for the first-grade treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"The Saint-Emperor's benevolence." The Crimson Radiance King's tone was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>He could hear that Lin Yuan truly intended to explain the methods of nourishing the bloodline. Normally, other Saint-Emperors would surely hide such secrets and keep them for themselves.</p><p></p><p>But the Silver River Saint-Emperor was so open about it, making the Crimson Radiance King feel ashamed.</p><p></p><p>After the Crimson Radiance King left, Lin Yuan began to re-examine the Martial Dao Evolution path.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan's modifications, the Martial Dao Evolution path suitable for propagation in this source world had basically abandoned the method of cultivating an inner cosmos.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it - in the Chaotic Void, many powerful experts could accept the infusion of the Primal Source and the gradual transformation of their inner worlds and inner cosmos. But in this source world, in the Six Great Ancient Kingdoms, the growth and transformation of inner worlds and inner cosmos was not so easy, and could not be popularized.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could still cultivate an inner cosmos in this world because he had already experienced it many times before, and was proficient in its opening, and his strength and resources were not lacking.</p><p></p><p>Even so, without the repeated infusions of the Primal Source in the Chaotic Void, Lin Yuan's inner cosmos was still weaker than the true body of his Primal Source Sovereign in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Scorching Sun Divine Body and the Scorching Sun Clan's blessings, the true body of the Sovereign in this source world would not be able to match the true body of the Sovereign in the Chaotic Void in terms of combat power.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the inner cosmos or the comprehension of the Dao rules, as long as the core does not change, it is the Martial Dao Evolution path. The more living beings that cultivate it, the more stable the anchors and guideposts will be for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, closing his eyes and entering cultivation and enlightenment once again.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

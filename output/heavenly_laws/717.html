        <h1>Chapter 717</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged in a desolate void, with tiny runes constantly condensing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Invisible timelines kept unfolding towards the future in his line of sight.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what it feels like to be a time-based lifeform? Peering into the future?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why time-based lifeforms rarely appeared or took action.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, it was because of their rarity. </p><p></p><p>Even in a dimensional space with perfect energy like the Origin World, the number of time-based lifeforms that ultimately emerged would not be too many.</p><p></p><p>The limitation in numbers made time-based lifeforms scarce, naturally resulting in fewer appearances and actions.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, for time-based lifeforms, there was no need to appear or take action at all. They could simply observe numerous future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Most of the time, apart from secluded cultivation, time-based lifeforms spent their time observing more and farther future timelines.</p><p></p><p>Unless they saw resources or opportunities useful to themselves, they would not meaninglessly appear or take action.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I'm ultimately not a true time-based lifeform. The timelines I can observe only extend up to 100,000 years at most, and I can't view many timelines simultaneously," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Through the way of runes, he had achieved something only time-based lifeforms could do, but at best it was a 'castrated version'.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, Lin Yuan's ability to observe his own future timelines was achieved through a 'shortcut' method.</p><p></p><p>Normal time-based lifeforms could observe future timelines due to their sufficiently high life essence.</p><p></p><p>If the future were compared to a maze, then time-based lifeforms would be positioned above the maze, able to overlook it. Naturally, they could see in advance which paths in the maze were dead ends and what obstacles lay in between.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan? His life essence had not reached the height to overlook the maze. The reason he could observe the future was through a method of briefly seeing through the maze walls.</p><p></p><p>His grasp and perception of future timelines naturally couldn't compare to true time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Lin Yuan was still very enthusiastic about observing his own future timelines.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"This timeline, the scene 30,000 years later is very obscure and distorted. Is it contact with other time-based lifeforms?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even for true time-based lifeforms, observing the future timelines of other time-based lifeforms at the same level would encounter great resistance.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan wasn't yet considered a time-based lifeform. In the future timelines he observed, once it involved time-based lifeforms, it would become extremely obscure, blurry, and distorted.</p><p></p><p>Only after passing this period did the timeline scenes gradually become normal and clear again.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the interaction with that time-based lifeform went well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated as he continued to observe further along the timeline.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>The future timeline reached 80,000 years later.</p><p></p><p>At this point, as Lin Yuan tried to observe even further into the future, it started to become difficult.</p><p></p><p>In this timeline, Lin Yuan's advancement to the thirteenth level was considered slightly late, becoming a time-based lifeform about 20,000 years later.</p><p></p><p>By 80,000 years later, Lin Yuan, who had already become a time-based lifeform, had long since begun exploring the mysterious dimensional interstices beyond the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>The dimensional interstices were the areas between vast dimensional spaces, fraught with dangers. Only massive individual lifeforms like time-based beings were qualified to roam here.</p><p></p><p>Below time-based lifeforms, some native lifeforms of the dimensional interstices might have some ability to survive.</p><p></p><p>As for lifeforms nurtured within dimensional spaces, they generally couldn't survive long in the dimensional interstices, as the environment there was simply too harsh.</p><p></p><p>In the 88,000th year, Lin Yuan, exploring the mysterious dimensional interstices, discovered a strange flower in a remote location that simultaneously contained yin and yang forces perfectly fused together.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed this timeline and learned the name of this extraordinary flower.</p><p></p><p>"This Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, with its perfectly fused yin and yang forces, would be of great help in reaching the third level of my Chaotic Taiji Way."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>88,000 years later, Lin Yuan's Chaotic Taiji Way had long since entered the third level, so even if he found this Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower then, it wouldn't have been of much use to Lin Yuan at that time.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Yuan's Chaotic Taiji Way had not yet entered the third level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in all the future timelines Lin Yuan had observed so far, his Chaotic Taiji Way entering the third level basically happened after becoming a time-based lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The transition from the second to the third level of the Chaotic Taiji Way represented a qualitative change in one's chaotic evolution path. It not only required insight but also sufficient accumulation, taking tens or hundreds of thousands of years to grind through.</p><p></p><p>"Let's look at a new timeline."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately began to observe a new future timeline.</p><p></p><p>In this timeline, Lin Yuan chose to immediately send out an avatar to the location of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower to retrieve this rare treasure in advance.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan continued to observe this timeline. With the power of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, he finally managed to elevate his Chaotic Taiji Way to the third level before advancing to the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>This was also the only future timeline Lin Yuan had seen so far where he entered the third level of the Chaotic Taiji Way before becoming a time-based lifeform.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes lit up, determined to obtain this rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan split off his Taiji primordial spirit and sent it towards the dimensional interstices, heading for the location of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower as seen in the future timeline.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched his primordial spirit leave, then continued to observe a few new future timelines. After confirming that his spirit had a high chance of successfully retrieving the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower was not of much use to other thirteenth-level time-based lifeforms following different paths.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it hadn't attracted the attention of thirteenth-level time-based lifeforms. In the few timelines Lin Yuan had observed, his avatar ultimately successfully retrieved the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, just a few timelines couldn't guarantee that he would definitely be able to retrieve the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, but the chances were certainly high, and there was no interference from other thirteenth-level time-based lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>"This is the method of time-based lifeforms."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't help but marvel. The most powerful aspect of time-based lifeforms was their ability to choose the future most beneficial to themselves.</p><p></p><p>For instance, without the ability to peer into the future, Lin Yuan probably wouldn't have been able to encounter such a rare treasure as the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower before advancing to the thirteenth level.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely by peering into the future that Lin Yuan was able to find a way to reach the third level of the Chaotic Taiji Way before the thirteenth level, and thus choose this future most beneficial to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The timelines I can observe now are still very short. Those true time-based lifeforms can observe timelines millions or billions of cosmic cycles into the future. The planning under those circumstances is truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He also became slightly aware of the way time and life struggle against each other.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the two time-lives that suddenly clashed had little grievance before their encounter.</p><p></p><p>But there would be great karmic consequences in the future, so they acted preemptively to clear obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Outside the chaotic void, Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"To be absolutely certain, I even sent out my Taiji Primordial Spirit," Lin Yuan thought. "In those few future timelines, I was able to successfully retrieve the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower by just sending an avatar. Now with my Taiji Primordial Spirit taking action, it should be even more secure."</p><p></p><p>This also showed Lin Yuan's emphasis on the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower. In the mysterious dimensional interstices, anything could happen, so naturally he had to make thorough preparations.</p><p></p><p>"That direction."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked in a certain direction and immediately headed there.</p><p></p><p>In the future timeline, he had discovered the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower tens of thousands of years after entering the thirteenth level, while casually wandering around.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the location of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower was not too far from the chaotic void. At Lin Yuan's Taiji Primordial Spirit's traveling speed, it would take about several hundred to a thousand years to reach it.</p><p></p><p>A round trip would take at most a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Enough time to return to the chaotic void before Lin Yuan's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>While traveling, Lin Yuan was naturally also contemplating the essence of the dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Lin Yuan explored the dimensional interstices, he had at most wandered around the periphery of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But now, he would need to move away from the chaotic void for some distance. Without the influence of the chaotic void, the dimensional interstices naturally gave Lin Yuan a different feeling.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious dimensional interstices and massive dimensional spaces like the chaotic void would naturally radiate influence on their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>But as Lin Yuan rapidly moved away from the chaotic void, this radiating influence gradually decreased, and the most authentic face of the mysterious dimensional interstices was revealed before Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Dimensional interstices..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sensed the empty aura of the dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The feeling the dimensional interstices gave Lin Yuan was emptiness.</p><p></p><p>Nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Eternal silence.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, there were numerous fluctuations of great Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>But the dimensional interstices had none, no fluctuations of any great Dao rules existed.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, for life forms born in the dimensional interstices, cultivation was an extremely difficult matter.</p><p></p><p>Because they could not sense any specific great Dao rule fluctuations, it was equivalent to having no guidance at all, and cultivation relied entirely on oneself.</p><p></p><p>In such an environment, it was simply a nightmare for cultivation and evolution.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time.</p><p></p><p>If one could grow up in such an environment.</p><p></p><p>Then they would inevitably become extremely powerful, far surpassing the limits of life forms within dimensional spaces like the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the environment of the dimensional interstices, the chaotic void was like a greenhouse.</p><p></p><p>"However, without the guidance of complete great Dao rules, although the combat power of life forms in the dimensional interstices is extremely strong, the probability of them ultimately becoming time-lives is very, very low," Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Strength and realm had no direct relation to the comprehension of great Dao rules.</p><p></p><p>And without the stable environment of dimensional spaces, many methods that were helpful for breaking through the time cycle were basically useless.</p><p></p><p>For example, spreading one's own evolutionary path?</p><p></p><p>Life forms in the dimensional interstices lived precariously from day to day. Spreading one's evolutionary path here? Probably those who tried to cultivate it would die and perish by nightfall after it was spread in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Therefore.</p><p></p><p>As far as Lin Yuan knew, the thirteenth-level time-lives were basically all from certain dimensional spaces, rather than from the fiercely competitive dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>During his journey.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also discovered some life forms of the dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>These life forms were extremely powerful, far surpassing the peerless great saints of the chaotic void, and even ordinary invincible great saints couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>But they were extremely cautious, trying their best to conceal their own auras.</p><p></p><p>In the dimensional interstices, there were only two situations where one would recklessly release their aura.</p><p></p><p>One was going mad, seeking death.</p><p></p><p>The other was being a thirteenth-level time-life.</p><p></p><p>Even in a cruel place like the dimensional interstices, thirteenth-level time-lives could roam freely with ease.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly, and the universe outside his body enveloped and covered everything. All life forms within range in the dimensional interstices fell into a brief slumber in their minds and consciousness, and their memories were silently replicated by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>So far, Lin Yuan's understanding of the intelligence and information about the dimensional interstices outside the chaotic void was still limited.</p><p></p><p>"In the memories of these dimensional interstice life forms, it's best to avoid the area near where the chaotic void is located if possible," Lin Yuan's expression was thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void was a vast dimensional space that had nurtured multiple time-lives, equivalent to the sphere of influence of time-lives. For native life forms of the dimensional interstices, this naturally belonged to the taboo of taboos.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Law Source Fruit Tree dared to approach the chaotic void was that it needed to absorb the aura of law and reason emanating from the chaotic void. It had no choice but to do so, already taking some risk.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the chaotic void, there are several other places that absolutely cannot be approached..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently memorized the locations in the memories of these native dimensional interstice life forms, speculating that they should be related to time-lives.</p><p></p><p>Massive dimensional spaces like the chaotic void would eventually enter a great destruction. What would the time-lives of the chaotic void do then? They could only leave the chaotic void and reside permanently in the dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>After the great destruction, even if the chaotic void re-evolved and was reborn, the time-lives from outside couldn't enter.</p><p></p><p>And for time-lives, massive dimensional spaces like the chaotic void were also like their lairs, so naturally they didn't want to lose them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the various thirteenth-level beings opened up special places to compensate for the hidden dangers and flaws of the chaotic void, extending the time and years that the chaotic void could continue to exist.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, several decades went by.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's traveling speed, the distance crossed in several decades was unimaginably long, already incredibly far from the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"I still can't sense the locations of the first source world and the second source world," Lin Yuan looked up at the boundless dimensional interstices.</p><p></p><p>He had true bodies stationed in both the first and second source worlds. In theory, no matter how far apart, he should be able to sense them, but now, Lin Yuan's perception of the true bodies in these two source worlds could still only be accessed through the Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the locations of these two source worlds are special, able to block sensing?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan speculated in his heart, not paying too much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>The more mysterious the source worlds were, the more it proved that the coordinates of the remaining thirty-one source worlds in the depths of his mind's Gate of Ten Thousand Worlds were rare.</p><p></p><p>For time-lives, any powerful dimensional space was extremely precious, especially source worlds. Even the Lord of Heavenly Light paid a heavy price to merge into a source world, wanting to rely on that trace of perfect aura to make the final breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan continued heading towards the location of the Yin-Yang Dual Life Flower, his expression suddenly changed, and he looked in another direction.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

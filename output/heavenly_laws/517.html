        <h1>Chapter 517</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two ultimate true forms of the Calamity Clan emerged, showing unprecedented respect for the Galactic Lord.</p><p></p><p>Normally, at least one of the two ultimates of the Calamity Clan would need to remain inside the wooden cabin. But now, with Lin Yuan's arrival, both ultimates appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This wooden cabin must be what you rely on to survive each universal cataclysm, right?" Lin Yuan asked with a smile, while carefully observing the cabin.</p><p></p><p>The wooden cabin looked ordinary and unremarkable, but every detail of its structure contained infinite power, with chaotic energy permeating inside.</p><p></p><p>"That's correct. This wooden cabin is the ultimate foundation of our Calamity Clan. Back then, our ancestors specially crafted these types of cabins to maintain the continuation of our clan, integrating them into the universe and leaving a branch of our lineage within the universe," the Calamity Clan ultimate standing on the left explained frankly. </p><p></p><p>In their minds, Lin Yuan was the reincarnation of a peerless great sage. Having crossed into the 12th level, he must have awakened some memories. Even if they didn't say it, he could deduce it.</p><p></p><p>"That's quite prudent," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic void, what is the safest place? The chaotic continent? </p><p>Hidden realms?</p><p>Or the cave dwellings of chaotic great sages? No.</p><p>None of those.</p><p></p><p>Even the cave dwellings and dao fields left behind by peerless great sages among the chaotic great sages cannot exist eternally. They will eventually collapse one day.</p><p></p><p>If not collapsing on their own, they will be breached by external forces, or taken over by great sages of the same level.</p><p></p><p>But what about the universe?</p><p></p><p>The chaotic void nurtures countless universes, each connected to the origin of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Universes can be affected by external forces. For example, attacks at the great sage level are enough to make a universe enter the great cataclysm prematurely. </p><p></p><p>But the so-called great cataclysm is merely the way the universe cycles. After the great cataclysm comes rebirth, and the universe itself still exists.</p><p></p><p>Even peerless great sages cannot erase a universe from its roots. Trying to do so would be no different from opposing the chaotic void itself. Even 13th level time beings would have to pay a terrible price, forever losing the chance to become perfect time beings.</p><p></p><p>And universes prohibit outside life from entering, which results in a low upper limit of strength within universes, making them extremely safe compared to the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>Back then, Emperor Xuanhuang opened 33,333 Xuanhuang secret realms, scattered randomly in universe after universe with no rules, ensuring that his own lineage had almost no possibility of being cut off.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Xuanhuang secret realm in one universe encountered an accident, what are the chances of all 33,333 Xuanhuang secret realms in 33,333 universes encountering accidents? The possibility exists, but is terrifyingly low.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Xuanhuang himself doesn't even know the exact locations of these 33,333 Xuanhuang secret realms. Even if a peerless great sage of the same level wanted to cut off Emperor Xuanhuang's lineage, could they search universe after universe? The chaotic void nurtures countless universes, like the relationship between the ocean and a drop of seawater. Even peerless great sages cannot traverse every corner of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>With the Calamity Clan forever hiding within the universe, although their upper limit is fixed at the peak of the Path-Opening Realm, at least they face no danger of extinction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to the Calamity Clan ultimate, the current Calamity Clan belongs to a branch of a powerful force in the chaotic void, specially used to prevent the force's lineage from being cut off.</p><p></p><p>"Which force did your ancestors come from?" Lin Yuan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>To be able to arrange methods within universes, they must be at least at the level of chaotic great sages, like the Xuanhuang secret realms opened by Emperor Xuanhuang?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either," the Calamity Clan ultimate on the right shook his head and said, "There are seals deep in our bloodline. The memories of our ancestors are all sealed. Only by leaving the universe and entering the chaotic void will the seals be removed."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>According to the messages left by the Xuanhuang lineage and the master of the Demon Jade Tower, this was also a standard arrangement for forces at the great sage level.</p><p></p><p>"If our Calamity Clan gives birth to a new 12th level being in this universe era, we can bring some of our clansmen out of the universe during the universal cataclysm and head to the chaotic void. The clan within the universe will then be handed over to the newly born 12th level being," the Calamity Clan ultimate on the left explained.</p><p></p><p>Their ancestors had similar arrangements in many universes.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Lord, if you're willing, we can help some humans survive into the next universe era this time. Of course, in the next universe era, they will face the aversion of the universe consciousness," said the Calamity Clan ultimate on the right.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan was truly the reincarnation of some great sage, he could help human civilization survive universe era after universe era even without relying on the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>This ultimate of the Calamity Clan said this purely to curry favor with Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see about that when the time comes," Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>It was too far away from the next universe era now, and Lin Yuan also had methods to survive to the next universe era, namely the Xuanhuang secret realms.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang secret realms coexist with the universe, and their ingenuity surpasses even this wooden cabin of the Calamity Clan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether it's the wooden cabin or the Xuanhuang secret realms, any life that survives to the next universe era will be targeted by the universe consciousness itself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"If the Galactic Lord has any needs when the time comes, just let us know."</p><p></p><p>The two Calamity Clan ultimates looked at each other and immediately said.</p><p></p><p>In a certain area of space at the edge of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The figures of dozens of 12th level ultimates descended.</p><p></p><p>"The meaning of the Xuanyuan supreme being of human civilization is that if we want to sue for peace, we must offer up 90% of our 12th level weapons, artifacts, and treasures, and finally live in the area designated by human civilization," the Universe Clan ultimate said with an ugly expression, conveying the decision of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Offer up 90% of our 12th level weapons, artifacts, and treasures? Isn't human civilization being too arrogant?" </p><p></p><p>"Does the Galactic Lord think</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Completely dominate us? Indeed, we cannot contend with the Galaxy Star Lord at the peak of Path Breaking realm, but if we hide inside our clan's supreme weapons, how could the Galaxy Star Lord do anything to us?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, hiding inside the clan's supreme weapons, what does it matter if he's at the peak of Path Breaking realm?" Many of the 12th stage Ultimates were extremely indignant. Hiding inside the clan weapons to barely survive was a last resort. If possible, they still hoped to be able to live under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>This would also be best for their respective clans.</p><p></p><p>Although the space inside the clan weapons was vast, it was only space. Compared to the universe that could nurture countless lives, it was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>If a clan reproduced within the space of a weapon for a long time, the potential and talents of the clan members would plummet, with basically no possibility of reaching the 12th stage.</p><p></p><p>But handing over 90% of their 12th stage weapons, treasures and rarities? This demand was too much.</p><p></p><p>Some of the cold-blooded 12th stage Ultimates would never agree to this demand.</p><p></p><p>Not every 12th stage Ultimate cared about the future generations of their clan. Many 12th stage Ultimates only cared about themselves.</p><p></p><p>Handing over 90% of their 12th stage weapons, armaments, treasures and rarities? This would have an extreme impact on themselves. When the universe faced its great destruction, facing endless annihilation, losing their main weapons would greatly reduce their chances of surviving.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were lucky enough to make it to the Chaos Void, how would they defend against dangers from all directions without their weapons?</p><p></p><p>"I disagree."</p><p></p><p>"I disagree as well."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the 12th stage Ultimates stated their positions. They would rather watch their clans be destroyed than hand over their personal weapons and treasures.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the remaining 12th stage Ultimates also lost their desire for peace.</p><p></p><p>They cared greatly about the future of their clans, but the human civilization's demands were too extreme. How could they hand over all their foundations without getting anything in return?</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then we shall test our strength against the human civilization and the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Universe Clan Ultimate spoke, "Next, I suggest all the major clans gather together and concentrate all our power to resist the Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"Let's do it."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone bring your clan's 12th stage weapons, activate the clan's supreme weapons and foundation weapons. Let's show that Galaxy Star Lord that we're not to be bullied at will."</p><p></p><p>Many 12th stage Ultimates said.</p><p></p><p>They didn't seek to contend with the Galaxy Star Lord, but as long as they could barely withstand his attacks, they would have leverage to negotiate with the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In the territory of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Inside the majestic palace of Base No. 3.</p><p></p><p>The ten supreme beings of human civilization were casually conversing.</p><p></p><p>"What we call space-time essentially originates from one entity," Lin Yuan calmly said.</p><p></p><p>Although he was conversing with the nine supreme beings of human civilization, he was essentially instructing them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's comprehension of the laws was too high. Even those at the Sovereign realm couldn't compare to him.</p><p></p><p>"Space-time." Supreme Being Xia Qin and the others seemed to have some insights. They had been stuck at the sixth level of space-time for a long time. Now listening to instructions from someone at the seventh level of space-time had a great impact on them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Supreme Being Xuanyuan's expression changed slightly as he looked at Lin Yuan and said, "Galaxy Star Lord, the alien races have given their response."</p><p></p><p>"What did they say?"</p><p></p><p>"Did those 12th stage aliens agree?"</p><p></p><p>The other eight supreme beings immediately became interested. At this moment, the human civilization held absolute dominance, which made all the supreme beings feel extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>Since the beginning of the Starry Sea Calendar, when had the human civilization ever been so triumphant in their wars against the top-tier clans?</p><p></p><p>"They refused."</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xuanyuan shook his head. He wasn't surprised by this response.</p><p></p><p>To be fair, if he were in the position of the alien races, he wouldn't so obediently hand over 90% of their 12th stage weapons, armaments, treasures and rarities either.</p><p></p><p>"They refused?"</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll beat them until they agree."</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord, when do you want us to take action?"</p><p></p><p>Supreme Being Xia Qin and the others immediately spoke up, looking towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan smiled slightly, then stood up and took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The universe rumbled as thousands of laws gathered, forming a grand celestial path that penetrated everything, crossing countless star regions and connecting to a certain place at the edge of space.</p><p></p><p>This celestial path formed by numerous laws was too dazzling. Starting from the east, it majestically spanned half the universe, reaching the area of space where dozens of 12th stage Ultimates were gathered.</p><p></p><p>"What is that? I sense so many law auras. A path paved by infinite laws?"</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be? Even 12th stage Ultimates couldn't gather so many laws!"</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Star Lord. One end of the path is in human civilization territory. The Galaxy Star Lord is about to take action."</p><p></p><p>Throughout the universe, countless powerful beings were shocked. They quickly realized who was the source of this path. Among the 12th stage Ultimates in the universe, who else but the Galaxy Star Lord could achieve this?</p><p></p><p>"The other end of the path is at the edge of the universe, where the top-tier clans have retreated to?"</p><p></p><p>A celestial path paved by infinite laws appeared without any concealment, representing absolute strength and dominance.</p><p></p><p>All powerful beings vaguely saw a majestic figure flash across the celestial path in an instant, arriving at the end of the path, in that remote area of space.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Star Lord."</p><p></p><p>All living beings in the universe, even first and second stage lifeforms, felt the vast aura belonging to the Galaxy Star Lord.</p><p></p><p>Blood energy like an ocean flooded half the universe, patrolling the stars, with all races bowing in worship.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are they fleeing?" Lin Yuan gazed into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The black ship and floating island were constantly traversing through the void, with a sense of hasty escape.</p><p></p><p>"Are these two little ones the plunderers guarding outside the universe?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind worked at an incredible speed, immediately deducing the origins of the other party. </p><p></p><p>For no reason, guarding outside the universe, and fleeing like this after seeing him come out - what else could they be but plunderers?</p><p></p><p>"Come back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred slightly, and his divine ability 'World' activated.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, with Lin Yuan at the center, a radius of 20 million light years all turned into an external universe.</p><p></p><p>On the black ship, Blood Blessing Overlord only slightly relaxed after traveling over 10 million light years.</p><p></p><p>"We survived." A faint smile appeared on Blood Blessing Overlord's face as he looked back. Even at such a great distance, Blood Blessing Overlord could still vaguely see the other's towering figure.</p><p></p><p>"At this distance, even if he wants to pursue and kill us, it's too late."</p><p></p><p>Before Blood Blessing Overlord could finish his thoughts,</p><p></p><p>He saw brand new space-time suddenly envelop from all directions.</p><p></p><p>In a daze,</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Overlord faintly heard a voice in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Come back."</p><p></p><p>By the time Blood Blessing Overlord regained consciousness, he was already in a familiar void, which was just outside the universe he had been guarding earlier.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Overlord's mood instantly sank to the bottom. He glanced around and discovered that Snake Demon Overlord was also not far away.</p><p></p><p>The two Overlord-level powerhouses fled in completely opposite directions, but were teleported back in almost the same amount of time. Blood Blessing Overlord had only seen such abilities from some Venerables before.</p><p></p><p>Just a Venerable? No matter how inconceivable it seemed, Blood Blessing Overlord associated that towering giant with a Chaos Venerable, even though this towering giant had walked out from inside a universe, which theoretically could only produce peak Path-breaking Realm beings.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Blessing."</p><p></p><p>Not far away, Snake Demon Overlord's expression was terrified, clearly also realizing something.</p><p></p><p>"Were you two planning to plunder me?" At this moment, a voice came from the side.</p><p></p><p>Snake Demon Overlord and Blood Blessing Overlord looked over sharply, discovering a figure standing not far away. This figure's aura was ethereal, and the two of them couldn't sense even a trace of it, which was why they hadn't noticed it all along.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Overlord immediately reacted, respectfully saying to Lin Yuan: "I was just passing by here, absolutely no intention of plundering."</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>Snake Demon Overlord hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>At this point, how could they not understand that the figure not far away was the towering giant that had just walked out from inside the universe.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos void, the weak are prey to the strong. No matter how much confusion and doubt Blood Blessing Overlord and Snake Demon Overlord had in their hearts, facing an existence like Lin Yuan who could easily crush them, respect was an instinctive behavior.</p><p></p><p>"Just passing by here?"</p><p></p><p>"No intention of plundering?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made no comment, naturally not believing such words. The chaos void was boundless, how could two Overlord-level powerhouses happen to be guarding in front of a universe about to be destroyed just by passing by?</p><p></p><p>"Look at me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards Snake Demon Overlord and Blood Blessing Overlord.</p><p></p><p>The two Overlords followed Lin Yuan's voice and looked over, only to see a pair of extremely deep eyes that seemed to connect to an endless abyss.</p><p></p><p>Mental Will Secret Technique - Eyes of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Buzz buzz buzz.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Overlord and Snake Demon Overlord's mental wills were impacted, beginning to fall uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's strength, he could have completely crushed these two Overlords in an instant when using his divine ability 'World'.</p><p></p><p>But in the end he chose to capture them alive, with the purpose of this moment.</p><p></p><p>Using the mental will secret technique 'Eyes of the Abyss' to make their minds fall, and then taking the opportunity to search the souls of these two Overlords.</p><p></p><p>This was also the most effortless method. Directly searching souls was too difficult, and the two Overlords weren't fools - they would definitely resist desperately. Even if they ultimately couldn't resist, they would unhesitatingly self-destruct their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>Then use resurrection methods they had prepared in advance to resurrect.</p><p></p><p>For powerhouses of any level, memory was the most precious domain. Unless there was truly no way out, no powerhouse would be willing to let someone search their soul for memories.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”" Blood Blessing Overlord's pupils suddenly turned blood red, and his physical body's aura began to surge. He actually managed to break free from Lin Yuan's restraints and suppression, frantically fleeing in another direction.</p><p></p><p>"He blocked my soul search?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed inwardly. He was ultimately only a Path-breaking Realm being. Although many of his abilities had reached the Chaos Realm level, trying to search the soul of a peak Overlord Realm being?</p><p></p><p>It was still somewhat difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan couldn't be bothered to keep trying. He directly reached out his right hand and, separated by hundreds of light years, struck Blood Blessing Overlord from afar.</p><p></p><p>For this slap, Lin Yuan used his physical body's power and the power of the universe within his body. Its might far surpassed peak Overlord Realm. Countless blood lights flashed around Blood Blessing Overlord's body, only resisting for an instant before shattering completely. His physical body and soul were annihilated simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Snake Demon Overlord also barely regained consciousness and fled without hesitation in another direction. Even facing a Venerable, he was unwilling to have his memories searched.</p><p></p><p>Since memories could be searched, they could also be altered and influenced. This kind of ability was extremely vigilant to any powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Smack.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan slapped out again, and Snake Demon Overlord's physical body and soul also began to be annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies and souls of the two Overlords, after several breaths of annihilation, turned into the purest origin power, which was condensed and then collected by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, please spare us."</p><p></p><p>Pleas for mercy came from the black ship and floating island, from Blood Blessing Overlord and Snake Demon Overlord's subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Spare you?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>These subordinates followed the two Overlords, guarding outside the universe ready to plunder.</p><p></p><p>Since they wanted to plunder others, naturally they had to be prepared to be plundered themselves.</p><p></p><p>Because Lin Yuan's own strength was strong enough, Blood Blessing Overlord and Snake Demon Overlord turned and ran without a second word, looking extremely innocent.</p><p></p><p>But what if Lin Yuan was just an ordinary 12th level Path-breaking Realm being? After exhausting all efforts to barely survive the great destruction of the universe, originally thinking a brand new future awaited, but instead facing cruel plunderers.</p><p></p><p>At that time, these plunderers wouldn't have any sympathy for Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze swept over, using the mental will secret technique 'Eyes of the Abyss'. Searching the souls of Overlord Realm powerhouses was quite difficult, but searching the souls of these Path-breaking Realm beings was relatively simple.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Blessing Overlord? Snake Demon Overlord?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately obtained information and intelligence on these two Overlords. They were both notorious Overlord-level powerhouses. Although their reputations weren't good, they were extremely powerful. Even Snake Demon Overlord possessed strength approaching peak Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"These treasures..."</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the many subordinates of the two Overlords, Lin Yuan began to take stock of the spoils.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan was slightly surprised - the spoils from the two Overlords were truly too abundant. Blood Blessing Overlord wielded two Chaos Realm secret treasures, one for attack and one for defense, plus other treasures and rarities.</p><p></p><p>The total value exceeded 600,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>As for Snake Demon Overlord, he also had two Chaos Realm secret treasures, but his other treasures and rarities were slightly inferior, adding up to about 500,000 chaos stones in value.</p><p></p><p>The two Overlord Realm powerhouses contributed over 1 million chaos stones worth of treasures to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Too wealthy."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sighed slightly. Even for a peak Overlord Realm powerhouse like 'Cang Wei Yang', his entire fortune was only between 300,000 to 400,000 chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, plundering is the simplest way to obtain resources." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Overlord was a notorious plunderer, guarding in front of his home universe. He had already plundered quite a few universes, and combined with his previous accumulations, his entire fortune was naturally incomparable to 'Cang Wei Yang'.</p><p></p><p>Although Snake Demon Overlord was slightly weaker, through plundering methods, he had also accumulated more wealth than 'Cang Wei Yang'.</p><p></p><p>"The resources for 12th level Overlord Realm perfection 'Xuanhuang Body' are almost gathered."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan estimated briefly. The 1 million chaos stones worth of resources contributed by the two Overlords, plus what he had left over from before, was enough to cultivate the body refining secret technique 'Xuanhuang Body' to Overlord Realm perfection.</p><p></p><p>When 'Xuanhuang Body' reached Overlord Realm perfection, the strength of Lin Yuan's physical body would surge again, and the power in his every move would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>And with the physical body nurturing the soul and mental will, the strengthening of the physical body also had many benefits for improving the soul and mental will.</p><p></p><p>"Without realizing it, I've already become this powerful?" Lin Yuan thought to himself as he finished organizing the spoils and put away the black ship and floating island.</p><p></p><p>When he first explored the chaos void, even just a cave dwelling left behind by the Overlord Realm 'Cang Wei Yang' required extreme caution and vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And now, how much time has passed? Blood Blessing Sovereign and Snake Demon Sovereign, who were basically on the same level as "Cang Wei Yang", could now be easily suppressed by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>The contrast between before and after made Lin Yuan deeply emotional.</p><p></p><p>"These two sovereigns, and those peak Realm-Opening stage subordinates, haven't completely died? They have life-saving measures in place?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan briefly sensed along the karmic connections.</p><p></p><p>This was also normal. Even for those just entering the Realm-Opening stage, let alone those at the peak, they could arrange life-saving measures.</p><p></p><p>Why were Chaos Venerable Ones so difficult to kill? It was because even someone as powerful as a Chaos Great Saint would find it hard to destroy all of a Venerable One's life-saving measures.</p><p></p><p>However, with a Chaos Venerable One's comprehension of karma, they could, if willing, destroy all the life-saving measures of a Sovereign realm powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>This was why Sovereign realm powerhouses were so cautious in front of Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>Inside a fragment meteorite floating in the chaos void, a figure quickly coalesced - it was Blood Blessing Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>He had left a life-saving measure in this fragment meteorite. As long as his true body perished, he could be revived here.</p><p></p><p>"I actually died at the hands of a Venerable One." Blood Blessing Sovereign felt a chill in his heart. At this moment, he didn't have extra energy to wonder why a Venerable One would come out from inside a universe.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to die."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign was utterly desperate. If a Chaos Venerable One was willing, they could completely erase all his revival measures through karmic connections.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at the moment of revival, Blood Blessing Sovereign was already prepared to die completely.</p><p></p><p>After waiting in despair for half a day, Blood Blessing Sovereign found that he hadn't died.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Venerable One disdaining to kill me?" Blood Blessing Sovereign let out a heavy sigh of relief. It was also quite troublesome for a Chaos Venerable One to erase all the life-saving measures of a Sovereign realm powerhouse through karma.</p><p></p><p>If there wasn't some grudge, Chaos Venerable Ones usually couldn't be bothered to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go, go, leave this void immediately."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign flew out without hesitation, then sped away in a direction far from Lin Yuan's location.</p><p></p><p>The karmic connection between him and Lin Yuan would become blurred as the distance increased. In Blood Blessing Sovereign's eyes, he was like an ant to a Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>If unseen, naturally they wouldn't bother to act, but if the karmic distance was very close, who knows, Lin Yuan might remember one day and casually kill him through karma.</p><p></p><p>So, to live longer, Blood Blessing Sovereign could only stay far away from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Go, go, go, never approach this void again."</p><p></p><p>Blood Blessing Sovereign's thoughts spread out, feeling both lucky and fearful.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos void.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan quietly gazed at his home universe. As it completely collapsed, the entire universe suddenly contracted, presenting itself as a grayish gas cluster.</p><p></p><p>This gas cluster looked extremely fragile, but in reality, it was indestructible, protected by the operation of the chaos void's rules. Even a peerless Great Saint couldn't damage it in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to head to the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent."</p><p></p><p>After seeing off his home universe for the last time, Lin Yuan turned and left directly.</p><p></p><p>He had long prepared a new home for the human civilization on the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent. Now he just needed to go there.</p><p></p><p>Several months later.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Finally here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards that incredibly prosperous Chaos Continent in the distance.</p><p></p><p>After the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent moved to this void, trade actually became even more prosperous, attracting many powerful beings from the surrounding areas to come and go.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan concealed his aura. The thirteenth-level inheritance "Infinite Void" was an unparalleled foundational inheritance, forging an internal universe that was unmatched in the world. With just a thought, Lin Yuan could conceal all his aura, making it difficult even for a Chaos Venerable One to detect.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered the Star Tears 'fragment world'.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his right hand, and the nine supreme experts of human civilization came out from his internal universe.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme expert cautiously surveyed the surroundings, only relaxing when he saw Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they were in Lin Yuan's internal universe, truly worried about many things, fearing that because of them, they would affect Lin Yuan's passage through the great destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing Lin Yuan, that suspended star in their hearts finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>"This is the new home of human civilization."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said with a smile, introducing it to the nine supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>"New home?"</p><p></p><p>"The new home of our human civilization?"</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan supreme expert, Xia Qin supreme expert, and the other seven supreme experts immediately began to observe.</p><p></p><p>"This place..."</p><p></p><p>The nine human civilization supreme experts were increasingly satisfied. Although the area of the Star Tears fragment world was far less than that of the main universe, every corner was habitable. Even if the number of human civilization citizens increased tenfold or a hundredfold, it could still accommodate them.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that this world is emanating an extremely gentle power."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qin supreme expert's expression was thoughtful. This gentle power was basically useless to them at the twelfth-level Realm-Opening stage, and even for ninth, tenth, and eleventh-level evolvers, the effect wasn't great.</p><p></p><p>But for third and fourth-level evolvers, especially for those human citizens who had just been born, it had an extremely great nurturing effect.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, this place, it shouldn't be cheap, right?" Xia Qin supreme expert asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few hundred years, he had also discussed the matter of a new home for human civilization with Lin Yuan, and understood the market price of 'fragment worlds'.</p><p></p><p>This Star Tears 'fragment world' before them, in terms of size and environment, was definitely top-tier among top-tier. </p><p></p><p>Plus, it was within the protective array range of the Ancient Ming Chaos Continent, under the protection of Ancient Ming Venerable One. The price definitely wouldn't be cheap. Even if Xia Qin supreme expert didn't understand the market, he knew that the Star Tears 'fragment world' probably far exceeded human civilization's budget.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan waved his hand, saying unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>This 'fragment world' was completely obtained for free, so naturally Lin Yuan wouldn't directly ask Xuanyuan supreme expert for 1.2 million chaos stones.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ownership of the Star Tears 'fragment world' was under his name, belonging to Lin Yuan's private property. It was simple to vacate part of the area for human civilization citizens to live in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lin Yuan didn't answer.</p><p></p><p>The nine supreme experts of human civilization, including Xuanyuan supreme expert, became increasingly certain of their assets, believing that this 'fragment world' was bought by Lin Yuan through frugal living, and he might even have taken on a certain amount of 'loans'.</p><p></p><p>"This 'fragment world', our human civilization can't afford to repay now, but we absolutely can't not repay, nor can we live here for free. As long as we nine twelfth-level experts work a bit harder, save up more chaos stones, bit by bit, if we can't gather enough in one universe era, then two universe eras, three universe eras."</p><p></p><p>Xuanyuan supreme expert and the other eight supreme experts exchanged glances, making up their minds.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization already owed Lin Yuan too much. If it weren't for Lin Yuan, human civilization would have been directly wiped out in this great destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Now not only were they not wiped out, but they were injected into such a perfect new home. Xuanyuan supreme expert naturally didn't want to just keep taking from Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>After discussing with the nine human civilization supreme experts for a while, Lin Yuan began to transfer the countless citizens from his internal universe to the Star Tears 'fragment world'.</p><p></p><p>"Is this where we'll live in the future?"</p><p></p><p>A third-level evolver curiously surveyed the surroundings. Compared to the scene in the universe where countless planets hung in the starry sky, this world was a whole, and was filled with a certain aura that made his mind and spirit joyful.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>More and more human citizens were transferred to the Star Tears 'fragment world', and at the same time, a large number of intelligent machines landed, beginning the construction work for human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Although the Star Tears 'fragment world' had a superior environment, it was too primitive. Naturally, it needed to be transformed to adapt to the current lifestyle of human civilization citizens.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, Xuanyuan supreme expert, and Xia Qin supreme expert looked down from afar at the Star Tears 'fragment world', where countless intelligent machines and human citizens worked hand in hand, carrying out bustling construction.</p><p></p><p>"At most in a few months, a suitable living environment can be built. After half a year, everything will be on track. Within two years, the virtual network world will be fully laid out. By then, there will be no difference from living in the universe."</p><p></p><p>Yu Die supreme expert said. The reconstruction project of human civilization had been fully rehearsed, and basically no problems would occur.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, human civilization will take root in this world." Gu Li supreme expert's face showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Human civilization is also about to enter a new era, an era that connects with the chaos void." Xu Shen supreme expert also said beside them.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>New home, new era.</p><p></p><p>The history of human civilization would enter a brand new era.</p><p></p><p>The 2.61 million years of Starry Sea Calendar had completely become the past.</p><p></p><p>PS: 10,000 word update, begging for monthly tickets~</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This grab tore open the chaos, tore open the space-time, and reached towards the Venerable Nine Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" The Venerable Nine Mysteries felt inexplicable fear.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing the collapse and destruction of a region spanning millions of light-years just now, the Venerable Nine Mysteries had never experienced such fear originating from the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>He will be torn open.</p><p>He will be shattered.</p><p></p><p>Such thoughts surged in the Venerable Nine Mysteries' mind.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, there was puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Who is it? </p><p>Who is striking at him? In the moment this grab reached towards the Venerable Nine Mysteries, he had already established a causal connection with its source.</p><p></p><p>Dimly, the Venerable Nine Mysteries saw a scene -</p><p></p><p>Beyond the layers of space-time.</p><p></p><p>A young man was slowly withdrawing his right hand, and the void still retained the five ultimate tear-the-sky forces.</p><p></p><p>And beside the young man, Cang Yu Long was standing there, his stone person tribe expression completely dazed as he looked at the former.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Nine Mysteries did not pay any attention to Cang Yu Long, through the brief causal connection, he stared at the young man who had unleashed the tear-the-sky grab.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Nine Mysteries immediately determined that the young man who struck at him was also Lin Yuan, the two sharing the same causal origin.</p><p></p><p>"The one I'm fighting against is not your true body?" </p><p></p><p>The Venerable Nine Mysteries found it unbelievable. He could sense that the young man standing beside Cang Yu Long, both in terms of physical prowess and spiritual pressure, surpassed the Taiji Primordial Spirit that had just fought with him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>The tear-the-sky grab descended.</p><p></p><p>Ripping.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate tear-the-sky force easily tore open the Venerable Nine Mysteries' surrounding spatial barriers, then his skin, flesh, bones, and the universe within his body.</p><p></p><p>All of the Venerable Nine Mysteries' physical body, spirit, and even mental will,</p><p></p><p>were torn open and shattered by this ultimate tear-the-sky grab, without any ability to resist,</p><p></p><p>not even able to barely delay the time of being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Crashing.</p><p></p><p>In the moment his physical body and spirit were torn open, a vigorous vitality surged forth from within the Venerable Nine Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>But every time it recovered a bit, it would be torn open again by the remaining tear-the-sky force,</p><p></p><p>back and forth, and in the Venerable Nine Mysteries' despair and unwillingness, his physical body, spirit, and the universe within were finally completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Not far away.</p><p></p><p>The Taiji Primordial Spirit silently watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>"My true body fully unleashed the tear-the-sky grab, its might indeed surpassing the 'World' divine ability."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself,</p><p></p><p>The 'World' divine ability and the 'Tear-the-Sky' divine ability are both considered offensive divine abilities, but the 'Tear-the-Sky' is much purer.</p><p></p><p>The 'World' divine ability still has suppression and other effects, but the 'Tear-the-Sky' does not.</p><p></p><p>And when the 'World' divine ability is detonated, the destructive force it releases is scattered over a region of millions of light-years, so its might is naturally inferior to 'Tear-the-Sky'.</p><p></p><p>The might of 'Tear-the-Sky' is fully concentrated in that one grab.</p><p></p><p>Humming.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Venerable Nine Mysteries' physical body, spirit, and the universe within were torn apart, nine auras coalesced beside him again, the nine auras converging to form the figure of the Venerable Nine Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>However, this Venerable Nine Mysteries, compared to the previous one, had plummeted greatly in terms of aura and pressure.</p><p></p><p>This plummet was not like the temporary one after Lin Yuan detonated the 'World' divine ability, but one that would require long ages to recover from.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't die?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed slightly, but he was not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerable's life-saving methods were not to be underestimated, and Lin Yuan was only at the Parting the Dao Realm, so at most he could heavily injure a Venerable with the 'Tear-the-Sky' divine ability.</p><p></p><p>As for killing? It would be quite difficult, especially since this was the newly ascended Chaotic Realm Venerable Nine Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan advanced to the Chaotic Realm, at the same level, unleashing the 'Tear-the-Sky' divine ability, not only the Venerable Nine Mysteries, even those peak Chaotic Realm Venerables would die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he doesn't even need to reach the Chaotic Realm, as long as Lin Yuan advances to the Sovereign Realm, with his life essence elevated, and his various inherited and cultivated methods perfected, under the 'Tear-the-Sky' grab, the Venerable Nine Mysteries would basically be doomed, at least this physical body would die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's do it again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Taiji Primordial Spirit took a step forward, after a brief rest, he had basically recovered, the consumption from detonating the 'World' divine ability had been completely restored, and his combat power had returned to its peak state.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>The weakened Venerable Nine Mysteries' complexion turned slightly pale, and he immediately said, "No need to spar anymore, I concede."</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Venerable Nine Mysteries was already heavily injured, continuing to fight would no longer be sparring, but a fight to the death, exhausting all his trump cards and methods.</p><p></p><p>A fight to the death?</p><p></p><p>To fight to the death for a Great Saint-level inheritance space, against a Venerable of the same realm, the Venerable Nine Mysteries would carefully consider it, let alone the current situation.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was willing to fight to the death, most likely he would still lose in the end, just this Taiji Primordial Spirit of Lin Yuan's had already forced him to exert himself to the limit, and the true body was even stronger, ready to strike at any moment. The Venerable Nine Mysteries felt his chances of winning were extremely slim.</p><p></p><p>Although even if he lost the fight to the death in the end, the Venerable Nine Mysteries would not die completely, </p><p></p><p>he had prepared many life-saving methods in other hidden locations, and if this true body perished, he would 'revive' from those methods.</p><p></p><p>But the many investments in this true body, as well as the personal weapons, treasures, and rare items, would all be lost.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan definitely would not return all those treasures to him.</p><p></p><p>"Concede?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately stopped, he also did not want to completely force a Chaotic Realm Venerable into a corner, who knows what other methods he still had not used.</p><p></p><p>The most critical thing was, in this Myriad Manifestation Void Domain, there were other Chaotic Realm Venerables, and at this moment, the gaze of most Chaotic Realm Venerables were focused on their battle.</p><p></p><p>If it was just a sparring, and neither side suffered significant injuries, those Chaotic Realm Venerables would naturally have no thoughts.</p><p></p><p>But if Lin Yuan was heavily injured?</p><p></p><p>As an outsider Venerable? Lin Yuan could not guarantee that the local Void Domain's Venerables would not strike.</p><p></p><p>And Lin Yuan was also not sure whether the Venerable Nine Mysteries had any other Venerable friends, what if they saw the Venerable Nine Mysteries fighting Lin Yuan and also joined in? One against two? With all his trump cards and true body and primordial spirit deployed, Lin Yuan was confident he could overcome the newly ascended Venerable Nine Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>But against one versus two?</p><p></p><p>There would be too many variables.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>the moment the Venerable Nine Mysteries conceded, Lin Yuan had no intention of continuing to strike.</p><p></p><p>His purpose in this battle had also been achieved, he had thoroughly subdued the Venerable Nine Mysteries, and even if the latter was still unwilling, he would have to consider whether he was truly Lin Yuan's match.</p><p></p><p>"Conceded?"</p><p></p><p>Beyond the layers of space-time, Lin Yuan's true body directly left.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Twelfth-Grade Extraordinary Chaotic Treasure Chaos Tree, and a Great Saint-level inheritance space,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan, after careful consideration, felt that merely dispatching the Taiji Primordial Spirit was still a bit risky.</p><p></p><p>So the true body also came over, hiding in the shadows to observe.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the Venerable Nine Mysteries endure the detonation of the 'World' divine ability, the true body then seized the opportunity to strike with the 'Tear-the-Sky' grab.</p><p></p><p>With the true body's primordial spirit fully deployed, the risk was higher, but after confirming the value of that inheritance space, Lin Yuan still did this.</p><p></p><p>Now that the sparring was over, the true body naturally had no need to remain here.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at Cang Yu Long one last time.</p><p></p><p>With the true body present, Lin Yuan had finally fully captured the fluctuation of the other consciousness hidden within Cang Yu Long's body.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a backup prepared by some Great Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan associated it with the mysterious inheritance space, this space was clearly created by a Great Saint, and Cang Yu Long had entered it before, so he should have some opportunities there.</p><p></p><p>Until Lin Yuan's true body completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long's thoughts, which had been like porridge, finally managed to recover somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Was that senior also a predecessor?"</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long steadied his mind and subconsciously asked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Lin Yuan's true body had put too much pressure on Cang Yu Long,</p><p></p><p>especially that tear-the-sky grab, although its might was completely internalized, not directed at Cang Yu Long at all.</p><p></p><p>Cang Yu Long also felt his mind and spirit trembling, just watching it gave him the illusion that his entire being was being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Until now, the previously silent childish voice continued, "You little brat, what kind of good fortune did the Stone Person Tribe actually have, to have such a powerful predecessor?"</p><p></p><p>The childish voice was quite wistful, although it did not dare to speak earlier, fearing being detected by Lin Yuan, but it had also seen that tear-the-sky grab.</p><p></p><p>That kind of purity and ultimate destructive power, even the childish voice itself felt somewhat alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of method is not a technique, but more like an innate divine ability, could it be that this powerful predecessor is a wondrous life form nurtured by the Chaotic Void? Innately grasping such a lethal method?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The delicate voice murmured to itself,</p><p></p><p>The profundity involved in Shitian's grab is something even a Great Saint would find difficult to replicate. </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength has clearly not reached the Great Saint level, yet he commands such a technique. </p><p></p><p>Only an innate divine ability could explain this.</p><p></p><p>This so-called innate divine ability refers to an inherent capability - you cannot comprehend the reasons and rules behind it, but you just know how to use it.</p><p></p><p>"Such a remarkable combat-oriented life form, once it enters the Great Saint realm, will likely become another peerless Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The delicate voice thought,</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Great Saint and the Peerless Great Saint both reach the pinnacle of the Chaotic Realm, but the difference is that the Peerless Great Saint's offensive and defensive methods are significantly stronger than the Chaotic Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either," Cangyu Long said truthfully. At the peak of the Stone People Tribe, there was only one Sovereign Realm ancestor, but that ancestor had disappeared for over ten universal cycles, and the soul lamp in the tribe had also extinguished.</p><p></p><p>As for having any connection to a certain Venerable, if Cangyu Long hadn't felt that Lin Yuan wouldn't lie about this, he wouldn't have believed it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, how did the sparring between the Senior and the Venerable of the Nine Profound go?" </p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long seemed to have recalled something. Earlier, he had been immersed in the oppressive presence of Lin Yuan's true body, and had even forgotten to inquire about the battle between the two Venerables outside the Nine Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long remembered that the delicate voice's last "report" was that the Venerable of the Nine Profound had withstood a killing move from Lin Yuan and was about to counterattack.</p><p></p><p>"Sparring?" </p><p></p><p>The delicate voice sounded slightly surprised. "Do you think the appearance of your tribe's Senior's true body just now was for what purpose?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" </p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long blinked his eyes. He only remembered that Lin Yuan's true body had reached out towards the battlefield and then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"It's already over. The Venerable of the Nine Profound has suffered heavy injuries and likely admitted defeat," the delicate voice said directly. It hadn't heard the Venerable of the Nine Profound admit defeat, but seeing Lin Yuan's true body leave, and the absence of any further fighting sounds from outside the Nine Profound Realm, it inferred the outcome.</p><p></p><p>"The Senior's grab just now directly made the Venerable of the Nine Profound admit defeat?" </p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long took a deep breath, finding it somewhat unbelievable. He did feel that the aura emanating from Lin Yuan's true body was terrifyingly powerful, but to Cangyu Long, Venerables and Great Saints were essentially no different - they were all beyond his direct comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Your realm and strength are still too low to perceive the might represented by that grab," the delicate voice sighed. "But this is a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"A good thing?"</p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long thought about it and gradually understood.</p><p></p><p>Across the vast Myriad Realms Void Domain, on numerous Chaotic Continents and in high-level secret realms, many Chaotic Venerables were gravely focused on the battlefield outside the Nine Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable of the Nine Profound has admitted defeat?"</p><p></p><p>"The power of that grab was indeed terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"If the Venerable of the Nine Profound doesn't admit defeat, he'll really be risking his life, and he'll most likely die."</p><p></p><p>The Venerables exchanged views. As Venerables in the same Void Domain, they naturally had means of communicating with each other, able to converse in real-time. </p><p></p><p>Some Venerables could even connect across dozens or hundreds of Void Domains, though the cost would be greater the farther the distance.</p><p></p><p>Within a single Void Domain, they could generally communicate freely.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable of the Nine Profound should still have some trump cards and backup plans left, but there's no need to continue fighting. That mysterious Venerable is also of that opinion."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. This mysterious Venerable is very powerful. Even I could only endure that grab, not dodge it."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, if it were me, I would merge into the four-dimensional space to greatly dilute the power of that grab. Even if I was injured, it wouldn't be as severe as the Venerable of the Nine Profound."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Venerable of the Nine Profound excels in offense, but is a bit weak in defensive and life-saving aspects, not agile enough."</p><p></p><p>The Venerables began to evaluate the recent battle, placing themselves in the Venerable of the Nine Profound's position and discussing how they would have faced Lin Yuan's Shitian grab.</p><p></p><p>Clashes between Venerables were rare, and even in sparring, they rarely brought out their true trump cards and backup plans. If those were revealed, they would no longer be considered true trump cards. Now that the Venerable of the Nine Profound and Lin Yuan had gone all out, approaching a life-or-death struggle, unleashing various trump card techniques, it had provided the Chaotic Venerables with some excitement.</p><p></p><p>Especially Lin Yuan's Shitian grab, which was a technique they had never witnessed before. Naturally, they were all discussing how they would have defended against it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what the Venerables didn't know was that the various methods they discussed for dealing with the Shitian grab were completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Because the Lin Yuan who had unleashed the Shitian grab was not a Chaotic Venerable on the same level as them, but a Transcendent Dao Realm being.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability 'Shitian' represented the pinnacle of offensive power. Even at the Transcendent Dao Realm, it was like this. By the time one reached the Sovereign or Chaotic Realm, to block this Shitian, it would likely require a peak Chaotic Realm cultivator or even a Great Saint.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching that level of strength, all their methods were just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the sparring is over, the Venerable of the Nine Profound has admitted defeat, and that mysterious Venerable has also left."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the excitement is over."</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable of the Nine Profound has suffered a heavy loss this time. It will take him at least a few universal cycles to recover from his injuries."</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Venerables took one last look at the Nine Profound Realm area, then turned their gazes away.</p><p></p><p>They had no particular thoughts about Lin Yuan. As for trying to keep Lin Yuan? The one who had just unleashed the Shitian grab was clearly Lin Yuan's true body clone.</p><p></p><p>None of the Venerables could lock onto this true body clone of Lin Yuan. What use would it be to stay in the Taiji Primal Spirit? </p><p></p><p>Unless Lin Yuan truly fought a life-or-death battle with the Venerable of the Nine Profound, the Venerables of the same Void Domain might intervene.</p><p></p><p>But for a simple sparring match, with the Venerable of the Nine Profound's own consent, no Venerable would bother to interfere.</p><p></p><p>"I lost."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Nine Profound Realm, the Venerable of the Nine Profound looked at Lin Yuan's disappearing figure, his expression somewhat wistful.</p><p></p><p>This was his voluntary admission of defeat. The Venerable of the Nine Profound naturally accepted it wholeheartedly. Lin Yuan's final grab had made him feel the danger of life and death.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't admitted defeat, he would have truly died.</p><p></p><p>"This sparring match has resulted in heavy losses for me," the Venerable of the Nine Profound began to assess the gains and losses.</p><p></p><p>First, the mysterious inheritance space was also gone. Even if he had won against Lin Yuan, he could only have obtained the inheritable legacies within the inheritance space that could be replicated.</p><p></p><p>But having something is better than having nothing.</p><p></p><p>Now, those inheritances were completely lost.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he had failed to control his battle power during the sparring, leading to the catastrophic destruction of the surrounding millions of light-years, even damaging the outer regions of his own Nine Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was the injury he had sustained from the Shitian grab, which would require a great deal of time to recover from.</p><p></p><p>As a newly ascended Venerable, the Venerable of the Nine Profound had experienced a tremendous rise in status and power from the Sovereign Realm to the Chaotic Realm. He had been full of ambition, and the chance encounter with the mysterious inheritance space had made him even more confident.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought his path would continue to be smooth sailing, leading him directly into the Great Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, this was the outcome.</p><p></p><p>"Oh well, oh well."</p><p></p><p>"I lost, and that's that. Some Great Saint-level inheritances, even if I obtained them, wouldn't necessarily make me a Great Saint."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Nine Profound calmed his mind. No matter how many Great Saint inheritances one had, it was still fundamentally up to one's own cultivation to become a Great Saint. External forces provided little help, even if a Great Saint personally guided one, it wouldn't significantly aid a Venerable's breakthrough to the Great Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Great Saints and Venerables were both essentially at the Chaotic Realm, so the guidance effect was limited.</p><p></p><p>"Through this battle, I can feel that my killing techniques and secret arts still have many flaws."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Nine Profound reflected, then a glint of fighting spirit appeared in his eyes: "Once I've made up for those flaws, the next time we spar and fight, the outcome may not be so certain."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Nine Profound was filled with a renewed fighting spirit, even though he still didn't know Lin Yuan's identity or which Void Domain he belonged to.</p><p></p><p>But a cultivator of such strength would definitely not remain anonymous. In the future, once he learned of Lin Yuan's identity, he would go and challenge him directly.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the layered space-time.</p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long stood respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Taiji Primal Spirit appeared, hands clasped behind his back, looking at Cangyu Long.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Cangyu Long said gratefully. Although Lin Yuan had intervened, it was not without purpose. But in the end, there was no need for him to spar with the Venerable of the Nine Profound just to save the entire Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>He could have simply said he couldn't save them, and Cangyu Long wouldn't have demanded that Lin Yuan must save the Stone People Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded, then said words that made Cangyu Long's expression change drastically, "How long are you going to keep hiding?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

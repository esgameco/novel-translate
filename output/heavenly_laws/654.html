        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the towering pillar before him, his heart rippling with a sense of emotion.</p><p></p><p>The last time he was here, this massive core celestial pillar had just come into being.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had been overjoyed and anxious, worried that he would not be able to protect this gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>And indeed, that had been the case. Even though Lin Yuan had refined this massive core celestial pillar in just a fraction of a breath, the Venerable Fuxu had come afterwards and snatched it away with just a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>But now...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stood before the gigantic core celestial pillar once again.</p><p></p><p>Unlike last time, this time Lin Yuan had no sense of anxiety or worry.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Fuxu," Lin Yuan calmly looked at the pillar and suddenly spoke, "Have you not had your fill yet?"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The moment the words left his mouth, a figure in a dark robe materialized.</p><p></p><p>It was the Venerable Fuxu.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Venerable Fuxu, unsurprised.</p><p></p><p>In fact, ever since the Venerable Fuyun's demise, Lin Yuan had sensed the Venerable Fuxu's aura, and this mightiest of Venerable Ones had been carefully observing him ever since.</p><p></p><p>Later, when many peak Transcendent Venerable Ones fell at Lin Yuan's hands, the Venerable Fuxu had not intervened.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the five top Transcendent Venerable Ones, including the Venerable Fuyun, had fought to the death in a desperate alliance. One reason was for the dignity and face of the great Fugu Nation. </p><p></p><p>The other was likely due to the Venerable Fuxu's secret orders.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive," the Venerable Fuxu said solemnly, his tone slightly in awe as he gazed at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed arrived earlier and had not made a move.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that he wanted to observe Lin Yuan's strength and methods.</p><p></p><p>As for the eleven great Transcendent Venerable Ones of the Fugu Nation who had perished - their physical bodies had merely died, not their true selves.</p><p></p><p>If it had only cost those eleven physical bodies to thoroughly probe Lin Yuan's true abilities, it would have been a worthwhile trade.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength must stem from the path of Chaos power you have cultivated? A path of Chaos power that surpasses the Thirteen Realms inheritances? Truly remarkable, truly remarkable," the Venerable Fuxu said, his tone somewhat unsettled.</p><p></p><p>Normally, as the mightiest of Venerable Ones, he had attained certain Thirteen Realms secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivated path of Chaos power - that was not his main focus, and could not compare to the power of the Thirteen Realms.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan had reversed this.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was not quite a reversal.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu had also sensed that Lin Yuan had cultivated a certain Thirteen Realms secret technique, but the blessings it bestowed upon him were not greater than his own cultivated path of Chaos power.</p><p></p><p>"In the exploration of Thirteen Realms secret techniques, I am still inferior to you," Lin Yuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Fuxu fell silent at these words.</p><p></p><p>"This gigantic core celestial pillar was the first one I refined. Venerable Fuxu, you've had it for so long, it's time to return it, don't you think?" Lin Yuan continued.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of his coming here was to reclaim the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Venerable Fuxu's strength exceeded Lin Yuan's ability to handle, he would not insist on taking it back.</p><p></p><p>"Return it?" the Venerable Fuxu remained silent.</p><p></p><p>If it had been any other peak Transcendent Venerable One saying this to him, the Venerable Fuxu would not have even bothered to respond.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan? </p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the exact extent of Lin Yuan's strength, he knew it was at the Venerable level, and the Venerable Fuxu even felt a sense of pressure facing Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I can return it," the Venerable Fuxu said, staring at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But only if you can withstand a single strike from me, Silver Galaxy Venerable."</p><p></p><p>He did not wish to fight Lin Yuan to the death over this gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>With the battle for the Treasure Realm still far from over, if he exhausted his trump cards and techniques against Lin Yuan now, what would he use to face the other ancient nations' profound techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Lin Yuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although he also wanted to clash with the Venerable Fuxu, he was also aware that now was not the time for such a confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Given his rate of cultivation, his strength would likely increase further before the battle for the Treasure Realm ended, allowing him to easily sweep aside all the powerful experts in this realm then.</p><p></p><p>As for now?</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had come to try and reclaim the gigantic core celestial pillar, but if he could not, it was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, across the Treasure Realm, many Transcendent Venerable Ones from the various ancient nations had also sensed the spatial fluctuations emanating from the gigantic core celestial pillar occupied and refined by the great Fugu Nation.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>"Why is there fighting there?"</p><p></p><p>One by one, the peak Transcendent Venerable Ones from the different ancient nations gazed towards the location of the gigantic core celestial pillar, able to feel the vast space collapsing and the Dao rules transforming, unwilling to approach due to the terrifying power of the clashing top Venerable Ones.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to make a move on the gigantic core celestial pillar at this time?" </p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Venerable Ones were puzzled. That gigantic core celestial pillar had already been refined by the Venerable Fuxu, and the Venerable Fuxu could descend in an instant to defend it - attacking it was tantamount to attacking the Venerable Fuxu himself.</p><p></p><p>This was not something any single ancient nation could accomplish. </p><p></p><p>Even in the late stages of the battle for the Treasure Realm, when the profound techniques of the various ancient nations were unleashed, they could only plan to join forces.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hope of seizing the precious land lies in the ability to contend with the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Exalted Celestial Lords of the various ancient kingdoms are perplexed, unsure of which ancient kingdom has made a move.</p><p></p><p>"That Galactic Celestial Lord"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the perplexed Thunderous Ancient Kingdom, Mysterious Yin Ancient Kingdom, Savage Ancient Kingdom and other ancient kingdom powerhouses, the eleven Celestial Lords of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom are looking at the direction of the gigantic core celestial pillar with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Their main combat incarnations were all crushed by the Galactic Celestial Lord, this kind of seemingly unbridgeable gap in strength has left the eleven Exalted Celestial Lords of the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom unable to recover their composure even until now.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Yun, that Galactic Celestial Lord." Fu Yun Celestial Lord looked at Fu Yao Celestial Lord, he was the first to fall at the hands of the Galactic Celestial Lord among the top-tier Exalted Celestial Lords. Although he did not witness more of Lin Yuan's actions, just that one scene before his death was enough for Fu Yun Celestial Lord to make some inferences.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Celestial Lord should have stepped into the realm of the Strongest Celestial Lords."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yao Celestial Lord was silent for a while, then nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Strongest Celestial Lords refer to the realm that Fu Xu Celestial Lord resides in, the pinnacle that all Celestial Lords throughout the history of the various ancient kingdoms can reach.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the top-tier Exalted Celestial Lords did not object to Fu Yao Celestial Lord's words.</p><p></p><p>If he is not a Strongest Celestial Lord, how could he easily crush and pierce through the eleven of them, the Exalted Celestial Lords? If he is not a Strongest Celestial Lord, why would the already descended Fu Xu Celestial Lord be unwilling to take action? If he is not a Strongest Celestial Lord, how dare he brazenly kill his way into the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom and occupy the refined gigantic core celestial pillar?</p><p></p><p>"Strongest Celestial Lord." Fu Yun Celestial Lord took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even for the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom, the Strongest Celestial Lords are extremely rare, with only a few in an era.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of Celestial Lords, not even the Exalted Celestial Lords can reach that level, let alone the Strongest Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the ancestral bloodline of the Celestial Lord realm?" Fu Dang Celestial Lord was silently thinking to himself, and upon hearing Fu Yao Celestial Lord say that Lin Yuan had stepped into the realm of the Strongest Celestial Lords, his resentment was completely dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I can only hope that Fu Xu can hold back the Galactic Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yao Celestial Lord sighed and looked towards the direction of the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Exalted Celestial Lords did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Galactic Celestial Lord really gone to the gigantic core celestial pillar?" In another part of the precious land, the Exalted Celestial Lords of the Blazing Sun Ancient Kingdom were also looking towards the source of the spatial fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Originally, in the independent space of the Blazing Sun National Capital, when they heard that Lin Yuan wanted to reclaim the gigantic core celestial pillar, although they chose to believe this young Galactic Celestial Lord, they still had doubts.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Just a slight breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Not weaker than Fu Xu Celestial Lord? Don't be ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Fu Xu Celestial Lord is the Strongest Celestial Lord, how could the Strongest Celestial Lord be so easily broken through? And just a slight breakthrough? However, when they sensed the battle ripples coming from the gigantic core celestial pillar, they were finally certain that what Lin Yuan said should be true.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Celestial Lord... has he become the Strongest Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Lotus Celestial Lord still found it hard to believe. Before entering the precious land, the Galactic Celestial Lord had once sparred with him, revealing the battle power of an Exalted Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Yet in just over a thousand years in the precious land, he had already transcended the peak Exalted Celestial Lords and directly entered the realm of the Strongest Celestial Lords? In front of the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Fu Xu Celestial Lord's gaze was deep, and the surroundings suddenly became illusory, as if transforming from reality to illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Seal."</p><p></p><p>Fu Xu Celestial Lord's expression was grave, and he exerted his full strength, raising his right hand towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>As the hand swept across, the heavens and earth, along with the rules, became illusory and non-existent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lin Yuan observed carefully, and the black and white yin-yang supreme force swirled around his body, gradually forming a Taiji diagram that rotated slowly.</p><p></p><p>When the hand pressed down, the Taiji diagram remained unmoved, and Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly. He vaguely sensed a change in his perception of time.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a technique that affects the power of time?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>When he was once slapped away by Fu Xu Celestial Lord, he had experienced this kind of scenario, without any chance to resist.</p><p></p><p>"But for the current me..." Lin Yuan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>This technique that affects the time perception of living beings is extremely terrifying, formless and intangible, sometimes one doesn't even know when they have been struck.</p><p></p><p>But it is not without a solution.</p><p></p><p>If time is likened to a flowing river, then living beings are like floating objects on the river, drifting with the speed of the water, powerless. But if the living being is a massive, heavy stone sinking to the bottom of the river, it can naturally disregard the speed of the water flow and remain unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Lin Yuan's boundless cosmic foundation and profound roots, he is akin to a massive stone sinking to the bottom of the river, the time perception manipulation technique of Fu Xu Celestial Lord cannot shake him at all.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Fu Xu Celestial Lord withdrew his right hand, looked deeply at Lin Yuan, and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not fully unleash his abilities, that previous move was already considered his full strength, yet the result still failed to have any effect on Lin Yuan. Fu Xu Celestial Lord realized that he would have great difficulty harming Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Unless he resorted to the ultimate killing weapon bestowed by the Great Fu Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But if he could use it, Lin Yuan could use it as well.</p><p></p><p>If both sides used it, it would be equivalent to not using it at all.</p><p></p><p>Fu Xu Celestial Lord was not too willing to do such a mutually assured destruction.</p><p></p><p>"He's leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan watched as the retreating Fu Xu Celestial Lord, without much thought, and immediately began refining the gigantic core celestial pillar in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, this gigantic core celestial pillar was once again successfully refined by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

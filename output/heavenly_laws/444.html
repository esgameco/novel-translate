            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 444 Sweeping (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign is waiting for us?"</p><p></p><p>The massive rock-based lifeform carefully observed Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>If it were other eleventh-stage lifeforms daring to block the path of space-time, he would have already taken action to subdue them.</p><p></p><p>But the Galactic Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>The massive rock lifeform was not afraid of the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>He had just entered the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>What the massive rock lifeform truly dreaded</p><p>Was the human civilization behind the Galactic Sovereign.</p><p>Those nine supreme experts high above.</p><p></p><p>Given the Galactic Sovereign's status in the human civilization, since he dared to enter this massive battlefield, even if it was just his avatar descending,</p><p>He must possess a trump card bestowed by the nine supreme experts of the human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"More or less."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, more and more eleventh-stage experts broke through the space-time labyrinth and stopped, looking at him.</p><p></p><p>The obstructive effect of the space-time labyrinth was useful against those eleventh-stage experts who entered first.</p><p></p><p>As for the eleventh-stage experts who entered the space-time labyrinth later, the earlier eleventh-stage experts had already destroyed the labyrinth into a mess. The latecomers could basically pass through the labyrinth very quickly and reach the path of space-time.</p><p></p><p>This move was also intended to minimize the chance of eleventh-stage experts adept at speed being the first to reach the path of space-time, and thus passing through the path without any fighting to enter the core area of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of opening this massive battlefield was for the experts of various races to fight and compete to determine a victor.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for someone like Lin Yuan who forcibly traveled through space-time, arriving half a day earlier at the path of space-time, it was impossible for the space-time labyrinth to obstruct him.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten breaths, all the eleventh-stage experts in this area had gathered in front of the path of space-time, staring intently at the cross-legged seated Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign..."</p><p></p><p>Among the many eleventh-stage experts, several from the human civilization alliance felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p></p><p>They felt that the Galactic Sovereign's behavior was too arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Originally, as the strongest genius in the history of human civilization, the Galactic Sovereign would definitely be targeted in this massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Logically, the Galactic Sovereign should have kept a low profile.</p><p></p><p>But now, blocking the way so openly, wasn't this giving the alien eleventh-stage experts an opportunity to surround and attack?</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, you..." </p><p></p><p>The Infernal Race's Ying Chuan's expression was gloomy as he was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p>The seated Lin Yuan in front of the path of space-time had his body gather a faint yellow glow.</p><p></p><p>His heavy and oppressive aura began to expand, instantly enveloping all the alien eleventh-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lin Yuan waited until now to take action was purely out of laziness to chase them down.</p><p></p><p>Rather than searching this edge area over and over, it was better to lie in wait at the path of space-time.</p><p></p><p>As long as those eleventh-stage alien experts had the intention to enter the core area of the battlefield, they would inevitably come here.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, you're courting death."</p><p></p><p>The massive rock lifeform raged. He was wary of the human civilization behind the Galactic Sovereign, but not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Even against the Infernal Race's Ying Chuan wielding a supreme weapon, the massive rock lifeform dared to clash a few times. The Galactic Sovereign? Even if he truly had a trump card bestowed by a supreme expert, how much could he unleash?</p><p></p><p>His own strength was there, without the quintuple spatial perception, he couldn't even preliminarily refine a supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble.</p><p></p><p>The massive rock lifeform immediately stepped forward, extending his right hand which began to rapidly expand until it reached tens of thousands of zhang, slamming down towards Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p>The extended right arm of the massive rock lifeform suddenly turned into nothingness, and immediately his rock body, as solid as could be, also began to crumble inch by inch into ashes.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>The other alien eleventh-stage experts' expressions changed drastically. The massive rock lifeform's strength was almost on par with Ying Chuan of the Infernal Race.</p><p></p><p>If not for his spatial perception being a bit inferior, he would definitely have been bestowed a supreme weapon as well.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, he was directly reduced to ashes before the Galactic Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>"Join forces."</p><p>"Join forces together."</p><p>"Otherwise, we'll all die."</p><p></p><p>Including Ying Chuan of the Infernal Race, all the alien eleventh-stage experts had the same thought arise in their minds.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they didn't have time to ponder questions like why the Galactic Sovereign possessed such powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble... Terrifying auras surged among the many alien eleventh-stage experts. Ying Chuan of the Infernal Race suddenly produced a black axe in his hand, emitting a deep luster, a trace of an aura transcending the eleventh stage condensing.</p><p></p><p>Although Ying Chuan had preliminarily refined a supreme weapon, he would not activate it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice, activating a supreme weapon consumed far too much...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Even if the Soul Extinguishing Clan burned their flesh and souls, they could not trigger much of an attack. </p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why just now, dozens of special lifeforms from the vast Star Alliance like the Massive Rock Life were able to stall him within the space-time labyrinth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even without triggering the supreme weapon, just passively using the might of the supreme weapon would greatly increase the strength of the Soul Extinguishing Clan.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the elites from the top clan forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's gaze was calm, his mind casually thinking.  </p><p></p><p>With his strength, if he went all out, these alien eleventh-stage cultivators would have no chance to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>But doing so would expose too much of his power, scaring the true experts from the top clan forces in the core battlefield area.</p><p></p><p>This would cause those true experts to avoid Lin Yuan in the core battlefield area, or even directly withdraw from this massive battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, I'll play with you all for a bit."</p><p></p><p>With a shift of Lin Yuan's thoughts, the profound yellow force field enveloping all directions began slowly contracting.</p><p></p><p>The profound yellow force field was an accompanying ability of the Profound Yellow Body, used for defense.  </p><p></p><p>But it didn't mean the profound yellow force field couldn't attack offensively, it was just not very powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, this lack of power was only relative to Lin Yuan. To these alien eleventh-stage cultivators, it was undoubtedly a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh.</p><p></p><p>The profound yellow radiance erupted with heart-shaking undulations. One alien eleventh-stage cultivator after another was swept away, their forms collapsing, following in the footsteps of the Massive Rock Life.</p><p></p><p>"My insect warriors..."</p><p></p><p>The massive Mother Nest of the Insect Race watched helplessly as the many insect warriors it birthed were reduced to ashes by the profound yellow force field.  </p><p></p><p>Soon after, this Mother Nest itself began to collapse.</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the profound yellow force field, several eleventh-stage experts from the Human Civilization Alliance gaped in astonishment at the one-sided massacre before them.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, the newly ascended eleventh-stage Galactic Sovereign, with every casual movement, allowed nearly two hundred alien eleventh-stage cultivators to be rendered powerless, including that Soul Extinguishing Clan wielding a supreme weapon who could only desperately hang on.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Sovereign's strength is so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>The few human eleventh-stage experts looked at each other, their minds trembling.</p><p></p><p>They had just thought the Galactic Sovereign was too arrogant for waiting at the entrance of the space-time path instead of entering early when he had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed he was just toying with those alien eleventh-stage cultivators by massacring them.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, within the profound yellow force field, all the alien eleventh-stage cultivators were annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Only the Soul Extinguishing Clan remained, barely holding on with the supreme black halberd in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Although the supreme black halberd was not a defensive supreme weapon, its black luster provided an extremely strong defensive effect.</p><p></p><p>In fact, any supreme weapon had many wonderful uses. Offensive supreme weapons could defend, and defensive ones could attack, just with varying degrees of power.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme weapon."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the black halberd in the Soul Extinguishing Clan's hands, his expression slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the artifacts in the second-dimensional world that only displayed a bit of supernatural power, the might of the supreme weapons in the main universe was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan had not crossed the eleventh stage, he might not have been able to deal with the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, spare me this once. You can make any demand," the Soul Extinguishing Clan hastily said.</p><p></p><p>Although he could temporarily withstand this for now, he vaguely sensed that the mysterious force field around him was becoming increasingly heavy and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the Soul Extinguishing Clan could no longer endure. The consumption from activating the supreme weapon was too great, whereas Lin Yuan seemed unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Once he could no longer activate the supreme weapon, he would inevitably be crushed by the omnipresent mysterious force field.</p><p></p><p>Without the supreme weapon, the Soul Extinguishing Clan would be no different from the Massive Rock Life.</p><p></p><p>"You want me to make a demand?" Lin Yuan's gaze was calm as he smiled, "Hand over the supreme weapon."</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the supreme weapon?" The Soul Extinguishing Clan's expression turned ugly. The supreme weapon was loaned to him by his Soul Extinguishing Clan.</p><p></p><p>How could he explain handing it over to the Galactic Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>Compared to this supreme weapon, what was this clone body of his?</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Sovereign, please change your demand," the Soul Extinguishing Clan said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>If it was a choice between handing over the supreme weapon or continuing this stalemate with the Galactic Sovereign, the Soul Extinguishing Clan would choose the latter.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, maybe before he was completely drained, the Galactic Sovereign would be unable to keep suppressing a supreme weapon without any cost?</p><p></p><p>The Soul Extinguishing Clan didn't believe the Galactic Sovereign could suppress a supreme weapon like this without any expenditure.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take it myself," Lin Yuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The black and yellow rays of light from all directions grew increasingly dense.</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour, the Demonic Tribe's Minghuan could no longer persevere and used his last strength in utter despair to unleash his supreme weapon, the Black Axe, intending to go down together with Lin Yuan. </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the jet-black and profound axe rays were all blocked by Lin Yuan. In the end, Minghuan of the Demonic Tribe died, and that supreme Black Axe floated quietly in the air.</p><p></p><p>Even without its master, this supreme weapon still emanated an extreme tearing aura.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme weapon."</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Lin Yuan, the Black Axe flew over and fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>"It still has a master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan tried to invade the Black Axe with his spiritual will but found a resisting force, immediately realizing the reason.</p><p></p><p>Minghuan of the Demonic Tribe had only died in one of his incarnations and had not perished completely. Therefore, this supreme weapon was not in a masterless state currently.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan did not care. Once he brought this supreme weapon back, he would naturally have plenty of time to erode the inner resistance.</p><p></p><p>"My supreme weapon."</p><p></p><p>Within the Demonic Tribe's domain, Minghuan's true self was roaring madly.</p><p></p><p>A supreme weapon was absolutely a rare opportunity for a powerhouse like him at the fifth level of the eleventh stage.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for this massive battlefield opening, which required the Demonic Tribe to have a vast number of powerful experts, he would never have had the chance to refine this supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything was gone.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he failed to enter the core battlefield area and achieve nothing, but he had also lost the supreme weapon.</p><p></p><p>"How terrifyingly powerful is that Galactic Celestial Lin Yuan?"  After the rage, a chill arose in Minghuan's heart.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's strength was too formidable. Even if he had relied on external forces, being able to force Minghuan to unleash his supreme weapon until the last drop of oil was burned was unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Celestial must not have just entered the eleventh stage. In terms of spacetime comprehension, he has at least reached the fifth level. Otherwise, it would be impossible for his spacetime suppression to reach a degree that even I could not escape."</p><p></p><p>Minghuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Minghuan felt somewhat stifled. If he had known the Galactic Celestial possessed such strength, he would have fled immediately.</p><p></p><p>On the path of spacetime.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies of numerous eleventh-stage aliens had all been transformed by Lin Yuan's "Primordial Force" into the most fundamental energy and then used as resources for cultivating the "Profound Yellow Body."</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies of the eleventh stage contained an immense amount of energy. Even for Lin Yuan, it was no small help.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Lin Yuan had also obtained a supreme weapon, the Black Axe, and hundreds of scattered treasures.</p><p></p><p>"After waiting for a good half a day, these gains are worth it."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. Not to mention the supreme weapon and numerous treasures, just the essence energy contained within the physical bodies of a hundred or two hundred eleventh-stage aliens could be equivalent to hundreds of billions or even trillions of cosmic crystals in terms of rare cosmic resources.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was also the supreme weapon of incalculable value.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan already possessed dozens of supreme weapons, and nearly half of the hundreds of wonders he obtained from the two-dimensional world were materials for twelfth-stage celestial treasures, it did not mean that supreme weapons were worthless.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all still dazed about?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the few eleventh-stage experts from the Human Civilization Alliance, standing in the corner, trembling and not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he took action until now, Lin Yuan had been secretly protecting these eleventh-stage experts from the Human Civilization Alliance with his Profound Yellow Force Field, preventing them from being killed by the residual waves of the force field.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan had been ruthless in slaughtering the alien eleventh-stage experts, he was still quite kind to his own people.</p><p></p><p>"Galactic Celestial, what should we do now?" The eleventh-stage experts from the Human Civilization Alliance immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>The top experts of the Human Civilization had already issued orders that on the battlefield, they should follow the Galactic Celestial's lead in all matters.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the path of spacetime."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left these words and stepped into the entrance of the path of spacetime, his figure disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"We... we should go in too." After a long while, these eleventh-stage experts finally reacted and walked to the path of spacetime, looking at the desolate battlefield and feeling indescribable emotions.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the top experts instructed us to follow the Galactic Celestial's lead after entering the battlefield." At this moment, these eleventh-stage experts seemed to have realized something.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had doubts about this order and, although they did not dare to disobey the top experts, they could not help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>But now, they suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the battle - or rather, the slaughter - that had occurred in this marginal area, where numerous alien eleventh-stage experts were slaughtered by the Galactic Celestial, quickly spread among the various peak forces and factions.</p>

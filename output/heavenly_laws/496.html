        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang' left behind many precious weapons and treasures, which greatly benefited Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this cave mansion itself is also a precious treasure. For Sovereign Realm experts, it may not be much, but in the universe, it is the most powerful war machine that can run rampant without scruples. Even the Twelve Ultimates are powerless against it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At least under the control of the owner, even if dozens of Twelve Ultimate experts in the universe attacked together, they would not be able to shake it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to activate such a massive object would consume a terrifying amount of energy, which an ordinary Dao Splitting Realm cultivator definitely could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Now immediately send this cave mansion and the harvests back to the universe." Lin Yuan walked out of the cave mansion, appearing in the Chaotic Void, and with a thought, he divided out another avatar.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, under Lin Yuan's control, the island spanning tens of millions of miles quickly shrank to the size of a palm and fell into the hands of the newly divided avatar.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Void is full of dangers, and the avatar Lin Yuan sent out had long been prepared to dissipate at any time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he wanted to quickly send the harvests back.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't send them back, and encountered any danger, and the avatar perished, wouldn't all these treasures be lost?</p><p></p><p>The treasures left behind by the peak Sovereign Realm expert 'Cang Weiyang' were enough to make ordinary Sovereign Realm experts envious. For Lin Yuan, who had just begun to explore the Chaotic Void, they were his first "pot of gold".</p><p></p><p>With a "whoosh", the avatar quickly disappeared under Lin Yuan's gaze, returning to his home universe at high speed.</p><p></p><p>"Next, continue to explore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was full of vigor, and for him at the moment, any harvest in the Chaotic Void could satisfy him, after all, it was his first exploration.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cang Weiyang left me a map of the Chaotic Void, but now without any specific reference points, the map is meaningless."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, "First, find the nearest Chaotic Continent, with this Chaotic Continent as a reference point, I can also know what's around it."</p><p></p><p>The maps of the Chaotic Void are divided into two types, one is the public type, and the other is the private type.</p><p></p><p>The latter is the map personally explored by each Twelve Ultimate expert, which is not publicly disclosed, and it marks many places of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The map left by Cang Weiyang was a private map.</p><p></p><p>The Chaotic Continent is the place where many lives gather in the Chaotic Void, and most of the Chaotic Continents are formed afterwards, created by Chaotic Realm experts as their own territories.</p><p></p><p>The order in the Chaotic Continent is strict, because only with order can it continuously attract powerful experts to gather, without order, what's the difference from the Chaotic Void?</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can determine which Chaotic Continent is the closest, Senior Cang Weiyang's map will be useful."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan randomly chose a direction and quickly traversed the void.</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether it was the Demon Jade Tower or the Xuanhuang Lineage, they both left Lin Yuan with maps of the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>But these two existed too long ago, even if the maps they left were much more detailed than Cang Weiyang's by many times, they were still of little reference value.</p><p></p><p>As the universes flowed by, even if the Chaotic Continents were dominated by Chaotic Realm experts, they would eventually collapse, and the areas marked on the maps might not even exist anymore.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Chaotic Void is too vast, even a Chaotic Sage cannot explore it completely. Whether the maps left by the Xuanhuang Emperor and the Demon Jade Tower Master are still effective, it is difficult to say whether they have marked the nearby areas.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had seen the images of the 33,333 Xuanhuang Secret Realms opened by the Xuanhuang Emperor, which were completely aimless openings, and the Xuanhuang Emperor himself might not even know the location of every Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Jade Tower Master is probably similar.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan became a member of the Demon Jade Tower sequence, and could vaguely feel the general location of the Demon Jade Space in the Chaotic Void, but it was only vague, except for the direction, the distance and other details were not clear.</p><p></p><p>Compared to these two Chaotic Sages, Cang Weiyang's map is the most useful, because Senior Cang Weiyang was the weakest, even if he perished, his cave mansion could not have flown too far.</p><p></p><p>And based on the traces of the passage of time on the cave mansion, Lin Yuan judged that the loss of control would not be too long, probably around two to three universal periods.</p><p></p><p>Two to three universal periods is not too long for Twelve Ultimate experts in the Chaotic Void.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, Lin Yuan sat cross-legged, and the details of the 98 secret techniques left by Cang Weiyang emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Now Lin Yuan has reached the ultimate in the Eleventh Realm, he is truly at the pinnacle. If it weren't for the fact that his inner world is still undergoing transformation, he might have already been preparing to break through to the Ultimate.</p><p></p><p>So Lin Yuan has been quite idle recently, even though the vast rules of the main universe and the Chaotic Void can still bring him help, his life realm limitation has restricted Lin Yuan's advancement.</p><p></p><p>With just the Eleventh Realm life realm, even with his extraordinary comprehension, he cannot elevate his Spatial-Temporal Comprehension to the Eighth Realm, nor can he elevate the Chaotic Rules to the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the newly acquired 98 Sovereign Realm secret techniques have made Lin Yuan quite pleasantly surprised. The secret techniques are not a path of evolution, and their cultivation requirements are not harsh.</p><p></p><p>"There are six secret techniques among the 98 Sovereign Realm secret techniques that are suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself, most of the secret techniques require reaching the Dao Splitting Realm to cultivate, and there are only six that can be cultivated at the Eleventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>These six secret techniques, three are offensive techniques, one is a defensive technique, and the remaining two are auxiliary techniques.</p><p></p><p>They can all play a very important role for the current Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"They are much simpler than the three Protective Dao Secret Techniques of the Xuanhuang Lineage."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought as he began to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>【Your extraordinary comprehension has allowed you to comprehend the Withering and Flourishing Seal, reaching the pinnacle of the Eleventh Realm.】</p><p></p><p>【Your extraordinary comprehension has allowed you to comprehend the Falcon Divine Blade, reaching the pinnacle of the Eleventh Realm.】</p><p></p><p>【Your extraordinary comprehension has allowed you to comprehend the Nine Tempering Feather Kill, reaching the pinnacle of the Eleventh Realm.】</p><p></p><p>In less than a month, Lin Yuan had fully cultivated all the secret techniques he could currently practice to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Now, among my many techniques, the 'Rend the Heavens' physical technique is still the strongest." Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>The 'Rend the Heavens' technique is an extremely offensive technique, with no superfluous effects, it just tears open everything in front of it.</p><p></p><p>However, there are some limitations in activating this physical technique, so many other secret techniques are needed to complement it, and 'Rend the Heavens' is Lin Yuan's ultimate trump card, which he will definitely save for the last moment.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's current foundation, a single 'Rend the Heavens' strike can unleash a power of hundreds of thousands or even millions of battle power, and this is the pure 'Rend the Heavens' without any powerful weapons.</p><p></p><p>"The avatar of a Twelve Ultimate in front of me can be easily torn apart, even if it's a Twelve Ultimate, if it tries to withstand it head-on, it will probably be injured."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had a rough understanding of his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is the 'Rend the Heavens' technique used by his true body, if it's his two major divine souls, the power might be a bit weaker.</p><p></p><p>On a large battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>A figure silently entered.</p><p></p><p>Every major battlefield has twelve ultimate gazes watching, but this figure's aura blended into the depths of space-time, and even the twelve ultimates could not detect it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm finally back."</p><p></p><p>The Taiyin Primordial Spirit appeared and waved a hand to retrieve the many harvests brought back by its incarnation. In the chaotic void, Lin Yuan always had a sense of crisis, but once inside the universe, he felt assured - this place could be considered absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>Those Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm experts could not invade a universe, as the chaotic void birthed one universe after another, and to invade a universe would be to defy the will of the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The Taiyin Primordial Spirit directly entered the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's true self was seated in meditation.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyin Primordial Spirit appeared, and a palm-sized island floated before it.</p><p></p><p>It was the abode of the Sovereign Realm peak expert 'Cang Weiyang'.</p><p></p><p>"First, let's refine the Transcendent Dao weapons." Lin Yuan immediately took out the few Transcendent Dao weapons in the abode and began refining them quickly.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm treasures? With his current strength, he was not yet qualified to refine them.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Realm and Chaos Realm treasures had already birthed 'spirits' and possessed the ability to self-revive and expel.</p><p></p><p>That 'white paper' originating from the Taiyu Ruins contained a two-dimensional world within, which could easily reduce the dimensions of anything nearby, but to try and reduce the dimensions of a Sovereign Realm treasure weapon? The latter had a 'spirit' and could resist and break free.</p><p></p><p>A Sovereign Realm treasure weapon was already equivalent to half a life.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the rare treasures within the two-dimensional world of the 'white paper' were all at the twelfth level of the Transcendent Dao, without a single Sovereign Realm or Chaos Realm treasure.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan went to the ten-eight strange trees in the abode island.</p><p></p><p>Each strange tree was laden with spiritual fruits, containing vast energy within.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan picked all the spiritual fruits and carefully collected them.</p><p></p><p>"These spiritual fruits can be used as the provisions for my cultivation of the Xuanhuang Body to the twelfth level."</p><p></p><p>He knew how arduous it would be to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body to the twelfth level of perfection.</p><p></p><p>The 'spirit' of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm had told Lin Yuan that a perfected twelfth-level Xuanhuang Body could easily withstand the calamity of a universe's great destruction.</p><p></p><p>This was simply nonsense - with a Xuanhuang Body at the twelfth level of perfection, a physique of that level would be considered powerful even among the Chaos Supremes, let alone withstanding the destruction of one, ten, or even a million universes.</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan focused his thoughts. The resources required to cultivate the Xuanhuang Body to the twelfth level of perfection were abundant, especially since Lin Yuan's base physical strength was too high, requiring even more resources than the ordinary Xuanhuang Body.</p><p></p><p>But the chaotic void was boundless, containing endless resources, and as long as Lin Yuan's strength grew, he would eventually be able to gather the necessary resources.</p><p></p><p>"Can these strange trees absorb the chaotic qi by themselves?" Lin Yuan observed the ten-eight strange trees and found that their roots were embedded deep into the depths of space-time, constantly absorbing large amounts of chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>The chaotic qi in the chaotic void was extremely turbulent and contained various energies, which is why the chaotic stones that contained stable and pure chaotic qi served as the 'currency' for circulation.</p><p></p><p>Even Chaos Realm experts did not dare to recklessly consume the chaotic qi in the chaotic void.</p><p></p><p>But these ten-eight Sovereign Realm peak strange trees could actually consume the chaotic qi in such a manner?</p><p></p><p>[Your perceptiveness is extraordinary. Observing the absorption of chaotic qi has deepened your understanding of the essence of chaotic qi.]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan carefully observed, and the essence of each wisp of chaotic qi unfolded before him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a special life structure?" Lin Yuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He felt that as long as he continued to ponder, he would be able to, like these ten-eight strange trees, freely absorb any chaotic qi.</p><p></p><p>In the dark palace.</p><p></p><p>More than ten twelfth-level experts from different races had gathered again.</p><p></p><p>"How did your investigation go?" The Abyss Tribe's ultimate looked around at the others and asked directly.</p><p></p><p>After separating last time, the twelfth-level ultimate experts had returned to their respective tribes to investigate the path of martial dao evolution.</p><p></p><p>If the information about the eleventh-level martial dao chapter was true, it would have an irreversible impact on their peak tribal powers, as the high-level evolution of human civilization would become terrifyingly efficient.</p><p></p><p>"According to our tribe's intelligence, the probability that the creator of the martial dao evolution path is the Galactic Overlord is as high as 95%," said the Skyfeather Tribe's ultimate.</p><p></p><p>Although the Galactic Overlord was an unparalleled evolution genius, and the path of evolution he walked should be a perfected and stable one, the fact that both the Galactic Overlord and the martial dao evolution path originated from the Canglan Star could not be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, every time the Galactic Overlord advanced to a higher level, the martial dao evolution path would also upload a new chapter, further confirming that the Galactic Overlord was the creator of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"The Galactic Overlord being the creator of the martial dao evolution path is something our tribe predicted hundreds of years ago," said the Cosmos Tribe's ultimate, and the other twelfth-level ultimates also had calm expressions, not showing any surprise.</p><p></p><p>It was not only their peak tribal powers that had noticed this, but even within human civilization, as the Galactic Overlord rapidly grew stronger, from the eighth level to the ninth, tenth, the voices linking the Galactic Overlord to the creator of the martial dao path became louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this was no secret to the peak tribal powers.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Before the martial dao evolution path advanced to the eleventh level, the twelfth-level ultimate experts from the different races had not paid much attention to this evolution path.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Galactic Overlord was indeed the creator of this evolution path, whether he could eventually cross over to the twelfth level relying on this path was still an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that.</p><p></p><p>There was also the fact that the Galactic Overlord was too well-protected by human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after the martial dao evolution path uploaded the tenth-level chapter and became the tenth evolution path of human civilization, some twelfth-level ultimate experts from the different races had already sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>But human civilization had protected the Galactic Overlord too well, and even if some twelfth-level ultimate experts were willing to put aside their pride and attack, they never had the chance.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, the martial dao evolution path was allowed to advance to the eleventh level, becoming the fifth evolution path of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that the twelfth-level ultimate experts from the different races realized the true potential and terrifying nature of the martial dao evolution path.</p><p></p><p>"Now the question is not whether we know or not, but how to deal with it."</p><p></p><p>The Insect Queen Tribe's mother frowned, as the fact that the Galactic Overlord was the creator of the martial dao evolution path was the biggest headache for the Insect Tribe.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 650</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The gigantic core celestial pillar is right next to me?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked closely at a celestial pillar that was ten times more majestic than the others, as it rapidly materialized from the illusory realm, leaving him quite unsettled.</p><p></p><p>The entire spatial treasure land was immensely vast, and the gigantic core celestial pillar could have appeared anywhere, yet it ended up right next to Lin Yuan? The probability of this was almost the same as randomly finding a 13th-tier inheritance on the street.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the gigantic core celestial pillar in front of him, and in just a moment, he had made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Refine it.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Lin Yuan activated his external universe and immediately began refining it.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Blazing Sun Realm, in an independent space.</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Venerable was dumbfounded as he looked at Lin Yuan: "You mean that gigantic core celestial pillar is right next to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme venerables were also somewhat bewildered. They had just been wondering where the gigantic core celestial pillar would appear, and it turned out to be so close to the Silver Galaxy Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"I have already started refining it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>"You should refine it now."</p><p></p><p>"I'm rushing over there as fast as I can."</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Venerable's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>He had already given up on the idea of competing for the first gigantic core celestial pillar, feeling that there was no need to fight to the death with Fuxu Venerable.</p><p></p><p>But that was based on the premise that Fuxu Venerable would be the first to reach the gigantic core celestial pillar and refine it.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly snatching the gigantic core celestial pillar from Fuxu Venerable's hands would be too costly, and whether he could ultimately seize it was another matter.</p><p></p><p>So, after weighing the pros and cons, Blazing Sun Venerable had chosen to give up, which was the most rational decision.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The gigantic core celestial pillar had appeared right next to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>That meant Lin Yuan was the first powerful cultivator to come into contact with the gigantic core celestial pillar. In such a situation, Blazing Sun Venerable had almost no hesitation and chose to compete for this gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice.</p><p></p><p>This gigantic core celestial pillar was practically being handed to him.</p><p></p><p>If Blazing Sun Venerable were to give up again, that would be too timid.</p><p></p><p>"In three breaths, I will use a special technique to reach you, and you only need to hold out for two breaths."</p><p></p><p>Blazing Sun Venerable said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The deadly artifact he had brought from the Blazing Sun Ancient Realm could completely protect that gigantic core treasure land.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if Fuxu Venerable wanted to forcibly refine the gigantic core treasure land, he would have to pay a certain price. As long as Fuxu Venerable had any rationality, he could choose to compete for the next emerging gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do my best."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Venerable could reach the site in one breath, while Blazing Sun Venerable could reach it in three breaths. </p><p></p><p>That meant Lin Yuan needed to hold out against Fuxu Venerable for two breaths.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't really be called "holding out"; as long as he delayed Fuxu Venerable for two breaths, preventing him from refining the gigantic core celestial pillar, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>In front of the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan only used one-tenth of a breath to successfully refine it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan felt the spatial suppression of this treasure land had decreased significantly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many of his incarnations could now instantly manifest here.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression changed slightly as he noticed ripples spreading in the distance, and a man in a dark robe emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression became solemn. This man in the dark robe was Fuxu Venerable, a being on par with the Demonic Jade Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>"How could he be so fast?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan felt the pressure. It had only been one-tenth of a breath, yet Fuxu Venerable had already arrived? </p><p></p><p>There were two possible reasons for this:</p><p></p><p>One, Fuxu Venerable had hidden his true strength, and his actual abilities were far beyond what he had shown over the past millennium.</p><p></p><p>Two, Fuxu Venerable just happened to be in the vicinity, so his speed of arrival exceeded Lin Yuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Your luck is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Venerable glanced at Lin Yuan and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Given his speed, by the time he arrived at the gigantic core celestial pillar, not only had Lin Yuan already reached it, but he had also refined it.</p><p></p><p>There was only one explanation for this.</p><p></p><p>The gigantic core celestial pillar had appeared right next to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, you've encountered me."</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Venerable's words had barely left his mouth when the surrounding space began to darken.</p><p></p><p>A sense of all-pervasive illusory energy descended.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he arrived at this place to the time he spoke his second sentence, not even a fraction of a breath had passed, yet Fuxu Venerable had already taken action, without the slightest delay.</p><p></p><p>"This...?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's brow furrowed as the illusory power caused his "World" divine ability to start collapsing and dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Begone."</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Venerable slapped his right hand, and Lin Yuan's expression changed drastically as his external universe immediately crumbled, and he was directly knocked away.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Venerable took a step forward, standing next to the gigantic core celestial pillar, and immediately began refining it. In an instant, he successfully removed Lin Yuan's imprint and smoothly refined the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was grim. From Fuxu Venerable's appearance to the present, only half a breath had passed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of one who stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the invincible Great Saints?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan took a deep breath. Although he had not sustained any injuries, under Fuxu Venerable's attack, he was completely unable to resist, and could only be passively knocked away.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Venerable's cultivation of that 13th-tier inheritance must be related to time."</p><p></p><p>Through the brief exchange just now, Lin Yuan had also deduced a lot. When facing Fuxu Venerable's attack, his sense of time was completely disrupted, and he had no intention of actively resisting.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Relying entirely on the passive defense of the outer cosmic realm.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to withstand my strike without sustaining much injury, you are quite impressive," said Fuxu Immortal Venerable, glancing at Lin Yuan with a hint of admiration after successfully refining the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>He knew the methods he had used, which could instantly shield the enemy's perception of time, allowing them to be struck without any defense.</p><p></p><p>In this case, Lin Yuan was only blown away without sustaining much injury, and his defensive capabilities were already considered terrifying, being rare even among the top supreme Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a spatial disturbance emerged in the distance.</p><p></p><p>A majestic figure appeared, looking at the gigantic core celestial pillar with a somewhat unsightly expression.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Immortal Venerable, you arrived quite quickly," the majestic figure said in a deep voice. He had hurried here as fast as he could, but Fuxu Immortal Venerable had still beaten him to it.</p><p></p><p>"You Barbarian Ancient Nation has certainly put in a lot of effort to vie for this precious land," Fuxu Immortal Venerable said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," the majestic figure snorted coldly and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>If Fuxu Immortal Venerable had not yet refined the gigantic core celestial pillar by the time he arrived, he would not have minded competing for it. But now that Fuxu Immortal Venerable had already refined it, there was no need to compete.</p><p></p><p>Soon, more figures appeared, gazing at the gigantic core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Fuxu Immortal Venerable has refined it."</p><p></p><p>"As expected, who can compete with Fuxu Immortal Venerable for the first gigantic core celestial pillar?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, we'll just wait for the next one then."</p><p></p><p>The arriving supreme Immortal Venerables conversed with each other and gradually retreated.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Crimson Flame Immortal Venerable sighed, then looked at Lin Yuan with a solemn expression. "But it's not entirely without gain. At least we now know that Fuxu Immortal Venerable cultivates not just one, but multiple Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritances, and one of them is related to time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had already truthfully recounted to Crimson Flame Immortal Venerable the situation in which Fuxu Immortal Venerable had acted.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yuan had surmised, Crimson Flame Immortal Venerable also determined that Fuxu Immortal Venerable had used a Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritance related to time.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Lin Yuan would not have been unable to even attempt to resist.</p><p></p><p>After all, the top supreme Immortal Venerables were indeed no match for Fuxu Immortal Venerable, but the gap between them was not as vast as imagined.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Lin Yuan, whose foundations were unfathomable. If necessary, he could directly detonate the outer cosmic realm, and even if he had to drag it out, he could still hold on for a few breaths, allowing Crimson Flame Immortal Venerable to arrive.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, Fuxu Immortal Venerable had not even given Lin Yuan the opportunity to unleash his full strength.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about it. We never intended to seize the first gigantic core precious land anyway," Crimson Flame Immortal Venerable comforted Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded without saying much more.</p><p></p><p>In the Chaotic Void, deep within the Silver Galaxy Chaotic Continent, Lin Yuan sat in a cross-legged position, beginning to review the gap between himself and such powerful experts as Fuxu Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to these boundary-complete cultivators who have mastered not just one, but multiple Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritances, my advantages have almost been erased," Lin Yuan examined himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritances, Lin Yuan had the "Infinite Void" inheritance and the semi-Thirteen Celestial Dao technique "Blazing Sun Opening the Heavens," which together could be considered two Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritances.</p><p></p><p>But Fuxu Immortal Venerable also had them.</p><p></p><p>Fuxu Immortal Venerable also had advantages that Lin Yuan lacked, such as the path of Chaotic Force evolution and boundary advantages, among others.</p><p></p><p>And Fuxu Immortal Venerable was not the only such powerful expert in the Great Fuxu Ancient Nation. Even other five great ancient nations, such as the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation and the Mysterious Yin Ancient Nation, also had such figures.</p><p></p><p>However, these kinds of experts had already reached the point where they had nothing left to desire. Even if a new first-grade precious land emerged, they would not be bothered to come and compete for it. Fuxu Immortal Venerable had come only because he happened to be free and had nothing else to do.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, I still have much room for improvement," Lin Yuan collected his thoughts, not feeling any sense of dejection.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Lin Yuan continued his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Infinite Void." Lin Yuan focused on the cultivation of the third layer of this Thirteen Celestial Dao inheritance. He could feel that he was already very close to completing the third layer and allowing his inner cosmic realm to undergo a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Just then—</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! A deep, powerful sound suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to have sensed something and immediately put down his cultivation of the "Infinite Void," with his consciousness manifesting at the highest point of his inner cosmic realm.</p><p></p><p>Here, chaotic qi drifted, and many chaotic rule essences meandered. A gigantic egg, entirely composed of chaotic qi, floated quietly there.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! A deep sound emanated from within the gigantic egg, as if it was evolving and nurturing something.</p><p></p><p>"Is my Chaotic Taiji Dao about to evolve?" Lin Yuan carefully observed the gigantic egg.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the gigantic egg continuously produced cracking sounds, and cracks appeared on its surface. Finally, two forces, black and white, distinct yet intertwined, evolved out of the cracks.</p><p></p><p>The black and white forces continuously fused, containing the ultimate Yin-Yang powers. A terrifying aura naturally spread with this black and white force, its spread instantly crushing layer after layer of space, even causing the chaotic qi to collapse in large swaths.</p><p></p><p>"What power is this?"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed girl child, who had been sleeping by relying on the Jade Gourd, suddenly awoke with a start. Vaguely, she sensed a sense of oppression, exceeding the oppression felt by all previous cultivators of the "Infinite Void" inheritance.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

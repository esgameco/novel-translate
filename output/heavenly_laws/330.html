            <p>Chapter 330: Lin Yuan and Hun Yi (Please subscribe)</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yuan's ninth crossing, in order to give Xi Lan hope, he casually mentioned that his elders were rushing over.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't entirely a fabrication. The meaning of "elders" was to counter Hun Yi. As long as Lin Yuan safely made it through the ninth crossing and greatly increased his strength, he himself would be the "elder".</p><p></p><p>In Lin Yuan's expectations before the crossing, even without the help of a divine status, through the thousand years in the crossing worlds, he could probably cultivate to the Nine Realms Millions Layers realm. </p><p></p><p>With the help of his inner world size of over 100 million li, even if there was a gap with Hun Yi in terms of spatial layer development, the overall strength could still be on par.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the actual gains from this crossing far exceeded Lin Yuan's expected gains before the crossing.</p><p></p><p>"Inner world."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan also observed his own inner world.</p><p></p><p>With the return of his mental will, there was no change in the size of his inner world. After all, he needed to fully absorb the liquid in the mysterious gourd to restore it to nearly 200 million li in diameter.</p><p></p><p>However, the depth of his inner world, that is, the spatial layers, was being developed at a terrifying speed - millions of layers, tens of millions of layers...</p><p></p><p>To develop spatial layers required a sufficiently deep understanding of the essence of space. With Lin Yuan's current understanding of the essence of space, he could quickly restore it to 2.331 billion layers of space in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we're heading out."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up. With his current mastery of spatial layers, even with the isolation of Xi Lan's inner world, he could easily see the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"Go out?"</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was a bit dumbfounded. Could it be that Lin Yuan's "elder" had arrived?</p><p></p><p>But Xi Lan didn't detect the aura of any ninth realm powerhouse approaching, right? Although there were many ninth realm aliens watching from a distance, based on the aura they displayed, they didn't seem capable of holding back Hun Yi either.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under Xi Lan's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure disappeared from where he stood.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master went out?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xi Lan was a bit slow to react.</p><p></p><p>In his inner world, without his permission, the Galaxy Master went out?</p><p></p><p>You should know that Xi Lan, as the developer of the inner world, was like the creation god within the inner world.</p><p></p><p>He could control all the power of the inner world. Even if a ninth realm powerhouse as strong as Hun Yi, who had developed over 30 million spatial layers, was trapped deep in Xi Lan's inner world.</p><p></p><p>If Xi Lan didn't agree, the only possibility of getting out was to forcibly shatter the inner world.</p><p></p><p>As for leaving quietly? Perhaps tenth or eleventh realm powerhouses could do it. Their understanding of the essence of space had reached an unimaginable level and could ignore Xi Lan, the world developer.</p><p></p><p>But how did Lin Yuan get out?</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan couldn't understand or figure it out. But immediately after, he realized one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was, the Galaxy Master had gone out, and outside, the strongest ninth realm of the Tianyu race, Hun Yi, was in hot pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Without Xi Lan taking Lin Yuan to escape, the Galaxy Master would probably be captured alive by Hun Yi in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan's conscious incarnation in the inner world dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Outside world.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan was relying on the many escape methods of the void evolution path, trying his best to get rid of Hun Yi by moving through the gaps between the spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment--</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Next to Xi Lan, Lin Yuan's figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Hun Yi, who was in pursuit, was slightly stunned, and then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yuan continued to hide in Xi Lan's inner world, under his pursuit, he might be able to struggle for a while.</p><p></p><p>But to voluntarily come out? Moreover, after Lin Yuan came out, he didn't continue to escape, but stood there quietly.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Xi Lan, who had escaped to a distance, also returned to Lin Yuan's side.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master..." Xi Lan's expression was solemn. He could keenly sense that the moment they stopped, Hun Yi had seized the opportunity and completely sealed off all the surrounding spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, now he, Xi Lan, and the Galaxy Master were like turtles in a jar, at the mercy of Hun Yi.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>The many ninth realm aliens who were watching from a distance also discovered that the Galaxy Master had voluntarily appeared and had no intention of escaping.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Galaxy Master despaired? He doesn't even want to run anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems so. In fact, it should have been like this long ago. Under Hun Yi's pursuit, no matter how a human evolutionary of the same level nearby tries to escape, it's certain death. It's just a waste of time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if at the beginning of the pursuit, he self-destructed his avatar, maybe the second avatar would have already formed a small half by now."</p><p></p><p>The many ninth realm aliens discussed spiritedly. They still had no intention of dispersing. Being able to witness the fall of a peerless genius of human civilization, even if it was just an avatar, was an extremely rare event.</p><p></p><p>Human civilization placed great importance on geniuses. Most of the time, geniuses were heavily protected. Even on the alien battlefield, there would be dedicated high-level evolutionaries watching over them.</p><p></p><p>But in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm? The Xuanhuang Secret Realm had a special origin and prohibited the entry of tenth realm and above powerhouses. Even the strongest beings couldn't peek inside.</p><p></p><p>Here, the geniuses of human civilization needed to independently face many dangers.</p><p></p><p>For example, right now, the Galaxy Master was facing Hun Yi's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"The critical moment is approaching." Deep in the spatial layers, Maduo Xingzhe also became nervous. He raised his right hand, and a vortex in the shape of a black hole was slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>The ancient god ancestor of Maduo Xingzhe was incomparably ancient and had long understood the complete rules of time. Even so, in order to create this life-saving trump card, he had paid a considerable price.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the reproductive ability of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Those ancient gods in the depths of the universe were mostly born from special lifeforms. Their talent was terrifyingly strong, but their reproductive ability was pitifully weak. Some unique special lifeforms had no reproductive ability at all. In the vast universe, they had no kin of the same kind.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Maduo Xingzhe's ancient god ancestor attached great importance to this descendant and spared no cost to create this life-saving trump card.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Maduo Xingzhe's true self immediately informed the ancestor of what happened in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master voluntarily appeared?" The ancient god ancestor had a huge body. Just sitting there, he began to affect the surrounding time and space. He stroked his chin and said, "Later, when the Galaxy Master is on the verge of life and death, activate the 'time black hole' I gave you."</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"You must not have any hesitation."</p><p></p><p>The ancient god ancestor reminded. If they acted too late and the Galaxy Master was killed by Hun Yi, wouldn't it be a waste of so much time?</p><p></p><p>If it was too early and the Galaxy Master had not despaired, the favor they did would not be as heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"I'm ready at all times."</p><p></p><p>Maduo Xingzhe nodded. Although he didn't know why the ancestor valued the Galaxy Master so much that he was willing to offend the Tianyu race to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Over the long years, the Old Ancestor had traversed among the few top pinnacle races, not as the strongest, but able to move freely, relying on his discerning eye.</p><p></p><p>There were even two of the strongest who, before they had grown up, had received "sponsorship" from the Old Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Galaxy Master, it seems you know your fate."</p><p></p><p>Hunyi quickly sealed off all the surrounding spatial layers, and looking at Lin Yuan standing there calmly, he actually relaxed and did not immediately move to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Within the spatial layers he had sealed, even if a special ninth-level of the same level as him from human civilization were to rush over now, it would be of no use.</p><p></p><p>With the many spatial layers sealed, Hunyi could completely move Lin Yuan into his own inner world with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, Hunyi was appreciating Lin Yuan with relish, having chased him for nearly three years, he also had some anger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to humiliate the Galaxy Master badly.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master, you still haven't self-detonated until now, it seems you are quite unwilling?" Hunyi spoke.</p><p></p><p>He also knew the Galaxy Master's innate talent and aptitude, and that he would have no difficulty stepping into the tenth level in the future, and might even catch up to him one day.</p><p></p><p>But so what, at least now Hunyi could crush the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>"Hunyi." Lin Yuan also looked at Hunyi and shook his head slightly, "You are too weak now."</p><p></p><p>"Too weak?" Hunyi was stunned for a moment, then laughed, "Want to vent before you die?"</p><p></p><p>Even a tenth-level powerhouse would not say he was weak, being able to open up more than 30 million layers of space at the ninth level, such a foundation was not something everyone could achieve.</p><p></p><p>"I don't even have the interest to talk to you." Lin Yuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had thought that after the end of the traversal, he would mock Hunyi for a while, but now, the gap between the two was too big, and he didn't even have the thought of mocking him.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested in talking to me?" Hunyi sneered and was about to respond.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Hunyi's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Because in an instant, the spatial layers he occupied were expelled by a nearly overbearing force, and a trace of fear appeared on Hunyi's face.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, he lost complete control of the surrounding spatial layers, and all the spatial layers he perceived were occupied by a brand new force, and the spatial layers occupied by this force far exceeded 30 million layers.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>Hunyi was sweating profusely as he looked at Lin Yuan in some disbelief, the brand new force was coming from the Galaxy Master in front of him who he thought he had in the bag.</p><p></p><p>"Die." Lin Yuan's expression was calm, and with a turn of his thoughts, endless spatial layers pressed down.</p><p></p><p>"How could you?" Great fear welled up in Hunyi's heart, and without hesitation, he self-detonated this avatar.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't self-detonate the avatar, Hunyi felt that he would be captured alive by the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>At that time, if this avatar fell into the Galaxy Master's hands and was brought back to the human civilization's territory, with the help of the avatar's curse killing techniques or memory poisons and other strange objects, he, Hunyi, would have the possibility of complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>Tianyu Race's Territory.</p><p></p><p>Hunyi's true self opened his eyes, revealing an incredulous look.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"That Galaxy Master, how could he possess such strength?"</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the spatial layers he occupies far exceed 30 million layers, no, at least 100 million layers, otherwise it would be impossible to make me feel powerless just by relying on spatial layers alone."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xilan, who had originally despaired, suddenly felt dazed when she saw Hunyi being forced to self-detonate his avatar in front of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>What's the situation?</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>Xilan's mind was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>"Galaxy Master." Xilan subconsciously looked at Lin Yuan standing beside her.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't know why Hunyi self-detonated, it must have something to do with the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master has occupied all the surrounding spatial layers?" Xilan also felt the layers upon layers of space occupied by Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although Xilan couldn't be sure exactly how many spatial layers were occupied, the pressure she felt at this moment was far greater than when Hunyi was chasing them.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Hunyi is dealt with."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan beckoned with his right hand, and Hunyi's spatial bracelet fell into Lin Yuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Dealt with?"</p><p></p><p>Xilan felt as if she was dreaming, she had thought of countless possibilities, such as herself and Lin Yuan dying at Hunyi's hands, or Lin Yuan's "elder" suddenly arriving.</p><p></p><p>Or a special ninth-level alien race on good terms with human civilization suddenly appearing to block Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>Or even a terrifying secret realm native life suddenly appearing and entangling Hunyi.</p><p></p><p>Many possibilities, many speculations, Xilan had almost thought of them all in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The only thing she didn't expect was that Lin Yuan would force Hunyi to self-detonate his avatar with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was too incredible.</p><p></p><p>In the distance.</p><p></p><p>The many ninth-level alien races who were watching the show also had their eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>"Hunyi self-detonated?"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why did he self-detonate for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, it's the Galaxy Master, all the nearby spatial layers have been occupied by the Galaxy Master, the Galaxy Master's strength is far above Hunyi's, forcing Hunyi to self-detonate."</p><p></p><p>Deep in the cosmic starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Mado Practitioner's true self was somewhat dazed, the scene that happened in the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was also seen by him at the same time, but it was precisely because of this that he was so confused.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you use that 'Time Black Hole' I gave you?"</p><p></p><p>The huge Ancient God Old Ancestor beside him immediately asked, in his speculation, the Galaxy Master actively showing himself, Hunyi would at most just humiliate him a few words.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't let the Galaxy Master live for too long.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Mado Practitioner, hidden nearby, was very critical, he had to use that "Time Black Hole" at the critical moment to trap Hunyi and save the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>This was the process preset by the Ancient God Old Ancestor, through this matter, not only would Mado Practitioner completely reconcile with the Galaxy Master, but he could also gain the Galaxy Master's goodwill.</p><p></p><p>"No." Mado Practitioner was stunned for a moment, and after a moment of silence, he replied.</p><p></p><p>"No?" The Ancient God Old Ancestor frowned, somewhat angrily said, "Why didn't you activate the 'Time Black Hole'? Do you think this life-saving trump card is too precious?"</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a life-saving trump card, give this old ancestor time, and I can completely make a second or third one, but the Galaxy Master's goodwill and favor, once you pass the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, will you have this opportunity again?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Old Ancestor looked at Mado Practitioner with some frustration.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor," Mado Practitioner shrank his head, "I originally wanted to use it."</p><p></p><p>"Then why didn't you use it?" The Ancient God Old Ancestor raised his voice and was about to continue scolding.</p><p></p><p>"Because Hunyi died, directly killed by the Galaxy Master." Mado Practitioner calmed himself and said somewhat aggrievedly, "I didn't even have time to use it."</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master killed Hunyi."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient God Old Ancestor fell into silence, staring at Mado Practitioner in disbelief and doubt.</p>

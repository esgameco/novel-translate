            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, what is your strength?" </p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Patriarch looked at Lin Yuan, his heart stirring with waves.</p><p></p><p>Before he even opened his mouth to inquire, he had already surmised that it was Lin Yuan who had clashed with the Nether Realm Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After all, that scorching sun-like aura could not be faked, it was absolutely the power of a strong cultivator from the Ancient Blazing Sun Realm. And at that time in that area, only Lin Yuan came from the Ancient Blazing Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although this possibility was extremely incredible - the Silver River Patriarch was a top-tier supreme Patriarch? But it was the only possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, I had a breakthrough," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>This was also the truth. If he had not condensed the key Blazing Sun Seed and formed the Blazing Sun Great Circulation within his body, his strength would not have undergone a qualitative leap.</p><p></p><p>At most, Lin Yuan was at the same level as the Crimson Lotus Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lin Yuan's current true life realm was only at the Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without crossing a great realm, it was difficult to suddenly jump from a Supreme Patriarch to a top-tier Supreme Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, good, good, good!" </p><p></p><p>The Vast Flame Patriarch burst into laughter, looking at Lin Yuan with great appreciation: "With you, the Silver River Patriarch, here, the Ancient Blazing Sun Realm now has four top-tier Supreme Patriarchs, which means there will be more methods to contend for and refine the core celestial pillar."</p><p></p><p>The top-tier Supreme Patriarchs of the major ancient realms were certainly not just four in number, but most of the top-tier Supreme Patriarchs, even the strongest Supreme Patriarchs, were in seclusion, attempting to break through to the Thirteenth Realm. As for competing for the newly born sacred land? It was difficult to attract these Supreme Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>And the top-tier Supreme Patriarchs that the Ancient Blazing Sun Realm could mobilize at any time were only the Crimson Flame, Vast Flame, and Eternal Sun Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Other ancient realms were about the same, with only the Ancient Profound Realm having a few more.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Blazing Sun Realm having one more top-tier Supreme Patriarch combat strength would definitely boost its foundation. It might not be apparent in the early stage, but when it came to the later stage of competing and fighting with other ancient realms, the usefulness would be great.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Patriarch was able to shatter the Nether Realm Patriarch's right Nether Eye, which in terms of killing power, is already quite strong among the top-tier Supreme Patriarchs," the Eternal Sun Patriarch said thoughtfully as he looked at Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He had fought against the Nether Realm Patriarch before and was clear about the latter's methods. Even if the Nether Realm Patriarch had underestimated Lin Yuan and trapped him in the right Nether Eye, shattering it was still very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was a power that instantly exceeded the Nether Eye's limit of tolerance, otherwise, with even the slightest delay, the Nether Realm Patriarch would have time to react and there would be a chance of expelling Lin Yuan from within.</p><p></p><p>"It was just luck," Lin Yuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the stronger the Silver River Patriarch is, the more advantageous it will be for us to compete for the sacred land," the Crimson Flame Patriarch said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the Lin Yuan who was stuffed in by the Emperor to bring him such a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>The other numerous Supreme Patriarchs looked at Lin Yuan with somewhat complex gazes. Originally, Lin Yuan was at the same level as them, but in the blink of an eye, he had become a top-tier Supreme Patriarch? "The Silver River Patriarch, I was still on par with him not long ago?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Lotus Patriarch looked at Lin Yuan, his thoughts in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, he had sparred with Lin Yuan, and at that time, he was still amazed by the power of this Silver River Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But it had only been a short while, and now, not only could he not spar with the Silver River Patriarch, it would be considered a rare feat if he could even defend himself against the other party.</p><p></p><p>"That sacred land's core celestial pillar is just about to be fully refined," Lin Yuan looked at the Crimson Flame Patriarch, Eternal Sun Patriarch, and Vast Flame Patriarch, the three top-tier Supreme Patriarchs, and spoke.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan they had initially formulated, all the discovered sacred land core celestial pillars should be refined by these three top-tier Supreme Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Supreme Patriarchs, their main task was to guard the sacred land core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are also a top-tier Supreme Patriarch, Silver River, you can refine the sacred land core celestial pillars that are discovered yourself," the Crimson Flame Patriarch nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts stirred.</p><p></p><p>The true body's main avatar in front of that core celestial pillar immediately completed the refinement of the last remaining area of the celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Hum.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of refinement,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan vaguely sensed a connection with this core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Now, as long as I'm within the range of this sacred land, I can instantly appear beside this core celestial pillar?" Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Crimson Flame Patriarch and the others had formulated the plan for the top-tier Supreme Patriarchs to refine the core celestial pillars was based on this ability.</p><p></p><p>The top-tier Supreme Patriarchs had the strongest strength, and if they refined the core celestial pillars, they could instantly appear beside any core celestial pillar, which could best protect the celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this instant appearance had to be based on the premise of stable space-time. If they were in the midst of a fierce battle with other powerful cultivators, and the surrounding space-time was disintegrating and collapsing, they would not be able to escape and appear through the core celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Nether Realm Patriarch had brought the main combat bodies of many Supreme Patriarchs to search for the core celestial pillars, allowing these Supreme Patriarchs to refine the outer areas of the celestial pillars, while leaving the final innermost areas for himself to refine.</p><p></p><p>This was the most efficient method.</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, I can feel that the suppression of this sacred land on me has decreased a bit," Lin Yuan looked around.</p><p></p><p>Completely refining this core celestial pillar had allowed him to sense many changes. Previously, his divine ability 'World' could at most carefully examine the area within a hundred billion li around him.</p><p></p><p>But now, the exploration range had probably increased by about one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>This exploration was a careful one, able to detect the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>It could be inferred that the more core celestial pillars he refined, the larger the exploration range would become.</p><p></p><p>In the Capital of the Great Spirit Realm,</p><p></p><p>A manifestation of the Nether Realm Patriarch sat there.</p><p></p><p>The other eleven avatar figures were also quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shi looked at the Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"Lingyu, are you saying that the one who fought with you was the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign from the Lieyang Ancient Country? Not one of Chiyan Heavenly Sovereign, Guanglie Heavenly Sovereign, or Hengyang Heavenly Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>The Linggan Heavenly Sovereign's brow furrowed. Originally, he had thought it was one of the three - Chiyan, Guanglie, or Hengyang Heavenly Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>But the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign? The Linggan Heavenly Sovereign had never taken the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign seriously, even though he was the first to reach the Heavenly Sovereign level from the ancestral bloodline. His growth time was just too short.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Then the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign is a top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign affirmed, "My right eye Lingyu was destroyed by that Silver River Heavenly Sovereign, and my strength is no longer at its peak."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do we do?" </p><p></p><p>The third top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign asked.</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign was important for their battle over the treasure land. With Lingyu, he could restrain many supreme Heavenly Sovereigns and weaken the ancient countries' ability to search for the core celestial pillars, which would indirectly increase the probability of the Great Ling Ancient Country finding more core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to use that precious treasure to quickly restore my right eye Lingyu," the Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"That precious treasure?" </p><p></p><p>The Linggan Heavenly Sovereign's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The twelve supreme Heavenly Sovereigns of the Great Ling Ancient Country had brought some precious treasures bestowed by the ancient country before entering the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>These precious treasures were extremely valuable and could not be used unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>But now?</p><p></p><p>The Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign's right eye was damaged, greatly reducing the efficiency of the Great Ling Ancient Country's search for the core celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>"Very well," the Linggan Heavenly Sovereign said cautiously. "As long as you, Lingyu, can recover as soon as possible, the consumption of those precious treasures will not be a loss."</p><p></p><p>If the battle for the treasure land did not have such a tight timeline of only two thousand years, the Lingyu Heavenly Sovereign would not have the opportunity to use that precious treasure. His right eye Lingyu would have slowly recovered on its own.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the news that the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign was a top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign quickly spread among the many supreme Heavenly Sovereigns in the treasure land. It was impossible to hide, as there were only about a dozen or two top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereigns, and the Great Ling Ancient Country had no intention of concealing it.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River Heavenly Sovereign? The first royal to cultivate the ancestral bloodline to the Heavenly Sovereign level?" </p><p></p><p>In the Great Fu Ancient Country, the Fu Xu Heavenly Sovereign, dressed in a dark robe, fell into deep thought. </p><p></p><p>He was not particularly interested in Lin Yuan's attainment of the top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign level, but was more concerned with the ancestral bloodline at the Heavenly Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>"Even with your strength, Fu Xu, you may not necessarily be a match for that Silver River Heavenly Sovereign at his peak," another top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign said.</p><p></p><p>The Fu Xu Heavenly Sovereign had cultivated a certain supreme ancestral legacy to a profound level, and his strength was among the strongest in the six ancient countries. In the realm of Heavenly Sovereign-level battle prowess, the Fu Xu Heavenly Sovereign was already at the top.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that, it would involve the power of the Thirteen Levels.</p><p></p><p>"But you never know, since it is the ancestral bloodline, there might be some transformation in the future," the Fu Xu Heavenly Sovereign said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Transformation?" </p><p></p><p>The other top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign of the Great Fu Ancient Country raised an eyebrow, though he did not refute it. </p><p></p><p>After all, it involved the ancestral bloodline and was related to the lofty ancestors. Even if the Silver River Heavenly Sovereign's ancestral origin was not the Great Fu ancestor, but the Lieyang ancestor, the ancestors could not be discussed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's focus on quickly searching for the core celestial pillars," the Fu Xu Heavenly Sovereign said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The other Great Fu top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereign nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver River's strength?"</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Lieyang Ancient Country, the emperor also received this news and was shocked by Lin Yuan's strength. As a fellow countryman, he knew that Lin Yuan was not even a Heavenly Sovereign a few decades or centuries ago.</p><p></p><p>Yet now he had directly entered the realm of the top-tier supreme Heavenly Sovereigns?</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, fortunately," the Lieyang Ancient Country emperor muttered to himself, fortunate that he had been quite good to Lin Yuan, essentially recruiting him.</p><p></p><p>In the treasure land, after refining that core celestial pillar, Lin Yuan left a few incarnations to guard it, while his true self continued searching in the direction.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yuan stopped and looked towards a certain direction, where there was a valley with faint golden mist swirling within.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Lin Yuan stepped forward, arriving outside the valley and gazing at the golden mist swirling inside.</p><p></p><p>"The mist in the valley should be the precious treasure nurtured by this treasure land," Lin Yuan thought to himself. The aura of the golden mist was faintly connected to the entire treasure land, like the fruit on a tree, permeated with a strange essence.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan reached out his right hand and took a wisp of the golden mist, carefully examining it.</p><p></p><p>The precious treasures nurtured by each first-class treasure land had different effects, such as the Black Jade from the Black Jade's Nest, which could enhance the strength of the mind and will, or the Infinite Crystal from the Infinite Eye, which could grant the Infinite Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>"This mist..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan observed it carefully, his expression gradually changing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

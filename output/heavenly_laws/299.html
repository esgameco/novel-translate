            <p>Chapter 299: The Ultimate Strike (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"Who is calling me?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was surprised in his heart. This calling sensation was faint and seemed like it could be cut off at any time, but it also gave a sense of being indelible. It was extremely contradictory.</p><p></p><p>"That direction?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked towards the depths of the starry sky. He could feel that the calling sensation was coming from there.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Xuanhuang Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was solemn. The direction he was looking at encompassed many star domains and star alliances.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanhuang Secret Realm was just one of them.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan instinctively determined that it was the Xuanhuang Secret Realm calling him.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because I cultivated the 'Xuanhuang' evolution path?"</p><p></p><p>Thoughts surged in Lin Yuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Since the discovery of the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, countless human evolvers and powerful alien races had gone in to explore.</p><p></p><p>But he had never heard of anyone receiving a call from the 'Xuanhuang' secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan didn't think he was particularly special. The only possibility was the 'Xuanhuang' evolution path.</p><p></p><p>This was also his only connection with the Xuanhuang Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yuan did not take the 'Xuanhuang' evolution path as his core evolution path, it was one of the many evolution paths he cultivated concurrently. There was the circulation of the unique 'Xuanhuang' power of the 'Xuanhuang' evolution path in his body.</p><p></p><p>"The relationship between this evolution path obtained by the teacher and the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is greater than speculated."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just because he cultivated the 'Xuanhuang' evolution path, it produced a calling to him across who knows how many tens of thousands of light years?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this kind of calling actually ignored all the isolation means on the mother planet, which was shocking.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that it was just a slight sense of calling, without any substantial power, but it was also extremely incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had some interest in this cosmic secret realm. Now he felt even more the calling of this secret realm to him. Lin Yuan wanted to know what the source of the call was.</p><p></p><p>Was it the secret realm itself? Or something inside the secret realm?</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I have to enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, let alone the ninth stage, even the sixth stage evolvers, having the ability to travel in the starry sky, began to enter various secret realms to explore.</p><p></p><p>There were still many semi-open secret realms within the territory of human civilization. The spatial layers where these secret realms were located were relatively shallow. Under the reinforcement of powerful evolvers, they could maintain the entrance and exit passages with the main universe for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This was also something that almost all evolvers would do.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan cultivated to the ninth stage, but he had never explored a secret realm. This was the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>It was just that now, the vague calling sensation from the Xuanhuang Secret Realm gave Lin Yuan the idea to go in and explore.</p><p></p><p>In any case, regardless of the result, there would be no loss for Lin Yuan. There was no real risk of death. At most, his primordial spirit would perish inside.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yuan's foundation, condensing a new primordial spirit was not much trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Every time the Xuanhuang Secret Realm opens, it will last for a hundred years. When the time is up, it will close. At that time, all external lives still in the secret realm will die in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"As for the cause of death? It's unclear. Even those powerful ones whose true bodies were outside and their clones deliberately stayed in the secret realm didn't know how their clones died."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the first iron rule for entering the Xuanhuang Secret Realm is to come out before the secret realm closes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought silently in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the time limit was exceeded, not to mention the clone's destruction, other people didn't have Lin Yuan's ability to easily condense primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>The key was that all the gains in the secret realm would also be left in the secret realm again.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't this be losing both the wife and the soldiers?</p><p></p><p>Detailed information about the 'Xuanhuang' secret realm flashed through Lin Yuan's mind. This was the huge advantage of having the backing of a peak race.</p><p></p><p>If it were powerful ones from ordinary races or weak races, even if they were lucky enough to enter the Xuanhuang Secret Realm, the possibility of finally obtaining gains and coming out unscathed was not high.</p><p></p><p>They were completely unaware of the many secrets and taboos in the secret realm, and they might die in some corner.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the human civilization's mastery of a lot of information and data about the Xuanhuang Secret Realm was explored by countless predecessors with their lives.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan left the top of the green mountain, ending this trip of soaking in the Eternal Spring.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the high cost of soaking once, I really want to bring the two great primordial spirits to soak as well." Lin Yuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>The effect of the Eternal Spring, although not as good as the mysterious gourd, was quite rare for enhancing the potential of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the cost was too high, requiring 5 million merit points? This was still the internal price of human civilization.</p><p></p><p>"In the Human Civilization Alliance, merit points can do almost anything."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan once again realized the importance of merit points. Improving citizenship level was just the most cost-effective way.</p><p></p><p>Many resources within the human civilization could not be enjoyed by relying on civilization coins or cosmic coins. Even bartering was useless. Only merit points were the pass.</p><p></p><p>It was just that this required an astronomical price of merit points.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan entered the space passage to leave the mother planet and arrived at the transit planet in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I still have an industry in this central star domain?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan seemed to remember something and glanced at a certain location.</p><p></p><p>Calling it an industry was not very accurate. It should be a planet.</p><p></p><p>Research planet.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Yuan became an advanced scholar, he automatically owned a research planet in this 'inch of land is an inch of gold' central star domain.</p><p></p><p>The value of a research planet was much higher than that of a high-level planet, especially in such a large place as the central star domain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the various equipment, computing machines, and a large group of professor and expert teams on the research planet were all automatically equipped.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's order to this research planet was to take on various problems officially released by the human civilization and use the computing power on the planet to slowly tackle them.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain corresponding merit points.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Lin Yuan had presided over the research planet to tackle various problems of human civilization, the merit points obtained would only be more.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need for this. Researching the many problems of human civilization? It was a bit of a waste of Lin Yuan's extraordinary comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Ten months later.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan traversed a small half of the human civilization's territory and returned to the Milky Way Star Domain again.</p><p></p><p>"Finally back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan crossed five or six hundred light years in one step and soon arrived at the Milky Way Main Star.</p><p></p><p>"This trip to the central star domain took nearly two years." Lin Yuan appeared silently in the Star Lord's Palace, looked at the Yin Yuan Spirit, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>This was still Lin Yuan using the Great Teleportation Technique without stopping for a moment.</p><p></p><p>If he chose to travel by spaceship, it would probably take five or six years to return.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial layers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan closed his eyes slightly, feeling the layers of spatial layers in his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Although most of the time in the past year or two was spent on the road, Lin Yuan's cultivation and enlightenment were not delayed. In the past two years, Lin Yuan had reached 43,000 layers in the development of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that when Lin Yuan first stepped into the ninth stage, the number of spatial layers he had developed was only 39,000.</p><p></p><p>In less than two years, he had developed and derived 4,000 spatial layers. If other newly entered ninth-stage evolutionaries knew about this, they would probably go crazy with envy.</p><p></p><p>"With dozens of ordinary cosmic powers, more than ten advanced cosmic powers, and one origin-level cosmic power to enter the ninth stage, developing spatial layers is simply like playing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan shook his head slightly. According to his estimation, he could enter the realm of 100,000 layers at the ninth stage in ten years at most, or even less than ten years.</p><p></p><p>Other ordinary ninth-stage evolutionaries initially only developed single-digit spatial layers. Later, every single spatial layer they developed could be considered a hard-won achievement. Even after tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years, they might not necessarily develop up to 10,000 spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>"However, while my cultivation is so easy, other martial dao evolutionaries, if they enter the ninth stage, will still need to slowly develop spatial layers."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan suddenly thought.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet cultivated to the extreme of the ninth stage, he still needed to consider the ninth stage of martial dao. Future martial dao evolutionaries would be almost impossible to replicate Lin Yuan's path and comprehend dozens of cosmic powers.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the vast majority of eighth-stage martial dao evolutionaries could not comprehend cosmic powers at all.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the boost and drive of cosmic powers, the development of spatial layers by ninth-stage martial dao evolutionaries was actually not significantly advantageous compared to other ninth-stage evolutionaries.</p><p></p><p>Evolutionaries who could cultivate to the ninth stage must have an extremely perfect evolutionary path. The gap between the martial dao evolutionary path at the same level and theirs was not that huge.</p><p></p><p>Of course, potential was an exception.</p><p></p><p>The final value judgment given by the three goddesses for the eighth stage of martial dao was far higher than the eighth stage of other evolutionary paths. This was because they discovered the potential of the eighth stage of martial dao, and the number of eighth-stage masters who could grasp cosmic powers was much higher than other evolutionary paths.</p><p></p><p>"There are also time rules. I have been comprehending them for the past two years and I estimate I will soon enter the entry level." Lin Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending time rules at the eighth stage and at the ninth stage were completely different in difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The current Lin Yuan could feel the fluctuations of time rules. Almost every minute and every second, his understanding of time rules was strengthening and deepening.</p><p></p><p>"Entering the entry level of time rules allows one to control time acceleration to a certain extent, which has a considerable boost in combat."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Reversing time and going against the flow were abilities that could only be possessed after thoroughly comprehending the complete time rules.</p><p></p><p>The previous techniques such as time acceleration could be used as long as one had a certain comprehension of time rules.</p><p></p><p>"Over these years, the accumulation of boundary-breaking source power has also reached sixty strands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's mind sank into his sea of consciousness and looked towards the Gate of Myriad Realms, sensing it slightly.</p><p></p><p>The 30,000-meter-long permanent spatial rift in the battlefield numbered B0001 had increased Lin Yuan's speed of accumulating boundary-breaking source power to one strand every 150 days.</p><p></p><p>In the past few years, Lin Yuan's breakthrough to the ninth stage and the recovery time after the breakthrough added up to a dozen or twenty years. He previously had thirty strands of boundary-breaking source power.</p><p></p><p>"Sixty strands of boundary-breaking source power are completely sufficient to support a physical body shuttle."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Physical body shuttling was not only a way of shuttling different from consciousness descending, but also an almost unresolvable means of escape.</p><p></p><p>Even when facing the strongest, who could occupy the layers upon layers of space in the main universe, it was impossible to pursue and kill across dimensions.</p><p></p><p>So far, the only means Lin Yuan had seen that could transcend dimensions was on the Gate of Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>"You go to the battlefield numbered B0001 and bring back the Sun Avatar."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Moon Avatar and instructed.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Moon Avatar's progress in absorbing the liquid inside the mysterious gourd had caught up with the true body. Next, it should be the Sun Avatar's turn.</p><p></p><p>Battlefield B0001.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Sun Avatar disappeared silently.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Avatar took the place of the former and looked at the 30,000-meter-long permanent spatial rift not far away.</p><p></p><p>"It's so incredible."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the level of attack of the strongest?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan stared at the permanent spatial rift, marveling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before the ninth stage, when Lin Yuan looked at this permanent spatial rift, he only stayed at its most superficial and shallow appearance.</p><p></p><p>But now, having become a ninth-stage, he could see through the layers upon layers of space with a single glance. Lin Yuan discovered that this permanent spatial rift not only tore open the space of the main universe but also tore open the space in the layers upon layers of spatial layers.</p><p></p><p>Who knew how many layers of space were like this.</p><p></p><p>At least the more than 40,000 layers of space that Lin Yuan observed were like this.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan could imagine that in the distant past, an evolutionary holding the strongest weapon lightly blasted out a strike.</p><p></p><p>This strike was overbearing and domineering, without any technique to speak of. No matter which layer of space you were hiding in, all the spatial layers were torn apart, and there was no use hiding anywhere.</p><p></p><p>This was the ultimate strike!</p><p></p><p>Silver Galaxy Main Star.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Avatar successfully rushed back.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the ninth stage, Lin Yuan's traveling speed had greatly increased. Although the two avatars did not have the World Tree to make up for the consumption of mental energy, it was far incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>"Start absorbing now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan threw the mysterious gourd to the Sun Avatar.</p><p></p><p>He himself closed his eyes to comprehend the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Avatar also absorbed the liquid in the mysterious gourd to the fifth kind, that is, the cyan liquid, catching up with Lin Yuan's progress.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sun Avatar, the Flame World surged, and layers upon layers of space were developed and derived. The entire Flame World reached a size of more than 100 million square li.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the Sun Avatar.</p><p></p><p>Although after thoroughly comprehending the complete space rules, the size of the inner world would no longer be limited by the perfection of the mastered rules and would uniformly reach a size of 10 million square li.</p><p></p><p>However, the kind of rules mastered would still affect the "nature" of the inner world. The inner world of the Sun Avatar was the Flame World, while the inner world of the Moon Avatar was the Yin-Cold World.</p><p></p><p>As for Lin Yuan's true body, the inner world was no different from the normal world.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the size of the inner world will be retained if the Sun Avatar is transformed from real to illusory and returned to the avatar state again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll try it later."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's thoughts converged. "Go and take a look at the Xuanhuang Secret Realm."</p><p></p><p>The physical body of the Sun Avatar was condensed completely according to Lin Yuan's true body, and the many evolutionary paths he cultivated together were naturally the same, including the "Xuanhuang" evolutionary path.</p><p></p><p>Now, in addition to Lin Yuan's true body, the two avatar clones could also feel the calling from the "Xuanhuang" Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh.</p><p></p><p>The Sun Avatar stood up.</p><p></p><p>His figure disappeared on the spot.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The boss has not changed at all, which is a bit monotonous.</p><p></p><p>To share some happiness, I plan to randomly select 10 readers and give each of them a deluxe edition of "Black Mythology".</p><p></p><p>The raffle is very simple - it will be based on voting for the monthly pass.</p><p></p><p>It will start from the early morning of September 1st and end on September 15th.</p><p></p><p>During this period, 10 winners will be drawn from all the monthly pass votes cast.</p><p></p><p>The winners will be selected based on the last 4 digits of the 'monthly pass number'.</p><p></p><p>Each monthly pass has its own unique 'monthly pass number', so theoretically the more monthly passes you vote for, the higher your chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>Greetings everyone.</p><p></p><p>The list of winners will be announced on September 16th. At that time, a new group will be created, and the winning readers can come in to claim their prize.</p><p></p><p>After the list of winners is announced, if no one claims their prize within seven days, the prize will be redrawn, and everyone can try their luck again.</p><p></p><p>So even readers who have played the "Black Myth" game can participate in the drawing.</p><p></p><p>In any case, I hope that domestic games will continue to improve and produce more high-quality works.</p><p></p><p>Finally, I hope everyone will vote more of their monthly tickets and actively participate.</p>

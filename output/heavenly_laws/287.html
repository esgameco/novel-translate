            <p>Chapter 287 Chaos Crystal (Please Subscribe)</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master is paying attention to us?"</p><p></p><p>The invincible eight-stage humans were certain in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Like the No. B0001 alien battlefield, it would be watched by human nine-stage or even ten-stage evolvers at all times.</p><p></p><p>But this attention was just attention.</p><p></p><p>In order to maintain the intensity of the war, even if the human side was utterly defeated, the nine-stage and ten-stage evolvers would not intervene.</p><p></p><p>It was the same on the Feather Tribe's side, with dedicated nine-stage and ten-stage powerhouses keeping an eye on this place.</p><p></p><p>The outcome of a medium-sized alien battlefield had little to do with the nine-stage, because they would not personally interfere with the situation.</p><p></p><p>But the Galaxy Master's attention.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Master was not a nine-stage, his attention was a real boost to the human side.</p><p></p><p>With the Galaxy Master's strength, once he participated, it would definitely have the effect of reversing the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Galaxy Master?"</p><p></p><p>"When did the Galaxy Master arrive at the battlefield, how come I didn't know."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, the Galaxy Master is the stabilizing force on our human side, his whereabouts are probably only known to Star Master Baiyun."</p><p></p><p>Dozens of eight-stage invincible warriors whispered in discussion, their mood obviously much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Before today, Star Master Baiyun had never revealed any news about the Galaxy Master, making them almost wonder if there was a problem with the invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Even with the Galaxy Master here, we should not let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>Star Master Baiyun swept his eyes over the many eight-stage invincible evolvers and spoke to remind them.</p><p></p><p>The Galaxy Master was the trump card, the killing weapon.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't rely on the Galaxy Master for everything.</p><p></p><p>If in this war, their human side was crushed by the Feather Tribe from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Then no matter how strong the Galaxy Master was, it would be useless. Could it be that they wanted the Galaxy Master to single-handedly take on all the eight-stage invincibles of the Feather Tribe on this battlefield?</p><p></p><p>After reminding the eight-stage invincible evolvers, Star Master Baiyun thought to himself: "I wonder where the Galaxy Master is now."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he knew very little about the Galaxy Master, only that two years ago, he received a message left for him by the Galaxy Master.</p><p></p><p>It said that he had arrived and would take action at a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>As for more, there was none.</p><p></p><p>Star Master Baiyun did not dare to disturb Lin Yuan either.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of the No. B0001 battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The eight-stage invincibles of the Feather Tribe stood in the void.</p><p></p><p>The leader was an old man with six pairs of wings on his back, his eyes were cold and his aura was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Feather Tribe members with one pair of wings had mediocre talent, and their height in this life was only at the first or second stage.</p><p></p><p>Two pairs of wings meant their future achievements would be at least at the third stage.</p><p></p><p>Three pairs of wings indicated their future potential would not be lower than the fifth stage.</p><p></p><p>Four pairs of wings meant they had the prospect of reaching the seventh stage.</p><p></p><p>The pairs of wings on the backs of the Feather Tribe contained many incredible abilities, possessing means almost like the "innate talents" of certain special lifeforms.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Feather Tribe could rank as one of the top races in the universe. In terms of population, the Feather Tribe was far inferior to human civilization.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the average level of the tribesmen, the Feather Tribe was also far inferior to the Insect Race.</p><p></p><p>The number of the Insect Race was actually very small, with the vast majority being mass-produced Insect Race warriors.</p><p></p><p>Each Insect Race queen was a war machine, and as long as resources were sufficient, they could be called true invincible existences at the same stage.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, the number of eight-stage invincibles on the human side has not increased." A five-winged Feather Tribesman said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The six-winged old man raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that human civilization is hiding other tricks up their sleeves." The six-winged old man spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Feather Tribe had been fighting with human civilization for many years and knew that the latter would not be unprepared.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Feather Tribe took advantage of human civilization being stretched thin this time and unable to provide timely support to actively launch an all-out battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But if they really felt there was no chance of winning, they would definitely take the initiative to concede to avoid more losses.</p><p></p><p>However, it was just the win or loss of an ordinary medium-sized battlefield, and with the size of human civilization, they would not care too much.</p><p></p><p>Since the human side dared to actively engage in battle now, it meant they definitely had a key trump card, and this trump card was powerful enough that the human side did not think they were bound to lose.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, according to our tribe's think tank's analysis of this war, there are three possibilities for human civilization's current actions."</p><p></p><p>The five-winged Feather Tribe powerhouse spoke: "First, the evolvers of human civilization sought a ninth-stage or tenth-stage secret treasure that could change the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-stage, tenth-stage secret treasure?" The six-winged old man shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the eight-stage warriors who dared to appear on the battlefield, whether human evolvers or Feather Tribe powerhouses, would not carry overly precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Eight-stage invincibles were difficult to die in other places, but on alien battlefields, especially ancient ones like No. B0001, the mortality rate was still very high.</p><p></p><p>The environment of alien battlefields was special, and with the existence of a large number of powerhouses at the same stage, even eight-stage invincibles could easily be overturned.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-stage, tenth-stage secret treasures? They were of high value and could greatly enhance the combat power of eight-stage invincibles, but if an eight-stage invincible wielding such treasures died in battle, these secret treasures would fall into the hands of the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, unless absolutely necessary, neither human civilization evolvers nor Feather Tribe powerhouses would use such treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, in this war, human civilization was already at an absolute disadvantage, so in the analysis of the Feather Tribe's think tank, this was a possibility.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the face of the huge gap in the number of eight-stage invincibles, only ninth-stage and tenth-stage secret treasures had the hope of making up for it.</p><p></p><p>"If human civilization can use high-level secret treasures, don't tell me our Feather Tribe can't?" The six-winged old man said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Second, the human side invited a group of eight-stage invincibles to help, but they are all hidden in ambush."</p><p></p><p>The five-winged Feather Tribe powerhouse continued.</p><p></p><p>"Meaningless." The six-winged old man's tone was calm.</p><p></p><p>In the face of absolute strength, there was no such thing as sneak attacks or ambushes.</p><p></p><p>"Third."</p><p></p><p>The five-winged Feather Tribe powerhouse paused for a moment before slowly saying, "The Galaxy Master may have been invited to come to this battlefield."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out.</p><p></p><p>The six-winged old man's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>Even he had heard of the Galaxy Master's reputation.</p><p></p><p>After all, this person had broken the myth of the eight-stage invincibles and killed two eight-stage invincibles with his bare hands without relying on any "external forces".</p><p></p><p>Although those two eight-stage invincibles were not from top races, an eight-stage invincible was an eight-stage invincible.</p><p></p><p>The six-winged old man spoke from his heart, with his strength, suppressing an eight-stage invincible was not a problem, but to kill one, unless he wielded a high-level secret treasure.</p><p></p><p>"The Galaxy Master... is indeed troublesome."</p><p></p><p>The six-winged old man pondered with a thoughtful expression, "</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"However, it won't affect the overall situation. At most, it will just restrain some of our tribe's invincible Eighth Stage experts."</p><p></p><p>Since the Galaxy Star Lord had never revealed his true strength before, his sudden attack on them would indeed lead to the deaths of some invincible Eighth Stage experts from the Tianyu Tribe.</p><p></p><p>But now, they were already prepared for the Galaxy Star Lord's strength, knowing that he had the ability to kill invincible Eighth Stage experts. With such precautions in place, there would basically be no major losses.</p><p></p><p>At worst, they just wouldn't directly clash with the Galaxy Star Lord, focusing mainly on restraining him. As long as human civilization as a whole was crushed, the Galaxy Star Lord couldn't make any waves.</p><p></p><p>Below the 30,000-meter-long permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's Solar Primordial Spirit suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Lin Yuan's face. This permanent spatial rift on the alien battlefield numbered B0001 had allowed the accumulation of the Origin Power of Myriad Realms to reach 150 days in one go.</p><p></p><p>Basically, in just under half a year, he could accumulate a complete thread of world-breaking Origin Power.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced into the distance.</p><p></p><p>He saw a thread of Lunar Force gathering, forming a figure.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Lin Yuan's Lunar Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the permanent spatial rift on this battlefield increased the efficiency of accumulating world-breaking Origin Power, surpassing that of the medium-sized alien battlefield where the Lunar Primordial Spirit was located.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan then had his Lunar Primordial Spirit leave that alien battlefield and instead head to the B0001 battlefield to reunite with the Solar Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, no matter how many permanent spatial rifts Lin Yuan was simultaneously under, the absorption and accumulation of world-breaking Origin Power only had the effect of a single permanent spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>"To be absolutely sure, it's about time for the two Primordial Spirits to merge into the Taiji Primordial Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan thought to himself that since he had promised Star Lord Baiyun to deal with the powerful experts of the Tianyu Tribe, he naturally had to play it safe.</p><p></p><p>The merged Taiji Primordial Spirit, although still inferior in combat power compared to the true body of his original self.</p><p></p><p>But it also surpassed the strength of those who had just entered the Ninth Stage. After mastering the complete Spatial Laws, Lin Yuan's strength had skyrocketed, and the same applied to his two Primordial Spirits.</p><p></p><p>With the complete Spatial Laws, plus dozens of Cosmic Forces, when facing other invincible Eighth Stage experts, it was simply a dimensional-level suppression.</p><p></p><p>"In these two years, I have been constantly comprehending the fusion of Laws, the fusion of Spatial Laws and Taiji Laws, as well as other Cosmic Forces, and have also made significant progress in utilizing the brand-new power after the fusion of Laws."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Doing so had two benefits.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the power after the fusion of Laws, even if not yet fully integrated, would still far surpass any single means.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the brand-new power formed by the fusion of Cosmic Forces and Spatial Laws could completely conceal the fact that Lin Yuan had comprehended dozens of Cosmic Forces.</p><p></p><p>At most, they would just feel that Lin Yuan's power after the fusion of Laws was a bit abnormally strong.</p><p></p><p>But in this regard, unless they captured Lin Yuan and slowly dissected and studied him, they wouldn't be able to draw any useful conclusions.</p><p></p><p>"The war hasn't started yet?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan glanced at the central location of the battlefield, where human civilization and the Tianyu Tribe were in a standoff.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to go."</p><p></p><p>As for the delay in absorbing the world-breaking Origin Power? Lin Yuan didn't mind this little bit of time.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Tianyu Tribe was successfully dealt with, Lin Yuan would have plenty of time to absorb the world-breaking Origin Power here.</p><p></p><p>On the Galaxy's main star.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, a crystal-clear irregular fragment was suspended.</p><p></p><p>If there were Eighth Stage evolvers, or even Ninth Stage evolvers present, they would discover that within this crystal-clear fragment, there were faint traces of various Laws circulating.</p><p></p><p>The forces of various Laws flashed by, finally perfectly fusing together, then differentiating again, repeating this cycle endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"This Chaos Crystal is truly marvelous. How can it fuse the forces of various Laws so perfectly?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression was one of infatuation.</p><p></p><p>Chaos Crystal was the name of the crystal-clear irregular crystal.</p><p></p><p>It was also the treasure that Lin Yuan had carefully selected from the reward vault opened by the humanoid stone statue Shengji after passing the second floor of the Black Tower.</p><p></p><p>The origin of this Chaos Crystal was that the former owner of the Magic Jade Tower had unintentionally passed by a mysterious place and obtained it.</p><p></p><p>That place had always been in a state of chaos, with various Laws constantly fusing and differentiating within.</p><p></p><p>And inside the Chaos Crystal, it roughly replicated a scene from that mysterious place, with the Five Elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, as well as light, lightning, yin-cold, life, space, and even time, occasionally fusing and occasionally differentiating.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan had observed the reward vaults of the second and third floors for a long time, and finally, under the suggestion of the humanoid stone statue Shengji, he had chosen this Chaos Crystal.</p><p></p><p>Because observing and comprehending this Chaos Crystal had a great guiding effect on Lin Yuan's subsequent fusion of the Taiji Laws and various Cosmic Forces into the Spatial Laws.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary evolvers, even Eighth Stage and Ninth Stage evolvers, would find it difficult to gain much insight from observing this Chaos Crystal.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yuan possessed a heaven-defying comprehension ability, and the effect of this Chaos Crystal far exceeded his imagination in helping him.</p><p></p><p>In just two short years, Lin Yuan had progressed from the initial one-tenth stage to the current one-half stage on the path of fusing Laws.</p><p></p><p>This was all thanks to this Chaos Crystal.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that in the Spirit Realm, Lin Yuan had spent several hundred years to complete the initial one-tenth stage of fusing Laws.</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying. Observing and comprehending the mysterious crystal has deepened your insight into the fusion of Laws.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying. Observing and comprehending the mysterious crystal has deepened your insight into the fusion of Laws.]</p><p></p><p>[Your comprehension ability is heaven-defying. Observing and comprehending the mysterious crystal has deepened your insight into the fusion of Laws.]</p><p></p><p>Choosing this Chaos Crystal, apart from being able to guide his own fusion of Laws, more importantly, Lin Yuan had a faint sense that even if he were to step into the Ninth Stage or Tenth Stage in the future.</p><p></p><p>This Chaos Crystal would still have a significant effect.</p><p></p><p>After all, the fusion of various Laws within the Chaos Crystal was far more than just the Spatial Laws and many ordinary Laws, but also included the Laws of Life and even the Laws of Time.</p><p></p><p>The Laws of Time were the pillar Laws that only Tenth Stage or even Eleventh Stage experts could hope to grasp.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Laws of Time, even if one didn't reach the level of the strongest, they could still achieve a kind of infinite lifespan in a certain sense.</p><p></p><p>"It's too marvelous."</p><p></p><p>"So this is how it changes after being integrated into the Spatial Laws." Lin Yuan raised his right hand, and threads of Spatial Force intertwined with Taiji Force, slowly fusing together.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when they were halfway fused, they suddenly shattered, once again turning into Spatial Force and Taiji Force.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yuan was not disappointed. Through the brief fusion, he no longer had any bottlenecks or shackles on the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>"There are still other Cosmic Forces."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan was about to try them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's expression slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan raised his head and looked in a certain direction.</p>

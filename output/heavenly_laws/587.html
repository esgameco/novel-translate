        <h1>Chapter 587</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's over."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Jade King was suppressed, and he also saw the Spirit Sovereign extend his hand to trap all the peak Venerable experts of the Purple Dream Domain in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Then a scene of him slowly and gently clenching his fist.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sovereign was a core imperial clan that had grown to the limit, capable of exchanging a few moves with true Celestial Venerables. His strength was so great that he far surpassed the peak Venerables.</p><p></p><p>The five or six peak Venerables, over twenty veteran Venerables, and several newly promoted Venerables of the Purple Dream Domain could not withstand the Spirit Sovereign's grip at all.</p><p></p><p>This was the terrifying power of the core imperial clans of the ancient nations, who had grown to the limit, opening up a realm between Venerables and Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the core imperial clans of the ancient nations would rarely appear in local wars. Warriors of this level, who were almost on par with Celestial Venerables, would only intervene in large-scale, all-out wars with extremely high intensity.</p><p></p><p>It was expected that the Spirit Sovereign King would call upon his brother, the Spirit Sovereign, to join the war. However, the fact that the Spirit Sovereign had grown to the limit was something Crimson Jade King had never imagined. The core imperial clans were indeed exceptionally gifted, but to grow to the limit and fully unleash the power of their bloodline was extremely difficult. At least Crimson Jade King had never achieved it in billions of years.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it."</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, Crimson Pine King saw all the Venerables on his side being scooped up by the Spirit Sovereign's palm, and his heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized that his previous decision to order all the Venerables to return to Qingfan City through the spatial channel was a mistake.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the core imperial clan that had grown to the limit was indeed overwhelming, and the peak Venerables were completely powerless against it. However, the overwhelming power of the limit core imperial clan was purely in terms of sheer might, while their control over the rules was rather ordinary.</p><p></p><p>If the more than 20 Venerable-level experts of the Purple Dream Domain had retreated to Qingfan City separately, even if the Spirit Sovereign pursued them with full force, how many could he have caught? Not to mention the Spirit Sovereign would also have to divert some of his attention to suppress the Crimson Jade King.</p><p></p><p>But by ordering all the Venerables to return through the spatial channel, it was like gathering all the big fish in a pond, giving the Spirit Sovereign the opportunity to catch them all at once.</p><p></p><p>"We lost."</p><p></p><p>Crimson Pine King looked up to the higher spatial realm, and although he could not see the specific scene, he knew that all the Venerables had fallen into the Spirit Sovereign's hands, and their fate was basically doomed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these Venerables all had means to save their lives, and even if they died, they would not be completely annihilated. But the loss of their main combat bodies would render them unable to take action for a long time, as it was not easy to re-condense a peak-state main combat body, not to mention the loss of their personal weapons and other things that would be difficult to replace in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Even if they could all take action, it would be too late. The Spirit Sovereign would certainly rush to Qingfan City at the fastest speed and defeat it with his absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>Once Qingfan City fell, the Purple Dream Domain would be considered conquered, and this war could be declared a failure.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this war to be lost so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Crimson Pine King fell silent, mainly because he had underestimated the Spirit Sovereign's strength. Before this, the Spirit Sovereign had never revealed that he had already grown to the limit.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the heavy hearts of Crimson Pine King and Crimson Jade King, the Spirit Sovereign King, who was also observing the battlefield situation, was plunged into ecstasy.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sovereign King was certain in his heart, even if he had known in advance that his brother had already grown to the limit of the core imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>But on the battlefield, there were countless variables, and unexpected incidents could happen at any time, such as the Crimson Jade King also growing to the limit, or the Crimson Jade King possessing some trump card powerful enough to resist the limit core imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>But now? The Spirit Sovereign had imprisoned all the Venerables on the enemy side with a single palm, basically declaring the end of this battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even if the news reached the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation at this moment, and there were experts on par with the Spirit Sovereign rushing to the battlefield, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the capital of the Blazing Sun Ancient Nation and the Purple Dream Domain was unknown, and even Celestial Venerables would not be able to arrive immediately, even if they used the spatial channel in Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>And this short period of time would be enough for the Spirit Sovereign to reach Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>In the higher spatial realm, the originally victorious Spirit Sovereign, looking at his half-clenched right hand, had a slightly changed expression.</p><p></p><p>The "Palm World" was one of his bloodline talents, forming a world in the palm of his hand, and this world would begin to collapse as he clenched his fingers.</p><p></p><p>When the world in the palm collapsed, the destructive power released would be something even peak Venerables could not withstand in a single breath.</p><p></p><p>This technique was not very useful against opponents of the same level, but it was a powerful killing tool against weaker lives.</p><p></p><p>However, now the Spirit Sovereign's expression was grave, as he could clearly feel a force preventing him from clenching his fingers tightly.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was not preventing him from clenching his fingers, but preventing the world within the fingers from collapsing.</p><p></p><p>The world that was about to be completely destroyed was being supported by an invisible force, causing the Spirit Sovereign's fingers to be unable to clench tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sovereign's brows furrowed. Among the many Venerables trapped in his palm world, the strongest were undoubtedly the few peak Venerables - Red Leaf Venerable, Fire Axe Venerable, Qingfan Marquis, and so on.</p><p></p><p>But these Venerables had not been able to block the power of his palm world.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Red Leaf has broken through?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sovereign stared at his half-clenched right hand. At this moment, not only was his right hand unable to clench completely, but his control over the palm world had also become vague and uncertain, unable to determine what was happening inside.</p><p></p><p>Among all the Venerables on the Purple Dream Domain side, the one with the highest potential was undoubtedly the Red Leaf Venerable, who was walking the two paths of chaos evolution, with a great hope of crossing into the Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>In the palm world, the Red Leaf Venerable, Fire Axe Venerable, and other Venerables were shocked to see the scene unfolding before them.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the five celestial pillars and the disintegration of the surrounding space-time had already left all the Venerables in despair.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lin Yuan suddenly stepped forward and with a wave of his hand, he blocked the imminent destruction of the heavens and earth, even forcibly holding the five collapsing celestial pillars in a half-fallen state.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Venerable? He actually has such strength?"</p><p></p><p>"I can feel that the destructive power of the collapsing world is enough to easily annihilate peak Venerables, but Silver River Venerable has blocked it?"</p><p></p><p>"Silver River Venerable did not just block it, but isolated the collapsing world."</p><p></p><p>The Venerables were disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the destructive power of the world's collapse and isolating the world's collapse were two completely different levels of difficulty.</p><p></p><p>It was like the difference between blocking the impact of a raging river and cutting off that section of the river.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River." Red Leaf Venerable looked at Lin Yuan, who had isolated the collapsing world with his own power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the heavens and earth shook the heart of Lin Yuan, as one can imagine.</p><p></p><p>"To what extent has this disciple of mine grown?" The Qingfan Marquis was also not entirely calm. Compared to the other great saints, he knew many of Lin Yuan's "secrets," such as his core royal lineage identity.</p><p></p><p>But even for a core royal lineage, to resist the collapsing heavens and earth around them, one would need to have grown to at least the level of the Chiyu King.</p><p></p><p>And how long has it been since Lin Yuan ascended to the great saint realm?</p><p></p><p>That's right, after Lin Yuan defeated the great saint Leigo, revealing his strength approaching the peak great saints, the Qingfan Marquis had deduced that Lin Yuan had already entered the great saint realm.</p><p></p><p>However, even for a core royal lineage, it takes time to grow after entering the great saint realm, but Lin Yuan? "Everyone, you'd better run far away when I break open this world." Lin Yuan swept his gaze around the other great saints.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if the Lingsheng King did not attack him, Lin Yuan had no intention of standing by and watching the Qingfan Domain fall.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingfan Marquis had been good to him.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Lin Yuan needed to comprehend the war machine and perfect the fusion and devouring of the blazing sun source within his body, and his strength had not yet reached the peak, so even if he acted, he would not be able to affect the situation. It might even lead to him being targeted, affecting his cultivation and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>So he had kept a low profile as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>But now? The cosmic universe and the blazing sun source within him have completely fused, and Lin Yuan's strength can be said to have reached great accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>Even facing a Heavenly Saint, he could emerge unscathed, and in this source world, as long as he doesn't court death and provoke the ancestors of the major ancient nations, he would be able to face everything fearlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Run far away?"</p><p></p><p>The great saints looked at each other and immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint Silver River, don't worry, as long as this world you're in is broken open, we'll definitely run far away."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, even if we can't help you, Great Saint Silver River, we definitely won't be a burden."</p><p></p><p>"If there's anyone who doesn't run far enough, Great Saint Silver River, you don't need to worry about it, just let them be affected."</p><p></p><p>The great saints were extremely perceptive. Through Lin Yuan's effortless resistance to the collapse of the surrounding heavens and earth, they could judge that this Great Saint Silver River's strength was far beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was not as strong as the Lingsheng King, he was still a powerhouse at the Chiyu King's level.</p><p></p><p>A battle between such existences was not something they, the great saints, were suitable to participate in.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, breaking open the surrounding heavens and earth was naturally simple.</p><p></p><p>But he was worried that the other great saints might not have reacted in time, so he reminded them in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked up at the five half-collapsed celestial pillars, and a terrifying aura emanated from him, tearing apart the space in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the higher spatial realm,</p><p></p><p>The suppressed Chiyu King, looking at the Lingsheng King, realized that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Because at this moment, the Lingsheng King's right hand was not completely clenched, and his expression was also constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"There's a variable."</p><p></p><p>Before the Chiyu King could continue pondering, the motionless Lingsheng King suddenly had his half-clenched right hand's five fingers uncontrollably spread open.</p><p></p><p>Crashing sounds.</p><p></p><p>The space was torn apart, and dozens of figures swiftly fled in all directions, unhesitatingly traversing the void.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan's figure stopped not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingsheng King gazed at Lin Yuan, and in the moment his palm world was broken open, he also saw the source that had obstructed his tightening right hand - the Great Saint Silver River who had once ruined his plans.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River?"</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu King was also somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was not clear about what had just happened in the Lingsheng King's palm world.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, all the great saints had escaped and immediately distanced themselves from the battlefield, only Lin Yuan had not left, and it was clear that all of this was related to this Great Saint Silver River.</p><p></p><p>"Lingsheng King."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Lingsheng King and said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Silver River, he..."</p><p></p><p>In the rear of the battlefield, Chaomu King was also surprised. The escaped great saints immediately informed him of what had just happened in the palm world.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good."</p><p></p><p>Chaomu King, after the initial confusion, had a joyful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Great Saint Silver River had suddenly revealed strength not inferior to the Chiyu King, directly reversing the situation of the war.</p><p></p><p>In this case, as long as the great saints could safely retreat to the Qingfan City and rely on the defensive formations within the city, holding out until the reinforcements from the capital arrived, they would have a chance to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>This was an unexpected joy for Chaomu King, who had already prepared for the defeat of the war.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan forcefully broke open the Lingsheng King's palm world, causing the aura of this core royal lineage who had grown to the extreme to show a vulnerability.</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu King, who had been suppressed by the Lingsheng King, seized the opportunity to struggle with all his might, finally breaking free from the restraints.</p><p></p><p>"Great Saint Silver River, I'm grateful to you this time."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu King appeared not far away and expressed his gratitude to Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>He now knew the course of events and understood that all of this was because of Lin Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Without Lin Yuan's outburst, all the great saints might have perished at this moment, and the Lingsheng King might have already reached the Qingfan City.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>The motionless Lingsheng King in the distance was actually able to exert a slight pressure on him, which made Lin Yuan slightly interested.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I hope the Great Saint Silver River will join hands with me to hold back the Lingsheng King."</p><p></p><p>The Chiyu King quickly transmitted his thoughts, he had already recognized Lin Yuan and regarded this Great Saint Silver River as a powerhouse on the same level as himself.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Lingsheng King who had grown to the limit of the core royal lineage, the Chiyu King had no confidence in defeating him alone, but if he joined forces with another powerhouse on the same level, even if they couldn't win, they could at least strive to escape unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"No need to join hands."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yuan looked at the Lingsheng King's aura becoming increasingly terrifying and suddenly stepped forward. "I'll handle it myself."</p><p></p><p>"You'll handle it yourself?" The Chiyu King looked at Lin Yuan, somewhat unable to react.</p><p></p><p>Handle it himself? Before the Chiyu King could continue speaking, Lin Yuan had already made his move.</p><p></p><p>An extremely scorching force field instantly swept across the vast area of millions of miles, this was the Blazing Sun World naturally formed by the operation of the Blazing Sun Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>Below, Zimo and the other great saints clearly felt the changes in the surrounding heavens and earth, but they were unable to glimpse the situation in the higher spatial realm, and the Lingwei King would not specifically tell them.</p><p></p><p>So they could only constantly speculate in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Sun Burning Heaven."</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lin Yuan had fully activated the Blazing Sun Divine Body. With the terrifying foundation and essence of the cosmic universe within him, even an ordinary constitution could unleash unimaginable power, let alone the Blazing Sun Divine Body, a body of slaughter?</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The boundless Blazing Sun World surged forward, pressing down towards the Lingsheng King.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Chiyu King standing by, ready to join forces with Lin Yuan, or Chaomu King watching from the rear of the battlefield, or even the Lingsheng King himself, they all felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The Lingsheng King retreated four steps before finally stopping, dissipating the suppression from the Blazing Sun World.</p><p></p><p>"He actually injured me?"</p><p></p><p>The Lingsheng King took a deep breath, looking at Lin Yuan with a sense of grave danger.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

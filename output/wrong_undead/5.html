        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 5: New Hatred, Old Grudges</p><p></p><p>Burial Ground, by the stone bridge.</p><p></p><p>The lake water hadn't completely evaporated, but most of the riverbed was exposed, leaving only a shallow pool at the bottom of the lake.</p><p></p><p>The dried corpses of fish, merfolk, and water monsters hung on the cliffs, with a nauseating burnt smell permeating everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Only the charred church remained standing on the island. The cemetery, dormitories, and the familiar vineyard and grove that Heine knew had all disappeared, leaving only a few blackened ruins.</p><p></p><p>Heine stared silently into the distance without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>In the works he had encountered before, holy light was always associated with hope and warmth, or at worst, a representation of hypocrisy. This was the first time he had seen such violence and brutality.</p><p></p><p>The Burial Ground was indeed not a place of goodwill, and necromancers who dealt with the dead were indeed disliked.</p><p></p><p>But the corpses in the Burial Ground were bought from the lords. Even without students, they would spend money to recruit more. They hadn't done anything outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Heine had run a side business at the academy for three years and had memorized the faces of almost every student. He had never seen any student secretly taken away for human experiments.</p><p></p><p>At most, it was a gray industry, far from deserving such punishment.</p><p></p><p>This indiscriminate orbital bombardment exuded an air of extremism, carrying a certain arrogance that disregarded everything.</p><p></p><p>His favorability towards the so-called "Holy Light" had already dropped into the negatives.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, Brother Sheep, your hometown folks are really ruthless."</p><p></p><p>"You can't say that. Our Blood Dawn is disciplined. These Eternal Dawn people are pure war criminals."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, you haven't split up yet. Aren't you going to go back and rally the troops?"</p><p></p><p>"Am I in a hurry to deliver merit in this state? By the way, didn't you say this was a broken bridge? It looks like cars can still pass through."</p><p></p><p>"It's just missing the last straw. I just hope he doesn't charge straight ahead."</p><p></p><p>Heine naturally wouldn't do that. He kept in mind all the keywords the other party had mentioned and immediately recalled the "broken bridge" statement.</p><p></p><p>He silently took note of the conversation between the two just now, tied the horse to the side of the road, and connected the three of them with a long rope.</p><p></p><p>"Step where I step."</p><p></p><p>After giving the order, he cautiously stepped onto the crack-filled stone bridge, taking each step very carefully.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly ten minutes to cross the short distance of a dozen meters. After fully crossing, Heine let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then, he heard a thunderous collapse behind him.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the stone bridge had broken into four sections.</p><p></p><p>He was immensely grateful that he had listened to the advice from the time traveler.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the gaps between each broken section of the bridge were not too far. Perhaps they could still—</p><p></p><p>"It finally looks a bit like the bridge I saw. How come there's an extra section?"</p><p></p><p>"The section near the lake island is unstable. In the game, it was collapsed by a barbarian warrior."</p><p></p><p>"Doing a big jump to break the bridge, huh? That's too dumb."</p><p></p><p>Okay, still can't relax.</p><p></p><p>Heine untied the rope and called the two to walk towards the charred church.</p><p></p><p>Xia La would usually stay there for the whole night and return to sleep for a bit when dawn was near.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit heavy-hearted, and his back looked very desolate.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the cellar door under the corner of the church wall was lifted open. Heine was startled and quietly ordered, "Hide," quickly hiding behind a broken wall nearby.</p><p></p><p>He looked back and saw that although the two started moving after his order, they slipped away even faster than him.</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, in the hot air, the cellar door opened, and a stooped figure crawled out from it.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>Heine narrowed his eyes, his breathing becoming rapid.</p><p></p><p>Old Henter?</p><p></p><p>He was certain he wasn't mistaken. Several times when he returned late from hunting outside, this little old man would be waiting at the cemetery gate with his hands behind his back to fine him. This silhouette was all too familiar!</p><p></p><p>He saw this logistics butler crawl out, use a stick to prop open the cellar door, then crawl back in to drag out a sack longer than himself.</p><p></p><p>Then a second, a third...</p><p></p><p>He dragged out four sacks in one go, showing no signs of fatigue on his face.</p><p></p><p>Heine couldn't help but think</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The term "traitor" was mentioned, could it be...</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, Brother Yang, your gear set has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The 'Flesh and Blood' set, with the bone-cutting knife and meat-chopping board shield. The weapon drains blood, and the shield has a weak life-stealing spirit that can be used up to level 15."</p><p></p><p>"I remember now. I grinded to level 16 and still couldn't collect a full set... Is this the third boss of the White Bone Dungeon?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that traitor."</p><p></p><p>It was indeed him!</p><p></p><p>The culprit behind everything!</p><p></p><p>With new and old hatred piling up, although Heine's teeth itched with resentment, he remained calm when it mattered.</p><p></p><p>He was unsure of Old Hunter's strength and had never seen him make a move, but they said he was the third boss of the White Bone Dungeon, so he must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of ghost souls act only on instinct, so restraints are needed to avoid their ineffective actions.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have a system and didn't know how to adjust the "mode," but he thought it should be related to the degree of restraint.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this type of tactic does exist in the tactics of undead mages—removing restraints to let minions act freely to attract firepower. There was nothing wrong with him doing this.</p><p></p><p>Heine no longer hesitated. He slightly loosened the restraints on his minions and gave orders to the two:</p><p></p><p>"One silently approach to attract attention, and the other take the opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Go!"</p><p></p><p>The detailed orders were quickly issued in the form of consciousness, and both skeletons were startled!</p><p></p><p>"I feel less restricted?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the mode was switched? Nevermind, I'll go first, you go around the back!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter had just poked his head in to drag the fifth sack when Sheep-Catcher hunched his body with the shield, stealthily approaching to within three or four meters of him with an agility that did not belong to skeleton soldiers.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly slammed his longsword hard against the wooden shield!</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>This dull sound was particularly piercing in the dead of night. Old Hunter was clearly startled and trembled, loosening his grip and dropping the fifth sack back into the cellar.</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter was so angry that he jumped up and down, glaring at Sheep-Catcher:</p><p></p><p>"Damn bag of bones, you're looking to die, aren't you!"</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the silver ghost fire under the other party's hood, his body suddenly stiffened, and he pointed with trembling fingers:</p><p></p><p>"S-spirit... puppet? You... you're..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you babbling about? Does this body of mine still have an intimidating aura?"</p><p></p><p>Sheep-Catcher couldn't understand what the other party was shouting about, but he saw that this was a good opportunity!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly accelerated, closing the distance of three or four meters in an instant, and his longsword slashed down over his head!</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, Old Hunter regained his composure. He raised his right hand, black as a claw, and actually blocked this sword head-on!</p><p></p><p>Then his face revealed wild joy!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, weak ants, you are not, you are not them!"</p><p></p><p>"Burning blood body, fight for me!"</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter shouted hoarsely. His right hand exerted force and pushed, sending Sheep-Catcher flying.</p><p></p><p>The latter seemed to stagger as he landed, but he used a backward somersault to dissipate most of the impact.</p><p></p><p>The moment he stood up, he half-squatted on the ground, placing the wooden shield horizontally in front of his body, with one foot retreating half a step behind.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time, Old Hunter, bathed in blood light, pounced over like a ghostly shadow!</p><p></p><p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p><p></p><p>The blood claws left deep marks on the wooden shield one after another. The opponent's feet sank deep into the scorched earth, yet he stubbornly blocked this string of attacks!</p><p></p><p>The coordination between the two was so perfect, it was as if they had agreed upon it in advance...</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible!!!"</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter's face revealed a look of horror!</p><p></p><p>It was clearly the first time they had fought, so how did this skeleton completely see through his moves?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly noticed something strange. Why was there no movement at all behind him?</p><p></p><p>He was about to throw down this difficult bone to chew on, but unexpectedly, his throat turned sweet and he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter hurriedly turned around, only to see a thin figure holding double daggers, standing up from the fourth bloodstained sack.</p><p></p><p>His daggers were stained with blood, and without exception, large pools of blood had seeped out from under the first three sacks...</p><p></p><p>"No—"</p>

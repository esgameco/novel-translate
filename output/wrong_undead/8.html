        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 8: The Lord and His Staff</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, the sounds of collisions and inhuman roars echoed one after another.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood reconstruction ritual was interrupted, and Galle's mutation was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Although his rationality could suppress his own desire to attack, it could not suppress the stubborn resistance of another consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Especially when facing a life-threatening situation, rationality was instantly devoured by the instinct for survival, and the "White Bone Master", a pure negative emotion, took control of the body.</p><p></p><p>Heine had retreated outside the door very early.</p><p></p><p>This was not cowardice, this was wisdom.</p><p></p><p>In the corridor, he roughly flipped through the manuscript in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At the top was a letter to the old viscount, and the principal did not know that he had passed away yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Galle also did not know that the burial ground had been washed away by the holy light rail cannon.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, he fell into a coma, and when he woke up, he was in the office, and the ritual was already halfway through.</p><p></p><p>Hunt had long ago used his position to transform the academy into a ritual site, blocking the students on the surface and drugging all the teachers.</p><p></p><p>The storage room was just a hub.</p><p></p><p>Before the ritual was completed, Galle could not leave the academy, and after it was completed... he would no longer be himself.</p><p></p><p>This was also the origin of the "White Bone Dungeon" instance.</p><p></p><p>It was a dungeon that imprisoned the White Bone Master.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these, most of the rest were bills, deeds, documents, and correspondence.</p><p></p><p>Galle was trying his best to prove the legality and order of the burial ground, to prove that he had never been tainted by any forbidden rituals.</p><p></p><p>Such a person was eventually tainted by an evil ritual and died in the body of a monster...</p><p></p><p>Heine sighed.</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, it became quiet inside.</p><p></p><p>A large amount of experience passed through the door and flowed into his body, as comfortable as drinking a mouthful of hot milk in the middle of winter.</p><p></p><p>Heine felt as if he had "leveled up".</p><p></p><p>His body became more agile, his senses more acute, and his thinking more active.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the two people who had already habitually started to summarize and (shift) the blame, saying where they didn't dodge and where they didn't cooperate well, not letting go of even a tiny flaw, Heine thought to himself that their strength was not without reason.</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door, and Galle lay in a pool of blood.</p><p></p><p>When he died, his eyes regained clarity, and his face showed relief and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>After closing his eyes, Heine looked at Zhuo Yang.</p><p></p><p>The latter's already dilapidated armor was shattered on the ground, and one of his ribs was broken, but the chopping board was intact, as expected of a high-quality one-handed shield.</p><p></p><p>He had no feelings for the original owner's father's relics, so if they were destroyed, so be it, but the skeleton's injury made people feel distressed.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't intervene in the battle, he could still manage the damage.</p><p></p><p>The most valuable things in the academy were on the surface and were destroyed by the holy light rail cannon. The only remaining valuable items were some of Galle's collection of books.</p><p></p><p>The three of them made two round trips to move all these books away, and finally buried Galle in the center of the cemetery, erecting a plaque as a consolation.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after looking at the burial ground that had been razed to the ground, Heine carried the unconscious Xia Yala and walked towards the broken bridge.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, until they reached the other side of the fourth section of the broken bridge, it still had not collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It was still waiting for a foolish warrior to bravely leap towards it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When they left, the twin moons were in the sky, and by the time they returned home, the sky was already dim.</p><p></p><p>Heine settled Xia Yala in a tidied room and let the two skeletons continue to clean the entire house.</p><p></p><p>He casually made some things to fill his stomach, then tidied up and looked at the blond boy in the mirror, suddenly feeling a little unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>At the academy, Xia Yala said that he was so restrained that he was almost dull, like a boring middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>But now, the eyes of the person in the mirror were a little brighter, and his face revealed a hint of youthful vigor that matched his age.</p><p></p><p>"After all, there is something to look forward to in life."</p><p></p><p>Throwing away the two skeletons who were emo-ing, Heine rode his horse to the town.</p><p></p><p>The two seemed to only realize at this time that this was a different world and not a game, and their conversations were full of sentimentality...</p><p></p><p>And the uneasiness of not being able to clear the browsing history and study materials.</p><p></p><p>Heine once again strongly empathized.</p><p></p><p>When he first crossed over, he relied on these socially dead scenes to fight poison with poison, and only then did he get through the initial fear and confusion.</p><p></p><p>As he got farther and farther away from home, the conversation got smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>..., but the two were completely unaware.</p><p></p><p>After leaving more than 100 meters behind, the sound completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Heine had a realization - it turned out the voice channel wasn't in his mind, he just happened to be able to hear it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lord's Mansion, Study.</p><p></p><p>The new Viscount George Albert Saven finished reading the letter and handed it to his aide Donald beside him. </p><p></p><p>"...Garry Gittler, the headmaster of the Undead Academy... Alice Gittler's husband, Hunter Gittler is his father-in-law. If I remember correctly, the Gittler family has a farm up north?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that farm that is said to be haunted. When my father was alive, he also had a headache over that place. At least a hundred serfs died there under mysterious circumstances every year."</p><p></p><p>"I see, no wonder they are the famous necromancer family in the Makarla region. Even the headmaster of the Undead Academy had to marry into their family."</p><p></p><p>"This headmaster says the Gittlers hope to turn the academy into a tool for profiteering and conducting evil experiments. He resisted this for a long time, even killing his own wife and contracting the Soul Banishing Curse - what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"I am skeptical about this, my lord." </p><p></p><p>Donald rubbed his gold and red ring.</p><p></p><p>"The Makarla region was a battleground between four countries in the past. Countless civilians who died miserably are buried here. It is their bones that have led to the rampant necromancers in your territory. If it weren't for the spread of the Holy Light doctrine, there might be more than one Gittler family here."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the viscount remain expressionless, the aide continued, "Last night's Holy Light Trial has already explained everything. You should ask the person who brought this letter what he actually saw."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the self-defense of an innocent person, or the dying bite of a sinner? The appearance of this letter, this trial, and this expelled student is all so coincidental that it's hard not to think more."</p><p></p><p>The viscount stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Let Mr. Heine come in."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Heine sat across from the viscount.</p><p></p><p>Donald kept staring at him, his hostility self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Heine had leveled up last night and was now sensitive to death energy and equally sensitive to holy light.</p><p></p><p>He noticed Donald's ring - he was a believer in Eternal Dawn.</p><p></p><p>Little George was simply a younger version of the old viscount, looking even more ambitious.</p><p></p><p>After the pleasantries, at George's questioning, Heine recounted what he had seen - Hunter's actions, the flesh reconstruction ritual, and what he saw in the headmaster's office.</p><p></p><p>He only stated the facts without expressing any opinions, not giving Donald the opportunity to presuppose his position and then attack.</p><p></p><p>Who hasn't seen a few BBC and CNN interviews...</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after Heine finished speaking, he frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It sounds like you sympathize with this headmaster?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I shouldn't sympathize with him, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I just think that before things are confirmed..."</p><p></p><p>"When I have only stated the facts I witnessed, you assert that these are unconfirmed - so you are simply doubting me? Where does your hostility come from, sir? Because I come from the Undead Lands and you believe in the Holy Light?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I..."</p><p></p><p>Donald was momentarily speechless. It was George who said with interest, "Mr. Donald believes in the Holy Light?"</p><p></p><p>"...My lord, this has nothing to do with the matter at hand."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>George no longer looked at him, but turned to Heine.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think about Headmaster Garry mentioning in his letter that he was framed by Hunter?"</p><p></p><p>"My view is consistent with Headmaster Garry's. He has already poured his heart out to show you. As an eyewitness, I can confirm that Hunter left the cellar with five unconscious teachers. When Shira wakes up, it won't be too late for you to ask her too, my lord."</p><p></p><p>The aide snorted coldly, "And how do you explain such coincidences, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"First, let me correct one of your mistakes - my appearance is not a coincidence. I returned to the Undead Lands three hours after the trial descended."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly, let me supplement some content not mentioned in this letter."</p><p></p><p>He pulled up his sleeve and pointed to his wrist.</p><p></p><p>"I was also afflicted with the 'Soul Banishing Curse' mentioned in the letter."</p>

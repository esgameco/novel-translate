        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 9: Silver Market</p><p></p><p>Heine briefly recounted his arduous journey of studying and repaying debts before returning to his burial ground.</p><p></p><p>This included summoning skeletons, but not in great detail.</p><p></p><p>He said these things only to confirm Hunter Gittler's villain identity, and he didn't intend to fully answer Donald's question.</p><p></p><p>Why was the timing of the Holy Light's judgment so coincidental with Hunter's actions?</p><p></p><p>Why indeed?</p><p></p><p>Because Hunter is a double agent of Eternal Dawn!</p><p></p><p>Heine now knows of Eternal Dawn's existence, sees through Donald's faith, and foresees the future of the Makarala region.</p><p></p><p>He knows that the Holy Light is about to cleanse this place—with deliberately created evil, invasion can also be packaged as righteous rescue.</p><p></p><p>But he cannot speak of it.</p><p></p><p>This is not a temporary whim of someone, but the momentum of history, a powerful inertia. Recklessly obstructing it will only result in being crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>So he chooses to turn questions he cannot answer into ones he can, and can answer perfectly.</p><p></p><p>"Humph..." </p><p></p><p>Donald sneered:</p><p></p><p>"If Hunter Gittler is as powerful and vicious as you say, I really can't imagine a skeleton summoned by a student deterred by a burial ground easily killing him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not unfamiliar with necromancers. The feeble skeletal minions summoned by an 'apprentice' necromancer can't even deal with a strong hunting dog. Don't joke around, sir."</p><p></p><p>See, here it comes!</p><p></p><p>Heine laughed: "Want to try it?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Questioning undead minions is questioning the necromancer himself. I request a duel with you."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Donald laughed in disbelief: "Why should I duel you?"</p><p></p><p>"I inherited my father's knight title. I have this right."</p><p></p><p>Heine was already taking off his gloves—he wore them specifically just to enjoy this moment.</p><p></p><p>Little George hurriedly stopped Heine, who had been holding back laughter from the start.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Donald is advanced in years and obviously cannot participate in a duel. How about this, in three days I will hold a hunt to warm up for the Thanksgiving festival. I invite you both to decide the winner by the amount of game. Is that acceptable?"</p><p></p><p>Heine readily agreed, and Donald also agreed with a dark face.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After having breakfast at the viscount's mansion, Heine prepared to go to the market specially set up for adventurers. </p><p></p><p>Silver Market.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his destination, the viscount handed him a badge.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the rewards for handing over those land deeds and documents.</p><p></p><p>A large part of the land under Galle's name was in the haunted farm. He didn't say who he left it to, but wrote the letter to the viscount, the meaning was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Heine was very sensible and wouldn't meddle blindly.</p><p></p><p>At least not for now.</p><p></p><p>He first went to the market and looked around in a low-key manner.</p><p></p><p>It was a bustling place with endless noise, shrewd merchants talking in jargon to each other, street urchins and pickpockets who were small in stature but mature, mysterious adventurers concealing their appearances, all sorts of people and things perfectly matching Heine's imagination of adventure.</p><p></p><p>He was very satisfied, but didn't participate too much.</p><p></p><p>The waters here were too deep, even the local lord couldn't fully control it.</p><p></p><p>He only bought a fully-covering helmet, a red hooded mask, and some soothing potions before hurrying back.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he completely disguised the two skeletons.</p><p></p><p>Sheep-Catcher wore the helmet and Heine's winter clothes, with Flesh and Bone Connection bundled up and slung across his back.</p><p></p><p>He mocked himself for looking like a nondescript deserter, while Teacher Xia looked like a ghost soldier stealing landmines, even wearing a conspicuous red headscarf.</p><p></p><p>"Although I know he wants to take us out, this guy's aesthetics are simply criminal."</p><p></p><p>But Teacher Xia, far from being angry, greatly liked the red mask Heine bought.</p><p></p><p>He was even more excited than when Sheep Bro got the Flesh and Bone Connection set.</p><p></p><p>"This guy understands me so well! How does he understand me so well!"</p><p></p><p>"You're exaggerating, it's just an ordinary mask..."</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand! The material of this mask is hemolytic hemp, a specialty of the Makarala region, perfectly matching the Bloody Pirate set. Unfortunately, by the time the equipment illusion function was unlocked, the Makarala region was gone, it's discontinued! I collected at least 60 masks and none of them matched the set, do you know how upset I was!!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You really understand you appearance-focused folks."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we can't compare to you guys. Your skills are either big swords or big wings, what more do you need in terms of appearance?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes..."</p><p></p><p>This is more like it. Yesterday, I felt like something was missing. Turns out, it was the lack of someone chattering in my ear.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the two of them bickering as usual, Heine drove the carriage back to the Silver Market.</p><p></p><p>His flashy entrance was like a foolish, rich customer, attracting almost all the beggars on the street who swarmed over.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, sir, where are you going? Do you need a guide?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I know all the merchants on this street!"</p><p></p><p>Heine snapped his fingers, and a blob of green, ghostly smoke suddenly appeared, scaring the beggars out of their wits. They instantly scattered.</p><p></p><p>Although summoning a ghost face was just a gimmick and not worthy of the stage, it was still considered spellcasting.</p><p></p><p>Soon, guards came to warn Heine that spellcasting was prohibited on this street.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing his badge clearly, their attitude immediately softened a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, next time you can let us handle these small matters for you."</p><p></p><p>Heine was well aware of the difficulties in the service industry. He tossed out a silver coin and received an even more sincere smile in return.</p><p></p><p>Declining the guards' enthusiastic offer to accompany him, the carriage first stopped at a store called "Focus on Defense".</p><p></p><p>He bought a helmet from here yesterday. Seeing the store owner's enthusiastic face coming out to greet him, he knew he had been ripped off yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what would you like this time?"</p><p></p><p>Heine didn't beat around the bush. He raised his hand and pointed to the set of bright silver full-body armor.</p><p></p><p>"How much is this?"</p><p></p><p>"You have a keen eye indeed!"</p><p></p><p>The store owner's eyes lit up as he began to enthusiastically introduce it.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Xia: "Is this guy crazy? That thing is a blank slate without any attributes. Only Enchanters buy it for recasting. What normal person would wear this?"</p><p></p><p>"You're wrong about that. We were also tricked by NPCs before learning our lesson. You always have to pay tuition fees. Besides, the strength of this kind of plate armor is sufficient. Having armor is always better than running around naked. I think you're just jealous."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, are you flattering him because this thing will be worn on your body?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"You really have your ways..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course. One of the virtues of a knight is honesty."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Heine had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He interrupted the store owner's endless self-praise: "How much?"</p><p></p><p>"8 gold coins. I originally wanted to ask for 10 gold coins, but since you are an honored guest of the lord..."</p><p></p><p>The store owner seemed unable to believe his ears: "What?"</p><p></p><p>"I come from the Burial Ground and am responsible for your orders here. You understand what I mean, right?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen this store in Galley's accounts. The centralized purchase price was 60 silver coins for a set, not including the helmet.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of magic, but metal products in this world were all very cheap.</p><p></p><p>What was expensive was enchantment.</p><p></p><p>All enchantments were prohibitively expensive.</p><p></p><p>Hearing him say this, the store owner's expression instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>He said somewhat desperately:</p><p></p><p>"The lowest is 1 gold coin. The tax side... Anyway, selling to the academy and selling to you are different."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Heine haggling so nonchalantly, the two were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"This guy... seems to not need to pay tuition fees."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this is the wisdom of the natives."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leaving this store, Heine headed straight for the "Magic Leather" he had chosen yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Deerskin boots with a slight enchantment of agility and spirit</p><p></p><p>A cloak with a slight enchantment of jungle shelter</p><p></p><p>A chain mail with a slight enchantment of magic resistance</p><p></p><p>The three pieces of equipment cost 16 gold coins, instantly taking away half of Heine's fortune.</p><p></p><p>He had originally also set his eyes on a green hunter's hat, but unfortunately, Teacher Xia behind him screamed like a pig, "I don't want that". So he politely inquired about the price and expressed his regret.</p><p></p><p>This green hat actually cost 20 gold coins...</p><p></p><p>The half-elf store owner acted indifferent, and the two didn't comment on the price.</p><p></p><p>The prices of magical equipment were never falsified because there was no need for that.</p><p></p><p>When walking out of this store, Heine heard Teacher Xia let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he said regretfully:</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. We came to the market but can't suggest him to do the 'Scorpion Tail Needle' quest. That magic hand crossbow could be used for quite a while."</p><p></p><p>Here it comes!</p><p></p><p>The thing he had been looking forward to finally arrived!</p>

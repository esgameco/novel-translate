            <p>Chapter 3: Return to the Burial Ground</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the twin moons in the sky, Heine felt a sense of being in a different world.</p><p></p><p>In the short few minutes in the cellar, his mindset and perception had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>Those specific troubles he originally had - what to do in the future, what to eat tonight, what to do next - didn't even leave a trace in the face of the more magical reality.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and carefully considered the impact these two skeletons had on him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking negatively, he probably wouldn't be able to sleep soundly in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking positively, the two transmigrator skeleton soldiers could be considered potential stocks, right? At least in terms of learning ability, they were definitely superior to other stupid things.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the biggest gain was that he could finally return to the burial ground.</p><p></p><p>And this time, he wasn't here to sell buns.</p><p></p><p>He had learned all the basic knowledge, and the subsequent advanced knowledge was based on the premise of summoning wandering souls. Now, he had finally crossed this threshold.</p><p></p><p>It was time to return to the burial ground to continueâ€”</p><p></p><p>"Crimson and gold twin moons?? I'm shocked. Could it be that we've crossed into a game??"</p><p></p><p>"It's true. These twin moons, these constellations, and the surrounding large beech trees..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a thunderbolt exploded above Heine's head!</p><p></p><p>Numb!</p><p></p><p>He was completely numb!</p><p></p><p>The painstakingly pieced together sanity was once again burned to ashes, and he almost couldn't stand steadily!</p><p></p><p>Could these magical developments come a little slower!?</p><p></p><p>He had spent three years in this world and was absolutely certain that this was a true different world. It turned out that he was the only one on a fantasy adventure, while others had played games before crossing over, right?</p><p></p><p>The two skeletons had already started discussing the differences between the scene and the game modeling. Heine was so sour that his teeth were softening.</p><p></p><p>He was worried that he would show weakness, so he simply instructed the two skeletons to draw water from the well.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he discovered that their movements were smoother than any undead creature he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this had something to do with the silver ghost fire jumping in their skulls instead of the ghostly green. Their movements were no different from ordinary people. They wouldn't fall on flat ground, wouldn't trip over each other, wouldn't pull up the bucket before it was full of water, and definitely wouldn't stupidly turn the winch until the wooden handle broke.</p><p></p><p>They were like androids loaded with advanced AI, intelligent enough to put one at ease, but also frightening.</p><p></p><p>The two of them chatted while drawing water.</p><p></p><p>Shepherd: "Respected Crownless King of the Sewers, don't you think this well also looks a bit familiar?"</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it, I've really seen this before. The wells in the McCullough Mountains are all in this style. The entrances to the Shadow Steps are all dry wells. I'm very familiar with them."</p><p></p><p>"So we've crossed into a nostalgic server? The name McCullough sounds really unfamiliar. When I started playing, it was already called the Scorching Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, this place was washed by orbital cannons not long after the server opened. Crap, could it be that we'll be hit by cannons right after crossing over? What time is it now?"</p><p></p><p>Heine's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, fearing that holy light would descend from the heavens in the next second.</p><p></p><p>"After you finish drawing water, come into the house and start cleaning the rooms on the first floor from the innermost one. I've placed the tools at the entrance."</p><p></p><p>While meticulously assigning tasks, he walked back into the house.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the "clean" interior of the house, and he wondered if there was any way to let the other party inadvertently discover the time.</p><p></p><p>And they were also illiterate.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a brainwave and took out a copy of the Ebony Town Daily that he had bought when he returned. There was a full-page illustration on it.</p><p></p><p>"Obituary: Old Count George Walker Saiwen passed away today at the age of 65."</p><p></p><p>If that transmigrator was really familiar with the plot, he should remember this... right?</p><p></p><p>It was like trying to revive a dead horse!</p><p></p><p>He flipped the newspaper to this page and threw it on the cabinet where the tools were leaning, but covered the old count's face with a rag.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, he sat on the sofa, pretending to read a book while quietly observing.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to determine if the other party's actions could go beyond the scope of the commands.</p><p></p><p>A dozen seconds later, the two skeletons came in one after the other with water buckets, and sure enough, they saw the newspaper when they took the tools.</p><p></p><p>"Shepherd bro, can you move the rag on the newspaper? I seem to see a familiar face!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? The two of us are in assist mode now and can't do actions outside of commands."</p><p></p><p>"No, do skeleton soldiers also have an assist mode? I thought only high-level summoned creatures had it. Oh no, that's not right. The two of us should be considered high-level summoned creatures, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure... I advise you to behave yourself and not expose your own thoughts, or you'll be ground into bone powder and used to plant trees."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I have an idea!"</p><p></p><p>Walking behind, Old Master Xia</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly speeding up slightly, he bumped into the skeleton in front, who stumbled and fell onto the cabinet, conveniently pushing open the rag. </p><p></p><p>Zhuo Yang laughed and scolded: "You really have something, you can even think of this method, did you see it clearly?"</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely Seventh Master, I've stolen things from his tomb before, very familiar."</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is Seventh Master?"</p><p></p><p>"You even watch Ultraman, seven! seven!"</p><p></p><p>"The burial ground was plowed by the rail gun on the night he died, other places will take half a month, just don't know which day this newspaper is from."</p><p></p><p>Heine's heart moved, and he immediately pretended to be disturbed by the noise and came to the door to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>He muttered while walking to the cabinet, and picked up the newspaper in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out to be here, making me search for a while... Oh my god, old Sai Wen actually passed away, I was just half a day late and didn't see him for the last time."</p><p></p><p>Heine pretended to lament to himself.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xia: "It sounds like it's today's matter, that's too bad."</p><p></p><p>"How unfortunate?"</p><p></p><p>"The viscount's tomb is sealed, unlocking below 50 can't get in. He doesn't seem to be the type to go to the burial ground either, which means the two most critical early grave robbing missions have been missed, damn it's simply a bloody loss."</p><p></p><p>"Then what can we do, who let us be skeletons."</p><p></p><p>"Hey..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Heine had an idea in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He must return to the burial ground, if there is no time to warn, at least he can go to the town chief to report this matter as the "first witness".</p><p></p><p>The opportunity is right in front of us!</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>But before that, we need to make preparations.</p><p></p><p>The cleaning work of the two skeletons didn't last long before they heard the movement of a carriage outside.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xia was stunned: "What's the situation, he won't go out hunting at this point, right? The beasts at night all have bonuses."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe going to town to buy things, this house is obviously emptied, nothing is left."</p><p></p><p>"It's possible."</p><p></p><p>Soon, their guesses were confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"You put down what you're doing first and come out!"</p><p></p><p>The two skeletons walked out of the house and saw two daggers, a sword, half a set of leather armor, half a set of upper body armor, and two black cloaks placed on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The leather armor was Heine's own. At the academy, he had to go out to hunt wild boars. The only meat vendor in the burial ground was old Hunter. Who knows if his meat is from the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>"You take this."</p><p></p><p>Heine pointed to the dagger and leather armor on the ground to Mr. Xia. He remembered that the other party introduced himself as a level 44 wanderer.</p><p></p><p>He had no concept of levels. The strongest transcendent he had seen was Principal Jia Lei. </p><p></p><p>Although the latter had never summoned the undead, he once used a row of bone spikes to nail a galloping wild boar to a tree, which was a shocking scene.</p><p></p><p>The students all called him "Master".</p><p></p><p>The two were muttering while putting on the equipment.</p><p></p><p>"How does he know my main account is a thief?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a coincidence. After all, there are only these few pieces of junk. He can't possibly know that my main account is a knight."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yang, do you think he can hear our conversation? We can understand him, can he also understand Chinese?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless he is also a transmigrator, otherwise he would have been annoyed to death. I still suggest pretending to be stupid to avoid being taken for bone meal."</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>So Mr. Xia put his arm out of the collar of the leather armor and stood there blankly.</p><p></p><p>A good leather armor was worn into an off-the-shoulder outfit, which was too blatant.</p><p></p><p>Heine sighed and stepped forward to help correct it.</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if you could be smarter." He mumbled.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xia: "Brother Yang, look..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't listen to him. If you're too smart, he will be afraid instead."</p><p></p><p>"I understand this. It's the Happy Valley effect, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's called the uncanny valley!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Heine almost laughed out loud, but fortunately he always had a smile on his face, so he didn't have to endure it.</p><p></p><p>Fully armed, the two skeletons looked majestic, with flickering silver ghost fires vaguely visible under their hoods. The black robes were occasionally lifted by the breeze, revealing the white bones underneath, and a solemn and killing aura hit them.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Heine couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>He waved his fist and sighed to the sky:</p><p></p><p>"I also summoned my own skeletons, I am no longer the shame of the burial ground!</p><p></p><p>"What if I get expelled, I'm going to come back again!!"</p><p></p><p>After venting, he waved to the two, as if beckoning his two assistants.</p><p></p><p>"Get in the car, we're going back to the burial ground!"</p>

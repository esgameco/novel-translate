            <p>Chapter 10: We Should Take More Initiative</p><p></p><p>Heine parked the carriage next to "Magic Leather", let the guards help watch it, and then walked.</p><p></p><p>With his years of experience in RPG games, the quest density in this place was only slightly inferior to the tavern.</p><p></p><p>This was also his main purpose for coming here.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was more reassuring than listening to the strategy guide to find quests.</p><p></p><p>"What hand crossbow? Explain in detail."</p><p></p><p>Sheep Bro couldn't help but start asking.</p><p></p><p>"A self-charging magic hand crossbow with poisonous armor-piercing arrows, a maximum of five arrows. It seems there's no chance now."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, it's just a hand crossbow. We can't force him to trigger the quest anyway."</p><p></p><p>Xia Laoshi was silent for a few seconds, then suddenly said, "Actually, there's also a plate armor belt with a slight enchantment of thorny protection on this street, which is considered..."</p><p></p><p>"I think this magic hand crossbow is crucial for you. We should take more initiative."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, is there a face-changing skill in the knight's skill bar?"</p><p></p><p>"This is called sincerity."</p><p></p><p>Xia Laoshi was speechless, but Zhuo Yang's words also inspired him.</p><p></p><p>"We can indeed take more initiative - you said that since he accepted our setting of 'fighting independently', wouldn't it be reasonable for us to trigger memories in certain scenarios?"</p><p></p><p>"You mean pretending to be a high-level NPC ghost from the Makarala region?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, now it's free mode. Later, when you walk to the door of 'Kiss of the Poisonous Spider', stand still and don't move to attract that alchemist to come out. Whether the plot can be triggered depends on this guy's understanding."</p><p></p><p>"Why me?"</p><p></p><p>"The chopping board used by the 3rd boss (Hunter) is made of hemolytic wood. Things like hemolytic hemp and hemolytic grass only grow near the haunted farm, which is a dungeon area that normal people don't dare to go to. He will borrow your chopping board in the name of research and then start the plot."</p><p></p><p>Sheep Bro was alert, "He won't dismantle my shield, will he?"</p><p></p><p>"Good question, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I dug up Seventh Grandpa's grave and was wanted. I spent the first 10 levels in the Whispering Forest, so it depends on his understanding."</p><p></p><p>"Then why would I stand still?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, maybe you're the old father of the owner of this store who died in battle..."</p><p></p><p>"...You really have your ways."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the three had slowly approached "Kiss of the Poisonous Spider".</p><p></p><p>When they reached the door, Zhuo Yang suddenly stood still, and Heine deliberately walked out a few steps before turning back in surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the alchemist Luo Wen had already walked out, also frowning at the skeleton wrapped tightly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He recognized that this was an undead.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wen returned to the house, and Heine also followed after pretending to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>There were no customers in the store, just as desolate as yesterday.</p><p></p><p>When Heine scouted yesterday, he automatically ignored this place and chose the "Bottles and Jars" potion store not far away. He didn't expect there to be a plot here.</p><p></p><p>"You come from the Burial Ground?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"My name is Luo Wen. I don't like small talk, so I'll just say it directly - there's something on your servant that I'm interested in. Name a price."</p><p></p><p>Heine's gaze swept over Zhuo Yang, as if thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Xia Laoshi, this is different from what you said, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, this NPC is at most level 5 and has a life profession. You can throw a flying shield and kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Then Heine will be wanted and spend the first 10 levels in the Whispering Forest?"</p><p></p><p>"You see, the world line has converged."</p><p></p><p>Heine listened with a smile and a cry, but his face was still calm.</p><p></p><p>"Is the thing you're interested in related to Hunter Gidiler?"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Wen's breathing was obviously a bit heavier, and hostility also appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Don't misunderstand, Hunter died last night."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"The Burial Ground was razed to the ground by holy light falling from the sky, and the academy no longer exists."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible... No, holy light..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Wen's face changed drastically. He inserted his hands into his hair and said in pain,</p><p></p><p>"That Gidiler is dead? Dead? Where should I go to find hemolytic grass then? Damn it, I finally escaped from that place!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Let's chat," Heine said, "Maybe I can help you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Heine left the Kiss of the Poison Spider with two bottles of paralytic toxin.</p><p></p><p>Teacher Xia sighed with emotion, "I'm so envious of this guy's comprehension and eloquence. If we had him in our team back then, how could we have fought so many unnecessary battles... We would have been in the first echelon long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Makes sense. After all, your IQ is only at the occupational level. Before I joined, you could even get into a fight with the quartermaster."</p><p></p><p>Heine scratched his head as he listened. What kind of players are these...</p><p></p><p>Rowan's story was not complicated.</p><p></p><p>He was born on a haunted farm run by the Gittler family and spent the first thirty-two years of his life there, only escaping nearly a year ago.</p><p></p><p>In addition to working for the Gittlers, the farmers on the haunted farm also served as experimental subjects.</p><p></p><p>Because of his talent for concocting medicines, he was selected to enter the manor at the age of fifteen, not only becoming a wizard's apprentice but also starting a family. He soon had an adorable daughter.</p><p></p><p>But later he learned that his wife had long been infected with a blood curse, and his daughter was an experimental subject for hereditary blood curse research.</p><p></p><p>Buffered by her mother, her blood could be used in medicine. The medicine Hunter used against the Buried Bone Ground teacher contained this kind of blood - which is why Shiyala is still in a coma.</p><p></p><p>Heine first let Rowan study the chopping board, but unfortunately, this object had most of its properties changed by the potion and could not be used in medicine.</p><p></p><p>So he agreed to bring some hemolytic grass back from the haunted farm.</p><p></p><p>It was for the follow-up to the magic hand crossbow and to treat Shiyala.</p><p></p><p>He did not reveal that he also had a patient lying at home. Rowan was naturally grateful and wept, immediately giving two bottles of poison.</p><p></p><p>During the conversation, Heine repeatedly restated Rowan's words in the form of rhetorical questions, allowing the two players to hear the whole story as well.</p><p></p><p>The two did not disappoint Heine and quickly connected the task with the haunted farm, stating, "This instance comes at just the right time. Going back to the haunted farm is like going back home for me."</p><p></p><p>Now there was no choice but to go.</p><p></p><p>Heine handed the poison bottles to Teacher Xia and carefully instructed him on how to apply the poison to the dagger, like teaching a kitten to poop in a litter box.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the carriage heading north.</p><p></p><p>Heine instructed Zhuo Yang to sit next to him and drive the carriage together.</p><p></p><p>He decided to give Zhuo Yang a certain degree of freedom, but before that, he had to show enough hesitation.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Zhuo Yang was also very nervous.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do, Teacher Xia? I feel like I'm going to turn into bone powder."</p><p></p><p>"From another perspective, you are the earliest skeleton to prepare for the next number."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Heine spoke carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Gareth said I am not an undead wizard.</p><p></p><p>"The effect of the Soul Curse is to prevent wizards from communicating with wandering souls from the underworld, so this curse is not very useful against me.</p><p></p><p>"But he mentioned spirits, which are a stronger class of the deceased. In life, they already possessed remarkable combat awareness, and this awareness did not disappear after death... I think you should also be a spirit, and an excellent one at that.</p><p></p><p>"Those who can summon spirits are spiritualists. I hope that one day I can live up to this title - to understand souls.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why you paused at the door of Rowan's store today.</p><p></p><p>"I asked him about the situation of that store. He said he took it over from an old man who had a son who died in battle far away. He was a great guy, affectionately called a 'solid backbone' by his teammates.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you are related to him, but I have to admit that you are equally reliable."</p><p></p><p>The gentle words were blown away by the autumn wind.</p><p></p><p>Heine fell silent, and the two were speechless for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Heine sighed.</p><p></p><p>He patted Zhuo Yang on the shoulder, "Go inside. Just consider it an attempt by a spiritualist to communicate with his summoned creature, but obviously failed."</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Yang returned to the carriage and spoke after a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Did I pass?"</p><p></p><p>"I think you did."</p><p></p><p>"Then next time, can I hint more obviously?"</p><p></p><p>"I think you can."</p><p></p><p>Heine also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Okay, this story was not made up in vain.</p>

            <p>Chapter 6: The Greedy Adventurer!</p><p></p><p>"Fighting this boss outside is ten thousand times harder than fighting him in the dungeon. Dealing with five elite monsters while also having to watch out for his backstabs is nerve-wracking," Zhuoyang summarized.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the two of them had been chattering non-stop since the battle began. They seemed to be able to split their attention effortlessly, joking and laughing while gradually dismantling and countering Old Hunter's sinister and little-known skills.</p><p></p><p>In Zhuoyang's words, Old Hunter's most common combo was a powerful launch followed by an almost instant chase attack. But as long as you crouch and block with a shield the moment you land, you can endure the frenzied assault and gain a buffer period. </p><p></p><p>He skillfully executed this maneuver. Meanwhile, the other person dealt with Old Hunter's follow-up.</p><p></p><p>Old Hunter would originally summon five corpses, as if using Impure World Reincarnation, but in reality, they were all people on the verge of death. The Blood Curse unleashed their final strength, making them burn their own blood in a "final radiance".</p><p></p><p>However, as Zhuoyang drew aggro and Mr. Xia circled behind to finish off the unconscious living, the battle lost its suspense. The Blood Curse was ineffective on the dead, and Old Hunter had no time to summon wandering souls to raise the four corpses.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could, the combat power of these corpses was incomparable to the living in their final radiance. Moreover, with the Blood Curse completely severed, he fell into a weakened state. Zhuoyang caught up and slammed him with a shield, sending him flying over three meters like a tattered sack.</p><p></p><p>But this battered wooden shield also met its end.</p><p></p><p>Heine was initially eager to find the perfect moment to join in. But when he saw Old Hunter force back Zhuoyang, who claimed to have "8 points of Strength", and pull out phantom claws with his blood talons, he consciously abandoned that idea.</p><p></p><p>It was better to stay on the sidelines and observe. In a battle of this scale, not getting in the way was a contribution in itself.</p><p></p><p>As the battle concluded, over a dozen emerald green orbs clinked and floated from the four corpses into his body. The warm current was much stronger than before. He felt a surge of new strength in his body that had gone without food or water all night, and his mind also became much clearer.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xia walked up to the fallen Hunter and skillfully severed the tendons in his limbs to prevent him from suddenly attacking. It was clear he had done this many times before.</p><p></p><p>As Heine tightened the restraints, the two skeletons loyally executed the order to "leave one alive". </p><p></p><p>He approached Old Hunter. Upon recognizing him, the latter was first shocked, then sneered, "You disgrace of the Buried Lands! Now that there are no more Buried Lands, you can no longer sell your pitiful little trinkets, hahaha cough... cough..."</p><p></p><p>Heine's expression remained calm, not provoked. He remembered that when Zhuoyang had scared the other party, he had shouted out an unfamiliar term.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Effigy.</p><p></p><p>This must be related to the silvery-white ghost fire.</p><p></p><p>He leaned in close to the other man:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Hunter, are these two Spirit Effigies powerful? I summoned them, bet you didn't expect that?"</p><p></p><p>"You, you... no, impossible it's you... you can't be a Pass--"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly shut his mouth and grinned viciously, "You're trying to trick me, aren't you? You can't possibly know, otherwise you wouldn't have been expelled, hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>Before Heine could question further, black tainted blood began seeping from the wounds on the other's face, and his pupils turned pitch-black in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Heine sensed something was wrong and immediately pointed his electric shock staff at him. </p><p></p><p>A thumb-thick electric arc shot out. Old Hunter's body convulsed violently and then went still.</p><p></p><p>But before that, a strange black line had wrapped around Heine's wrist. No experience orbs appeared, basically confirming Heine's initial guess - he could only gain experience through his summons.</p><p></p><p>This could still be considered a cheat ability...</p><p></p><p>Then came a new problem. He looked at his wrist, where there was a black double-ring mark. Inside the circles were two vertical lines, like an opened doorway.</p><p></p><p>His body had no abnormalities at the moment, but there was no guarantee about the future. </p><p></p><p>A thought struck him. He pretended he couldn't see it clearly, rolled up his sleeve, and examined the mark carefully under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>In reality, he was letting his skeletons take a good look.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Mr. Xia exclaimed in a low voice, "What the hell is this? B</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Boss's Deathspeak skill? Brother Yang, have you seen it before?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen it, he hasn't used it on me either..."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's probably NPC-exclusive, triggered by the storyline?"</p><p></p><p>Heine's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't show it, only slightly frowning before putting down his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He rummaged through Old Hunter's body and found a set of keys, then returned to the cellar entrance.</p><p></p><p>Opening the sacks one by one, it wasn't hard to distinguish by the moonlight that these were four teachers from the Burial Ground, two men and two women, including Mr. Luge who had angrily given him a zero in the first summoning class.</p><p></p><p>Luge was a scrawny old man who had a very good relationship with Old Hunter and was one of the few people who could stomach his rotten sausages and bean soup, but unexpectedly he was also stuffed into a sack.</p><p></p><p>Heine activated the Eyes of the Dead, and there were still no lines on the four people - neither green nor silver.</p><p></p><p>Opening the sacks, Heine's body trembled, as if all the gloom of the night had been swept away...</p><p></p><p>"Ms. Shiyala?"</p><p></p><p>Heine took her out of the sack and untied the ropes on her hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>Shiyala was completely unconscious, her face pale and her breath weak.</p><p></p><p>But in Heine's view, the death energy did not come from her, but was blocked by a layer of faint black light when trying to invade her body.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the Lady of Deathspeak is still protecting her believers..."</p><p></p><p>Heine breathed a sigh of relief, he carried Shiyala into the cellar and let her lean in a clean corner.</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Yang stared at her for a while, then suddenly asked, "Mr. Xia, don't you think this person looks like the demon Shiyala?"</p><p></p><p>"You're asking me? I didn't stand in front of her, I was circling behind the whole time..."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, I was wondering why this boss hit me like she hadn't eaten, turns out it was missing a damage amplifier."</p><p></p><p>"If I had known, I would have left an elite monster to give you some intensity."</p><p></p><p>"That won't be necessary."</p><p></p><p>Heine listened to the two's banter while continuing to search for the source of the death energy.</p><p></p><p>Shiyala won't wake up anytime soon, the top priority is to go down and find Principal Jia Lei.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xia had mentioned that Jia Lei entered the dungeon and became the "Skeleton Master", but he believed there was more to it.</p><p></p><p>If there was anyone else in the Burial Ground besides Shiyala who didn't want him expelled, it could only be Jia Lei.</p><p></p><p>Although the principal had never publicly expressed his support for him, Heine was clear that Shiyala's insistence alone would have made it difficult for him to stay in school for three years.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this principal was the key figure in preventing the Burial Ground from becoming paranoid and extreme for so many years. Now that the traitor is dead, he must tell Jia Lei about it, maybe it can change his fate of entering the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>Also, he remembered every word the two mentioned, such as "the most critical grave robbing mission in the early stage", "the set that can be used up to level 15" and so on.</p><p></p><p>The three-year period is up, it's finally time for the greedy adventurer to take the stage!</p><p></p><p>"Found it!"</p><p></p><p>Heine lifted the straw mat used for disguise, uncovered the weeds, and found a locked stone slab.</p><p></p><p>It was completely embedded in the ground, with no handles or pull rings, only three black keyholes.</p><p></p><p>He took out the set of keys from Old Hunter - a full twenty-two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, it's over." Zhuo Yang said, "Arranging three out of so many keys, the result is nearly ten thousand combinations, we'll be trying until the year of the monkey and the month of the horse. How did this dungeon door open originally? When I played, I always went through the main entrance."</p><p></p><p>"Originally it was also the main entrance, the earth element cleared out the gate buried underground. As for the back door, I'm not sure, this is my first time here too... Fuck, this guy is ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst his exclamation, Heine took out a set of keys that were obviously counterfeit.</p><p></p><p>These were naturally his accumulation over three years, the cemetery, library, storage room, meat storage, kitchen...</p><p></p><p>The places he had secretly visited were not few.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly feel that his expulsion was not unjust."</p><p></p><p>"To be fair, indeed."</p><p></p><p>Heine silently accepted the two's praise and matched three keys he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Now there were only six possible outcomes.</p><p></p><p>His luck was apparently not bad, after inserting the keys the second time, he heard a "hum" sound.</p><p></p><p>The stone door slowly opened.</p>

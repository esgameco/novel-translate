            <p>Chapter 2: My Undead is Acting Strange</p><p></p><p>In this world, the concept of the underworld exists, and the summoning technique of necromancers is to communicate with the unconscious wandering souls of the underworld and attach them to corpses. {What? You don't know about this yet | Read COM, chapters without errors | Hurry and google it}</p><p></p><p>Death energy is the opposite of life energy. Withering, decay, rot, death and so on are all accompanied by the overflow of death energy. </p><p></p><p>The underworld is the destination of death energy. The prerequisite for becoming a necromancer is to be able to communicate with the underworld and sense death energy.</p><p></p><p>As long as you're human, you can do this. Heine has no defects in this regard.</p><p></p><p>His problem is that no wandering souls ever respond to his summons.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I'd never deal with the undead again, but I didn't expect there to be a surprise at home..."</p><p></p><p>He tucked a Molotov cocktail at his waist and gripped an electric magic wand as he approached the cellar.</p><p></p><p>Although it's called a magic wand, it's actually a half-meter long electric baton. One charge can release three electric shocks, each enough to take down a 300-pound wild boar.</p><p></p><p>This was something he spent 2 gold coins to have Sheila buy on his behalf from the church. It's currently his most relied upon means of self-defense. </p><p></p><p>From the soil covering the edges of the door and the seamless fit, the cellar hasn't been opened for at least half a year, but death energy is indeed wafting out from below.</p><p></p><p>Heine pulled open the heavy cellar door. Strangely, there was no stench of decay below, but instead a faint breeze.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually ventilated?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly surprised. Tapping his brow, he chanted in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Life and death can both be seen."</p><p></p><p>His vision brightened a little. He saw a stream of gray air diffusing out from the cellar. </p><p></p><p>This is the Eyes of the Deceased which can observe traces of death energy. Most importantly, it can determine if the death energy comes from wild undead.</p><p></p><p>Most necromancers also die to these monsters that drown in water.</p><p></p><p>The airflow before his eyes was steady, without any fluctuations. It was most likely naturally diffusing, meaning there were no dangerous fellows lurking below.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his mental energy rapidly depleting, Heine quickly lit a torch and dove in.</p><p></p><p>The cellar was not large and very dry. He walked no more than a few steps before seeing the source of the death energy.</p><p></p><p>It was two corpses that had "fallen in an embrace".</p><p></p><p>Their clothes were intact with only skeletons remaining, but a small knife was scattered at each of their chests.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Heine was that a silver thread actually extended from each corpse and pierced into the ground!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>He cried out in shock and hurriedly canceled the Eyes of the Deceased, inserting the torch into the wall.</p><p></p><p>His heart was pounding nonstop!</p><p></p><p>He actually really saw it!?</p><p></p><p>After failing to summon wandering souls the first time, Heine had asked the successful students about it.</p><p></p><p>Those people all said they saw green threads on the corpses, some had one, some two, and some even more.</p><p></p><p>Or it could be said that every corpse was attracting wandering souls, but not every mage could see it.</p><p></p><p>Those who successfully summoned had already succeeded the moment they witnessed the green threads. The remaining work was just a matter of course.</p><p></p><p>But Heine had never seen a single green thread.</p><p></p><p>Although the color was wrong now, he definitely saw a thread!</p><p></p><p>Could this mean he could finally complete a summoning!?</p><p></p><p>Heine felt a bit parched. He restrained his excitement and stepped forward to examine the two corpses.</p><p></p><p>He carefully remembered the necessary summoning procedureâ€”you must first sufficiently understand the vessel the wandering soul is attached to.</p><p></p><p>The flesh and blood of the two corpses had already dissolved, leaving only bare white bones, indicating they had been here for at least a year.</p><p></p><p>The texture of the bones was tough and of excellent quality, showing the two had been well-trained.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they could kill each other, did they fight over something?"</p><p></p><p>Heine searched around. The two weren't carrying anything that indicated their identities, nor any valuables, just ordinary clothing.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth mentioning was that the quality of the two daggers was not bad.</p><p></p><p>The Burial Ground offered a course on setting up bone frames for armor, commonly known as "hanging iron", so he could tell the daggers were made of finely forged iron ingots.</p><p></p><p>After confirming everything was in order, Heine took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He opened the Eyes of the Deceased again, concentrating his mind on the two corpses each connected by a silver thread.</p><p></p><p>After two years, he once again recited the unfamiliar incantation:</p><p></p><p>"Dead things can still move seeing life, wandering souls cross realms near my body!"</p><p></p><p>Heine held his breath, staring intently at the two skeletons.</p><p></p><p>He saw the silver threads vibrate, then split into hundreds of fine filaments like blooming autumn crocus flowers, piercing into the ground.</p><p></p><p>One second...</p><p></p><p>Two seconds... </p><p></p><p>Three seconds...</p><p></p><p>A ball of silver flame lit up in the craniums of each skeleton. The one on the left suddenly lifted its leg as if missing a step while going down stairs in a dream, kicking the other one away. The latter immediately sat up from the ground!</p><p></p><p>"It succeeded!!!"</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an unfamiliar voice flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"What's happened to me?"</p><p></p><p>Heine stood there dumbfounded as if struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>What the other party said was... Chinese?</p><p></p><p>The three taboos of summoning magic</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A terrible thought suddenly surfaced in his mind:</p><p></p><p>Don't summon souls that already have a master, don't summon souls that already have a master, don't summon souls that already have a master!</p><p></p><p>But his skeleton could speak, and it spoke fluent Chinese...</p><p></p><p>A transmigrator??</p><p></p><p>The bad news didn't stop there. The other skeleton also immediately exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"I transmigrated?"</p><p></p><p>Oh my, two of them??</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence, me too. Bro, I can hear your voice."</p><p></p><p>"Are you the skeleton in front of me? Damn, how come I'm also a skeleton? Then who is this person? Wait... what the hell, Master?"</p><p></p><p>"You got that right, brother. We've become summoned creatures. Damn, just a second ago I was still on the battlefield. Could it be that my helmet got burned?"</p><p></p><p>They even started chatting with each other!!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what battlefield were you fighting on? It couldn't be 'AGE', could it?"</p><p></p><p>"Holy crap, it can't really be such a coincidence, right? I'm a level 44 Wanderer in the Asia region. I'm called Xia Ge Ai Di Jian (Summer Pavilion Dreaded Enemy Sword). What about you?"</p><p></p><p>"Xia Laoshi (Teacher Xia)??? I'm Zhuo Yang (Catch Sheep) ah, I caught a sheep!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Yang Ge (Brother Yang)???"</p><p></p><p>While the two were passionately recognizing each other, Heine's rationality had already experienced the entire process of burning to ashes and then being reborn from the ashes.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, countless thoughts flashed through his mind. At one point, he overloaded and crashed, but he finally managed to calm down.</p><p></p><p>Heine came from Earth in 2023. He had never heard of a game called "AGE", especially the term "Asia region" was completely unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Taking Yamaguchi Mountain from his previous life as an example, when players identified themselves, they would first say the larger server - Asia server, US server, Europe server, and the like, and then specify the major region - 1357, 246810, etc.</p><p></p><p>Different regions also had different servers, like Burning Card, Phoenix Card, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Although this might be influenced by Chinese, the fact that he said it so casually indicated that this game was most likely a global server. At the very least, the "Asia" scope only had one region, and it might not even be divided into China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, etc.</p><p></p><p>Plus, he mentioned a helmet...</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the virtual online game that no one writes about anymore on a certain online novel site before he transmigrated!?</p><p></p><p>Heine was certain that he wouldn't see such a game in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>So the two people in front of him were either from a parallel universe or from the future.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they were not from the same era as himself.</p><p></p><p>After the initial wild joy and shock, Heine fell into a strong sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>This fear first stemmed from the rejection of fellow transmigrators.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of biological instinct, similar to territorial awareness. His unique advantage was being challenged.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was his own weakness.</p><p></p><p>He had transmigrated for three years without any cheat abilities, and the other party seemed to come from a more advanced era and even knew each other...</p><p></p><p>If it were him, even if he transmigrated and became a servant of the natives, he would definitely keep a low profile, endure, and then slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the other party was even weaker, just fellow travelers who arrived a few years earlier.</p><p></p><p>Although he could still keep them in check now, they were transmigrators after all.</p><p></p><p>With things developing to this point, the sense of security brought by the undead magic was not enough at all.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, thoughts flashed rapidly in Heine's mind.</p><p></p><p>He quickly made a decision. The most urgent task was to disguise himself as a native. Before he had a clear understanding of these two people's temperaments and a sufficient understanding of their personalities and the era they were from, he absolutely could not reveal the fact that he was also a transmigrator and could understand their words!</p><p></p><p>This was his biggest advantage.</p><p></p><p>It only took him a very short time to think of these things. The two transmigrators were passionately recognizing each other and did not notice his abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Listen to my command, stand up!"</p><p></p><p>The two skeletons immediately stood up and stood neatly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were frantically conversing.</p><p></p><p>"Yang Ge, can you understand what he's saying?"</p><p></p><p>"No, but I can comprehend it, and my body also follows the orders."</p><p></p><p>"Me too. We've really become someone else's servants now."</p><p></p><p>"Look on the bright side, he doesn't seem to be able to hear what we're talking about... By the way, how are we chatting? It can't be that the team voice chat also transmigrated with us, right? This cheat is too much."</p><p></p><p>"Look on the bright side, it's better to have it than not."</p><p></p><p>Hearing their conversation, Heine also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They didn't realize that their conversation could be heard by him, and they also couldn't understand the language of this world.</p><p></p><p>But because of the master-servant relationship, they could understand his words.</p><p></p><p>This made things much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>"I command you to pick up the dagger on the ground and the torch on the wall, and follow me to the surface."</p><p></p><p>Heine gave verbal commands, and refined the specific operations in his mind, letting them know who should go to get the torch and who should pick up the dagger.</p><p></p><p>In theory, an undead mage's thoughts were enough to command, and there was no need to shout out orders.</p><p></p><p>But human thoughts changed in an instant and were difficult to control. Language could let him clarify what he was actually thinking.</p><p></p><p>The two skeletons followed the orders while complaining that "this is like a newbie tutorial". Their movements were smooth, without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>Heine's anxious heart finally relaxed a little.</p>

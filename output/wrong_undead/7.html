        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 7: The Psychic</p><p></p><p>The path leading down from the stone gate was deep and narrow.</p><p></p><p>Heine had a good sense of direction. Coupled with his familiarity with the architecture of the burial grounds, he quickly realized that this path circled around the foundation of the church and led to the door of the academy's utility room.</p><p></p><p>Before entering, a pungent smell of blood wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Heine took out the key and opened the door. Behind it was a scene resembling hell.</p><p></p><p>Severed human limbs and shattered corpses were piled into two small hills on the ground, one part flesh and one part bones. </p><p></p><p>Dirty clothes, hair and the blood stains on the ground formed a thick layer of black and brown paste, with flies buzzing around and rats scurrying by.</p><p></p><p>"Holy shit..." </p><p></p><p>Professor Xia was the first to exclaim in shock.</p><p></p><p>"So stimulating? Good thing I'm a skeleton, otherwise I'd probably puke..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a ritual of flesh and blood reconstruction," Zhuo Yang added, "Offering three times the bones and three times the flesh to the Flayed Twins in exchange for one person to shed their mortal coil. This is a prerequisite for becoming a lich."</p><p></p><p>"Too professional, Brother Yang. Do we need to memorize this for Crimson Dawn?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I found a problem with this ritual back then. Human bones only account for 5-10% of body weight when wet. But the bone to flesh ratio in this ritual is 1:1. If the sacrifice follows equivalent exchange and conservation of mass, then there are clearly too many bones added. After the reconstruction, wouldn't one just become a skeleton master?"</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, Brother Yang, as expected of a top student at Incubation!"</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is Incubation, this is just middle school biology..."</p><p></p><p>Heine didn't just stand there and listen. He activated Eyes of the Dead and found a chopping block faintly emitting a bloody glow amidst the fog-like death energy.</p><p></p><p>This chopping block was very sinister, about ten centimeters thick, covered in chop marks, yet fresh blood rolled off it like dew on a lotus leaf, not staining it at all.</p><p></p><p>The edges of the block were lined with iron-clad leather, with a groove in the center and a pull ring on the back, perfect to use as a shield handle.</p><p></p><p>Although skeletons don't breathe, Heine still felt Zhuo Yang "holding his breath" behind him.</p><p></p><p>He was very nervous.</p><p></p><p>Heine empathized deeply. </p><p></p><p>He himself had felt the same trepidation when standing before Illidan's corpse back then.</p><p></p><p>He pulled out the chopping block, pretending to examine it in surprise, and suddenly glanced at Zhuo Yang's empty right hand.</p><p></p><p>Feigning contemplation...</p><p></p><p>A sudden realization...</p><p></p><p>Decided!</p><p></p><p>"Here, you try this."</p><p></p><p>"Great!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Yang excitedly took the chopping block.</p><p></p><p>The block that took both of Heine's hands to flip felt as light as a cushion in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot about this. It's Hunter's treasure, take it."</p><p></p><p>Zhuo Yang excitedly tossed aside the sword and took the knife.</p><p></p><p>The knife was about forty centimeters long, with the blade taking up two-thirds of that length. It was narrow and black, with a faint bloody glow surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm complete!"</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't afraid of scaring Heine, he would have performed a knife and shield combo move, GP defense!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Heine picked up the longsword and called for the two to leave. Before leaving, he tossed an incendiary bottle.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, this ritual was aimed at Principal Garre. The wood and grease in the storeroom were enough to burn it all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Heine had completed a rough search with the two skeletons, basically finding nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the academy was far from becoming a dungeon. Except for the horrific scene in the storeroom, everywhere else was no different from normal days.</p><p></p><p>But for the other two, this was like revisiting old haunts, full of surprises everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"...There should be a trap here."</p><p></p><p>"...This lab actually has no monster spawns."</p><p></p><p>"...This, this, this, Brother Yang's heroic scene, the god of war in the washroom!"</p><p></p><p>"...I always worry a wraith will spawn in the hallway."</p><p></p><p>Every word from the two was a warm memory from the game, but in Heine's mind, it was all an eerie sight.</p><p></p><p>The last stop was the principal's office.</p><p></p><p>The door was unlocked, everything was too calm to be normal.</p><p></p><p>The two were still quietly discussing whether to pull the boss out to fight, when Heine directly pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>A monster with pale bony spikes growing out of its back like a porcupine was frantically writing at the desk.</p><p></p><p>In the vision of Eyes of the Dead, death energy merged into his body like a hundred rivers flowing into the sea.</p><p></p><p>This was an irreversible undead mutation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I was still one step too late...</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound, it raised its head, revealing a terrifying face with protruding bones, vaguely resembling Principal Garre.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't the first time Heine had seen this old man. He remembered those eyes.</p><p></p><p>Garre squinted for a while before recognizing the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Heine? I really didn't expect it to be you."</p><p></p><p>"I also didn't expect you to turn out like this."</p><p></p><p>"Scary, isn't it?" </p><p></p><p>Garre put down his pen, pulling out a smile uglier than crying.</p><p></p><p>"The ritual was interrupted, was it your doing? Where's Hunter?"</p><p></p><p>"Dead."</p><p></p><p>Garre was first stunned, then sighed, "I misjudged. I thought your talents were all in making money. This is your skeleton...hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Meeting the silvery ghost fire in the skeleton's eye sockets, his gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly stood up, the bone spikes behind him propping on the ground, making a rustling sound of friction.</p><p></p><p>Heine immediately released some of the restraints and retreated half a step, hiding behind the undead.</p><p></p><p>"I mean no harm."</p><p></p><p>Garre waved his hand and extended his right hand.</p><p></p><p>"You should have this too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Heine's pupils contracted abruptly. There was actually a mark on the other party's wrist, the same as his.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"I guess Hunter also planted the Soul-Rebuking Curse on you. Everything about it is written in the will. You can read it yourself later. Now, let's chat about your skeleton - while I'm still lucid."</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes were earnest. Heine hesitated slightly before agreeing.</p><p></p><p>He briefly described the silver threads he saw, the summoning process, and the performance of the two along the way.</p><p></p><p>"...After the battle with Old Hunter ended, I had a guess. My skeletons seem to retain some combat awareness, especially when I slightly loosen the restraints. Their performance is simply better than experienced mercenaries."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so..."</p><p></p><p>Garre was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the two had already blown the lid off the pot.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, it should have been discovered long ago. An undead mage's initial minions struggle to kill a chicken...The two of us are obviously high-grade goods."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like we won't turn to bone dust. What do you think he's chatting with the boss about?"</p><p></p><p>"Asking if the two of us count as SSR, then two patients chatting about curses. This is good. In the future, we don't have to act too dumb."</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>Heine was very satisfied with the reactions of the two. He had originally planned to gradually show that he realized and accepted the fact that "undead have self-awareness". Garre had given him a good stepping stone.</p><p></p><p>The principal spoke at this time.</p><p></p><p>"The underworld not only has wandering souls, but also a kind of condensed, tenacious individual. They are called 'Wraiths' and retain some memories from when they were alive, possessing intelligence similar to humans.</p><p></p><p>"Undead mages who can summon wraiths often cannot see wandering souls and are also called 'Spirit Mediums'. The first Gidler himself was a spirit medium, but the lineage has long been severed.</p><p></p><p>"Your two skeletons are obviously wraiths, and you are a spirit medium. The Soul-Rebuking Curse has locked onto your location. Trouble may keep finding you in the future."</p><p></p><p>Heine asked, "Will wraiths have their own consciousness? Will they betray the spirit medium?"</p><p></p><p>Garre shook his head, "I cannot answer that."</p><p></p><p>"Then what impact does the curse have on me?"</p><p></p><p>"It has no impact on you whatsoever."</p><p></p><p>Heine breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>As long as there's no impact, it's fine. As for man-made troubles, he was not worried about meeting the enemy head-on.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Garre's body hunched over, shaking violently, and even making chaotic roaring sounds.</p><p></p><p>Chopping Board took a step forward to shield Heine behind him, his cleaver in hand, eager to have a go.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Summer also silently circled to the side of Garre, the dagger in his fingertips flipping direction.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush!"</p><p></p><p>Heine hurriedly called for the two to stop.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten seconds, Garre recovered slightly. He raised his head, and at this time, a bloodthirsty red light had appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold on for long..."</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the sorted paper bag on the table and threw it to Heine.</p><p></p><p>"Everything I want to say is in here. Give them to Old Saiwen.</p><p></p><p>"Then, have your skeletons kill me."</p><p></p><p>Heine was filled with solemn respect.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate and resolutely gave the order:</p><p></p><p>"Do it!"</p>

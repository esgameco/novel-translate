        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chapter 4: First Battle and Experience Orbs</p><p></p><p>The reason why adults collapse in an instant is because they accumulate stress on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many buns Heine sold in these three years, how much money he earned, or how many fresh things he came up with, he was always a freak who was discriminated against and disliked in the Burial Ground.</p><p></p><p>So his roar was not entirely an act, and it was unclear how much repression and bitterness were mixed in.</p><p></p><p>But they were all released cleanly with his angry shout to the sky.</p><p></p><p>When the carriage was bumping along, his two skeletons were discussing frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Xia, do you know this NPC? This guy sounds like he was expelled for not being able to summon skeletons. Shouldn't this kind of thing be considered a celebrity among NPCs?"</p><p></p><p>"Not to that extent. He's not a failed art student. Besides, not long after the server opened, the Burial Ground turned into a dungeon. I only remember one traitor and the Skeleton Master among the NPCs, and both of them entered the dungeon."</p><p></p><p>"White Bone Dungeon? The Broken Bridge?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Burial Ground was originally an island in the middle of a lake, and the Broken Bridge was the only road connecting to it. After the rail gun dried up the surrounding lake water, the stone bridge was also broken, so it became one of the three great terrain killing holy lands of the Scorching Valley, and the NPCs in the dungeon are the survivors that the traitor tricked into going in."</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Light Rail Gun is truly terrifying... No, wait, doesn't that mean we're rushing to our deaths?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I remember very clearly, it will be 'dawn' soon."</p><p></p><p>"What dawn?"</p><p></p><p>Heine, who was sitting outside driving the carriage, couldn't help but look up at the sky when he heard this sentence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a meteor slid from afar and fell straight ahead. Then, a scorching and dazzling pillar of light suddenly rose, piercing the clouds and illuminating the entire night sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky really "dawned".</p><p></p><p>So this is what they meant by the rail gun...</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, even though they couldn't stick their heads out, they could see the momentary wonder outside the window.</p><p></p><p>"See, that's what I meant." Teacher Xia sighed, "When I crawled out of Seventh Master's tomb, I happened to see this scene. It was too shocking."</p><p></p><p>"What about after that? Is the holy light scalding there?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the first-generation Holy Light Rail Gun, different from the one in the Ash Plains. There is no radiation residue."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to their conversation, Heine had mixed feelings.</p><p></p><p>The Burial Ground was razed to the ground by the holy light, even the lake water was dried up. I'm afraid Teacher Shiyala is also...</p><p></p><p>At that time, the phrase "definitely next time" was just a joke. Who would have thought it would come true with one sentence?</p><p></p><p>He quickly broke away from his sentimentality and cracked the whip to speed up the carriage.</p><p></p><p>In the violent bumps, he began to ponder the "traitor" and Skeleton Master mentioned by the other party.</p><p></p><p>The latter was the principal Jia Lei, but who was the traitor?</p><p></p><p>It sounded like tonight's experience in the Burial Ground seemed to be the work of an inside man?</p><p></p><p>Heine did not have a very thorough understanding of this world. Although he tried hard, books and reading were enjoyments that only belonged to those in high positions, and knowledge was directly proportional to social status.</p><p></p><p>Before he could figure it out, wolf howls suddenly came from the bushes beside him, and pairs of eerie green eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>Heine was startled in his heart. It seemed that the beasts in the forest were also disturbed by the holy light.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>He called the two skeletons to leave the carriage. Sheep Bro was on alert beside him, while the other climbed onto the roof of the carriage to monitor the left and right.</p><p></p><p>"Oh wow, here comes the action, and it's an encounter battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Sheep Bro, protect that horse well. The gray wolves will definitely pounce on the horse first. This guy obviously doesn't have much combat experience."</p><p></p><p>Heine thought to himself, that's right, this horse can't be startled!</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't directly do as they said, so he simply jumped onto the horse's back.</p><p></p><p>"You come and take my position!"</p><p></p><p>He instructed Teacher Xia on the roof of the carriage to jump to his original position, and the two supported each other.</p><p></p><p>Sheep Bro laughed, "You see, he can think of that, can't he?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Take back those words... be careful!"</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow suddenly pounced from the side, startling the horse which tried to turn its head to the right. Heine hurriedly yanked hard on the reins. </p><p></p><p>Just as the wolf's jaws were about to clamp onto the horse's rear, a flash of sword light passed by, splattering blood. The beast didn't even have time to let out a miserable howl before its head and body were in different places.</p><p></p><p>Heine and his skeleton soldiers were all stunned!</p><p></p><p>He was shocked that the combat power of these two was actually so strong. Ordinary trainees' skeletons would embarrassingly be carried off by gray wolves, and zombies fared even worse, with hyenas and crows also eyeing them.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two fellows:</p><p></p><p>"Damn, the sharpness of your sword is too high, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"And the strength too! This bro has at least 8 points of Strength! Invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"That high? I also want to test out my own attributes. Damn, my hands are itching..."</p><p></p><p>"Assist mode is like this. Look on the bright side, at least it's not passive mode... watch out!"</p><p></p><p>Another gray wolf pounced over, this time going for the thigh bone Teacher Xia had accidentally exposed. </p><p></p><p>It was probably starving.</p><p></p><p>"Speak of the devil!"</p><p></p><p>Splash!</p><p></p><p>The gray wolf's belly was instantly torn open, a large hole with its internal organs pouring out like a torrential downpour, and a strong fishy stench rapidly spread.</p><p></p><p>"Awesome! 8 points of Agility, I'm certain this speed requires 8 Agility, and around 6 Strength too! These two daggers are awesome, at least Assassins' Guild starter weapon level!"</p><p></p><p>"With this combat power, wouldn't clearing low level dungeons be a cakewalk?"</p><p></p><p>"If you tank, there definitely won't be any issues, but are you sure you won't expose yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"True... forget it, pretend I didn't say anything."</p><p></p><p>Heine had no time to pay attention to their exchange. His focus was completely drawn to the wolf that had just been slain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't notice the first wolf that died too close by, but this time he saw it.</p><p></p><p>Two glowing green dots floated over from the wolf's body and merged into his own, an extremely faint warmth spreading from his chest.</p><p></p><p>This was...</p><p></p><p>Experience?</p><p></p><p>It was extremely similar to the experience orbs in MMOs, accompanied by pleasant dings.</p><p></p><p>In the past when he killed wild boars, there was nothing like this.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he focused his gaze on the skeletons.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they...</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, Yang bro."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"We killed the monsters but didn't get any experience, no system, no status screen, nothing activated. This really turned into a hardcore nostalgia server..."</p><p></p><p>"Come on, we've already transmigrated as skeletons, and you still care about that stuff?"</p><p></p><p>So they can't see this?</p><p></p><p>Heine immediately had an odd thought. Could it be that he only gets experience for kills by his summoned creatures?</p><p></p><p>He placed his hand on the electric shock magic staff at his waist, staring at the woods on the side, preparing to make a comparison.</p><p></p><p>However, with the two lead wolves dying miserably one after another, the trailing wolf pack had already given up on this difficult meal. After a howl from the pack leader, they quickly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a long time with no more coming to seek death, Heine felt quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Nicely done! My skeletons are indeed much stronger than those fellows'."</p><p></p><p>He praised, then seemed to think of something, his expression suddenly becoming dejected.</p><p></p><p>"The academy... it should still be there, right...?"</p><p></p><p>He somewhat irritably chased the skeletons back into the carriage, then sat back in his original spot, fiercely whipping the reins as if venting his anger on the pitiful horses.</p><p></p><p>Inside the increasingly bumpy carriage, the two transmigrators didn't speak for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is quite pitiful too," Xia said. "Getting expelled for not being able to summon undead, now finally able to show off, but the school is gone..."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he's even started talking to the two of us. The pressure must be immense."</p><p></p><p>"Well, who hasn't talked to furniture before?"</p><p></p><p>The air was quiet for a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>Yang: "Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Ha, haha, how could that be? I- I was just joking..."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, come to think of it, how could anyone really talk to furniture..."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p>

            <p>Chapter 1: The Shame of the Burial Ground</p><p></p><p>In the early morning, the frost-covered thistles in front of the cemetery gate made the black iron railings look even more chilling than usual.</p><p></p><p>In August of 772, when most of the Makarah Basin had not yet harvested the last crop of the year, Heine had to put on a sweater and a thick windbreaker.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was due to the necromancy magic, but autumn often came earlier to the Burial Ground than other places.</p><p></p><p>Heine rubbed his cold cheeks and tightened the collar of his windbreaker. </p><p></p><p>When the first bell rang, he pulled out the latch, kicked open the iron gate, and pushed his homemade food cart out of the dormitory area right next to the cemetery, heading straight for the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the food cart appeared, it became the center of attention. The students who had been waiting eagerly surged forward like a tide of corpses.</p><p></p><p>Wizards who were constantly exposed to the aura of death usually had dull expressions, numb nerves, irreversible degeneration of their body structures, taste buds and other senses due to the damage caused by the death aura.</p><p></p><p>But the Burial Ground was just a necromancy academy, and while the students were not proficient in their arts, they were not deeply affected either.</p><p></p><p>So even though they were used to cold food and didn't care about the taste, very few people could refuse when steaming hot buns with fillings made of three kinds of chopped chili peppers stir-fried with dried pickled meat appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Don't push, there's plenty for everyone today," Heine shouted symbolically, lifting the lid of the pot. Instantly, more than a dozen skinny, pale arms reached in, braving the scalding steam.</p><p></p><p>Deadened nerve endings feared neither heat nor cold, which was also one of the "benefits" of being tainted by the death aura to some extent.</p><p></p><p>On the last day of doing business, he didn't bother to keep an eye on who didn't pay.</p><p></p><p>In three years, he had not only earned back his tuition with these "unorthodox methods", but also made an extra 60 gold coins, about four times the amount of three years' tuition. He didn't care about the small change.</p><p></p><p>These people were breathing heavily from the spiciness, their faces flushed from eating.</p><p></p><p>The spicy buns were not tasty, being both hot and spicy, and the filling didn't even have salt in it, but it was enough to stimulate their dull nerves and satisfy their desire to chew.</p><p></p><p>Heine was a little grateful that he hadn't turned out like this.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking about?" </p><p></p><p>The speaker appeared behind him, a mature and elegant woman.</p><p></p><p>She was wrapped in a thick cotton magic robe, her black hair neatly coiled up, her neck slender. From her red eye shadow to her elastic, fair skin, everything about her was at odds with the Burial Ground.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Shiyala? I thought you weren't coming." </p><p></p><p>Heine took out a warm paper package from his windbreaker pocket, containing three normal-flavored buns inside.</p><p></p><p>It proved that he could also make something edible for people.</p><p></p><p>Shiyala took the breakfast and thanked him, her face showing regret and guilt.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, I really couldn't keep your student status this year, even though your grades were so excellent."</p><p></p><p>"It's not your fault. Besides, I only got perfect scores in your general education and culture classes. Although my grades in spells, casting, and alchemy were good, they weren't important. On the other hand, summoning..." </p><p></p><p>Heine laughed self-deprecatingly, "You know, that's the core reason I was persuaded to drop out. The Burial Ground will not tolerate a necromancer who can't even control a skeleton selling buns in the cafeteria every day."</p><p></p><p>His gaze went past Shiyala to the short, stout old man in a dirty apron behind her.</p><p></p><p>He looked extremely slovenly, with flies buzzing around him, staring resentfully at the crowd here, especially at the two people talking.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Shiyala noticed his gaze and looked back.</p><p></p><p>"Well, indeed, no one wants you to leave more than Old Hent. Ever since you started selling these meat pies, hardly anyone has eaten his sausages and rye bran bread."</p><p></p><p>Heine smiled noncommittally. </p><p></p><p>Old Hent was in charge of the cafeteria and was also the academy's logistics director.</p><p></p><p>He had definitely played a part in getting himself expelled so quickly.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted casually for a while longer, and Shiyala was called away by someone else. Before leaving, she told him to "wait for me at the gate at noon."</p><p></p><p>By this time, the buns on the food cart were basically sold out, and the students had mostly left. Heine pushed the cart that had accompanied him for three years to Old Hent.</p><p></p><p>"I'll sell you this little cart for ten gold coins," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Ten gold coins? You madman, you're an unreasonable lunatic." Old Hent exclaimed, glaring at him and turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't buy it, I'll sell it to someone else for a copper coin, along with a complete tutorial. Then no one will eat your clean and hygienic rotten sausages."</p><p></p><p>The old man turned back angrily, staring at him resentfully.</p><p></p><p>"One silver coin, that's the most I'll pay for this pile of junk!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten silver coins, or I'll give it away for free to someone else."</p><p></p><p>"You damn vampire!" </p><p></p><p>He cursed and threw ten dirty silver coins into the money jar.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's yours. Goodbye, Mr. Hent, I wish you good health." </p><p></p><p>Heine smiled happily. The cart wasn't worth much, he just wanted to disgust the other party, nothing else.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost, the Burial Ground doesn't welcome you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At noon, the sun was shining brightly, but the air was still cold.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped at the bridgehead. The Burial Ground was surrounded by lakes on all sides, and this was the only way out.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this place was originally a battlefield, and later it was turned into a dungeon because the terrain was treacherous and inconvenient to escape from. Many people died in the dungeon, resulting in an excess of death aura, which led to the later Burial Ground.</p><p></p><p>If you stood on the shore and looked out, few people would associate this quiet lake island with necromancers.</p><p></p><p>Heine, who had packed up, leaned against the side of the carriage, staring blankly at the statues in the cemetery, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity..." </p><p></p><p>In the end, he still failed to touch the truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Being able to save a considerable amount of wealth while studying for three years would be considered an extraordinary achievement for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But as a transmigrator, Heine's pursuit was not limited to this.</p><p></p><p>He knew well that this world was much more dangerous than his previous life, and ordinary people could die at any time without a sound.</p><p></p><p>So he worked very hard, getting high scores in every subject except summoning, but he just couldn't summon the undead.</p><p></p><p>Even the least talented students could make a corpse sit up, but he couldn't even make a skeleton move its fingers.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't have any cheats - of course, maybe he just hadn't discovered them. What if the golden finger was to transmigrate again after death?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had no chance to try it for the time being, and he didn't dare to try either.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry to keep you waiting!" </p><p></p><p>Shiyala ran over from the direction of the church, panting.</p><p></p><p>She taught general education classes as well</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that time, he was still a pastor, responsible for treating those poor souls who had accidentally lost their way while communicating with the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I haven't been here for too long either."</p><p></p><p>"This is for you."</p><p></p><p>Shia La handed him a letter. Heine hesitated for a moment before taking the letter and asking:</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a letter of introduction I wrote to the lord of Ebony Town. Although you didn't formally graduate, with your abilities and knowledge, you can definitely serve as an advisor, providing help in alchemy, geography, and etiquette."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe also in cooking."</p><p></p><p>Heine made a joke, making Shia La smile.</p><p></p><p>He put away the letter and thanked her.</p><p></p><p>With the impending farewell, the air became quiet.</p><p></p><p>The two were nominally student and teacher, with an age difference of seven or eight years. But no matter what, Heine's body also housed the soul of an adult. After three years of interaction, Shia La didn't treat him as a child, but rather as a good friend.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was she who broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>She stepped forward to hug Heine and softly said:</p><p></p><p>"The next time we meet, remember to treat me to a good meal."</p><p></p><p>"Definitely, next time."</p><p></p><p>Heine replied as such.</p><p></p><p>The two parted ways.</p><p></p><p>The carriage slowly drove across the stone bridge, leaving this gloomy land.</p><p></p><p>The mountain road was rugged. It took Heine an entire afternoon to barely reach the outskirts of Ebony Town.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't encounter any beasts along the way, much better than nearly being devoured by wolves on his way to the Burial Grounds years ago. The incendiary bottles and shock staffs Heine prepared also didn't come in handy.</p><p></p><p>His home was located in the eastern outskirts of the town, about a forty-minute walk to the town center.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Heine saw an ancient manor.</p><p></p><p>After three years, the house in the twilight looked like an ancient tree in a deep forest, covered in mottled moss and lush vines.</p><p></p><p>When Heine first transmigrated, he faced a complete mess.</p><p></p><p>The original owner's father was a minor noble who inherited the ancestral home. The family of three lived simply, but as the mother fell ill, the family's savings were exhausted and they were burdened with external debts. The father had no choice but to return to his old profession of adventuring in ruins, ultimately only bringing back a sword and half a suit of armor.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the mother died from illness, and debt collectors came to the door, driving the fifteen-year-old original owner to his death. This was how Heine came to be.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Burial Grounds to study was his "path to repaying debts", as required by the moneylenders.</p><p></p><p>Necromancers had a poor reputation, and enrollment at the Burial Grounds was unstable, so recruitment had to go through gray channels.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Heine, as a transmigrator, happened to crave such things, so the two parties hit it off right away.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at his doorstep, there was still a horse-drawn wagon parked by the roadside, with a familiar-looking bed frame on top.</p><p></p><p>The large iron gate was open, and a well-dressed middle-aged man stood at the entrance, his hair neatly combed without a strand out of place.</p><p></p><p>He was not surprised by Heine's arrival and even waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>He was none other than Simon, the moneylender who had sent Heine to the Burial Grounds three years ago.</p><p></p><p>As Heine's "enrollment recommender", he was the first to receive the notification letter from the Burial Grounds.</p><p></p><p>According to the agreement made that year, he first received a "deposit" of 10 gold coins from the Burial Grounds. If Heine could successfully graduate, he would receive another 25 gold coins.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready to repay your debt, Mr. Heine?"</p><p></p><p>This was meant to be a joke, but what responded to him was a money pouch containing 25 gold coins.</p><p></p><p>Simon caught it steadily and raised his eyebrows after weighing it.</p><p></p><p>Why was an expelled student so wealthy?</p><p></p><p>The letter did mention that the other party's "interest in making money far exceeded learning magic", but he thought that referred to independently repaying three years of tuition to redeem himself.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed he had earned at least 40 gold coins. How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>But out of good professional ethics and the financial strength displayed by the other party, Simon didn't pry and only expressed sincere admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly incredible. Customers with such good credit as you are rare these days."</p><p></p><p>He patted the iron gate and shouted inside, "Stop messing around and restore the gentleman's belongings!"</p><p></p><p>Two burly men covered in dust squeezed out from inside the house. Their arms were thicker than Heine's calves, and they only wore linen vests in this season.</p><p></p><p>There were also extraordinary warriors in this world, but Heine didn't have that talent and had passed the optimal age.</p><p></p><p>Watching them carry the bed frame back inside, Simon spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"There doesn't seem to be much left in your house."</p><p></p><p>Heine rolled his eyes. "Wasn't it all taken away by you guys back then?"</p><p></p><p>At that time, in order to pay off debts, the house was nearly emptied, leaving only some things that weren't worth much but still had sentimental value, such as the half-body armor and an ordinary longsword.</p><p></p><p>The original owner was driven to death like this, so he naturally wouldn't give the other party a good face.</p><p></p><p>"Situations are always changing." Simon rubbed his hands, his smile amiable. "You must have higher requirements for quality of life now, right? Perhaps you need a set of higher-end furniture. We can—"</p><p></p><p>Heine chuckled. "No need. For the past three years, I've been sleeping next to the coffins of the dead. I'm not used to anything too fancy all of a sudden."</p><p></p><p>Simon also didn't expect life at the Burial Grounds to be so thrilling, but he quickly dispelled the awkwardness with a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Then we can only look forward to the next collaboration."</p><p></p><p>"I'm also looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a few meaningless words. Simon tried to probe a few times but was deflected by Heine each time. He couldn't help but feel that the other party had changed greatly in the past three years.</p><p></p><p>The Burial Grounds was truly a great place to temper people!</p><p></p><p>He had only interacted with the transmigrator Heine for a mere half day, so he naturally thought this was all thanks to the Burial Grounds.</p><p></p><p>This moneylender was quite graceful. He even had people help Heine carry his luggage into the house.</p><p></p><p>After sending the three off, looking at the truly empty house, Heine had a sense of déjà vu that "the game had just begun".</p><p></p><p>"This is fine too. Let's consider it a farewell to the past."</p><p></p><p>There were many rooms. He drew a basin of water from the well in the backyard and simply tidied up the room he was staying in.</p><p></p><p>When he passed by the entrance to the cellar for the second time, he suddenly frowned.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't an illusion.</p><p></p><p>He indeed sensed a faint trace of death energy.</p><p></p><p>New person, new book, pure Western fantasy, no system, not the fourth apocalypse, lighthearted adventure story.

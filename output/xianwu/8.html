        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He has now mastered the practice of the Spring Thunder Fist, and practicing martial arts does not require the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, so from now on, unless he encounters problems in cultivation, the majority of his time will be spent here.</p><p></p><p>It is impossible to cultivate blood qi and become an entry-level martial artist in just two months.</p><p></p><p>However, utilizing a hundredfold time difference is easy.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>A bespectacled, cultured young man found him.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian, the younger son of Yu Qinghai, the grandson of the clan elder Yu Guotai, was sent by his father to help with affairs, responsible for housing-related matters, as he was around the same age as Yu Xiao and had cultural knowledge and literacy.</p><p></p><p>Since releasing the news that he wanted to buy a house,</p><p></p><p>Several wealthy families and landlords have come to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>One called "Wang Yuanwai" was quite active.</p><p></p><p>Wang Yuanwai's grandfather had passed the imperial examination, and he had a considerable reputation in Mei County. Although this generation has declined somewhat, they still have a large mansion in the town of Xiaohe in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>This Xiaohe Town is located between Mei County and Yu Family Village, a town with a population of over 20,000 and is quite prosperous.</p><p></p><p>It is only four or five li to go to Yu Family Village or Mei County, making it very convenient for living.</p><p></p><p>The power structure is also simple.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao is very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"How's the negotiation going?"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Yuanwai agreed to sell the mansion for 6,000 yuan, but there is an additional condition..."</p><p></p><p>"What condition?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wang family also has 850 mu of land nearby, some of which are being cultivated by our Yu family people. They hope to bundle the mansion and the land together and sell it to Brother Xiao for a total of 9,000 yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Nine thousand yuan! Yu Ruqian teaches at a private school in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>His monthly salary is only 1.8 yuan! Even if he doesn't eat or drink, it would take him 416 years to save up that much! Yu Xiao was delighted to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Lately, he has not only been busy practicing martial arts and mining,</p><p></p><p>but also planning to purchase a batch of spiritual rice and tea tree seeds to plant.</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual energy in this realm is extremely scarce, the quality of the spiritual rice and tea leaves will certainly not be as good as the main world, but they will still be better than ordinary rice and tea, and can easily open up the market.</p><p></p><p>This is like someone bringing a pillow when you're already sleepy.</p><p></p><p>A mansion, plus 850 mu of land, for a price of 9,000 taels, is it expensive or not? In Yu Xiao's view, it's not expensive, just about three days' basic wages for a miner.</p><p></p><p>But he also doesn't want to be seen as a fool with money.</p><p></p><p>After a round of bargaining that day, they settled on a price of 8,150 yuan.</p><p></p><p>The standard procedure for purchasing a mansion and land is that after the buyer and seller negotiate through an intermediary, the seller drafts the sales contract draft, which is then reviewed by the buyer. When the buyer has no objections to the draft, they will enter the formal signing stage.</p><p></p><p>As the buyer,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao followed the rules and hosted a banquet for Wang Yuanwai and his neighbors.</p><p></p><p>He also invited the village head, township elder, and county officials to witness the notarization.</p><p></p><p>He also requested a county clerk to act as a scribe and formally write up the contract based on the draft. The seller and the witnesses present need to take turns signing or sealing the contract to confirm its validity.</p><p></p><p>The contract was soon presented to Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The general content is as follows:</p><p></p><p>-- </p><p></p><p>The seller (Wang Fu), due to urgent need for silver, voluntarily sells the mansion located in Xiaohe Town, Mei County, Guangyue Province, including the land and buildings, to Yu Xiao as his permanent property.</p><p></p><p>The details of the mansion and good farmland are listed as follows: East to: ... (omitted) South to: ... (omitted) North to: ... (omitted) West to: ... (omitted) The boundaries are clear and have been measured.</p><p></p><p>The current verification is accurate, and the ownership is clear and undisputed.</p><p></p><p>The agreed price is eight thousand one hundred and fifty yuan, to be paid in full within three days.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction is completed, the buyer may modify and reside in it permanently without regret. This is a mutual agreement, without any coercion. All the previous ownership documents will be handed over to the buyer for safekeeping, lest there be no proof in the future. This is established as evidence.</p><p></p><p>Established on the 2nd day of the 6th month of the 78th year of the Dajing reign.</p><p></p><p>(The seller, buyer, witnesses, township elder, and village head have signed and sealed.)</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Very rigorous and standardized.</p><p></p><p>The land deed and house deed are all in order.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao promptly paid 8,802 taels.</p><p></p><p>The 8,150 yuan was for the house and land purchase, and he needed to bear 7% of the Dajing Dynasty's deed tax, as well as 1% for the notarization fee and the commission for the relevant officials, which were 570 yuan and 82 yuan respectively.</p><p></p><p>At this point, everything is settled!</p><p></p><p>He finally has his own house! This is a rather luxurious two-courtyard mansion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The architecture was simple yet elegant, with blue-gray tiles and upturned eaves, exuding an antique charm.</p><p></p><p>The outer courtyard was spacious, with several lychee and pomelo trees, as well as a well, a pond, and a pavilion. On either side were two side houses where the servants lived and worked.</p><p></p><p>The inner courtyard was a standard single-story quadrangle.</p><p></p><p>The north side was the main house, with a living room, bedrooms, and a study.</p><p></p><p>The east and west wings each had two rooms, which could be used for family members to live in or for storage, a pantry, and a kitchen. The total area was around 680 square meters. Although it was a grand manor in the small town, it was not extravagantly luxurious, but it was a high-standard and comfortable residence by local standards.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, a new plaque was installed, bearing the words "The Surplus Family Mansion".</p><p></p><p>The entire house had undergone thorough cleaning and renovation.</p><p></p><p>This day happened to be an auspicious day for the housewarming.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao officially announced the housewarming and hosted a banquet at the best restaurant in town, inviting the elders and villagers from Xu's village.</p><p></p><p>Firecrackers were set off along the way.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao had specially hired carriages to bring the elderly clan leaders, while the other younger people followed behind, walking with their heads held high.</p><p></p><p>"Who is that? Such a grand display!"</p><p></p><p>"It's Xu Xiao, the young master of the Xu family from the village. He just returned from overseas and the family has made a lot of money!"</p><p></p><p>"How much money? Can it compare to Mr. Wang and Mr. Li?"</p><p></p><p>"Pah, those country gentry, how can they compare to this international tycoon? Xu Xiao bought the Wang family's mansion and land without even blinking an eye!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, he must be incredibly wealthy!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Xiao did not hear the discussions, he knew he had become famous in the small town.</p><p></p><p>Because the stone tablet in the ancient palace space was continuously displaying new information:</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>His reputation value was approaching 50 points. At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he leveled up.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, roast suckling pig, crispy roast goose, braised lamb, and steamed yellow croaker were served - dishes the villagers had never seen before. They were all salivating.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao raised his glass: "These past few days, everyone has worked hard to help with the move and renovations. Especially the uncles and elders who personally assisted, I am deeply grateful. Let's have a toast to all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai: "We're all family, no need for formalities. Ruan, you've troubled Xiao a lot!"</p><p></p><p>He then gestured to Xu Ruan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruan hurriedly raised his glass, saying somewhat stiffly, "Brother Xiao, I'll stick with you from now on!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>With Xu Xiao moving into the mansion, he would naturally need some help. Xu Ruan, who had received an education and was a well-behaved young man, was brought in as an accountant. This not only made him the most cultured and educated youth in Xu's village, but also the grandson of the clan elder Xu Guotai, greatly strengthening the family ties.</p><p></p><p>After a few rounds of drinks, Xu Xiao asked, "I've just returned to the country and settled down. I haven't had a chance to repay the villagers yet. I heard some of them are renting my fields?"</p><p></p><p>The clan elder quickly explained, "Mr. Wang is the largest landowner in Xiaohe Town, and his fields happen to be near Xu's village, so..."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Xu Xiao nodded. "Then from today onwards, for at least the next five years, the Xu family members can farm the fields rent-free, and the other villagers can have a 50% reduction. What do you think, clan elder?"</p><p></p><p>"What?!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>An elder tremblingly asked, "Is this... for real?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao smiled, "This is nothing for me. Benefiting the villagers, how could it be false!"</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao's heart swelled. This action had indeed increased his reputation.</p><p></p><p>The villagers were moved to tears. In these times, land rent was one of the biggest burdens for farmers. The clan elder was delighted, but also had some concerns.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

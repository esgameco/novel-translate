        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Town Government Office.</p><p></p><p>Mayor Ma stood under the eaves.</p><p></p><p>He was respectfully bowing and greeting a horse-drawn carriage.</p><p></p><p>A young man in a white suit, wearing a top hat, half-rimmed glasses, with a gold pocket watch and a revolver tucked in his waist, was walking out, surrounded by his entourage.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked, "How did it go?"</p><p></p><p>Mayor Ma replied, "I would not dare to neglect the important matters of Young Master Yu. The three township heads as well as the elders from each town are all waiting inside the hall."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>The other attendants remained outside.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao walked into the hall, flanked by Wang Zhong and Tang Yang as his escorts.</p><p></p><p>The town government office was spotlessly clean. Over a dozen elders in brocade robes were waiting there. These were either the nearby township heads (mayors), or the largest landlords and gentry of the various townships. When facing the young man, they all stood up respectfully and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"Please, Mr. Yu, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Mayor Ma invited Yu Xiao to the main seat before continuing:</p><p></p><p>"The reason I have gathered you all here today is to discuss the matter of the Militia Corps."</p><p></p><p>"In recent years, the political situation has been unstable."</p><p></p><p>"The bandit menace has been escalating!"</p><p></p><p>"The bandits led by Shihutai have been raiding our neighboring townships every few days, and we in these few townships have suffered greatly from their harm!"</p><p></p><p>"Although we have also organized militia corps before, due to insufficient manpower, lack of equipment, and lack of organization and training, we have been unable to deter the bandits."</p><p></p><p>"Today, Young Master Yu, with your noble intentions, is taking the lead to reorganize the Militia Corps, with the aim of completely eliminating the bandit threat and protecting the people of these ten-plus townships, restoring peace and order to Mei County!"</p><p></p><p>The tone was impassioned.</p><p></p><p>The crowd burst into applause and cheers.</p><p></p><p>The Militia Corps was essentially a civilian militia organization approved or sanctioned by the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of years of war and rebellion, with bandits rampant, the gentry and common people, in order to safeguard their lives and property, would contribute money and manpower, which was a very common practice.</p><p></p><p>The Militia Corps usually consisted of a hundred or two hundred able-bodied young men. Their equipment was spears, broadswords, and a small number of primitive muskets and blunderbusses.</p><p></p><p>The squad leader could receive a salary of 80 cents to 1 yuan, while the ordinary Militia Corps members would only get 30 to 50 cents per month. Though it didn't seem high, it was still income.</p><p></p><p>The local young men would scramble to join. On the one hand, the Militia Corps members enjoyed a relatively high social status in the local area, and on the other hand, the Militia Corps was not a full-time regular army, but rather a part-time job with some income, which was not bad.</p><p></p><p>There were Militia Corps in many places. From the squad leader to the ordinary members, they were all volunteer labor. After all, the Militia Corps was just a civilian militia organization, and the daily training and equipment procurement all required money, but the imperial court's finances could not possibly allocate funds, so it all depended on the spontaneous donations of the local gentry, and the funds were inevitably very tight.</p><p></p><p>After Mayor Ma had set the stage, Yu Xiao announced the details of the Militia Corps.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have all honored me by coming here, let me get straight to the point!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said, "I plan to establish a 500-strong permanent Militia Corps in Xiaohe Town. Each township and village can recommend reliable young men of good character to participate in the training and selection!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>"Five hundred people!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was taken aback by the number.</p><p></p><p>The battalion commander of the local area, a seventh-rank military officer, had at most only about a hundred soldiers under his command!</p><p></p><p>The troop strength of the Xiaohe Town Militia Corps was probably on par with that of a sixth-rank colonel!</p><p></p><p>An elder couldn't help but say, "Young Master Yu, recruiting so many people, and requiring them to be permanent, may pose certain difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao replied, "Don't worry, I won't shortchange the local folks. Each permanent Militia Corps member will have their room and board provided, and will also receive a 1 yuan monthly subsidy. If they participate in bandit suppression or arrest operations and make meritorious contributions, there will be additional subsidies or rewards!"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd changed.</p><p></p><p>Just the free room and board was already very attractive!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they can even get a stable 1 yuan basic monthly salary!</p><p></p><p>An ordinary laborer going to Mei County, pulling a rickshaw, doing manual labor, working hard for a month, can only earn a little over 1 yuan.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, a mere 500 people - what's the big deal? Mei County has a total population of 400,000 to 500,000. Even a small nearby town can have 10,000 to 20,000 people.</p><p></p><p>These days, the average lifespan is not high, the proportion of young people is extremely large, and with industrialization, there is a serious surplus of labor, with many people having no land to till and unable to find work.</p><p></p><p>The treatment of the Baomingtuan is so good. These 500 positions are likely to be fought over fiercely!</p><p></p><p>After establishing the Baomingtuan in Xiaohe Town, Yu Xiaocheng will bring in some of his private soldiers, then have his "uncle" Yu Qinghai serve as the Baomingtuan chief, and recruit 400 reliable, young and strong local militia from the surrounding villages.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his sphere of influence will not be limited to just Xiaohe Town.</p><p></p><p>All the funding, all the expenses, including training, equipment, salaries, and benefits of the entire Baomingtuan, will be borne by Yu Xiaocheng alone, and the core members will also be his own people.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be his personal private army. This is not an exaggeration at all!</p><p></p><p>His position as the local tyrant will become even more unshakable. Not only the county magistrate, a mere seventh-rank local official, even if the prefect himself comes to this small piece of land, he can completely ignore them.</p><p></p><p>However, this new county magistrate is quite interesting...</p><p></p><p>Is he an incompetent fool, or is he deliberately allowing me to grow stronger? It doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The top priority now is to establish the Baomingtuan.</p><p></p><p>Prestige and security are the only things Yu Xiaocheng needs to consider.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaocheng publicly announced, "There's no time to waste, I will immediately invest 10,000 yuan for the initial construction of the Baomingtuan, as well as the purchase of equipment and facilities!"</p><p></p><p>10,000 yuan? What kind of Baomingtuan is this? That's enough to buy a few thousand mu of land and become a big landlord! The 10,000 yuan that Yu Xiaocheng put up is just the initial investment.</p><p></p><p>He plans to directly procure weapons from the provincial capital, establish the Baomingtuan and thoroughly arm it, then train for a month or two, and then launch a comprehensive sweep against the Shihu Stronghold and the surrounding bandit forces!</p><p></p><p>The suppression of the bandits cannot be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>The Shihu Stronghold and such bandit groups are not easily eliminated. Their leader, Guo Shanhu, is only a sixth-rank warrior, but he has more than a hundred men under him, with dozens of long and short guns, and is familiar with the mountain and forest terrain, with several secret escape routes, making them very difficult to defeat.</p><p></p><p>The government has launched several bandit suppression campaigns, all of which have failed. There have even been some casualties.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaocheng attaches great importance to the upcoming bandit suppression operation.</p><p></p><p>Because if he can successfully suppress the bandits, especially wipe them out completely, it will greatly increase his prestige and elevate his local status.</p><p></p><p>But if the bandits all escape, and there are many casualties among the militia, and they suffer retaliation, it will not only severely dampen morale, but also tarnish Yu Xiaocheng's reputation and undermine his personal prestige.</p><p></p><p>The bandit suppression operation must succeed, not fail!</p><p></p><p>He cannot act rashly, he needs to prepare well! In addition to directly procuring advanced weapons from the provincial capital to equip the Xiaohe Militia, surpassing the regular troops, Yu Xiaocheng will also accelerate his own cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>His most important goal now is to quickly cultivate the "Azure Wood Technique" and become an Qi Condensation Cultivator! Even just reaching the Qi Condensation realm will give him spiritual powers to command, allowing him to learn some simple spells and activate low-level talismans and charms.</p><p></p><p>This will enable him to launch a dimensional attack against these local bandits!</p><p></p><p>How can he not succeed and even achieve a complete victory?</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please vote and continue reading!)</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

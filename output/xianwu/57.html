        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao resolutely announced his attempt to break through to the fifth rank, his several masters were all filled with shock and disbelief!</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao broke through to the sixth rank, he spent most of his time in Baiyun Workshop, only occasionally returning to stay in Dajing for a few days, mainly to rest and recuperate when he was tired.</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao had spent a solid four months participating in multiple hunts and engaging in actual combat with various demon beasts, in the eyes of his Dajing masters, his breakthrough had just happened before the new year.</p><p></p><p>At most.</p><p></p><p>Less than a month.</p><p></p><p>And during this month.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could be described as carefree and leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He had never undergone intensive arduous training.</p><p></p><p>Which sixth-rank martial artist would attempt to break through to the fifth rank in less than a month?</p><p></p><p>Of course, they wouldn't know about things like Blood Essence Pills!</p><p></p><p>If Yu Xiao really succeeded, even looking back through thousands of years of history, one could hardly find a few who could compare. It could no longer be described as genius - such talent was simply monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Once word spread!</p><p></p><p>It would likely cause a huge shock in the martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao certainly knew how much of a psychological impact this would have on his martial arts teachers.</p><p></p><p>No matter! This was exactly the effect he wanted! Yu Xiao was dedicated to crafting a genius persona in Dajing.</p><p></p><p>This not only helped increase his personal prestige, but was also more beneficial for developing his influence and gathering support. It would be very helpful for integrating the entire provincial martial arts world later, and was part of the plan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao officially began his attempt to break through. On average, he digested one Blood Essence Pill every five days. During the period when the pill's effects were active, his blood energy cultivation efficiency could increase more than tenfold. This state lasted for nearly a month!</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>During the nearly month-long cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao did not stay in Dajing the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, only one night would have passed in Baiyun Workshop.</p><p></p><p>If Wei Biao and Lu Lingyun woke up to find Yu Xiao's blood energy had suddenly skyrocketed, it would seem too abrupt.</p><p></p><p>To make his cultivation breakthrough process appear more smooth and natural, Yu Xiao basically spent one day in each place, simultaneously utilizing the resources and services of both realms for comprehensive cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Dajing had tonics, massages, and a group of guards to spar with.</p><p></p><p>Baiyun Workshop had senior brother Wei Biao and the boxing gym facilities, as well as Lu Lingyun's recovery spells and pills to provide assistance.</p><p></p><p>And so.</p><p></p><p>When the effects of the fifth Blood Essence Pill were nearly exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao successfully connected his fourth extraordinary meridian. His blood energy circulation became even smoother, and the strength of his blood energy increased by another 30-40% on top of the original foundation. Every cell became more vigorous, and his perception of the world's spiritual energy was enhanced!</p><p></p><p>With this!</p><p></p><p>The fifth rank was achieved!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Another breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao marveled at his junior brother's powerful talent.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't find it particularly surprising.</p><p></p><p>He had long accepted his junior brother's persona as a martial arts genius.</p><p></p><p>His junior brother's last breakthrough was nearly four months ago, and with the aid of Blood Essence Pills, although it was still faster than imagined, it was completely reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun exclaimed: "Fellow Daoist Yu's martial talent is truly outstanding!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao had a smug look on his face: "That's right, my junior brother is the most talented martial artist in Baiyun Workshop. At this rate, he'll probably reach the middle stage of Blood Refining in a year or so, and start attempting to break through to the late stage of Blood Refining!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Lingyun's heart stirred: "Does Fellow Daoist Yu plan to participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Of course I can't let down Master Li's kindness, so I plan to try my luck. Who knows, maybe I'll be lucky enough to pass?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, with your skills, you'll definitely pass the Immortal Ascension Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun: "The Immortal Ascension Assembly is held every three years, with the next one at the end of next year... If you can make it in time, I suggest Fellow Daoist Yu participate directly!"</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Joining a cultivation sect a few years earlier could make a big difference in the attention and nurturing you receive!"</p><p></p><p>I see. But Yu Xiao didn't care.</p><p></p><p>He was already so old, and a rogue cultivator without any background. No matter what, the Qinglan Valley wouldn't nurture him as a core disciple. Since that was the case, why bother</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Why care about this small difference in treatment?</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao, however, took it very seriously.</p><p></p><p>That's right, his junior disciple started cultivating too late and wasn't exactly young anymore. He could participate in the Immortal Ascension Conference at most twice. Would someone joining a cultivation sect at 25-26 years old receive the same attention and training as someone joining at 28-29? Perhaps.</p><p></p><p>A difference of three years.</p><p></p><p>The treatment would be completely different!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if something didn't go smoothly, there would still be a second chance.</p><p></p><p>If betting on the next conference, there would only be one opportunity. Even if he had confidence in his junior disciple, what if something went wrong in the meantime, causing him to fail or not be selected?</p><p></p><p>"This humble brother thinks Fellow Daoist Lv's words are extremely correct. You should challenge next year's Immortal Ascension Conference to fight for a better future and opportunity for yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao humbly replied, "With only a little over a year, I'm afraid there's not enough time."</p><p></p><p>"How will you know if you don't try?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao slapped the table and said, "I suggest that in the future we try to hunt beasts that produce blood essence stones, then refine more blood essence pills to help my junior disciple first reach the peak of mid-stage Blood Refining and enter the second level of Qi Refining, then push for late-stage Blood Refining and break through to the third level of Qi Refining!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Lingyun agreed and said, "Mm, although time is tight, with Fellow Daoist Yu's demonstrated martial arts talent, using martial arts to quickly break through in Qi Refining may not be impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao made the decision: "Then it's settled!"</p><p></p><p>These two guys really were... more anxious than the emperor himself!</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao found it amusing,</p><p></p><p>He felt warmth in his heart!</p><p></p><p>After all, they were truly thinking of him, and there was really no reason to refuse their goodwill!</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case,</p><p></p><p>He might as well give it a try!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't lack cultivation resources,</p><p></p><p>But he was severely lacking in cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Green Wood Technique given by Old Man Li only had the first three levels.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely difficult to buy fourth-level techniques in the rogue cultivator market, let alone higher levels.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivation methods,</p><p></p><p>How could one cultivate immortality?</p><p></p><p>Joining a large sect was very necessary.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Alright, since you two are so supportive, I'll definitely participate in next year's Immortal Ascension Conference!"</p><p></p><p>Lv Lingyun: "It's settled then, we'll go together."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao laughed and said, "When you two become disciples of Qinglan Valley, please take care of my little martial arts gym!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, saying that is too distant. After all, we are the Spring Thunder Three Friends of Baiyun District!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, cheers!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After drinking,</p><p></p><p>Lv Lingyun went back to rest.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Wei Biao remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, the martial arts manuals my junior brother wanted, I had people collect a batch. They're placed in the courtyard, feel free to use them as needed!"</p><p></p><p>"So fast? Thank you, Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, although your martial arts talent is outstanding, martial arts is ultimately a minor path. Don't spend too much energy on it, lest it delay truly important cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao came to the martial arts gym's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He saw a thick stack of books tied directly with straw rope, thrown in the corner gathering dust, looking almost like garbage. Most were old and tattered, probably not even wanted for wiping one's bottom.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly went over and pulled out a few:</p><p></p><p>"Swift Wind Leg", "Lightning Fist", "Black Iron Hand", "Iron Shirt Technique", "Flying Eagle Sword", "Breaking Wave Blade"...</p><p></p><p>There were at least dozens of manuals here, each representing a martial art. Though their names were simple, they could all be cultivated to at least the Marrow Refining realm, with some even reaching the Force Refining realm!</p><p></p><p>In other words!</p><p></p><p>Each of these tattered books here was at least grandmaster-level martial arts!</p><p></p><p>And this pile of "junk" was one of Yu Xiao's important chips for unifying the martial arts world of the provincial capital!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao casually flipped through them: "Good, with these things, I'm not afraid of failing to conquer those old fogeys in the provincial capital!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

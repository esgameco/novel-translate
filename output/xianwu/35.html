        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>White Cloud District.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was practicing martial arts in the boxing gym.</p><p></p><p>Each punch produced an explosive sound that cracked the air.</p><p></p><p>Compared to when he first started training, his vital energy had at least doubled in strength, and the power of his boxing techniques was incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, due to his abundant vital energy,</p><p></p><p>His physical constitution had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>His current strength was so great that using a millstone as a dumbbell would be completely effortless. Being hit by one of his punches would be almost like being rammed by a wild bull.</p><p></p><p>After completing the 36 forms,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao slowly regulated his breathing, exhaling breaths that formed white mist-like arrows shooting several yards in the cold air.</p><p></p><p>Clap clap clap! Applause sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Well done! In just five months of practice, you've already opened your second extraordinary meridian. At this rate, your senior brother will soon have nothing left to teach you."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao sighed with both admiration and regret.</p><p></p><p>His little junior brother's talent was too astonishing!</p><p></p><p>It's a pity he didn't join five or eight years earlier.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could have received personal instruction from Master Li, and might even have been able to help Master Li in return... Perhaps then the Spring Thunder Boxing Gym wouldn't have declined to its current state.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this,</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's mood darkened.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan had been in seclusion for some time now.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Thunder Boxing Gym's reputation had greatly diminished. Not only had nearly half the disciples quit, but there were no new enrollments either.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his junior brother had used his personal connections to contact a merchant group, allowing them to purchase scarce goods like refined salt and white sugar at low prices. This let the gym earn extra gold and even spirit stones by reselling these items.</p><p></p><p>After deducting the cost of goods,</p><p></p><p>His junior brother didn't take a single coin of the profits.</p><p></p><p>To help the gym get through this relatively difficult period.</p><p></p><p>Talented, modest, and generous - Wei Biao sincerely respected him!</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already profited earlier.</p><p></p><p>He was just using the gym to sell goods.</p><p></p><p>This way he could avoid drawing attention.</p><p></p><p>It was actually a mutually beneficial relationship between them.</p><p></p><p>These days, with the gym's backing, he had been steadily increasing his spirit stone assets by reselling goods, now reaching 42 stones.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needed to secretly accumulate spirit stones through mining.</p><p></p><p>Recently he had redeemed himself from the spirit mine.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sensed Wei Biao's low spirits and comforted him: "Senior brother has already taught me more than enough. You could be considered half my master. But you haven't been in good shape lately. Don't put too much pressure on yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you little rascal, now you're comforting me!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said irritably: "Don't worry, your senior brother isn't that fragile. The gym's difficulties are temporary. Once I break through to the late stage of Blood Refining, everything will get better again!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed,</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was at the peak of the fourth rank.</p><p></p><p>At his age, he could certainly advance further.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao was a bit worried. Breakthroughs require the right opportunity. Forcing a breakthrough for the sake of breaking through not only has a low success rate, but could also be risky.</p><p></p><p>After spending time together for many days,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew,</p><p></p><p>This rough-looking guy with a fierce face,</p><p></p><p>Was actually a rare good person in this cruel world!</p><p></p><p>Not only was he warm-hearted, but also loyal and righteous. He had provided a lot of help over the past few months! Yu Xiao didn't want anything to happen to his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>If conditions allowed, he would help him.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak,</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, junior brother, I've bought the things you wanted."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao brought two items.</p><p></p><p>The first was a large bucket emitting a bloody smell.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said: "This is the blood medicine brewed by nearby mountain villagers using Scarlet Heart Tiger blood."</p><p></p><p>Recently,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had begun setting up his business ventures in Da Jing.</p><p></p><p>He planned to first establish a winery and a handicraft workshop.</p><p></p><p>For brewing spirit rice wine, the main ingredient was spirit rice, supplemented with a small amount of secret blood medicine. This would bring out the best nourishing effects of the spirit wine.</p><p></p><p>The hundred mu of spirit rice was about to be harvested.</p><p></p><p>There would be no shortage of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>But there was no way to get blood medicine.</p><p></p><p>It definitely couldn't be obtained in Da Jing.</p><p></p><p>They could only purchase and transport it from here.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, brewing wine consumed very little blood medicine.</p><p></p><p>Bringing such a large bucket to Da Jing would cost at most 1 point of destiny. After further dilution, it could be used for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>Once the spirit rice wine was brewed,</p><p></p><p>It would not only astonish the whole world,</p><p></p><p>But this wine would also greatly benefit martial artists' cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could not only keep some to drink himself, but also promote it as a top luxury wine, establishing his reputation at home and abroad, laying the foundation for expanding into other fields and industries.</p><p></p><p>As for the handicraft workshop?</p><p></p><p>It was purely to solve the employment problem for villagers.</p><p></p><p>This factory would hire and train a large number of dexterous people, letting them</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Processing various jewelry, jade, wood carvings, and stone carvings, daily profits weren't important.</p><p></p><p>Because Yu Xiao could easily obtain a batch of top-quality jade, gemstones, and diamonds from the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that as long as they didn't possess spiritual energy or sentience,</p><p></p><p>Whatever premium jade or gemstones, even egg-sized diamonds,</p><p></p><p>Were considered garbage in the main world, worthless and not much different from ordinary stones.</p><p></p><p>But if one casually brought one of these to Da Jing, it would be a priceless treasure!</p><p></p><p>Gold is too heavy! Transporting that stuff is outdated.</p><p></p><p>Although the price difference for gold between the two worlds is also large,</p><p></p><p>It's nothing compared to these large diamonds and gemstones.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could easily create profits a hundred times higher than gold with almost negligible consumption of his luck.</p><p></p><p>Reselling these items,</p><p></p><p>The profits were beyond description! There was no risk, and it was very easy.</p><p></p><p>This money came a hundred or thousand times faster than robbing a bank! Moreover, for some top-level dignitaries, these treasures were beyond mere monetary value, perhaps exchangeable for other major benefits or rare materials beyond money.</p><p></p><p>"Also, junior brother, if you want to learn spells, I've carefully searched the market," Wei Biao said.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao took out another item.</p><p></p><p>It was two jade tablets emitting magical fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said, "Because there are really few spells suitable for the first level of Qi Condensation, there are only these 'Perception Spell' and 'Invisibility Spell'."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao showed a delighted expression!</p><p></p><p>He once again marveled at how good a person Wei Biao was.</p><p></p><p>The first level of Qi Condensation was too low, with very few small spells that could be cultivated. It was quite good that Wei Biao could find two, and he tried to choose the two most practical ones.</p><p></p><p>Perception Spell.</p><p></p><p>This was a spell that could greatly enhance the six senses.</p><p></p><p>It could not only counter invisibility and similar techniques but also sense killing intent, thus used for early warning or judging hostility.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a basic small spell,</p><p></p><p>It was actually very practical!</p><p></p><p>It could greatly increase Yu Xiao's survival ability.</p><p></p><p>Invisibility Spell, this spell had an effect similar to the "Invisibility Talisman", but the Invisibility Talisman was an advanced version of the Invisibility Spell, requiring at least the second level of Qi Condensation to learn.</p><p></p><p>Their effects were exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that the Invisibility Spell was static invisibility, while the Invisibility Talisman allowed for dynamic invisibility.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect was somewhat inferior,</p><p></p><p>It could still increase survival ability.</p><p></p><p>Once Yu Xiao mastered the Invisibility Spell, it would become easier to cultivate the Invisibility Talisman later.</p><p></p><p>These two spells,</p><p></p><p>Were too suitable for Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao remembered this favor.</p><p></p><p>A bucket of blood medicine and two spell jade tablets cost a total of 28 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The two spell jade tablets accounted for over 90% of the cost, and since the secret text on them would disappear after use, they were consumables that couldn't be resold to recoup the cost.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit stones are still not enough to spend freely!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>That day,</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to Senior Brother Wei,</p><p></p><p>He returned to his own residence.</p><p></p><p>After redeeming himself from the mine, he moved from the shantytown to inside the district.</p><p></p><p>He currently lived next to the martial arts gym, with improved living conditions, safety, and privacy.</p><p></p><p>With a thought,</p><p></p><p>He entered Da Jing with the blood medicine.</p><p></p><p>This process consumed 1 point of luck.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao descended into Da Jing, he casually checked his current status.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao</p><p></p><p>Cultivation: Qi Condensation First Level</p><p></p><p>Age: 23 years old</p><p></p><p>True Age: 24 years old</p><p></p><p>Reputation: 1145/2000 (Famous in the area)</p><p></p><p>Luck Growth: 3 points per year</p><p></p><p>Current Luck: 88</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>On the stone tablet in the ancient hall,</p><p></p><p>A "True Age" item was added to the personal information.</p><p></p><p>Because Yu Xiao's actual age had surpassed his body's age.</p><p></p><p>In the future, this number would grow larger and larger, allowing Yu Xiao to more intuitively judge the time he had experienced.</p><p></p><p>After a surge in luck,</p><p></p><p>It had started to slow down again recently.</p><p></p><p>The influence of the Stone Tiger Fortress incident had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Even if it could increase further, it would probably be quite limited.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yu Xiao returned,</p><p></p><p>Master Liao sought him out with a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>He brought good news: "Da Niu has reached the rank!"</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

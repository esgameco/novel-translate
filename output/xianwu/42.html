        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun and Lü Song left the house.</p><p></p><p>They headed towards the agreed meeting point to rendezvous with the others.</p><p></p><p>Lü Song cautioned, "Miss, although we're only dealing with blood monkey bats this time, we still can't be careless."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun calmly replied, "I understand!"</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the two were not actually siblings.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun's true age...</p><p></p><p>Was actually only sixteen! She had used special methods to disguise herself, so she appeared to be in her twenties.</p><p></p><p>What was hidden...</p><p></p><p>Was not just her appearance.</p><p></p><p>Her true cultivation level was not Qi Refining stage 2, but Qi Refining stage 3!</p><p></p><p>Sixteen years old! Qi Refining stage 3!</p><p></p><p>Such talent was unlikely for an independent cultivator! In fact, it was true - Lü Lingyun was born into a medium-sized cultivation clan. For several generations, her ancestors had all been Foundation Establishment cultivators, with a lineage stretching back over 500 years.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Six months ago.</p><p></p><p>Due to a family incident.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun was forced to leave.</p><p></p><p>After several twists and turns, she joined the White Cloud Sect as an independent cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Her goal was to participate in the Immortal Ascension Conference and enter the Qinglan Valley cultivation sect!</p><p></p><p>"I must become a Qinglan Valley disciple, reach Foundation Establishment, and seek justice for mother!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of her mother's fate,</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun's eyes grew moist.</p><p></p><p>Especially the ugly actions and behavior of the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>It made her feel an unquenchable fire of rage burning forever in her chest.</p><p></p><p>Lü Song sighed inwardly:</p><p></p><p>"The young miss has extraordinary talent, but her obsession runs too deep... This hatred and anger will likely become a heart demon. The higher her cultivation, the more dangerous it becomes, which is not good for her future cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>But how could he blame the young miss.</p><p></p><p>Her experiences and fate had been too bitter.</p><p></p><p>The urgent task now was to help the young miss obtain an Immortal Ascension token.</p><p></p><p>So she could quickly participate in the Immortal Ascension Conference and join Qinglan Valley.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if people from her clan discovered her identity and whereabouts, they might take harmful actions!</p><p></p><p>As long as she could enter Qinglan Valley and have the sect as backing, a mere Foundation Establishment clan wouldn't dare to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>As an independent cultivator,</p><p></p><p>To obtain an Immortal Ascension token,</p><p></p><p>One must make enough contributions.</p><p></p><p>These contributions could be participating in various missions, killing nearby spirit beasts, protecting sect mines, or collecting and submitting various spiritual herbs and treasures.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun had been pampered since childhood.</p><p></p><p>When in her clan, she mainly focused on pill refining and was not very skilled in combat.</p><p></p><p>This time, participating in hunting low-level spirit beasts was both to collect materials and accumulate contributions, as well as to gain experience and hone her combat skills in preparation for the Immortal Ascension Conference.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side,</p><p></p><p>And to avoid drawing attention while keeping a trump card,</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun deliberately suppressed her cultivation by one level.</p><p></p><p>They were hunting the lowest-level spirit beasts, and other independent cultivators were joining the team, so there shouldn't be any risks.</p><p></p><p>A quarter hour later.</p><p></p><p>The five-person team was assembled.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun had interacted with Jiang Hao and Wei Biao before.</p><p></p><p>But she had never seen Yu Xiao before, so she took an extra look at him.</p><p></p><p>He was in his early twenties, handsome and refined, dressed a bit strangely, and for some reason carried a bulky wooden box on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Who's this?" Jiang Hao asked first.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao cupped his hands and said, "Fellow Daoist Jiang, Fellow Daoist Lü, this is my junior brother Yu Xiao whom I mentioned to you before. Although his cultivation is not high, he is very courageous and has come along to help."</p><p></p><p>"What help can a Blood Refining early stage martial artist provide?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao was clearly very displeased with the sudden addition: "We're here to hunt spirit beasts, not for sightseeing!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun could see Yu Xiao's strength.</p><p></p><p>This person was about the same age as Jiang Hao, but only at Qi Refining stage 1. Although he had martial arts cultivation, it was only at Blood Refining early stage. Independent cultivators of this level were everywhere in the sect, far behind their level.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Faced with Jiang Hao's questioning,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao replied neither humbly nor arrogantly: "Although my cultivation is not high, I have mastered the Sensing Technique, which I believe can be of some use. Additionally, I've brought my family's fire weapon, which I believe can play an important role at critical moments."</p><p></p><p>"Fire weapon?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it a magical artifact?"</p><p></p><p>When everyone learned that the so-called fire weapon was just a weapon made by mortal craftsmen, they all felt disappointed.</p><p></p><p>The disdain on Jiang Hao's face grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>He already looked down on independent cultivators' unorthodox methods.</p><p></p><p>Especially these martial artists who entered the Dao through martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, as a cultivator, to use a weapon made by mortals, it was simply disgracing all cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Song: "Brother Jiang, since he's Wei's junior disciple, he must have some exceptional qualities. I think having one more person to help isn't a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun also said: "Daoist friend Wei has always valued loyalty and righteousness. The person he trusts must be of good character. We should hurry and set off as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, fine, since you all say so, I don't want to waste time here either!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao said: "However, let me be clear upfront - any gains from this trip will be distributed according to contribution. And if we encounter danger, don't expect me to come to your rescue."</p><p></p><p>This person's words seemed a bit harsh and he didn't seem easy to get along with.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable. </p><p></p><p>In the world of immortal cultivation, the strong are respected.</p><p></p><p>Who told Yu Xiao that his current cultivation level wasn't high? It was normal for Jiang Hao, at such a young age and already at the third level of Qi Refining, to be a bit arrogant and look down on other independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao considered himself to have some tolerance.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't get angry over such a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao breathed a sigh of relief and immediately cupped his hands: "Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>They officially set off.</p><p></p><p>Leaving White Cloud Town.</p><p></p><p>Entering a nearby mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was Yu Xiao's first time leaving White Cloud Town.</p><p></p><p>Everything he saw and heard along the way was a fresh experience he'd never had before.</p><p></p><p>The mountain forest was quiet and deep.</p><p></p><p>Full of mysterious colors.</p><p></p><p>Ancient trees with intertwining roots were everywhere, along with countless strange flowers, exotic plants, and magical small animals.</p><p></p><p>Some were naturally skilled at transformation.</p><p></p><p>Some would even emit colorful illusions.</p><p></p><p>When they reached high ground and looked into the distance, strange peaks and odd rocks took on a thousand shapes, snow-capped mountains were shrouded in clouds and mist, like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>If one listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>There were always unidentified roars.</p><p></p><p>Coming from dozens of miles away.</p><p></p><p>Although very far, it still made one's heart tremble, giving a feeling of goosebumps all over the body. It was clearly some extremely powerful beast.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful, magnificent, mysterious, vast...</p><p></p><p>These were Yu Xiao's impressions of the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>He felt that any corner they passed would be an extraordinarily beautiful sight in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, beneath this majestic and beautiful exterior.</p><p></p><p>There were too many unknown dangers and mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"It's great to be alive!"</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Town was just an inconspicuous poor and remote place. This world had countless famous mountains and great rivers, blessed lands and immortal realms, with endless wonders of nature. There were too many places worth experiencing and appreciating.</p><p></p><p>Along the way.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao gave Yu Xiao a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>For example, how to avoid places where evil spirits appear in the mountains, how to effectively avoid being tracked by beasts, as well as how to identify various common poisonous flowers and plants. Yu Xiao benefited greatly.</p><p></p><p>This journey was unexpectedly smooth.</p><p></p><p>Although they encountered a few fierce beasts like tigers and leopards, these wild animals had keen sixth senses, so they didn't dare to attack and even turned tail and ran.</p><p></p><p>"Found it! This is it!"</p><p></p><p>The five people successfully found a cave. Before they could approach to observe, they suddenly heard a sharp screech.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao immediately warned: "Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao saw a black shadow fly out from the cave.</p><p></p><p>It was an ugly monster, half human-shaped and half bat!</p><p></p><p>It was about 1.2 meters tall, with the upper body like a red-haired monkey, and the lower body with a pair of sharp claws. Its forelimbs had transformed into a pair of fleshy wings with a wingspan of nearly two meters.</p><p></p><p>This was a large bat.</p><p></p><p>But at first glance, it did look a bit like a monkey!</p><p></p><p>The name "blood monkey bat" was quite fitting! This beast normally wouldn't leave its cave during the day. This one must have been resting at the entrance of the cave. Because of its very sensitive hearing, it was startled by the group and flew out to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Squeak——!"</p><p></p><p>The blood monkey bat let out a shrill cry.</p><p></p><p>Its two sharp blood-sucking fangs were quite creepy.</p><p></p><p>Its pair of sharp claws quickly turned bright red, a sign that it was about to attack.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the claws of a blood monkey bat could tear through gold and iron, and they also carried a deadly poison. Being wounded by them would be no joke!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao and Lü Song were just about to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>"Let me handle this!"</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Hao's movement was even faster.</p><p></p><p>A small green sword shot out from his sleeve and grew as it flew, instantly becoming about three feet long.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of green light.</p><p></p><p>The blood monkey bat's head was immediately sliced off and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The others were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said with a face full of envy: "It's a magical weapon!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

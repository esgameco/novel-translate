        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Song praised, "Brother Jiang, what excellent skill!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao said proudly, "This is my ancestral Green Light Sword. It has slain countless monsters and enemies. Mere blood bat monkeys are nothing to speak of."</p><p></p><p>Indeed impressive!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had been at White Cloud Square for two years. </p><p></p><p>This was the first time he witnessed a cultivator using a magical weapon to kill.</p><p></p><p>For low-level independent cultivators, magical weapons were coveted treasures. </p><p></p><p>Even fairly well-known independent cultivators like Li Yan and Jin Peng didn't possess magical weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those two had cultivated through martial arts, reaching the peak of Blood Refining. Their own bodies were equivalent to magical weapons, so at least in the early stages of Qi Refinement, their need for and reliance on magical weapons wasn't great.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao was a pure Qi Refining cultivator. </p><p></p><p>He himself was relatively fragile and had to rely on spells, talismans and magical weapons. Magical weapons were the best means to bring out one's full strength.</p><p></p><p>There was a world of difference between magical weapons and ordinary weapons!</p><p></p><p>Magical weapons could not only kill enemies, but often had transformation abilities and various special functions, or served as mediums for casting spells and setting up arrays. Any low-grade magical weapon, if brought to the mortal world, would be a divine weapon that could cut through iron like mud!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but look at the Green Light Sword a few more times.</p><p></p><p>"Stop looking. Such treasures are not something a miscellaneous cultivator and martial artist like you can aspire to. Even if you sold your labor for a lifetime, you couldn't afford it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao said mockingly, "Hurry up and extract the blood essence stones. Do I have to do this dirty work myself?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had the lowest cultivation.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules, hard and dirty work should naturally be done by him.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao quickly said, "Junior brother, let's process these blood bat monkeys together. It's a good chance to teach you some techniques for dissecting monster beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Although Yu Xiao felt Jiang Hao was harsh and arrogant, he didn't take it to heart too much, just giving face to Senior Brother Wei.</p><p></p><p>They used knives to cut open the flesh of the blood bat monkeys.</p><p></p><p>From the heart cavity, they found a bright red stone.</p><p></p><p>The stone was about half the size of a fingernail, emitting a strong bloody aura. It was the blood essence stone, the most valuable material.</p><p></p><p>They also separated out the teeth, claws, and poison glands.</p><p></p><p>All in all, these had some value too.</p><p></p><p>With this harvest, everyone was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The five people began to explore the cave.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao had the best physical skills and strong close combat ability. He walked at the front of the team, responsible for drawing monsters and containing them, creating opportunities for others to attack.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao had the lowest cultivation, he had mastered the Perception Technique and was also one of the only two martial artists present. His physical skills were better than the others, so he followed beside Wei Biao to assist and scout.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao stood in the middle. </p><p></p><p>He was at the third level of Qi Refinement and possessed a magical weapon, naturally becoming the main damage dealer. Whenever blood bat monkeys posed a threat, he could immediately kill them with the Green Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>Lü Song was skilled in small spells for long-range attacks like Fireball and Ice Arrow, while Lü Lingyu was proficient in spells like Spring Return and Healing used to restore energy and treat wounds.</p><p></p><p>The two of them followed at the back of the team.</p><p></p><p>Responsible for providing support.</p><p></p><p>The division of labor was clear.</p><p></p><p>Only after entering the cave did Yu Xiao discover that it wasn't pitch black inside. Many luminous vines were distributed throughout, and with the light emitted by Jiang Hao's Green Light Sword, it was enough for everyone to see their surroundings clearly.</p><p></p><p>After exploring for an hour,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't have many chances to take action.</p><p></p><p>The blood bat monkeys appeared only two or three at a time.</p><p></p><p>At most, they encountered five simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>With such small numbers, there was no need for him to draw his weapon.</p><p></p><p>He simply focused on doing the odd jobs.</p><p></p><p>Collecting blood essence stones and materials for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group had killed twenty-five blood bat monkeys, and their current harvest was quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, how come we haven't reached the bottom of this cave yet? I feel like we've walked very far," Wei Biao looked puzzled and became somewhat vigilant. "We've had a good harvest this time. Why don't we head back and come again another day?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao was unconcerned, "It's fine. I still have several tenths of my spiritual power left. We can kill a few more batches before leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Since he said so,</p><p></p><p>The others naturally had no objections.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun suddenly heard something and reminded, "Is that the sound of running water ahead?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Song: "It could be an underground river. Magical beasts tend to gather near such water sources."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao: "Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>After passing through a narrow cave passage, </p><p></p><p>A scene that surprised them all appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The space ahead</p><p></p><p>Suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>An underground cavern that had never seen daylight appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Although it had never seen sunlight, it wasn't dark here. Various fungi, vines, and wild grasses covered the ground.</p><p></p><p>These plants didn't rely on sunlight, but grew by absorbing spiritual energy, so their colors were mostly not green, but mainly white, blue, and purple. They emitted a faint fluorescence on their surface, enough to illuminate the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Beautiful!</p><p></p><p>This was Yu Xiao's first impression!</p><p></p><p>It felt like a scene straight out of a fairy tale.</p><p></p><p>Those fluorescent wild grasses were especially dense near the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>Many strange flowers and herbs had also grown, with several emitting rich spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Even though Yu Xiao knew nothing about medicinal herbs, he could tell these things were not ordinary - they were likely spiritual grasses and herbs!</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Replenishing Grass!" </p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun immediately recognized one type of spiritual grass.</p><p></p><p>This purple spiritual grass was the most abundant, with at least one to two hundred plants visible. It was the main ingredient used to refine Spirit Grass Pills.</p><p></p><p>"There's also Spirit Blue Flower!"</p><p></p><p>That was a strange flower entirely blue in color, emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>This was the main ingredient for refining Return Origin Pills, a type of pill that could quickly restore magical power. It was the most commonly used high-efficiency recovery pill for cultivators in the middle and late stages of Qi Condensation. One pill was worth at least twenty spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>A quick glance showed at least twenty flowers.</p><p></p><p>They could refine at least ten Return Origin Pills.</p><p></p><p>Even if sold as raw materials, they would be worth seventy to eighty spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>For a rogue cultivator in the early stages of Qi Condensation, this was undoubtedly a considerable income!</p><p></p><p>Besides the Spirit Replenishing Grass and Spirit Blue Flower, there were several other materials. Although they couldn't be considered heavenly treasures, they were still very useful spiritual medicines and herbs!</p><p></p><p>They struck it rich! This would make them a fortune!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao's eyes revealed a greedy look!</p><p></p><p>Such a large quantity of spiritual herbs and medicines, if he could have it all to himself and exchange it for spirit stones, it would greatly benefit his cultivation and allow him to go much further on the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If it were just normal hunting gains,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao wouldn't think too much about it. Although he didn't think highly of the rogue cultivators of White Cloud Pavilion, he still had to mingle with them in the future, so he had some reservations.</p><p></p><p>But this windfall was really too big! It made him think more.</p><p></p><p>For example: with so many spiritual herbs and medicines,</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't it be a bit too much to split among four or five people?</p><p></p><p>"Listen!"</p><p></p><p>"What's that sound!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao heard some rustling noises.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao made a hand seal to activate the Perception Technique. As the spell took effect, all five senses and various perceptions would be greatly enhanced for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Above!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up.</p><p></p><p>They all showed expressions of horror.</p><p></p><p>The rock ceiling above was densely covered with an alarming number of black shadows.</p><p></p><p>They were waking from their slumber, and countless pairs of crimson eyes appeared before the group!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>"It's Blood Monkey Bats!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Monkey Bats everywhere!"</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, there are too many of them!"</p><p></p><p>After entering this place, the group had been distracted by the spiritual herbs and medicines, so they didn't notice the danger immediately. Now the sleeping Blood Monkey Bats had sensed the presence of intruders.</p><p></p><p>"Squeak squeak squeak——!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Monkey Bats let out sharp screeches!</p><p></p><p>One after another detached from the rock walls and circled in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>Looking up, the five people felt their scalps tingle, because there were simply too many, like a black storm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his blood essence was condensed, his eyes were bright, like a human-shaped fierce tiger, and his strength had increased significantly!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Late-stage Blood Refining was equivalent to a third-rank great martial artist in the mortal realm. Although it was just barely the third rank, it was still much stronger than the fourth rank, and had already reached the level of an expert in White Cloud District!</p><p></p><p>With his current strength,</p><p></p><p>He was capable of upholding the reputation of the Spring Thunder Boxing Gym.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't reach the glory of Master Li's era, it certainly wouldn't easily collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, thank you, junior brother, thank you, Fellow Daoist Lu. Without the help of you two, I wouldn't have been able to break through no matter what!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was most grateful to Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, forget about breaking through, he would have died more than once already.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to say a few more words, he suddenly noticed a faint trace of blood essence circling around Yu Xiao's body, which was a phenomenon not present in the early stage of Blood Refining. He was both surprised and delighted, and said,</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you've broken through too!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "That's right, it's all thanks to the Blood Essence Pill. I was lucky to break through successfully!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao praised: "Although you borrowed the effects of the Blood Essence Pill, being able to achieve a breakthrough so quickly is still extremely impressive!"</p><p></p><p>He felt that his junior brother's future achievements would definitely surpass Master Li's. Breaking through Blood Refining and entering Marrow Refining should be no problem for him. He would certainly be able to participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly and become a true cultivator! Amidst his joy,</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>Master Li's tragedy couldn't be repeated! The Immortal Ascension Assembly was fraught with danger, and his junior brother still lacked combat experience.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Wei Biao immediately said: "The profits from hunting are so high, why don't we form a fixed team and come once or twice every week from now on? What do you two think?"</p><p></p><p>This hunt</p><p></p><p>Had a large element of luck.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Blood Monkey Bats could produce "Blood Essence Stones," which could be used to refine "Blood Essence Pills." Even though their strength wasn't particularly high, their value was among the top in early Qi Condensation stage beasts.</p><p></p><p>And the Blood Monkey Bat nest they encountered this time was of a rarely seen scale.</p><p></p><p>The harvest from this single trip was equivalent to four or five ordinary hunts.</p><p></p><p>They even discovered a large pile of spirit grasses and herbs.</p><p></p><p>This was a low-probability event, otherwise it wouldn't have aroused Jiang Hao's greed, causing him to betray his word and ultimately leading to his demise.</p><p></p><p>Even so,</p><p></p><p>Both of them expressed their support.</p><p></p><p>The income from hunting was still relatively considerable.</p><p></p><p>And both of them were in great need of practical combat experience.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew that the reason Wei Biao proposed regular hunting was not primarily for earning spirit stones, but mainly to use it to temper himself and increase his survival abilities.</p><p></p><p>This goodwill</p><p></p><p>There was no reason not to accept it.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao took several more revolvers,</p><p></p><p>And gave one each to Wei Biao and Lu Lingyun for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao, with his third-rank strength, was already formidable. If he were to be equipped with several firearms, or even bombs and grenades, the comprehensive strength he could display would probably reach the level of Qi Condensation fourth layer!</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Lingyun, although she wasn't skilled in combat, she was a genuine Qi Condensation third layer cultivator, proficient in several recovery spells, and had protective magical tools as a safeguard, which could greatly enhance the team's safety factor.</p><p></p><p>As for Yu Xiao?</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was weaker,</p><p></p><p>He could become the team's MVP with just two Madsen guns.</p><p></p><p>With such a combination, such a team, if they only hunted within the range of White Cloud District's grand formation, it could be said that they would be invincible and unstoppable, with risks so minute they could basically be ignored!</p><p></p><p>And so,</p><p></p><p>For the next two months,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao mainly focused on White Cloud District.</p><p></p><p>As he continuously refined the Green Radiance Sword, it gradually became attuned to his thoughts and as easy to use as his own limbs.</p><p></p><p>Although with his current spiritual power he couldn't use it many times, the effects it could produce were already quite good, and he could basically control it flexibly to strike wherever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Besides this,</p><p></p><p>Most of his time was invested in Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could purchase Spirit Grass Pills from Lu Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>For every twenty Spirit Grass Pills, it only cost eight spirit stones, which was 20% cheaper than the shops, with no difference in quality.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>The Qi Condensation process wasn't as smooth as imagined.</p><p></p><p>He practiced for a full two months,</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he had consumed sixty to seventy spirit grass pills, and made considerable progress, there was still a significant gap to reach the second level of Qi Refining. The difficulty was greater than anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao remained open-minded. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't breakthrough for the time being.</p><p></p><p>So he decided not to rush the breakthrough for now.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew he was not a genius and had mediocre aptitude for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, time was the one thing he didn't lack. There was no need to obsess over this and risk developing mental demons - that wouldn't be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>The past two months had not been wasted.</p><p></p><p>The primary task of refining and controlling the Green Radiance Sword had been successful.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the weekly hunting trips, once or twice a week, always yielded good results. Though far from comparable to the first time, it was still enough to satisfy everyone.</p><p></p><p>During the hunting process,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao accumulated a lot of experience.</p><p></p><p>He had fought tigers and bear monsters multiple times without relying on firearms, greatly improving his survival skills and combat techniques. His martial blood energy had also noticeably progressed.</p><p></p><p>Finally,</p><p></p><p>He continued to resell resources.</p><p></p><p>Even with the high cultivation expenses,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's spirit stone savings still steadily increased.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it had reached 272 pieces - a huge sum!</p><p></p><p>Enough!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was satisfied! Let this period of cultivation end here! Yu Xiao planned to rest for a while and shift his focus back to Dajing... Since hard cultivation couldn't lead to a breakthrough, he might as well try his luck in the provincial capital. Such a place would surely have ideal spirit medicines for sale!</p><p></p><p>Before that,</p><p></p><p>He still had one thing to do.</p><p></p><p>That was to buy a storage bag he had been longing for!</p><p></p><p>"What? You want to buy a storage bag?!" </p><p></p><p>When Wei Biao learned of this, he was very surprised, as storage bags were expensive and most independent cultivators couldn't afford them.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded: "Yes, with a storage bag, our future hunting trips will be more convenient. I've now saved up 200 spirit stones, which should be enough to buy one."</p><p></p><p>200 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was amazed but not surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yu Xiao had some Blood Essence Pills. These pills alone could easily fetch over a hundred spirit stones when sold. And with the bountiful hunting trips lately, it wasn't strange to save up 200 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This amount of spirit stones was indeed enough to buy a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Worried about Yu Xiao's safety alone, Wei Biao decided to accompany him to choose a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?" </p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun walked out from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This woman had been living near the martial arts hall for nearly two months.</p><p></p><p>After spending several months together, she and the two sworn brothers had become close friends. They not only formed an iron triangle for hunting but also often exchanged cultivation insights and helped each other.</p><p></p><p>And their hunting performance,</p><p></p><p>Had attracted the attention and even admiration of many independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there was an elegant nickname for the three in the area: "The Three Friends of Spring Thunder"! This showed that the combination of Yu Xiao, Wei Biao, and Lü Lingyun had gained some fame among the independent cultivators of Baiyun District!</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Buying a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>She then said: "Storage bags are very complex. Do you understand the intricacies?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao and Wei Biao looked at each other, completely clueless.</p><p></p><p>"You two rough men probably don't know how to bargain either. I'm afraid you'll be slaughtered like fat pigs!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun said irritably.</p><p></p><p>She then sighed heavily: "Fine, fine, I have nothing urgent to do anyway. I'll go with you!"</p><p></p><p>That would be great!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao immediately laughed and thanked her: "Much obliged, Fellow Daoist Lü!"</p><p></p><p>Storage bags were indeed expensive and very important. They couldn't be careless about it. Being overcharged wasn't a big deal, but buying a storage bag with quality issues would be.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun had better judgment than the sworn brothers.</p><p></p><p>With her help in appraising, they could avoid many pitfalls.</p><p></p><p>So the Three Friends of Spring Thunder left the martial arts hall and entered the cultivators' market.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

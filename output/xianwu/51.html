        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Transportation in Da Jing was not very developed. Although railway construction had begun, there were very few operational lines. From Mei County to the provincial capital, there were several land and water routes, but none were easy journeys and all required considerable effort.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao chose to travel mainly by water. </p><p></p><p>The water system around Mei County was quite dense, but there was no large river that went directly to the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>He needed to take a boat from Mei County, travel down the Han River, then transfer to the Mei River to Huale Town, then go several dozen li to the East River port. Only then could he board a passenger ship that went directly to the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>This route.</p><p></p><p>The whole journey was seven to eight hundred kilometers.</p><p></p><p>It would take about three days.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao set off in the morning.</p><p></p><p>By noon he had arrived at Huale Town.</p><p></p><p>This town was located at the confluence of the Tanxia River, Wuhua River, and Wupi River. Before rail transport became mainstream, this place would be an important transportation hub for the northeastern part of Guangyue Province.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao disembarked from the boat,</p><p></p><p>He saw the docks crowded with ships large and small.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of rough-skinned laborers were working hard to carry all kinds of goods.</p><p></p><p>Because there were several docks nearby, this place had become a transit point for merchants and travelers, so you could see many people from all over speaking different dialects, which made it seem very lively.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian: "The carriage has been prepared in advance. We still have several dozen li to go next."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to rush. Since we're here, we might as well have a good look around, try some local specialties, and leave tomorrow. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had never traveled far from home.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about places outside Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the others had no objections.</p><p></p><p>So Yu Xiao asked: "Are there any local specialties?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian immediately rattled off a list: "I've heard that the Qinjiang raw fish, Wuhua stuffed tofu, and Hakka salt-baked chicken here are very special."</p><p></p><p>"This Qinjiang raw fish is made from a kind of grass carp called 'chub' here, which is deboned and sliced thinly. The meat is firm, sweet and refreshing, with a chewy texture that lingers in the mouth."</p><p></p><p>"The Wuhua stuffed tofu is delicate, sweet and fragrant, melting in your mouth. In the Hakka dialect, 'tofu' sounds like 'head wealth'. Since it's the New Year and Brother Xiao is going to the provincial capital to buy property, it could be a good omen."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Hakka salt-baked chicken..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian went on and on.</p><p></p><p>Explaining the local specialties, customs and culture.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian was not just an ordinary bookworm. He hadn't actually traveled much either, but he liked to read newspapers and miscellaneous books. His knowledge covered a wide range of topics, and he was very attentive, obviously having done his homework in advance.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Yu Xiao relied on him heavily.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Yu Ruqian's various introductions,</p><p></p><p>The masters all became interested.</p><p></p><p>The maids were even salivating.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Good, since we're here, we can't leave empty-handed. It's lunchtime now, so let's find a restaurant to rest our feet and try some of these local specialties."</p><p></p><p>But as they walked into Huale Town,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because what he saw was somewhat different from what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Huale Town was indeed much livelier than Xiaohe Town. It wasn't hard to see wealthy landowners and merchants in fine clothes all over the streets. And since it was the New Year period, lanterns hung from shops along the street, with many festive activities.</p><p></p><p>But there was always an unpleasant strange smell in the air.</p><p></p><p>And in every corner of the streets and alleys,</p><p></p><p>In inconspicuous small lanes,</p><p></p><p>There were tramps in tattered clothes, as thin as sticks, with sickly faces.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were empty and their faces lifeless. Some had festering wounds on their bodies, even with maggots growing in them, yet they were indifferent, like living dead.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there so many tramps?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian was equally puzzled about this.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang then said: "These are clearly opium addicts. This is the fate of those who smoke opium."</p><p></p><p>Opium? Yu Xiao suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Why there was a strange smell in the air.</p><p></p><p>He found that on the main streets of Huale Town, there were no less than four opium dens, with people coming and going in an endless stream.</p><p></p><p>Opium dens were rampant in the Da Jing dynasty.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect there to be so many opium addicts in a small town.</p><p></p><p>Huale Town</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The convenience of shipping was not a good thing. Large quantities of opium slabs were imported from the provincial capital or other ports, with many being transshipped through this area to the inland. This process inevitably poisoned the local area.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked, "Are there many opium dens in the provincial capital?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just many, they're everywhere. Who knows how many families have been torn apart, how many human tragedies have occurred..."</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang said in a deep voice, "Men addicted to opium often appear emaciated and weak. Once the craving hits, they're willing to abandon their wives and sell their children. Women who become addicted are often at the mercy of others, willing to sell their bodies to pay for opium!"</p><p></p><p>"These opium addicts don't deserve sympathy!"</p><p></p><p>"They'll do anything for opium!"</p><p></p><p>"The foreigners are using this substance to gradually hollow out our people's bodies while reaping huge profits in the process!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had known about the rampant opium dens, but before seeing it with his own eyes, he had underestimated the severity of the problem. The harm caused by opium in this era was shocking.</p><p></p><p>The profits from opium were enormous.</p><p></p><p>The Da Jing Dynasty court was incompetent and weak.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were righteous individuals who wanted to promote an opium ban,</p><p></p><p>The external resistance was too great, easily angering the Western powers.</p><p></p><p>Internally, merchants and officials were in cahoots, making it impossible to clean up the situation.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a corrupt state of affairs, Yu Xiao felt a sense of heaviness in his heart. Even his enthusiasm for eating, drinking, and having fun was affected. After having a meal, he didn't linger and left by horse-drawn carriage that afternoon.</p><p></p><p>On the way to Dongjiang Port,</p><p></p><p>They passed through many dilapidated and desolate villages.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Family Village was quite run-down before Yu Xiao came, compared to these nearly abandoned villages, Yu Family Village was considered prosperous at the time.</p><p></p><p>The most shocking thing was that,</p><p></p><p>Many fields near the villages were abandoned.</p><p></p><p>It was now the early rice season. Xiaohe Town had already started seedling cultivation and soil loosening in preparation for the most important spring plowing. But after the villagers here became addicted to opium, most lost their ability to work, and there was no one left to cultivate the land.</p><p></p><p>Not only that!</p><p></p><p>There was an even more infuriating sight.</p><p></p><p>Some of the cultivated fields, instead of growing crops, were full of large patches of opium poppies, which are the raw material for making opium! Upon inquiry, they learned that</p><p></p><p>Local landlords were cooperating with foreigners.</p><p></p><p>These foreigners provided seeds and agreed to purchase the harvest.</p><p></p><p>While the landlords organized people to plant the raw materials for opium.</p><p></p><p>"How outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang's eyes were red with anger.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Tang family fight so desperately against the foreigners? In fact, rather than fighting foreigners, it was more about fighting the opium poison.</p><p></p><p>Now only Tang Yang and Tang Yue were left of the Tang family, and countless righteous people like the Tang family had died resisting, yet they still couldn't stop the spread of opium poison across this land! All the blood shed was in vain!</p><p></p><p>All the sacrifices had become a joke! Such national and personal hatred!</p><p></p><p>How could one not be angry?!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was equally shocked to see fields of opium poppies, unable to believe he could see such a sight in Guangyue Province.</p><p></p><p>Due to climate and soil conditions,</p><p></p><p>Guangyue Province was not an ideal place for growing this crop.</p><p></p><p>The raw materials produced here were of lower quality.</p><p></p><p>Now that even such places were planting in large quantities, it was hard to imagine what the scene might be like in more suitable planting areas like Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan... It was likely that the mountains and plains were covered with it, no wonder the people were destitute.</p><p></p><p>Although cruel, the sacrifices of the Tang family and others like them were indeed meaningless.</p><p></p><p>These traditional righteous people, influenced by ideas of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, often still harbored illusions about the Jing court.</p><p></p><p>They opposed foreigners but not the Jing Dynasty, even still protecting it. With such an attitude, no amount of sacrifice would be useful... because this land was indeed beyond cure.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had more faith in the Da Xia Society of Ye Biqing and Gao Zhi! Only through overthrow</p><p></p><p>Could there be rebirth!</p><p></p><p>However, the Jing court was still decaying but not weak, nominally still employing hundreds of thousands of soldiers, with a group of loyal supporters, and several capable but foolishly loyal imperial maintainers. They were no match for the powerful ships and cannons of the foreign powers, but they had more than enough to suppress domestic rebellions and uprisings.</p><p></p><p>The world was on the brink of chaos but not yet there. Patience was needed, waiting for the right moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

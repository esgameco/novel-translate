        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was playing with a revolver in the room.</p><p></p><p>He had brought two pistols, two rifles, and over a thousand rounds of ammunition from the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the quantity was not small, they were all ordinary items, only consuming less than 1 point of his Qi. His current Qi was still at 93 points.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Yan, who had reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm, would not be able to withstand the bullets with just his physical body. He could not contend with such a person with just these two weapons!</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Being able to cause damage is one thing.</p><p></p><p>Being able to hit the target is another.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was not only a peak-level Martial Artist, but also a Cultivator at the third layer of Qi Refinement. As long as he prepared in advance and used talisman techniques to protect his body, even if he was shot a few times, it might not cause fatal injuries.</p><p></p><p>The problem is.</p><p></p><p>The Cultivation World does not have handguns.</p><p></p><p>These are ordinary items without any spiritual power fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>So it is difficult to defend against them in advance, and the chances of being at a disadvantage are still high.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was already one of the most formidable Wandering Cultivators in the White Cloud Pavilion, and this meant that with these guns in hand, Yu Xiao already had decent self-defense capabilities within the White Cloud Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, even so.</p><p></p><p>It is still necessary to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>The secret of reaching the Blood Refining Realm "in a single day" must not be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao began to travel frequently between the two realms, spending most of his time in the Main Realm mining and cultivating. With his greatly increased physical strength, he could now dig out three or four hundred catties of spiritual ore in half a day, and spend the rest of the time cultivating or resting.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>More than a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>He had also accumulated over ten thousand taels of wages.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to more than a hundred thousand silver dollars from the Great Realm!</p><p></p><p>It was impossible to spend it all.</p><p></p><p>Impossible to spend it all!</p><p></p><p>This month, his luck was also good.</p><p></p><p>He had dug out six spiritual stones in succession.</p><p></p><p>One was handed over, and the rest were all kept for himself.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's current spiritual stone reserve had reached seven pieces.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, it was about time to reveal the truth to Master Li and enter the next stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Li Yan's tea water trembled.</p><p></p><p>"You said Yu Xiao has already achieved Blood Qi Penetration? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"I have personally checked it several times, and this junior brother has indeed accomplished it!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's face was also full of disbelief. An ordinary miner, having only practiced martial arts for less than two months, being able to cultivate a sense of Qi was already remarkable.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>The facts were right in front of them!</p><p></p><p>They had no choice but to believe it!</p><p></p><p>Li Yan summoned Yu Xiao and personally checked his pulse.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's pulse was strong and powerful. The Martial Artist's Blood Qi was circulating through the meridians, and he had not only entered the Blood Refining Realm, but his Blood Qi was also very solid and dense, probably having achieved Blood Qi Penetration for some time.</p><p></p><p>"It was my mistake, to be able to reach this level in just over a month, you are truly a rare and exceptional martial arts talent!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Are you willing to become my inner disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was overjoyed: "It is my greatest wish!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, starting from tomorrow, I will personally teach you the techniques of the Spring Thunder Fist!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Li!"</p><p></p><p>The goal was successfully achieved!</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Blood Refining Realm in less than two months was a rare talent, but it did not reach the level of a monstrous prodigy, so it would not attract too much unnecessary attention. However, it allowed him to obtain the personal guidance of a peak-level Master.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Thunder Fist has both cultivation methods and fighting techniques.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method is the "Thirty-six Forms" + "Breathing Technique".</p><p></p><p>The main function is to temper the body and activate the Martial Artist's Blood Qi.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method has no practical value in combat, as the essence and core of the Spring Thunder Fist lie in the fighting techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan has been teaching for over ten years, and the cumulative number of disciples is no less than eight hundred, but the ones who can truly enter the door can be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Among these inner disciples, the ones currently staying by his side are only four people: Wei Biao, Gao Han, Fang Dashan, and Peng Tiesheng.</p><p></p><p>As the fifth inner disciple,</p><p></p><p>He naturally needs to get to know these senior brothers first.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Junior Brother Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are a true fellow disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"Entering the Blood Refining Realm in less than two months? I can only admire your talent!"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if you have any problems, please feel free to find your senior brothers. We will definitely do our best to help!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was the eldest senior brother, with a straightforward and enthusiastic personality. He often assisted Li Yan in teaching the registered disciples, and his cultivation had reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm, which was the peak of the fourth rank in the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Han was the second senior brother, quiet and introspective, handling various daily affairs for Li Yan. His cultivation was slightly weaker than Wei Biao's, but he also had the strength of a fifth-rank cultivator in the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Dashan and Peng Tiesheng, they had only been cultivating for three or four years...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He still only had the cultivation of the initial stage of blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Both were in the initial stage of blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>The two had cultivated two strange meridians.</p><p></p><p>Equivalent to a seventh-rank warrior of the Great Landscape.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of their origins, Yuexiao also decided to make friends with them.</p><p></p><p>Fang Dashan was a mountain man from a nearby village, and there were many hunter-gatherers and herb farmers in the village he lived in. In the future, if he wanted to buy wild meat, medicinal materials, and other mountain goods, it would be more convenient to go directly to him.</p><p></p><p>Peng Tiesheng was the son of a wandering cultivator merchant, whose father had the cultivation of two layers of qi refinement and ran a grocery store, selling common daily necessities. In the resource-scarce White Cloud District, his business was doing quite well.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao first privately found Peng Tiesheng.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Peng was a person of average appearance and short stature, but he looked very shrewd.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Yuexiao, do you need any help?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, does your family business sell salt?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Tiesheng smiled and said, "Of course, salt is a necessity of life. In the White Cloud District, it is much more valuable than gold. Junior Brother, if you need it in the future, I'll sell it to you at cost price. As fellow disciples, don't be polite!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother has misunderstood. I'm not here to buy, but to sell some salt."</p><p></p><p>"What? Sell salt?"</p><p></p><p>"It's improper to come empty-handed when becoming a disciple, but I'm short on funds and don't have the means to prepare a gift. Fortunately, I have some good salt, so I thought I could convert it into spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Peng Tiesheng was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Salt in the White Cloud District was much more valuable than gold. </p><p></p><p>One liang of salt could be exchanged for ten or even twenty liang of gold. </p><p></p><p>This junior brother could just take the salt to the market and barter it, why go through this extra step?</p><p></p><p>Of course, as long as there was business to be done, there was no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>When Peng Tiesheng saw the salt Yuexiao brought, his eyes widened in disbelief. He picked up a bit and put it in his mouth, savoring it for a moment, and a look of pleasant surprise gradually appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly an excellent salt!"</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao was not at all surprised by Peng Tiesheng's reaction.</p><p></p><p>There were no salt production sites near the White Cloud District, and all the salt had to be transported from afar by merchant caravans. It was not an exaggeration to call it a luxury item. </p><p></p><p>Many miners didn't even have salt to eat, and could only obtain salt from plants and animals.</p><p></p><p>As for the salt available in the market, it was all coarse salt produced by the traditional brine boiling method. This salt had too many impurities, large granules, dark color, and a bitter taste. But the salt Yuexiao provided came from the Great Landscape and was a very mature, refined salt - pure white, fine-grained, and powdery, incomparable to the ordinary coarse salt.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Junior Brother didn't directly use the salt for barter. This salt is of extremely high quality, incomparable to the ordinary coarse salt."</p><p></p><p>Peng Tiesheng patted his chest and said, "Salt has always been a scarce good. High-quality refined salt is especially rare. Junior Brother, how much are you willing to sell? I'll buy as much as you have, at double the regular salt price, how does that sound?"</p><p></p><p>The regular salt price was around 15 liang per liang. </p><p></p><p>Peng Tiesheng was willing to buy it at 30 gold per liang!</p><p></p><p>Thirty liang of gold in the Great Landscape was 3,000 taels. Buying one liang of salt for 3,000 taels, then one jin of salt would be 30,000 taels - an absurd price that no one in the Great Landscape would dare to dream of!</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the current prices in Mei County, the salt price was only around 3 fen per jin. </p><p></p><p>The procurement cost was practically negligible! Salt was the most basic commodity, and even if one transported a few hundred jin, the loss in spiritual energy would not exceed 1 point.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao had stored many supplies in the stone palace space, including several hundred jin of salt. He just didn't want to take it all out at once, so he only gave Senior Brother Peng about 20 jin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these white, powdery refined salts, "So much?" Peng Tiesheng first exclaimed in surprise, then fell into ecstatic joy. "Good, I'll take it all. In total, three spirit stones, how does that sound to Junior Brother?"</p><p></p><p>This price was still quite reasonable. Three spirit stones could be exchanged for six or seven thousand liang of gold on the market. But to exchange six or seven thousand liang of gold for three spirit stones would not be as easy.</p><p></p><p>For Yuexiao, this was essentially a risk-free business, so he agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Stones +3!</p><p>Current Spirit Stone Accumulation: 10 pieces!</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if I can get more of this good salt, I'll be sure to find you, Senior Brother Peng. I won't let Junior Brother down!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>This was truly a good business.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in addition to mining, there was now another way for him to obtain spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't sell salt every day, or it might attract trouble.</p><p></p><p>In the stone palace, Yuexiao had also stored many other daily necessities, such as white sugar and chili peppers, which were also scarce goods in the district. He could use them to exchange resources and supplies with the wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

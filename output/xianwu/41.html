        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone present got a share.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, and Chief Escort Lei and his son were also allowed to fire a magazine each. They all experienced the brutal ferocity of the new weapon! Young Escort Lei was especially shocked.</p><p></p><p>Not just shocked by the power of the gun.</p><p></p><p>But even more shocked by Yu Xiao's extravagance. </p><p></p><p>Imported bullets.</p><p></p><p>Very precious!</p><p></p><p>Ten bullets cost as much as 1 yuan!</p><p></p><p>In this short while, hundreds of yuan worth of ammunition was used up! This was equivalent to the total income of a sixth-rank escort over three months of enduring wind and rain, risking life at knifepoint!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu didn't even blink, and his guards and followers were also accustomed to it, showing just how wealthy this master truly was.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had someone maintain the guns.</p><p></p><p>Then he had the five machine guns packed up and placed in the stone hall.</p><p></p><p>Several boxes of explosives, landmines, and grenades were also moved there as backup.</p><p></p><p>If the stone hall space was only used as storage, without bringing these items to the main world, this process would not consume luck. It was convenient for withdrawing anytime in the future.</p><p></p><p>"This is the escort receipt, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai handed over a document.</p><p></p><p>The escort fee standard was related to the value of the escorted goods, and also depended on the distance, difficulty and risk of transport. For ordinary goods within Guangyue Province, Wanhai Escort Agency usually charged 0.5% to 1% as escort fee.</p><p></p><p>This time they were transporting weapons.</p><p></p><p>Very sensitive, with higher risk.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules, they charged the maximum rate, multiplied by five.</p><p></p><p>The goods were worth 50,000 yuan, so the escort fee was 2,500 yuan. It was a rare big order.</p><p></p><p>Wanhai Escort Agency had transported goods of higher total value before, but such a high escort fee was the first time in recent years!</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao signed the escort receipt.</p><p></p><p>Housekeeper Yu Ruqian would notify the accountant to settle the remaining payment as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"We have placed several orders with foreign firms in Macau. We may need to trouble Wanhai Escort Agency again in the coming months."</p><p></p><p>"No trouble at all!"</p><p></p><p>Chief Escort Lei was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This was the easiest money-making trip for Wanhai Escort Agency recently.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, Yu Xiao and the escort agency had done a good job with confidentiality measures. Except for the two escort chiefs, no one knew what was in the boxes.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, this shipment was transported within the province, so the journey was not very far. And Yu Xiao now had quite a reputation in Guangyue Province. Bandits would have to think twice when they remembered what happened to Stone Tiger Fortress.</p><p></p><p>"You two have come from afar, please allow me to be a good host!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already booked a banquet at Wanfu Restaurant in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu is too kind!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai and his son knew well the importance of connections in their line of work.</p><p></p><p>This was not only a super client, but also a newly rising hero of the generation. There were only benefits and no harm in associating with such a figure, so they naturally would not refuse his hospitality and immediately joined the banquet.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao not only invited Chief Escort Lei.</p><p></p><p>Local gang leaders and famous merchants all came to attend.</p><p></p><p>Besides them, there were two more unexpected guests.</p><p></p><p>"Official duties kept me busy, causing me to arrive late. My apologies!"</p><p></p><p>When Ye Biqing and Gao Zhi arrived at the restaurant, everyone present was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai and his son secretly marveled that Yu Xiao not only had connections with gangs, merchants and local gentry, but unexpectedly even the county's top two officials gave him such face, coming to attend this kind of underworld gathering with a mix of dragons and snakes.</p><p></p><p>This man had returned to the country less than a year.</p><p></p><p>Yet his power and influence already permeated both legal and illegal circles.</p><p></p><p>Truly a talented and promising hero!</p><p></p><p>Host and guests all enjoyed themselves thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao expressed his intention to invest in Wanhai Escort Agency.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai hesitated a bit: "Mr. Yu, the escort business earns hard money, I'm afraid it doesn't suit your status!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't care about profits, I just want to support a trustworthy escort agency to deal with this increasingly chaotic world," </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "And if Wanhai Escort Agency wants to advance further, with the Chief Escort's reputation and prestige, and the Young Escort's talent and style, there is great hope of expanding beyond Jiaying Prefecture to become the number one escort agency in Guangyue!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai and his son were both somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>They had seen with their own eyes the strength of this Mr. Yu. Calling him a minor warlord or local tyrant wouldn't be much different.</p><p></p><p>He had only returned to the country for less than a year but had already grown to this extent.</p><p></p><p>It was hard not to admire him.</p><p></p><p>It was said that he would be heading to the provincial capital next to vigorously develop industry. If they could engage in full and in-depth cooperation with him, not only would they not have to worry about escort business in the future, but perhaps there would be a chance for the agency to reach new heights.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Old Escort Lei.</p><p></p><p>Lei Changfeng was clearly more tempted.</p><p></p><p>He was young and had more ideas.</p><p></p><p>The escort business was too hard and tiring. Although the money was decent, it was ultimately a bloody profession that wasn't respected.</p><p></p><p>Was the Lei family destined to only live like this for generations? Lei Changfeng was clearly not content with that! Now the world was in turmoil. If he could follow a capable and powerful figure, not only reaching new heights but even changing their fate might not be impossible in the future!</p><p></p><p>Regarding this.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai did not make a decision immediately.</p><p></p><p>No problem, it's very normal</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As long as the intention is conveyed, that's enough.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's expansion in the Dajing world had begun. He would use his business and territory in Mei County as a foundation, then gradually infiltrate his influence into various industries, as well as escort agencies, martial arts schools, civilian gangs, and martial arts sects.</p><p></p><p>He had patience. </p><p></p><p>He didn't pursue the fastest efficiency.</p><p></p><p>Steady and sure, step by step.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he continued to increase his personal prestige, so as to gradually gain the ability to influence the situation in the world.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Several days later.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had stayed long enough in Dajing.</p><p></p><p>Not only had he adjusted his state to the optimal level.</p><p></p><p>All the necessary preparations had also been made.</p><p></p><p>He took the wooden box custom-made by the carpentry shop, took two light machine guns and ten magazines full of bullets from the stone hall and put them inside, and stuffed several hand grenades on his person.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he return to Baiyun District.</p><p></p><p>This caused about 1 point of fortune consumption.</p><p></p><p>He had stayed in Dajing for half a month.</p><p></p><p>Due to the 100-fold time difference.</p><p></p><p>Only a few hours had passed in the main world.</p><p></p><p>With such ample preparation, he could even kill those at the middle stage of Qi Refinement. It should be more than enough to deal with this hunt!</p><p></p><p>When Wei Biao saw Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he noticed was the wooden box on his back.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a qin case, a bit conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, are you..."</p><p></p><p>"These are the latest firearms sent from my hometown!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh that although it could be carried in a wooden box, it still felt very inconvenient. If only he could have a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"New firearms?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the situation was in his junior brother's hometown.</p><p></p><p>Why they could forge so many strange and peculiar tools.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>In this vast world.</p><p></p><p>Nothing is impossible.</p><p></p><p>Although firearms are powerful.</p><p></p><p>They are just the ingenious tricks of mortal craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>Mortal objects are still difficult to gain a foothold in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first introduce you to the three fellow Daoists who will be accompanying us this time. They have different personalities and backgrounds. It's good for you to know in advance so you can be mentally prepared."</p><p></p><p>"Please tell me, senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>For his first time participating in an activity among scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was certainly necessary to have a basic understanding of each other.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said: "Among the three fellow Daoists accompanying us this time, one is at the third level of Qi Refinement, and two are at the second level."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was slightly surprised: "There's actually someone at the third level of Qi Refinement?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this fellow Daoist at the third level of Qi Refinement is named Jiang Hao. Although he's a scattered cultivator, he has some background. He has an uncle who is an outer sect elder of Qinglan Valley, and he himself is only 24 years old."</p><p></p><p>24 years old!</p><p></p><p>And already at the third level of Qi Refinement! This aptitude was considered quite excellent among scattered cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's face was full of envy: "Barring any accidents, he will participate in the Ascension Assembly in the next two years, and given his age and cultivation level, he has a very good chance of being accepted as a disciple of Qinglan Valley!"</p><p></p><p>"That is indeed impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "This person is recognized as a genius in Baiyun District, and relying on his uncle's connection, ordinary scattered cultivators don't dare to provoke him easily... He inevitably tends to be arrogant due to his talent, but as long as you are cautious in your words and actions and don't actively start conflicts with him, it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Most scattered cultivators have strange tempers or are sensitive and suspicious.</p><p></p><p>It's normal that some are difficult to get along with.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "The other two are a pair of siblings. The brother is called Lu Song, and the sister is called Lu Lingyun. The former is proficient in several attack spells, while the latter is skilled in various healing and recovery spells."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very clear about the background of these two, I only know that they came to Baiyun District less than two months ago."</p><p></p><p>"But they are usually very low-key and quite amiable."</p><p></p><p>"They have never had conflicts with anyone."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the gathering place.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao wore soft armor inside and armor outside, with iron gauntlets on both hands, looking fully armed.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao also wore protective gear and carried a large wooden box on his back. This outfit looked a bit strange from the outside, but there were plenty of scattered cultivators with odd attire and peculiar styles, so he didn't stand out too much.</p><p></p><p>The other three arrived.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao was a young man wearing blue clothes with a fairly handsome face.</p><p></p><p>Lu Song looked about thirty, with a square face, wearing a dark green robe, looking mature and steady.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun was a female cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had never interacted with female cultivators before.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't help but take an extra look.</p><p></p><p>In terms of appearance alone, Lu Lingyun was a very ordinary type among female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>She looked to be in her early twenties, but was not a beauty by any means. Her appearance had almost no distinguishing features, and her figure looked somewhat small, as if she was fifteen or sixteen and hadn't fully developed.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were very bright.</p><p></p><p>Though her looks were very ordinary, her temperament was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao always felt that Lu Lingyun gave him a strange sense of incongruity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

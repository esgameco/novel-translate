        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having formed an initial hypothesis.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet tasks are divided into: world tasks, fortune tasks, and merit tasks.</p><p></p><p>The world task is the "ultimate task".</p><p></p><p>It's likely a necessary condition for unlocking the next level.</p><p></p><p>Fortune tasks can be understood as "main quests", which can run throughout and continue to be executed or take effect even after the world has been cleared.</p><p></p><p>As for merit tasks?</p><p></p><p>They can perhaps be understood as "side quests".</p><p></p><p>They only appeared after Yu Xiao officially settled in the provincial capital. It's possible that settling in other regions could trigger other merit tasks, though the content and triggers should be completely random.</p><p></p><p>What's the use of merit tasks?</p><p></p><p>Based on the limited communication possible with the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao learned that completing merit tasks can earn merit points.</p><p></p><p>Merit points may have multiple functions or uses. For now, their biggest use is exchanging for fortune points.</p><p></p><p>Every 100 merit points.</p><p></p><p>Can be converted to 1 fortune point.</p><p></p><p>This greatly encouraged Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because fortune points have always been in a state of deficit. It's been less than two years since he opened the dual-crossing gate, and fortune points have already been consumed to below 80. If he were to engage in large-scale resource trading, these few fortune points wouldn't be nearly enough.</p><p></p><p>Now there's an additional channel to obtain fortune points.</p><p></p><p>No matter how efficient it is.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing!</p><p></p><p>However, the task hints given are too few - one is to eliminate drugs, one is to eliminate evil cultivators. The fact that such goals can be triggered indicates that drugs and evil cultivators are quite rampant in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Drugs?</p><p></p><p>Anyone with eyes can see that.</p><p></p><p>Evil cultivators?</p><p></p><p>This world should no longer have immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It's speculated that evil cultivators may refer to heterodox cultivators who are not martial arts practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang once mentioned that there are many Western or Southeast Asian sorcerers in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>These people's cultivation methods differ from martial artists, and their techniques are quite bizarre, causing many martial arts masters from Da Jing to stumble. Perhaps they are the targets of this task.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The definition of evil cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Is more likely to be divided simply by good and evil.</p><p></p><p>For example, martial artists who have committed heinous crimes may also be considered evil cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The specifics are still unclear and require further research!</p><p></p><p>"Although having two more objectives is a good thing... why do I feel they're both not very easy?!"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Yu Xiao said: "No rush, there's no time limit, and it's not mandatory. The choice is entirely mine. I can't let this disrupt my plans. The urgent task at hand is to improve my personal strength and build up my forces!"</p><p></p><p>Other matters.</p><p></p><p>Can wait! When my strength is powerful enough! When my forces are strong enough! Won't everything fall into place naturally?</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian came to the study to report: "The first batch of associates from Mei County has arrived, along with Lei Changfeng, the young chief of Wanhai Escort Agency!"</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-nine people appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly bowed: "Greetings, Master (Sir)!"</p><p></p><p>These were all personnel transferred from Mei County. Those who addressed Yu Xiao as "Master" were all long-term workers, while those who called him "Young Master" or "Sir" were generally Yu family members or elite militia members.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had purchased a large amount of real estate in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention just twenty or thirty people, even one or two hundred could be accommodated.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao will be recruiting and hiring talents from various industries in the provincial capital next, and will continue to purchase servants and maids from the human market for deployment, as well as adopt children for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But he also needs a group of old hands brought from Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Of these twenty-eight people, fifteen were from the militia, most of whom had the surname Yu.</p><p></p><p>They were selected again from among 500 carefully chosen local braves, so naturally, each of them was skilled, of good character, and loyal. Moreover, their entire families relied on Yu Xiao for their livelihood, making them more trustworthy to use and more worthy of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The other thirteen included kitchen aunts, accounting clerks, etc.</p><p></p><p>They were long-term workers or servants who worked in the Yu family mansion.</p><p></p><p>They had proven quite useful.</p><p></p><p>Besides these twenty-eight people.</p><p></p><p>There was one special assignment.</p><p></p><p>This person was Lei Changfeng, the young chief of Wanhai Escort Agency.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Lei Changfeng excitedly cupped his hands and said, "I begged my father for days before he finally agreed to let me come out and work for you, Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai had already accepted Yu Xiao's investment.</p><p></p><p>He sold a 30% stake in Wanhai Escort Agency for 100,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Although the shareholding ratio was not high at present, it was enough to take their cooperation to the next level.</p><p></p><p>With Yu Xiao's large investment and promise of future business, the old escort master was ambitious to make Wanhai the top escort agency in Guangyue.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yu Xiao was in need of manpower.</p><p></p><p>So Lei Wanhai sent Lei Changfeng to help. He was his most outstanding son, reaching the fourth rank in martial arts before 30, with potential to become a great martial arts master in the future.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Lei Changfeng had started working as an escort at 16.</p><p></p><p>Despite his young age, he had over 10 years of experience traveling north and south, with extensive knowledge of the jianghu world. Working for Mr. Yu would allow him to both protect Yu's safety and potentially be entrusted with important tasks, carving out a new future for himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Yu Xiao gathered all the martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>With Lei Changfeng joining, there were now three fourth-rank experts.</p><p></p><p>Although this was already a formidable lineup, it was not enough to intimidate in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>So Yu Xiao asked, "Master Tang, how are your connections in the martial arts world of the provincial capital?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang immediately replied, "I grew up in martial arts schools in the provincial capital. I know almost all the famous school masters by name, as well as some retired martial arts elders living in seclusion here."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked further, "Are there many experts of the top three ranks in the provincial capital?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang answered, "Experts of the top three ranks are generally martial arts masters. Although such experts are rare nationwide, the provincial capital is full of hidden talents. Just the ones I know of number several dozen!"</p><p></p><p>"So many?" Wang Zhong, Bai Yajie, and Xu Qingfeng looked shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction and said, "Good. Please help me contact these experts, Master Tang. Tell them I'm establishing a special martial arts school and sincerely invite them to join!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked at each other in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Was he going to launch another money offensive?</p><p></p><p>This time to hire a large number of top three rank experts?</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang hesitated slightly before saying, "Young Master Yu, these top experts are either martial arts masters famous for decades or completely retired jianghu celebrities. It may not be easy to invite them all at once!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, these old fellows were all difficult to tame.</p><p></p><p>Forcefully throwing money at them might even offend them.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao smiled mysteriously: "Don't worry. Besides generous compensation, I can offer conditions they can't refuse. Before long, these people will be willing, even eager, to work for me!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't yet reveal what these irresistible conditions were.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang didn't ask further and immediately carried out the order.</p><p></p><p>In the coming days, he would visit these big shots one by one as Yu Xiao instructed. These old fellows would be one of the foundations for Yu Xiao to build his power in the provincial capital!</p><p></p><p>The provincial capital was different from Mei County!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't openly organize troops or equip firearms.</p><p></p><p>But if he could unite the entire martial arts world, or all the martial arts schools in the city, it would be a huge force capable of stirring up trouble, enough to support Yu Xiao in doing anything he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Yu Xiao would try to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>While building up his forces, he would also improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>It had been over four months since Yu Xiao broke through to the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>Since then, he had spent two to three months in Baiyun Workshop practicing boxing every day, hunting for real combat every week. In Dajing, he also used large amounts of blood qi medicines and sparred with martial arts masters for training.</p><p></p><p>The time was almost ripe! With the remaining blood essence pills in hand,</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the fifth rank shouldn't be too difficult!</p><p></p><p>So Yu Xiao formally announced to the masters: "In the coming days, you'll all have to work harder. I'm going to attempt breaking through to the fifth rank!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this news, Wang Zhong and the others were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

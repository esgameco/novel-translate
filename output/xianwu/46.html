        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun murmured, "Uncle Song can rest in peace now!"</p><p></p><p>After spitting at Jiang Hao, Wei Biao became worried again.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Hao has an uncle who's an outer sect elder of Qinglan Valley. If that guy investigates, it could cause some trouble."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun said calmly, "Jiang Hao was devoured by a monster beast and died without a complete corpse. What does that have to do with us?"</p><p></p><p>That's true.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing happens in Baiyun Pavilion every other day.</p><p></p><p>And Jiang Hao wasn't the only one who died this time.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Lü Lingyun's "brother" Lü Song also lose his life? As long as the three of them firmly insist that Jiang Hao died at the hands of a monster beast, even an outer sect elder probably couldn't do anything to them.</p><p></p><p>What is an outer sect elder? It sounds like a high position.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they are just ordinary disciples with some power, but not enough power. As they get older and find it difficult to advance further, they are assigned to manage various affairs outside the sect and supervise miscellaneous outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao's uncle's cultivation level is probably only at the middle stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength can't be called weak, but it's still far from being able to act recklessly. He might not even be able to withstand Yu Xiao's two Madsen guns! Yu Xiao also has the mysterious stone hall to hide in.</p><p></p><p>So there's no need to be too nervous.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's better to have less trouble than more.</p><p></p><p>It's still best to clean up loose ends thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>After disposing of Jiang Hao's body, Wei Biao threw it into a remote mountain ravine. "It's done. In less than one night, wild beasts will gnaw it until not even bones are left."</p><p></p><p>The gains from this operation were extremely bountiful.</p><p></p><p>1 high-grade blood essence stone, 124 ordinary blood essence stones, 422 spirit-replenishing herbs, 24 spirit blue flowers, and various other herbs and monster materials, with a total value of up to several hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In addition, 15 spirit stones, 6 consumable pills of various types, and 1 magical weapon - the Green Light Sword - were found on Jiang Hao's body.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said directly, "Junior Brother Yu's role was crucial in our survival and counterattack against Jiang Hao. This magical weapon should rightfully belong to Junior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun: "That's only right!"</p><p></p><p>And so Yu Xiao obtained the Green Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined he would own a magical weapon so quickly! After all, for a Qi Refining first layer rogue cultivator, magical weapons were truly out of reach, something that could be encountered but not obtained!</p><p></p><p>The Green Light Sword was only a low-grade magical weapon.</p><p></p><p>But it was a low-grade magical weapon of quite good quality.</p><p></p><p>According to Yu Xiao's knowledge, even the worst low-grade magical weapon, as long as it could still be used normally, was worth at least 200-300 spirit stones. One like the Green Light Sword would probably be worth two or three times that.</p><p></p><p>This operation was truly a huge profit!</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, it's best not to use this magical weapon openly within Baiyun Pavilion, to avoid trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao humbly accepted the advice. After all, there were quite a few people in Baiyun Pavilion who would recognize the Green Light Sword. If Yu Xiao used this weapon openly, it would likely bring him trouble.</p><p></p><p>It's better to take it to Da Jing to use!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's Xuantie gloves were impenetrable by swords and spears. Ordinary iron weapons could hardly leave a scratch on them, their durability far surpassing titanium alloy or even special steel. Yet the Green Light Sword tore through them with just one strike.</p><p></p><p>Even with the technology of his past life, it would be difficult to find a material that could withstand the Green Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>And Da Jing's technology was far behind that of his past life. It was almost impossible to produce materials that could resist the Green Light Sword. Even tank armor could be easily penetrated, rendering any protective gear useless!</p><p></p><p>Although the Green Light Sword didn't have many additional mystical arrays, it could change its size, shrinking to as small as a finger.</p><p></p><p>Such a weapon that could be controlled by will, killing enemies a hundred paces away in an instant - if used in a surprise attack, even top martial arts masters could be easily slain!</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining gains, Yu Xiao and Wei Biao split the blood essence stones.</p><p></p><p>All other items were given to Lü Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>The latter was quite valuable, worth over 200 spirit stones, a huge fortune for a rogue cultivator! However, although Yu Xiao contributed the most, he had taken the most valuable Green Light Sword and split the blood essence stones with his senior brother. It was reasonable to give all other gains to Lü Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>After all, in that situation, Lü Lingyun's defensive magical item was also crucial.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun didn't stand on ceremony and readily accepted the materials, planning to distribute them later.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He gave some pills to his two fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>The value of this batch of materials, after being enhanced through alchemy, could double again, enough to exchange for a large amount of Qinglan Valley contribution... This way, he might be able to exchange for an Ascension Order within half a year.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao excitedly said, "With so many Blood Essence Stones, I'll definitely be able to break through successfully this time!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun asked, "Have you two Daoist friends arranged an alchemist in advance to refine the Blood Essence Pills?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao replied, "We'll go find one now."</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun said, "Actually, I have studied alchemy before. Refining Blood Essence Pills is not complicated. If you two trust me, why don't I refine them for you?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao and Wei Biao were both very surprised. </p><p></p><p>This woman who looked ordinary not only concealed her cultivation level and had a high-quality protective magical artifact, but she also knew alchemy? If she wasn't from a major faction, that would be strange! And since she volunteered to help, her alchemy skills probably weren't bad either.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao asked, "How much would Daoist Friend Lu charge?"</p><p></p><p>"We've been through life and death together, so let's consider this making friends. Apart from the cost of auxiliary materials, I won't charge any additional fees."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was overjoyed: "Great!"</p><p></p><p>And so, both parties quickly reached an agreement.</p><p></p><p>1 high-grade Blood Essence Stone and 124 ordinary Blood Essence Stones, all to be used to refine Blood Essence Pills!</p><p></p><p>As for why they didn't keep the high-grade Blood Essence Stone to refine the more valuable Blood Marrow Pills? Mainly because Blood Essence Stones have a very short shelf life, becoming ineffective after just three days in a natural environment.</p><p></p><p>Even with special preservation methods, the shelf life could only be extended to ten days at most.</p><p></p><p>How could Blood Marrow Pills be so easy to refine? The high-grade Blood Essence Stone was just one of the main materials for Blood Marrow Pills, and to refine Blood Marrow Pills, at least three Blood Essence Stones of this quality would be needed.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it was better to use it to refine ordinary Blood Essence Pills.</p><p></p><p>1 high-grade Blood Essence Stone was equivalent to about 10 ordinary Blood Essence Stones.</p><p></p><p>According to Lu Lingyun's prediction, this batch of Blood Essence Stones could refine about 18 Blood Essence Pills.</p><p></p><p>After the group returned to Baiyun District,</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun moved to temporarily stay at the Spring Thunder Boxing Gym.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, without her attendant Lu Song, living alone was inconvenient and not very safe. Moving to the Spring Thunder Boxing Gym would provide some support.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Lu Lingyun was going to refine pills for the two fellow disciples next, so living closer would be more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Several days later,</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun finished refining the pills.</p><p></p><p>She delivered a total of 20 Blood Essence Pills.</p><p></p><p>Two more than the expected 18!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao and Wei Biao were both surprised. This woman's alchemy skills were even higher than expected, at least far superior to the well-known independent alchemists in Baiyun District. It seemed they could directly cooperate with her for future alchemy needs.</p><p></p><p>In the end,</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao requested to split the twenty Blood Essence Pills equally with Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao originally only wanted to take five, after all, Wei Biao was at a critical moment of breaking through to the late stage of Blood Refining, having more Blood Essence Pills as backup would ensure success.</p><p></p><p>And he had taken the Green Radiance Sword.</p><p></p><p>The value of this magical weapon was already equivalent to the total of all the materials.</p><p></p><p>"I initially only asked for five Blood Essence Pills, but now I've suddenly received ten, which is more than enough!" </p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said confidently.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "This time during the hunt, I didn't contribute much. To be honest, it was all thanks to my junior brother's efforts. How could I be so greedy? You should keep these ten pills. Whether you use them for cultivation, as life-saving medicine, or even exchange them for spirit stones, they're all excellent!"</p><p></p><p>His senior brother was indeed as generous as always.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was at the early stage of Blood Refining, about to break through to the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>If he could have Blood Essence Pills to assist, it would save a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>Blood Essence Pills were also a type of highly effective healing medicine that could effectively prolong the life of severely injured people. If everyone had one pill before setting out this time, Lu Song's life could definitely have been saved.</p><p></p><p>So Yu Xiao didn't stand on ceremony.</p><p></p><p>He very happily accepted the pills.</p><p></p><p>These pills could not only help him break through quickly,</p><p></p><p>But also give him more power to survive and protect himself!</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please vote!

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The personal information recorded above is as follows:</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao</p><p>Cultivation: None for now</p><p>Reputation: 102/400 (Somewhat famous)</p><p>Spiritual Qi Growth: 1 point per year</p><p>Current Spiritual Qi: 94</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p>The level of reputation has increased.</p><p>From being an "unknown person" to becoming "somewhat famous", the growth of spiritual qi has changed from 0 to 1.1 points of qi per year.</p><p>This can offset 1 year of aging.</p><p>As long as the spiritual qi can automatically increase by 1 point every year, and without additional consumption, Yu Xiao has already become an immortal being who will never age!</p><p></p><p>From now on,</p><p>He will live long and look down upon the long river of time.</p><p>No matter the changes of the world, he will remain evergreen for eternity!</p><p></p><p>When one has infinite lifespan, they can possess infinite patience. They can spend decades, even centuries, to accomplish a task or scheme.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of Yu Family義館(Righteous Hall) is such an example.</p><p>Most of these children are not yet ten years old. </p><p>They will receive free education and training, and will soon grow into talents.</p><p>Yu Xiao does not address them as servants, but has adopted them as his own義子義女 (righteous sons and daughters). In the future, some of them will stand out and be able to assist him.</p><p></p><p>After the義館was inaugurated, Yu Xiao returned to the manor.</p><p>Another good news came.</p><p>The martial arts masters he had invited have set out one by one.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao has essentially become immortal, he will still persist in cultivating and improving his martial arts abilities.</p><p>Because immortality does not mean indestructibility. </p><p>Even with an infinite lifespan, he can still be killed by fatal injuries.</p><p>With unlimited lifespan and time, how can he be content to be confined in one place or realm? Improving his cultivation and abilities can not only better protect himself, but also allow him to appreciate the wonders of the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>These days, Yu Xiao has been recruiting powerful martial arts masters. On one hand, they can serve as assistants and sparring partners; on the other hand, they can also become his guards and bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>Mei County has over 400,000 people, and there are indeed many skilled individuals. </p><p>However, most of them are involved with local gangs and factions, so their integrity may not be reliable.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Celestial World, martial arts have been revered since ancient times. There are many martial arts sects and schools, some with histories of over a thousand years. Furthermore, with the recent population and industrial growth, martial arts schools have sprung up all over the country.</p><p></p><p>Rather than recruit a mixed group of gangsters and thugs, why not directly write to these sects and schools? With money, one can get anything done! As long as the price is right, these forces may be able to provide private tutoring.</p><p></p><p>Although it may be more troublesome and costly, there are three major benefits:</p><p>1. The martial artists from renowned sects and famous schools will have stronger theoretical foundations and higher martial arts quality.</p><p>2. These sects and schools have long-standing histories and highly value their reputations. With their forces as backing, their personal integrity and credibility are guaranteed.</p><p>3. These martial artists come from all over the province, even other provinces. They do not know each other and have no local roots in Mei County, which can maximize confidentiality and prevent collusion with outsiders, thereby greatly enhancing safety.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, in the Yu Family manor, fourteen martial arts masters greeted Yu Xiao with flattering expressions.</p><p>These people came from different backgrounds - some from the provincial capital, some from Buddhist cities, some from Guangzhou, some from Jiangzhou, and a few from other provinces. They were all highly skilled, and were now undergoing an interview with the young master of the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to underestimate this young master! He was the son of an overseas tycoon, and those who could make it big abroad these days were all fabulously wealthy. It was said that after returning to the country, he had generously donated nearly 10,000 taels of silver to assist orphans, the elderly, and the villagers - an amount that they could never earn in three lifetimes!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the young master was in need of personnel. If they could pass the interview and stay, they would naturally enjoy a life of luxury and comfort. "You have all come from afar and it has been tiring. I, Yu, will certainly not treat you poorly," Yu Xiao said as he sat in the grand chair.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "I have returned to the country with the sincere intention of cultivating the martial arts, and I need some bodyguards and protectors around me. You may all introduce your abilities, and as long as you meet the requirements, you will be able to stay."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "Even if you do not meet the requirements, I will still cover all your travel and accommodation expenses, and give you a generous gift as a token of my appreciation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of the crowd lit up with delight.</p><p>"The young master is indeed righteous and generous!"</p><p>"Then who shall go first to introduce themselves?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who's next?" </p><p></p><p>"I'll go first!" A middle-aged man, around 40-50 years old, stepped forward. He was tall and slender, with a fair complexion and a melancholic demeanor. Dressed in a simple long robe, he looked more like a cultured scholar.</p><p></p><p>"I am Tang Yang, a Fourth-Grade Martial Artist. My ancestors hailed from the Sichuan-Chongqing region, and I am the sole inheritor of the Feiyi Martial Arts Hall in the provincial capital."</p><p></p><p>Fourth-Grade Martial Artist? The others were all taken aback.</p><p></p><p>They had been a bit resentful that he had gone first, but now they all fell silent and obediently waited their turn.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded amiably when he saw Tang Yang. The master and the Feiyi Martial Arts Hall behind him were worthy of respect.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, when the foreigners invaded Guangzhou, many patriotic warriors had risen to defend the city. The old master of the Feiyi Martial Arts Hall was one of them. Sadly, the outcome was tragic. The Tang family was ambushed, and the entire clan was wiped out. The old master managed to kill over a dozen foreign enemies before being mercilessly gunned down on the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>Now, the only survivors from the Tang family were Tang Yang and a young girl.</p><p></p><p>The Feiyi Martial Arts Hall had fallen into decline and could no longer operate.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang said, "The Feiyi Martial Arts Hall has two supreme martial arts techniques - the Flying Swallow Step and the Plucking Leaf Skill. The former is an exceptional lightness skill, which, when mastered, allows one to fly like a swallow, scaling walls and ceilings. The latter is a hidden weapon art, which, when perfected, can use fallen leaves to injure opponents."</p><p></p><p>He demonstrated by pinching a leaf between his fingers and flicking it out. The leaf flew like a dart, leaving a scratch on the trunk of a loquat tree several steps away.</p><p></p><p>"Pardon my poor display," Tang Yang said humbly, bowing with his hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he was anxious. He desperately needed this job, not only to avoid persecution from certain forces in the provincial capital but also to properly raise his daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive skills, Master Tang!" Yu Xiao nodded approvingly. The Feiyi Martial Arts Hall was known for its loyal and capable disciples, and Tang Yang, with his young daughter, was a reliable candidate.</p><p></p><p>"The basic monthly salary for a Fourth-Grade Instructor at the provincial capital's major martial arts halls is around 100 taels. I'll offer you 300 taels. How does that sound, Master Tang?"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Yu!" Tang Yang could barely conceal his delight. This was far beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>A woman in her late twenties eagerly stepped forward. "I am Bai Yajie, a Sixth-Grade Martial Artist from the Red Snake Martial Arts Hall in Dongguan. Although I may not be as skilled as Master Tang, our hall has a unique blood qi massage technique."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Tell me more about it," Yu Xiao said, eyeing the voluptuous woman.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie quickly explained, "After Young Master practices, this technique can be used for massage, quickly relieving fatigue and accelerating physical recovery, as well as boosting the regeneration of blood qi."</p><p></p><p>Intrigued by the technique's benefits, Yu Xiao offered a salary of 200 taels, which Bai Yajie was more than satisfied with, as it was three times her usual earnings at the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>An elderly man with a white beard stepped forward. "I am Xu Qingfeng, from Mount Longhu, currently at the Fifth-Grade of cultivation. Although I am advanced in years, I am proficient in the preparation of various tonics and elixirs, some of which can greatly replenish one's qi and blood, effectively accelerating Young Master's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Excellent! Yu Xiao nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Then, a towering, burly man stepped out. "I am Wang Zhong, Fourth-Grade, from the Shaolin School. I possess a set of Iron Cloth Shirt techniques, which, when perfected, make me impervious to blades and arrows. I can also serve as a bodyguard to protect Young Master's safety."</p><p></p><p>A Shaolin disciple! And a Fourth-Grade Martial Artist, no less. Impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Approved!"</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>And so on, until after a thorough selection, eight individuals were chosen.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, and four other Fourth and Fifth-Grade Martial Artists would serve as combat instructors, able to impart their skills and guide the cultivation. Bai Yajie and Xu Qingfeng would provide supplementary support, with massage therapy and potent elixirs.</p><p></p><p>These were all renowned martial arts halls and sects, and each of them possessed formidable abilities. Even the weakest, Bai Yajie, would be considered a top-tier expert in Meizhou.</p><p></p><p>The salaries were hefty, but well worth it. Not only would there be a guarantee of safety, but the cultivation progress would also skyrocket. (End of chapter)</p>

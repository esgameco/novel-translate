        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After autumn began.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai's health deteriorated day by day. He had a fever for over ten days straight, was listless, and had no appetite. Even prescriptions from the best doctors for miles around had no effect.</p><p></p><p>This morning. </p><p></p><p>He suddenly improved.</p><p></p><p>He insisted on going out to see the village.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai had no choice but to support his elderly father as they went out.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai walked on the land he had devoted his entire life to.</p><p></p><p>Every blade of grass and tree here was intimately familiar, every corner filled with memories.</p><p></p><p>In a daze.</p><p></p><p>He saw himself running around as a child.</p><p></p><p>As well as the shadows of those who had once walked here but were now gone.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Guotai reached higher ground, leaning shakily on his cane, basking in the warm sunlight, he saw wisps of smoke rising from every household. Many villagers were taking advantage of the sunshine to dry grain in their courtyards.</p><p></p><p>The village granaries were full.</p><p></p><p>This hadn't happened in many years.</p><p></p><p>People's faces had color again - no longer thin and sallow as before. Some wore new clothes, some new cloth shoes. Children noisily made their way to private school, seeming to have a new light in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary daily life.</p><p></p><p>Yet he never tired of looking at it.</p><p></p><p>Could never tire of looking at it. </p><p></p><p>He just wanted to look a bit longer!</p><p></p><p>"The village has changed so much in the past six months..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we've suffered for too long. It's been many years since we've seen a scene like this."</p><p></p><p>"They've started renovating the ancestral hall. Should we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure!"</p><p></p><p>The Yu family ancestral hall that hadn't been repaired in 20 years.</p><p></p><p>Was now undergoing extensive renovations. Though not yet complete, it already looked impressive.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai: "Nephew Yu Xiao is too generous. He donated 2000 yuan all at once to renovate the ancestral hall for the village, dig wells and repair village roads. Life will surely keep getting better from now on."</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai's face was full of gratification.</p><p></p><p>But he also felt a wave of sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"I was clan leader for 30 years. Too many clan members died of starvation and disease. Too many children were forced to be sold. Too many people had no choice but to leave their homes and go overseas to make a living."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes, flowing down his wrinkled old face and dripping onto the yellow earth below.</p><p></p><p>"I have failed our ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with his father's pained, self-reproachful expression and head full of white hair.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai quickly consoled him: "Father, this isn't your fault. It's just the state of affairs these days. Fortunately, now we have nephew Yu Xiao looking after the village. I'm sure nothing like that will happen again in the future."</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>The common people at the local level in the Great Jing Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Had long since lost their land.</p><p></p><p>Almost all farmers had become tenants farming for landlords.</p><p></p><p>The imperial court piled on taxes and levies layer after layer. Life was too difficult for the common people these days.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai said: "Qinghai, you must remember every word of what I'm about to say."</p><p></p><p>"Please go on."</p><p></p><p>"We must know to be grateful and repay kindness. We must remember every bit of Yu Xiao's kindness, generation after generation. We can't forget it and must repay it. We absolutely can't take it for granted."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"...The young men of our Yu family can't just think of themselves. If there are changes in the world in the future, if our nation needs us, you can't shrink back. You must at least do what you can within your abilities."</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Also..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai had a lot to say today.</p><p></p><p>He instructed Yu Qinghai on many things all at once.</p><p></p><p>Making Yu Qinghai have an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you're not fully recovered. Let's go back early so your second and third brothers don't worry."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Fatigue washed over him like a tide. Yu Guotai realized his time was almost up, so he let his son support him home. Almost as soon as they crossed the threshold, the old man collapsed again.</p><p></p><p>This time.</p><p></p><p>He never got up again.</p><p></p><p>The Yu family hurriedly called for the doctor again.</p><p></p><p>The doctor sighed and said: "His pulse is like boiling water in a pot - floating without root. This is a sign that all five organs are failing. His natural lifespan is ending. Birth, aging, sickness and death - fate cannot be defied. Please accept my condolences."</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>The sons began to wail.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his grief, Yu Qinghai instructed those around him: "Quickly, go to town and notify Ruqian and Yu Xiao. Perhaps they can still see him one last time!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Twenty minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao and Yu Ruqian rushed over.</p><p></p><p>By now many villagers had heard the news and gathered outside the house.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The old clan leader has worked hard for most of his life."</p><p></p><p>"Now that things are finally looking up, how could he..."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao'er is here!"</p><p></p><p>"Make way!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone immediately stepped aside without a word.</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian knelt by the bedside, weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be sad. At this age, heaven has already been kind to me," Yu Guotai said in a faint voice, comforting Yu Ruqian. "In the future, you must listen to Xiao carefully and never engage in any rebellious acts."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Grandfather. Ruqian swears to heaven that he will follow Brother Xiao to the death and will never have second thoughts!"</p><p></p><p>"I have one more wish now."</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai looked at Yu Xiao: "Xiao, please take on the role of clan leader. The village now follows you."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao politely declined: "Old clan leader, I still have many things I must do. In the future, I won't be staying in Mei County most of the time, so I'm afraid I can't fulfill this role..."</p><p></p><p>He wasn't from Yu Village. How could he become the leader of the clan?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, as long as I, Yu Xiao, am here, from now on, no one in Yu Village will starve to death, nor will anyone be forced to sell their children."</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai didn't insist.</p><p></p><p>His condition was getting worse.</p><p></p><p>"Ruqian, go out first. I have some words to say to Xiao alone."</p><p></p><p>Although reluctant, Yu Ruqian knew that his grandfather must have important things to say, so he obediently withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai held Yu Xiao's hand in front of him and said softly: "Xiao, I can see that you're not actually Awang's grandson, right..."</p><p></p><p>What? He was found out. When did this happen?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>But thinking carefully, it wasn't strange.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai was Yu Guowang's cousin.</p><p></p><p>If anyone in this world could spot the flaw, it would only be the old clan leader.</p><p></p><p>"Child, although I don't know why you're so good to us, this old man sincerely thanks you... If Awang knew about this, he would surely be happy too!"</p><p></p><p>He was like a candle in the wind now.</p><p></p><p>Barely hanging on with his last breath.</p><p></p><p>He could pass away at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't interrupt, just quietly listening to the old man's last words.</p><p></p><p>"Child, you are a capable person with a kind heart, but there are millions of Yu Villages on this land. Even a sage couldn't change this situation... I think the Great Jing Dynasty has probably reached the end of its fate!"</p><p></p><p>"I believe you have the ability to protect Yu Village and keep it safe."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't want you to be limited to just one place."</p><p></p><p>"With your abilities, with your talent."</p><p></p><p>"You should benefit the whole world!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had thought that before his death, Yu Guotai would ask him to take good care of his children and grandchildren. He didn't expect that the final wish would be for Yu Xiao to leave Mei County and care for the whole world.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, this scene.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but feel dazed.</p><p></p><p>An old man from his memories overlapped with the one before him.</p><p></p><p>That was Yu Xiao's grandfather in his previous life. The old man had been a soldier, and due to worsening lung disease in his later years, he could only live with a respirator, unable to leave his bed all year round.</p><p></p><p>Even such an old man, tormented by illness,</p><p></p><p>Even though he lay in bed with a respirator every day, he never forgot about national affairs, worrying about the unification and future of the nation, to the extent that he became a laughingstock in many people's mouths.</p><p></p><p>Though of humble status,</p><p></p><p>He dared not forget to worry about the country.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some people would find it laughable.</p><p></p><p>But when a country or a nation has millions of such ordinary people, it becomes an unstoppable force!</p><p></p><p>No matter how great the difficulties faced, no matter how many times it falls, it will eventually be reborn and become great again.</p><p></p><p>"Old clan leader, don't worry!" Yu Xiao said, "I promise, this land will be reborn. At that time, there will be no opium ravaging the country, no foreign powers bullying us. Everyone will have enough to eat, everyone will have clothes to wear, and everyone will be proud of their nation!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that would truly be a wonderful era..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai's tightly gripped hand loosened, and then he peacefully closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the 18th day of the 10th month in the 78th year of Emperor Qian of the Great Jing Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai, the old clan leader of Yu Village, died of natural causes at the age of 84.</p><p></p><p>Seven days later.</p><p></p><p>With Yu Xiao's support.</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai took on the role of the new clan leader.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

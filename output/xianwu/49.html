        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The market in Baiyun District still had its usual atmosphere. This corner of the cultivation world, at the lowest level, had none of the transcendent qualities of immortals, but was instead full of mundane sights and sounds.</p><p></p><p>Some people were cooking spirit rice porridge on the street. </p><p></p><p>Others were hawking fruits, vegetables, meat and eggs.</p><p></p><p>There were also stalls set up for fortune-telling and treating illnesses.</p><p></p><p>Rogue cultivators bustled about, mostly at the first level of Qi Refinement, with a few at the second level. Those at the third level were extremely rare. From their dirty robes and shoes, to their shrewd and cunning smiles, they weren't much different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Not all cultivators were aloof beings who abstained from worldly affairs and could cover the sky with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Low-level cultivators were human too! Being human meant they needed to eat and work for a living.</p><p></p><p>This was the cultivation world in its unadorned, simple and authentic state.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao's mindset was completely different from a year ago. Back then, he was just an ordinary person without any cultivation or background, so he had to tread carefully even when walking and breathing here.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid of accidentally offending the unpredictable rogue cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And bringing unnecessary trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>Now things were different.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Xiao's Qi Refinement level wasn't high, he had mid-stage Blood Refinement martial arts cultivation. With this, he could already fight better than most second level Qi Refinement cultivators. He had also recently become one of the "Three Friends of Spring Thunder", gaining some fame among the rogue cultivators in the district.</p><p></p><p>The three of them browsed several cultivator shops.</p><p></p><p>After comparing, Xu Xiao chose a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>It was only palm-sized, not only convenient to carry, but also plain and inconspicuous in appearance. It had a storage space of 100 cubic feet, which was about 2.8 cubic meters.</p><p></p><p>Not very big.</p><p></p><p>But enough for his needs.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, it could fit several light machine guns and dozens of magazines.</p><p></p><p>"You gentlemen truly have good taste. This is one of our shop's prized items!" </p><p></p><p>It was a big sale!</p><p></p><p>The fat shopkeeper hurried over to serve them personally.</p><p></p><p>He introduced: "Unlike the worn-out, second-hand defective products in other shops, this storage bag was crafted by a renowned equipment refining workshop. It's brand new and has never been used..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "Cut the nonsense, just tell us the price!"</p><p></p><p>The fat shopkeeper said with a smile: "Only 240 spirit stones. This price is quite cheap!"</p><p></p><p>What? 240 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao drew in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao had looked at several storage bags for sale.</p><p></p><p>Most were indeed worn and patched up, with not very large spaces.</p><p></p><p>This one was the most satisfactory, except the price exceeded his budget. If they could bargain it down by 10%, it would be barely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun interrupted the shopkeeper's endless boasting.</p><p></p><p>She picked up the storage bag and felt it, saying: "Although this storage bag is in good condition, it's definitely not brand new. I can see at least three repair marks!"</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It also couldn't have been made by a top-tier equipment refiner, because there are many flaws on it. This is definitely not the style of a famous workshop!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun then pointed out over a dozen flaws in terms of materials, craftsmanship, array inscriptions and so on, almost disparaging the storage bag as worthless trash.</p><p></p><p>She had an imposing manner and made convincing arguments.</p><p></p><p>Even the shopkeeper was intimidated.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun said directly: "Final offer - 150 spirit stones, not a stone more. If you agree, we'll make the deal right now. If not, we're leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao and Xu Xiao stared at each other in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The price had been slashed by nearly 100 spirit stones in one go.</p><p></p><p>Buying a storage bag wasn't like buying clothes. Bargaining this hard was very risky. They could easily get kicked out by the shopkeeper.</p><p></p><p>The fat shopkeeper's face alternated between pale and flushed. He hadn't expected to encounter someone who truly knew the trade. His usual tricks were completely ineffective.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go look at some other shops!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun gave them a look.</p><p></p><p>The three of them tacitly started to walk away.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper hurriedly called out: "Wait, fellow Daoists. We can still negotiate on the price. But 150 spirit stones is absolutely impossible. If I make the deal at that price, the owner will have me pack up and leave tonight."</p><p></p><p>It's negotiable?</p><p></p><p>That's good!</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun took charge of the negotiations herself.</p><p></p><p>After some back-and-forth, they finally settled on 180 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao and Xu Xiao didn't dare to breathe, completely watching Lü Lingyun's performance. In the end, they paid the spirit stones and obtained the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lü, impressive skills. I'm in awe!"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them walked back.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun was quite satisfied with the result.</p><p></p><p>She also seemed to really enjoy the battle of wits during the bargaining process.</p><p></p><p>She said: "In the future, when buying expensive items, make sure to call me. Otherwise, with just you two, you'd be helping count the money after being sold yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The market for independent cultivators is very deep!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was speechless. He felt something wasn't quite right! He and his senior brother were the real independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This woman was clearly a young lady from some cultivator family!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't important. </p><p></p><p>Having someone help save money was never a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao quickly said: "Fellow Daoist Lü has been a great help to me. I must treat you to a meal today no matter what!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun nodded and said: "Alright, I won't be polite about it!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "Hehe, then I'll tag along and benefit too!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>He spent five spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>To treat the three of them to a good meal.</p><p></p><p>With this.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao now owned his first storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This period of cultivation could now come to a satisfying conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao hadn't broken through to the second level of Qi Refining, he had successfully mastered the Green Radiance Sword and obtained his first storage bag. These two items would bring him much convenience in his upcoming adventures in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>That day.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, the three returned to the martial arts gym full and satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao returned to his own residence.</p><p></p><p>He immediately crossed over to the stone hall, then entered the Great Jing world.</p><p></p><p>[Destiny -3!]</p><p></p><p>[Destiny -6!]</p><p></p><p>[Remaining Destiny: 80!]</p><p></p><p>Losing as much as 9 points of destiny at once.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao still felt somewhat pained.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that his destiny income wasn't keeping up with expenses, and was becoming increasingly insufficient.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait until he reached the provincial capital to acquire destiny faster, otherwise this amount of destiny would soon be used up.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this destiny was well spent. The items brought back from the cultivation world this time were precisely the newly purchased storage bag and the magical weapon Green Radiance Sword! After months of spiritual power refinement.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had completely refined the Green Radiance Sword.</p><p></p><p>Now he could summon the Green Radiance Sword at any time to kill enemies dozens of feet away.</p><p></p><p>People in this world would guard against guns and explosives, and be wary of swords and hidden weapons, but they had never seen magical weapons before, much less understand how powerful magical weapons could truly be.</p><p></p><p>When not in use, the Green Radiance Sword.</p><p></p><p>Could shrink to the size of a finger.</p><p></p><p>It could be completely hidden in a sleeve, or worn as an accessory.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, enemies would find it even harder to guard against. Even if the opponent was a first-class martial arts master, or even a grandmaster level figure, they could still be caught off guard and severely injured or even killed!</p><p></p><p>With this magical weapon in hand.</p><p></p><p>His sense of security had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had also brought the storage bag at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The storage bag required a corresponding incantation to open.</p><p></p><p>People of this world could not decipher the incantation, so even if they obtained the storage bag it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao placed two fully loaded and chambered Madsen light machine guns inside. He only needed about two seconds to complete the action of drawing the guns and opening fire.</p><p></p><p>He could achieve the element of surprise and attack the unprepared! Even a grandmaster would suffer greatly in the face of such sudden and violent firepower!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao found Yu Ruqian and asked: "How are the arrangements for the winery going?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Xiao-ge!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian said: "We have already sent out acquisition invitations to several wineries. Among them is Guangfu Old Wine located in the provincial capital, which has been struggling recently and is almost bankrupt. We should be able to buy it."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Although the spirit wine brewing was successful.</p><p></p><p>The over ten thousand catties of spirit wine certainly couldn't all be sold.</p><p></p><p>This batch of highest-end wine would mainly be used to make a name for itself, and was positioned as the most top-tier luxury consumer good.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao planned to buy several large wineries and old brand names for integration. This way he could quickly occupy the domestic market using their influence, then sweep overseas, achieving the title of Wine King.</p><p></p><p>First establish a foothold in the business world.</p><p></p><p>The wine industry market was actually not small.</p><p></p><p>Compared to shipping, finance, and military industries, there weren't as many top gangs, consortiums, and major forces involved, so the waters weren't as deep. It was suitable for early stage development and making big money quietly.</p><p></p><p>With industry, connections, and reputation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao would be able to more unscrupulously unleash his money power and go on a crazy buying spree!</p><p></p><p>From textile factories, restaurants and teahouses, department stores, to schools, pharmaceutical factories, hospitals, and even arms manufacturing, automobile and shipbuilding and other heavy industries, he could lay out plans and infiltrate everything, thereby controlling the world's economic lifelines!</p><p></p><p>In a few more days.</p><p></p><p>It would be the Great Jing Spring Festival.</p><p></p><p>And this would be Yu Xiao's first Spring Festival since coming to this world.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

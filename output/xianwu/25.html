        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Morning.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan is about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Many people are seeing him off.</p><p></p><p>Among them is an acquaintance of Yu Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>Wang the Manager, the outer gate steward of Qinglan Valley.</p><p></p><p>He has come to see him off, and besides their personal relationship, there are other reasons. One can see his attendant handing over two items.</p><p></p><p>One is a blue-green robe.</p><p>One is a blue-green wooden plaque.</p><p></p><p>Manager Wang announces: "During his time in Baiyun Pavilion, Li Yan has made many contributions to the sect, and is now granted the status of an outer disciple to retire back home!"</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Li Yan had given his real estate to Wei Biao, the Ascending Immortal Talisman to Yu Xiao, and donated all his remaining personal property without compensation to Qinglan Valley, after retrieving the assets from the Golden Knife Gang that had harmed his disciples.</p><p></p><p>He had been in Baiyun Pavilion for over twenty years.</p><p></p><p>He had already indirectly made many contributions to Qinglan Valley.</p><p></p><p>Although he was unable to become a formal disciple of Qinglan Valley, by donating all his personal assets in exchange for the status of an outer disciple, he was probably seeking some solace.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior brother!" </p><p></p><p>Li Yan bowed to Manager Wang.</p><p></p><p>He then bowed three times towards Qinglan Valley.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao and Wei Biao stepped forward and put the blue robe on him.</p><p></p><p>This robe was similar in style to the one worn by Manager Wang, just with slightly simpler patterns, and made of ordinary fabric, without any special features.</p><p></p><p>Manager Wang said, "The spirit boat is about to set sail, Brother Li should board it quickly to avoid missing the departure time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Under the sendoff of the crowd, Li Yan boarded the flying boat. As he watched the boat gradually move away from Baiyun Pavilion, he gently stroked the plain and simple blue robe on him, and couldn't help but sigh wistfully.</p><p></p><p>"What was my life all about, after all?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao watched Li Yan depart.</p><p></p><p>He knew that from now on, there would be no more Li Yan in Baiyun Pavilion, no more Li Yan in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>In some unknown corner of this vast land, there would be a grave for the returning wanderer, but his experiences would not be celebrated, for this was just the mundane story of a failed cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the world or industry, the focus is always on the movers and shakers at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>However, beneath the feet of every glorious figure, there are countless Li Yans who have exhausted themselves in pursuit, ultimately achieving nothing, and having to bow out in mediocrity and regret.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao still holds Li Yan and such people in deep respect.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan may have been just an insignificant and ordinary drop in the cultivation world, but it is precisely the countless such drops that come together to form the mighty rivers and oceans, allowing the most brilliant and dazzling waves to emerge.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li! Safe journey!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao cupped his hands and bowed towards the direction the flying boat disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Yan's departure saddened and troubled him, it did not affect his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>He adjusted his mindset and began to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He first took out twenty spirit stones and bought forty spirit herb pills in one go, then applied for a long leave at the mine.</p><p></p><p>Manager Wang had no objections.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already agreed to Li Yan's request to allow Yu Xiao to work freely without attendance constraints, and although Li Yan was now gone, this bond of gratitude remained.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as Li Yan's direct disciple, Yu Xiao had already become a Blood Warrior, and would most likely be able to enter the Qi Refining stage in the future, making it unlikely for him to remain a miner forever.</p><p></p><p>After making the necessary preparations, Yu Xiao began his breakthrough cultivation directly in the Fist Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After Li Yan's departure, the Fist Pavilion's owner became Wei Biao.</p><p></p><p>As Wei Biao's only true disciple, Yu Xiao naturally had the right to use the facilities here, and choosing to cultivate here was both convenient for seeking guidance and relatively safer.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>To focus and avoid distractions, Yu Xiao had not gone to the Great Scenery even once, spending most of his time cultivating the Azure Wood Technique, and only occasionally helping Wei Biao manage the Fist Pavilion and seeking his advice.</p><p></p><p>After a month of cultivation, his progress in the blood qi aspect was not significant, but at least there was no regression.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Azure Wood Technique showed remarkable results, as he had spent dozens of spirit stones, which was a considerable amount for any wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was a small number, but even a piece of wood could not possibly make no progress.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaoqing clearly felt it.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy gathered into a sea of energy in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The conditions for cultivating qi had been met!</p><p></p><p>"Almost there!"</p><p>"It's time to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaoqing then began to cultivate in seclusion, and for the next half a month, except for the fixed times for meals and drinking water, he was in a state of sitting meditation and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The sea of energy became more and more active.</p><p></p><p>It reached the critical point of quantitative change to qualitative change!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaoqing felt that his dantian was like a tank filled with gas.</p><p></p><p>His diligent cultivation day after day finally sparked a small flame.</p><p></p><p>Although it was insignificant, it ignited the spiritual energy, causing it to undergo a miraculous transformation, and finally burning and forming a controllable spiritual energy vortex.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual energy vortex automatically absorbed spiritual energy, transformed it into controllable spiritual power, and then transmitted it throughout the body.</p><p></p><p>It's done!</p><p></p><p>This power!</p><p></p><p>It was the magical power of a cultivator!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Xiaoqing was no longer an ordinary martial artist.</p><p></p><p>But a true qi-cultivating practitioner!</p><p></p><p>Although he only had the cultivation of the qi-cultivating realm, he already possessed abilities that ordinary people did not have, and could learn various basic spells, activate various basic magical treasures, or use spell talismans and the like.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yu Xiaoqing came out, Wei Biao approached him with a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>He had been staying nearby in recent days, spontaneously protecting his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator in the late stage of the qi-cultivating realm, Wei Biao naturally could sense the changes in spiritual energy and the fluctuations of spiritual power, so he felt Yu Xiaoqing's breakthrough at the moment it happened!</p><p>"Thank you, senior brother Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaoqing's mood was also very good at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Before this.</p><p>He was just an ordinary person.</p><p>From now on.</p><p>He was a true cultivator.</p><p></p><p>With the blood qi of an eighth-grade martial artist, the cultivation of the qi-cultivating realm, and weapons like firearms for self-defense, his comprehensive combat power in Baiyu Town was already not weak.</p><p></p><p>And with the success of qi-cultivation, not only could he learn spells, but the difficulty of advancing from the eighth grade to the seventh grade had also been greatly reduced.</p><p>The number of people who posed a threat to Baiyu Town would become countable on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Conversely.</p><p>In the Great Landscape, it was the same.</p><p>Now his self-defense ability was becoming more and more sufficient.</p><p>Especially the spells and various methods of the cultivation world, if brought to the Great Landscape world and used, that would be a definite dimensional strike!</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p>Although it was the case.</p><p>But Yu Xiaoqing still would not be too aggressive.</p><p>After all, for him, time was abundant.</p><p>He didn't have to worry about the passage of time at all, and didn't need to pursue efficiency excessively in anything.</p><p>Moreover, from the activation of the double-penetration gate until now, even if the time consumed in the two worlds was added together, it was only about eight months in total!</p><p>Three and a half months in the Great Landscape.</p><p>Four and a half months in the main world.</p><p>This efficiency was already very high!</p><p></p><p>As for in Wei Biao's eyes, his junior brother was even more of a genius, going from a complete novice to cultivating the eighth-grade blood qi and the qi-cultivating realm in just over four months. He should be a little more low-key!</p><p>Yu Xiaoqing then asked Wei Biao to keep his qi-cultivation success a secret.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao also agreed with this, he believed that Yu Xiaoqing's talent was far superior to the traitor Gao Han, and even better than Mr. Li. The future of the Martial Arts Hall might depend on his care, and it was necessary to hide such a genius for a while.</p><p></p><p>After the success of qi-cultivation, Yu Xiaoqing rested for a few days, first consolidating his cultivation. During this process, he also asked Wei Biao for some basic techniques in the use of spiritual power, including the activation and use of spell talismans, so that his cultivation could be better manifested.</p><p></p><p>The next goal was to break through to the seventh grade of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation environment of the martial dao in the Great Landscape was better than in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Yu Xiaoqing had stubbornly endured the relatively harsh conditions in order to focus on qi-cultivation, and had not returned to the Great Landscape world for nearly two months!</p><p>Now, with the breakthrough, he could safely return to life in the Great Landscape!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yu Xiaoqing entered the stone hall, passed through the double-penetration gate, and once again descended into the Great Landscape.</p><p></p><p>Although he had cultivated in the main world for almost two months, the time that had passed in the Great Landscape was only a single night since his last departure!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>March 12th.</p><p></p><p>This was an auspicious day.</p><p></p><p>18 Qinglong Lane, Baohua Street, Xiguan, Ram City.</p><p></p><p>Firecrackers were set off, gongs and drums were beaten - what a lively scene!</p><p></p><p>Many passersby and citizens gathered at the entrance of the lane to watch.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like some big shot is moving into a new home."</p><p></p><p>"18 Qinglong Lane, isn't this Mr. Sun's mansion?!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Mr. Sun once held the position of Provincial Administration Commissioner and was given the title of Vice Minister of Personnel. He was a high-ranking official of the second grade in the Great Jing Dynasty. It's said his descendants gradually moved to the capital to develop their careers, so they sold the mansion to Mr. Yu Xiao from Mei County."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu?"</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiao from Mei County? I do have some impression. His father was a wealthy overseas merchant who once single-handedly killed over 200 bandits in Mei County, causing quite a sensation at the time!"</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Could there really be such an extraordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>"Over 200 bandits? That's too exaggerated!"</p><p></p><p>"It's him! He's Ram City's newest Yellow Wine King!"</p><p></p><p>"This gentleman founded Xianfu Spirit Wine, brewed using century-old medicinal methods. Recently he also acquired Guangfu Old Wine, bringing this nearly bankrupt old winery back on track. He's a young and promising industrialist."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, now I know!"</p><p></p><p>"I've seen advertisements in the newspapers recently!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>People chatted back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The identity of the mansion's new owner was quickly revealed.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the magnificent house before them with envy.</p><p></p><p>This was a typical Xiguan mansion, with a total floor area of 480 square meters. It might be smaller compared to some large landlords' mansions in the countryside, but those were in remote rural areas with inconvenient transportation.</p><p></p><p>But where was this place? The most prosperous Xiguan area of the provincial capital! And Baohua Street was the prime location in Xiguan.</p><p></p><p>This place was no more than 800 meters from Shangxiajiu Road, the busiest area in the whole city.</p><p></p><p>18 Qinglong Lane was located at the very end of the alley, not only in a safer location, but also in a quieter environment. It was a feng shui treasure spot that was tranquil amidst the hustle and bustle! Now look at the house.</p><p></p><p>It was truly magnificent! There was a pair of imposing stone lions on either side of the main gate.</p><p></p><p>The facade of the main building was simple and elegant, with harmonious colors. The green-tiled sloping roof, water-polished blue brick walls, and granite stone corners all embodied the ancient and elegant beauty of Lingnan architecture.</p><p></p><p>The mansion faced south with its back to the north, in an elongated rectangular shape.</p><p></p><p>It had at least three sections, with small alleys on both sides.</p><p></p><p>The central section consisted of an official hall, sedan chair hall, courtyard, main hall, inner hall, and inner rooms. The side sections mainly contained areas such as study rooms and guest rooms. The various halls and rooms were reasonably divided, not interfering with each other, and very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>To celebrate the hanging of the plaque for the Yu mansion,</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian led the servants to distribute small gifts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing there were such benefits, people immediately crowded around to offer auspicious words. The atmosphere became very lively.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sat in the study.</p><p></p><p>The new home was not as large as the one in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>But its convenience was certainly far superior to the country mansion.</p><p></p><p>The busiest commercial street was nearby, with goods from all over the world and all kinds of services.</p><p></p><p>The Yu mansion itself was equipped with advanced facilities. Not only was it connected to electricity with all kinds of lighting fixtures, but it also had a landline telephone and a private telegraph machine installed, which were extremely rare even among wealthy families in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>You get what you pay for.</p><p></p><p>This luxurious mansion was not cheap.</p><p></p><p>It cost a total of 78,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Just the spare change could buy a large house in Mei County, plus a thousand acres of good farmland! Such an enormous sum that ordinary people wouldn't dare to imagine, Yu Xiao spent without batting an eye. He was also planning to buy No. 15, 16, and 17 Qinglong Lane at a price 20% higher than the market value.</p><p></p><p>Although these mansions were of slightly inferior quality,</p><p></p><p>They would still cost at least 140,000 to 150,000 yuan in total.</p><p></p><p>Money talks. In less than three weeks since coming to the provincial capital, Yu Xiao had already spent hundreds of thousands of silver yuan. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say he was spending money like water, and these expenditures were clearly all worth it.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at his current information.</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao</p><p></p><p>Age: 23 years old</p><p></p><p>Actual age: 24 years old</p><p></p><p>Prestige: 1388/2000 (Famous in the region)</p><p></p><p>Luck growth: 3 points per year</p><p></p><p>Current luck: 80</p><p></p><p>———</p><p></p><p>Now advertisements for Yu Xiao were all over the major newspapers in the provincial capital, along with a series of soft promotional articles, quickly gaining Yu Xiao fame in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Because of this,</p><p></p><p>His prestige increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The celestial mansion's spirit wine hadn't even been released yet, but it was already on fire.</p><p></p><p>The old wine from Guangzhou was directly revitalized and given a second spring.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yu Xiao not only bought a mansion, gained quite a few reputation points, but also successively acquired a large amount of spiritual medicinal materials!</p><p></p><p>He opened a purple sandalwood medicine box.</p><p></p><p>Forty-six silver medicine cases appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Each medicine case contained an old medicinal herb over 200 years old.</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual energy environment in Da Jing was thin, once the age of the herbs exceeded 200-300 years, the spiritual energy they contained was not to be underestimated. Even if taken to Baiyun Workshop, they would be considered top-quality spiritual herbs! Yu Xiao estimated.</p><p></p><p>A 200-300 year old wild ginseng from Da Jing.</p><p></p><p>Was at least equivalent to a 30-year-old spirit-replenishing herb in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Spirit-replenishing herbs were the main ingredient for spirit grass pills and spirit-replenishing pills, typical basic cultivation materials for the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>Most spirit-replenishing herbs had a natural lifespan of only 7-8 years, 1 spirit stone could buy 10 plants, less than one in ten could break through to 30 years, and the value could directly skyrocket to 3-4 spirit stones per plant.</p><p></p><p>In other words.</p><p></p><p>This box of medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>Was worth at least 150 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the actual value was far more than that.</p><p></p><p>200-300 years was just the lower limit for acquisition.</p><p></p><p>Among them, three of the highest quality had reached over 500 years.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao discovered that 500 years was a watershed for Da Jing's medicinal materials. The accumulation of spiritual energy in wild ginseng over 500 years old had reached a certain level, resulting in a qualitative change induced by quantitative change.</p><p></p><p>If we say.</p><p></p><p>Before this they were spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Then after this they became true spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>The former was mainly used to assist cultivation and restore magical power, while the latter could be used to enhance cultivation and break through realms, so it was not surprising that their value was eight to ten times higher than the former.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in Da Jing was too thin.</p><p></p><p>500 years was still a bit short.</p><p></p><p>If he could acquire spiritual ginseng over 700 years old.</p><p></p><p>Then Yu Xiao was confident he could break through to the second level of Qi Condensation in a short time!</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't bought spiritual medicines of this quality yet, Yu Xiao was very satisfied with his current gains.</p><p></p><p>After all.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't been in the provincial capital for long.</p><p></p><p>He believed that in the hands of various large herbal shops and collectors, there must be truly precious medicines, not to mention 700-800 years or even over a thousand years, and as long as they existed, they could definitely be bought!</p><p></p><p>Da Jing's resources were richer than imagined! It even allowed Yu Xiao to cultivate by spending money without needing to return to the cultivation world! Of course, directly consuming the raw materials would cause waste and might have side effects. It would be best to refine them into pills like spirit grass pills.</p><p></p><p>What troubled him was.</p><p></p><p>While cultivation resources were becoming more and more abundant.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't take them all back to the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Because according to Yu Xiao's experience, the spiritual energy required to transport items was very likely related to the item's grade and spiritual power. If he were to move a whole box of medicinal materials to the cultivation world, who knows how much fortune it would consume.</p><p></p><p>Moreover.</p><p></p><p>This box was just the beginning! In the future, the resources in his hands would only become more and more!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao pondered to himself: "It seems very necessary to learn this pill refining skill!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That evening.</p><p></p><p>The housewarming ceremony was officially over.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off several neighbors who came to congratulate him.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was about to continue perfecting and advancing his personal cultivation plan and provincial capital development plan when he suddenly sensed something: there was a change in the ancient palace! More precisely.</p><p></p><p>It was the stone tablet that had changed.</p><p></p><p>The stone tablet had the function of recording information.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there was a change in Yu Xiao's information, such as increases or decreases in fortune or reputation, its contents would change, and he could immediately understand the situation through sensing.</p><p></p><p>This time was different.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that his personal information had changed.</p><p></p><p>It was the side recording task information that had changed.</p><p></p><p>This situation had never occurred in the past year or more.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao hurriedly checked the relevant information and saw three lines of simple and ancient text appear on the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The first two lines were:</p><p></p><p>[World Task: Please cultivate to the Heaven-Human Realm!]</p><p></p><p>[Fortune Task: Please gain as much reputation as possible!]</p><p></p><p>These were two tasks that had been present since the opening of the dual-crossing gate. Now, below these two lines of text appeared new text.</p><p></p><p>[Merit Task: Eliminate drug addiction and evil cultivators!]</p><p></p><p>Only now did Yu Xiao realize that the tasks on this stone tablet could actually be updated?!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

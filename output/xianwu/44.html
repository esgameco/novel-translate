        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's true that blood monkey bats are gregarious demonic beasts. </p><p></p><p>But normally there are only 30-40 in a colony.</p><p></p><p>Yet now there were at least over 100 appearing before their eyes! Wei Biao said: "Don't panic, these mangy beasts may be numerous but they're not strong. We just need to retreat into the cave and use the terrain to our advantage. With our strength, we can definitely eliminate them!"</p><p></p><p>That made sense! Before the others could respond,</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao suddenly activated his Green Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>With one strike, he directly severed Lu Song's right leg.</p><p></p><p>Lu Song was caught off guard. Blood gushed out like a fountain as he screamed in agony.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun cried out in shock: "Uncle Song!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you guys have fun on your own. This young master won't be joining you!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao activated a lightness talisman and quickly fled into the cave, then used an earth wall talisman to seal off the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Success!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao's face showed a smug expression.</p><p></p><p>His current spiritual energy was down to only 30%.</p><p></p><p>If he had stayed to fight, even using the terrain to his advantage would have been quite risky.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of person am I, Jiang Hao? I'm destined to join an immortal sect in the future. How could I live and die together with a bunch of rogue cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>There was another reason.</p><p></p><p>That was wanting to hog all the opportunities for himself!</p><p></p><p>He had considered taking action against Wei Biao or Yu Xiao, but martial artists have quick reflexes, and Yu Xiao had detection techniques, so success wasn't guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Song was different. </p><p></p><p>Not only was he close by, but he was also off guard. A sneak attack would be 100% successful.</p><p></p><p>Now Lu Song was seriously injured and immobilized. The other three were encumbered by him and unable to retreat in time. And the blood monkey bats, stimulated by the scent of blood, would become even more crazed and ferocious.</p><p></p><p>None of the four would survive!</p><p></p><p>They certainly wouldn't sit idly waiting for death.</p><p></p><p>In their desperate final counterattack, they would likely eliminate a considerable number of blood monkey bats, which would actually be doing Jiang Hao's work for him! Jiang Hao was confident in his own abilities. He just needed to recover all his spiritual energy, buy a few golden light talismans for protection, and with the power of his Green Light Sword, he would be able to slay all the remaining blood monkey bats.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the blood essence stones, spirit grasses, spirit medicines, including the belongings of the four people,</p><p></p><p>Would all belong to him alone.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be wonderful?</p><p></p><p>The consequences? </p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao wasn't worried at all! Lu Song and Lu Lingyun were outsider rogue cultivators who had just arrived in Baiyun District and had no foundation here.</p><p></p><p>As for Wei Biao and Yu Xiao? If Li Yan were still around, he might have some reservations and wouldn't dare to do something so extreme. But now Li Yan was gone, so what did those two amount to!</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>No matter how he thought about it,</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have all benefits and no drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>This was the choice that maximized his interests!</p><p></p><p>He felt no guilt at all. The cultivation world was just that cruel.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation was about taking from the weak to supplement the strong, using thousands as fuel to help one person attain the Dao! Which great cultivator didn't have countless bones piled beneath their feet?!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao was wholeheartedly pursuing the Dao! He wanted to climb higher! Being decisive in killing was necessary.</p><p></p><p>He successfully escaped from the cave but didn't go far.</p><p></p><p>Although the four were almost certainly doomed, you can never be too careful, so he decided to wait a while.</p><p></p><p>If you're going to do it,</p><p></p><p>Do it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Can't leave any hidden dangers!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the karst cave.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao used his blood energy to seal several of Lu Song's vital acupoints.</p><p></p><p>However, the injury was too severe and he had lost too much blood. The outlook was grim.</p><p></p><p>Stimulated by the scent of blood, the blood monkey bats fully awakened and went berserk. Dozens or hundreds of giant bats emitted piercing shrieks.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about me!"</p><p></p><p>"You all need to leave quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Song said to the other three, his face pale.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Lingyun's expression was resolute. "Fellow Daoists Wei and Yu, I implore you to lend me your strength!"</p><p></p><p>The swarm of bats was about to engulf them.</p><p></p><p>The situation was extremely critical at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao asked: "Junior brother, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already decisively put down the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"Buy me a few breaths of time."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao hesitated no longer.</p><p></p><p>He threw a fierce punch, sending a blood monkey bat flying.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun gratefully said: "Thank you both, fellow Daoists. If we can make it out alive, Lingyun will never forget this kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao opened the wooden box, took out the machine gun, attached the magazine, pulled the bolt, and got ready to fire. The whole process</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It would take at least ten seconds.</p><p></p><p>Too troublesome!</p><p></p><p>If there was a real emergency or dangerous situation, the consequences would be unthinkable!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao silently made up his mind!</p><p></p><p>After returning this time, he must save money to buy a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>With a storage bag, there would be no need to carry a gun around everywhere, and it could be retrieved and used at the fastest speed when needed.</p><p></p><p>The blood monkey bats came fiercely. While Yu Xiao was still loading the magazine, several blood monkey bats had already attacked, launching assaults on the four people from various directions.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" </p><p></p><p>Wei Biao knocked away several of them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Song repelled one with a fire bullet technique.</p><p></p><p>The other stragglers continued to pounce fiercely.</p><p></p><p>They launched successive attacks on the four people with their venomous claws and fangs.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao could only protect Yu Xiao but had no time to take care of the others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Lingyun suddenly made a hand seal. The jade bracelet on her left hand emitted a beam of green light, rippling out like a layer of water, actually enveloping all four people within it.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang! The sharp claws of several blood monkey bats struck the green light, but without exception, they were all repelled by a force, unable to break through this barrier in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Refining third level?"</p><p></p><p>"A defensive magical artifact?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao and Yu Xiao were both shocked.</p><p></p><p>The magical power Lu Lingyun was channeling now had definitely reached the level of Qi Refining third level. It turned out this woman had been hiding her cultivation all along.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>She also had a magical artifact! And it was a defensive magical artifact! Although the origin of the artifact was unknown.</p><p></p><p>But its quality and value were likely higher than the Green Radiance Sword.</p><p></p><p>This woman was indeed extraordinary! She was definitely not an ordinary rogue cultivator! Wei Biao was overjoyed: "Hahaha, what a treasure. With this artifact, we'll definitely be able to fight our way out!"</p><p></p><p>The joy didn't last for two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Several semi-transparent energy bullets came flying.</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang! These energy bullets were quite powerful, all hitting the artifact's defense, causing the green light to violently ripple.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>She quickly locked onto the direction of the attack.</p><p></p><p>A giant bat unlike the others appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It stood about 1.8 meters tall, its body more humanoid in shape. The most distinctive feature was its face, which had a pale bone structure that looked like it was wearing a ferocious mask at first glance.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Ghost-Faced Bat Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun recognized the monster beast and was terrified! This was a blood monkey bat that had mutated after over a hundred years. Its strength far surpassed that of blood monkey bats, and it could even use some basic magic techniques.</p><p></p><p>The strength of this kind of monster beast was at least equivalent to Qi Refining fourth level. Although Qi Refining fourth level and third level only differed by one level, it was the difference between early-stage and mid-stage Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>This was why.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun was so terrified.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred blood monkey bats were already extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Now an even more ferocious and terrifying bat demon had appeared.</p><p></p><p>This situation! It was almost certain death!</p><p></p><p>The Ghost-Faced Bat Demon came with an imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>It gathered another energy bullet and bombarded the defense.</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun's face turned pale, and the green light defense grew increasingly dim.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>"It can't hold much longer!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Lingyun was only sixteen years old in reality. She had no actual combat experience and was not skilled in killing techniques. Faced with the current situation, she fell into despair for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Would she really die here?</p><p></p><p>She hadn't even joined the Qinglan Valley yet!</p><p></p><p>She also hadn't avenged her mother yet! But in the face of an absolute power difference, no matter how unwilling she was, it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was already prepared, and through a few seconds of observation, he discovered that Lu Lingyun's artifact defense was one-way, in other words, they could launch attacks outward at this moment.</p><p></p><p>That's good! The Ghost-Faced Bat Demon had already approached.</p><p></p><p>It was about to completely tear apart the defense.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, look here, I've got a big treasure for you!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't fire immediately.</p><p></p><p>He first took out a hand grenade.</p><p></p><p>He pulled the pin, delayed for a few seconds, and threw it towards the Ghost-Faced Bat Demon.</p><p></p><p>Probably because there was no magical power fluctuation, the Ghost-Faced Bat Demon lacked sufficient vigilance, and even worse, it grabbed the hand grenade.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Along with the explosion and flames.</p><p></p><p>A deafening roar echoed throughout the cave!</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>(PS: It's a new week, please continue reading, vote, and recommend. There's just over a week left in the new book period, and it hasn't entered the overall rankings yet. I hope we can make a push.)</p>

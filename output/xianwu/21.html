        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao returned to the main world.</p><p></p><p>This was the top landlord of Mei County, the local tyrant of Xiaohe Town.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he was still a lowly ant in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have a decent and clean house!</p><p></p><p>No matter, he needed some adversity to awaken himself, lest he be corrupted by the abundant material wealth, and to always maintain a clear mind and a drive to progress.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time.</p><p></p><p>A total of five months in the two worlds.</p><p></p><p>Three months in the Great Landscape, two months in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Formal martial arts training for less than four months, he had already reached the eighth rank of the Great Landscape, a speed that could be considered extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew his martial arts talent was average, relying entirely on integrating the resources of the two worlds, plus sufficient medicinal and dietary supplements, to cultivate to this level.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts advancement.</p><p></p><p>It will only get harder.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to break through to the seventh rank.</p><p></p><p>The time required will be much more than the previous stages.</p><p></p><p>He decided to change his approach: cultivate both martial arts and immortal cultivation! If martial arts could first enter the seventh rank, it would be equivalent to reaching the early perfection of the Blood Realm in martial arts cultivation, in which case reaching the first layer of Qi Refinement would be without any suspense or bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>This is the way of martial arts into the Dao! But the fire power for Blood Refinement is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>However, it can greatly reduce the difficulty of cultivating the Azure Wood Technique.</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Wood Technique is successfully cultivated first, it can also promote the progress of martial arts, greatly accelerating the speed of entering the seventh rank from the eighth rank.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts and immortal cultivation are not mutually exclusive.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts training consumes physical strength and blood energy.</p><p>Immortal cultivation requires the consumption of spiritual energy and essence.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators, the biggest problem is the lack of time.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao has unlimited time.</p><p></p><p>He can practice martial arts in the Great Landscape world.</p><p>Then cultivate the Azure Wood Technique in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>He first went to the White Cloud Pavilion market to purchase a medicinal pill called "Spirit Grass Pill".</p><p></p><p>This is a basic medicinal pill refined from various spirit grasses, and taking one before cultivation can provide extra spiritual energy, thereby increasing the efficiency of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the third layer of Qi Refinement, the Spirit Grass Pill has a significant effect.</p><p>It can also greatly increase the success rate of Qi Refinement!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao visited several shops and contacted a few scattered cultivator alchemists, but ultimately chose the largest medicinal shop in the pavilion, where the price was a bit higher, but at least the quality was guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>The shop assistant introduced: "Spirit Grass Pill, one spirit stone for two pieces, no bargaining."</p><p></p><p>"Can I exchange with other items?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this shop only accepts spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao looked regretful: "Then I'll take ten pieces, the quality must be good!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the medicinal pills sold in our shop are all from qualified alchemists, not like those scattered cultivators on the outside."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Spent 5 spirit stones!</p><p>Remaining spirit stones: 18 pieces! The spirit stone expenditure was heartbreaking.</p><p>But it was an indispensable consumption in the cultivation process.</p><p></p><p>In the next twenty days, ten days in the Great Landscape, ten days in the main world.</p><p>In the Great Landscape, he would frantically practice martial arts and consume physical strength, while also overseeing the establishment of the Baomin Team and the selection and training of its members.</p><p>In the main world, he would sit in meditation and cultivation, consuming one Spirit Grass Pill per day, which could also help him rest and recover from the intense martial arts cultivation, and he would also spare some time to mine for more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>If there are any doubts or difficulties? No problem! Find the senior brother!</p><p></p><p>After these days of interaction, Yu Xiao found that the seemingly rough-looking senior brother was actually a very helpful and warm-hearted person.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao himself had the cultivation of the second layer of Qi Refinement.</p><p>His guidance would be sufficient!</p><p></p><p>In a flash, twenty days passed.</p><p>He gradually accumulated 20 spirit stones.</p><p>His blood energy was much more abundant than before.</p><p>But there was still a long way to go to break through to the seventh rank.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Azure Wood Technique had made some progress, although he had not yet refined the spiritual power within his dantian, he could feel a faint gathering of spiritual energy in his dantian.</p><p>He had just touched the threshold! Only the threshold!</p><p></p><p>When the dantian is filled with spiritual energy,</p><p>The gathering of spiritual energy will be completed, and he can then begin to refine the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao estimated that at the current efficiency, the gathering of spiritual energy would take at least a month, and the successful refinement of spiritual power would be even more distant.</p><p></p><p>It is said that top-tier cultivation geniuses can reach this stage in just a few hours, and some monstrous talents can even innately sense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, instantly completing the gathering and even refining spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But for himself.</p><p>It took two months to comprehend the Azure Wood Technique.</p><p>Then it would take another month to complete the gathering of spiritual energy.</p><p>It would be difficult to enter the first layer of Qi Refinement in less than half a year.</p><p></p><p>And this is under the condition of consuming a large amount of Spirit Grass Pills, and with the guidance of others. Other ordinary scattered cultivators, how could they have so many spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>The immortal path is difficult! Difficult as ascending to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>For those with average talents,</p><p>Every step is full of a thousand difficulties and ten thousand obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Life is limited, but the immortal path is endless.</p><p></p><p>To measure eternity in a fleeting moment - this is a path destined to have no end, and no conclusion!Yu Xiao couldn't help but feel fortunate, even though his natural talents were mediocre, he had the mysterious stone palace and an almost infinite lifespan, so it didn't matter if he went a little slower! He prepared to buy another 20 spirit grass pills.</p><p></p><p>Current remaining spirit stones: 10!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was ready to go back and continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, he received a mobilization notice from the boxing hall.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what was going on, he still came to the boxing hall immediately. There, he saw five inner court disciples, five guard masters, and thirty-six outer court disciples - all of them were present in the boxing hall.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "Tonight is a critical moment for Elder Li's breakthrough, so we've gathered to collectively protect him."</p><p></p><p>He said to the others, "From now on, this matter must be kept highly confidential, and no one is allowed to leave my sight!"</p><p></p><p>What? Elder Li is about to break through? This is quite sudden!</p><p></p><p>The location of Li Yan's closed-door cultivation, his cultivation progress, and the timing of his breakthrough were all strictly confidential.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Spring Thunder Boxing Hall in Bai Yun Fang was not without rivals, and Elder Li himself also had many enemies. If the news was released in advance, it would be difficult to ensure that the process would not be interfered with.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the evening.</p><p></p><p>The group secretly went to a nearby Scattered Cultivation Grotto.</p><p></p><p>Such grottos outside Bai Yun Fang were numerous, serving as the residences of scattered cultivators. Some were even imbued with spirit gathering formations, not only convenient for cultivation, but also quiet and hidden.</p><p></p><p>"From now until tomorrow morning!"</p><p>"No one is allowed to leave!"</p><p>"As long as Elder Li succeeds in his breakthrough, the benefits won't be lacking for everyone!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Wei Biao began to command the disciples. The outer court disciples were divided into twelve small groups of three, scattered in the nearby woods to stand guard and patrol, also supervising each other. They couldn't even leave each other's sight to urinate.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any traitors from escaping to leak the news.</p><p></p><p>The inner court disciples and guard masters guarded the entrance of the grotto.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had never seen such an elaborate arrangement before, and couldn't help but ask, "Elder Brother Wei, is it really necessary to be this tense? This place seems so hidden, I don't think anyone would come to disturb us."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "Younger Brother Yu, you don't know this, but the others don't need to worry - it's the Jian Dao Sect that we must be on guard against!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had heard of the grudge between the Spring Thunder Boxing Hall and the Jian Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Jian Dao Sect leader was missing a hand.</p><p></p><p>Supposedly, that hand was cut off by Elder Li.</p><p></p><p>When Elder Li participated in the Ascension Assembly in the past, he almost passed through smoothly, but at the last moment, he was ambushed, not only causing his attempt to fail, but also resulting in severe internal injuries, missing the best opportunity to join a sect and walk the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>The one who ambushed him.</p><p></p><p>Was the Jian Dao Sect leader, Jin Peng.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were roughly at the same level of cultivation, maintaining a delicate balance. But if one of them were to break through, the other would certainly not sit idle, so the Jian Dao Sect would most likely make a move.</p><p></p><p>I just want to cultivate in peace.</p><p></p><p>How did I get caught up in this kind of thing? But thinking about how Elder Li has always treated him well, Yu Xiao quietly took out two shotguns and hid them on his person. These would be enough to deal with cultivators at the Qi Refining stage. Even if someone as powerful as Elder Li let his guard down, they would only be able to die with regret on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, if the situation turned bad, he could always hide in the stone palace space, where no one could threaten him.</p><p></p><p>"Younger Brother!"</p><p>"Don't be nervous!"</p><p>"Your elder brothers are here!"</p><p>"You won't come to any harm!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Da Shan and Peng Tie Sheng patted Yu Xiao's shoulders, comforting him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Several hours later.</p><p></p><p>The sky had completely darkened.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the people could clearly feel a scorching aura rising from the direction of the grotto.</p><p></p><p>Martial artist's blood qi?!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's expression showed surprise.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi was so majestic that it could be externally manifested.</p><p></p><p>Was this the aura of a quasi-Sect Master level expert?!</p><p></p><p>"Elder Li has begun his breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of several disciples were filled with fanaticism and delight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there were several cries and shrieks in the woods.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The thing he feared the most had happened.</p><p></p><p>"The Jian Dao Sect!"</p><p>"It's the Jian Dao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>A fierce-looking, disheveled one-armed burly man, accompanied by more than a dozen subordinates, forcefully barged into the woods. The outer court disciples dared not resist, all showing fear on their faces, retreating to the front of the grotto.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

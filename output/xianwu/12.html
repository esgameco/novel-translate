        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Another ten days have passed.</p><p></p><p>After the Yiguan was successfully inaugurated, the Puji Hall was also opened as scheduled. This has steadily increased Yuexiao's reputation in the surrounding villages and counties. His reputation value has now surpassed 120, making him a well-respected gentry. Even the county magistrate would now show him some courtesy.</p><p></p><p>These days, Yuexiao has not been idle. He has first completed the planting of rice and spiritual tea. Additionally, he has procured nearly a hundred long and short firearms, as well as tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, enough to arm a militia and provide sufficient self-defense capabilities in this small piece of land.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the majority of Yuexiao's time and energy has been devoted to his cultivation practice. With the theoretical guidance and assistance of several martial arts masters, Yuexiao's cultivation progress has accelerated noticeably, and the vitality in his body has become increasingly robust.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Yuexiao practiced the Spring Thunder Fist three times in a row, only then feeling physically exhausted. He immediately took off his clothes and lay down.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu has been making remarkable progress recently!" </p><p></p><p>A pair of slender, white hands began to massage his body. The warm qi circulated through the acupoints, quickly relieving the soreness in his muscles and dissipating his fatigue, providing an exquisite experience.</p><p></p><p>The one massaging Yuexiao was Bai Yajie, the youngest and weakest among the eight martial arts masters. However, she possessed a unique blood qi massage technique that greatly enhanced the efficiency of Yuexiao's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After an hour, Bai Yajie was drenched in sweat, while Yuexiao felt refreshed and rejuvenated. He then instructed the maid Xiao Mei to prepare a sumptuous dinner, including beef, venison, shark's fin, bird's nest, bear's paw, and a pot of lingzhi and tiger bone soup.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie followed behind, salivating at the thought of such a lavish feast. She couldn't help but envy Yuexiao's youthful vigor, wealth, and generosity, wishing she could become his woman, even without any formal status, as it would be far better than the chaotic life on the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Elder Xu Qingfeng, the second weakest among the eight masters, arrived with joy, informing Yuexiao that the medicinal soup he had been brewing had been successfully concocted. Xu Qingfeng's medical expertise and knowledge of cultivating qi and blood tonics were invaluable in supporting Yuexiao's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the pharmacy.</p><p></p><p>The scent of Chinese medicine wafted through the air.</p><p></p><p>A bowl of dark, murky medicinal liquid appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingfeng confidently said, "This is the Shiquanbuqi Decoction, a great tonic for replenishing qi and blood. As long as you persist in taking it, it can strengthen your qi and blood, not only fortifying your body, but also enhancing the refinement of a martial artist's blood qi. There are no side effects whatsoever."</p><p></p><p>Is it really that effective? Yu Xiao had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>However, considering that the medicinal ingredients were all personally procured by Xu Qingfeng, and they were indeed all tonics, it couldn't possibly be harmful to the body. So he presented the first bowl of the medicine to Master Bai.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because he was worried about the medicine being problematic.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shiquanbuqi Decoction from Mount Longhu was renowned.</p><p></p><p>The problem was, this medicinal decoction was extremely precious, with a single bowl costing over a hundred silver taels, nearly two months' worth of his income as an impoverished martial arts teacher. Could a pauper like him really partake of such a precious elixir?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said, "No need, these past few days Master Bai has expended a lot of qi and blood from the massage therapy. Consider this bowl of Shiquanbuqi Decoction as a form of compensation for you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie didn't stand on ceremony and downed the bowl in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal effect is so potent! I feel my entire body's blood qi surging, as if I have endless strength!"</p><p></p><p>Master Bai had just consumed a lot of his blood qi from the massage therapy, but after downing this single bowl, he was immediately full of vitality. This demonstrated just how powerful the effects of the Shiquanbuqi Decoction were!</p><p></p><p>Xu the Taoist truly had some tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao began to purchase large quantities of the ingredients for the Shiquanbuqi Decoction.</p><p></p><p>He would drink a bowl every seven days, to invigorate his blood qi and accelerate his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Why every seven days? Of course, it wasn't because Yu Xiao lacked the funds, but because with his current cultivation, a bowl every seven days was already the limit. If he weren't in his early twenties with a robust constitution, even half a bowl would leave him depleted and unable to recover! Yu Xiao had plenty of patience and time.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to worry about efficiency, and certainly couldn't force his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Shiquanbuqi Decoction could quickly nourish the body and increase blood qi, allowing a martial artist's cultivation to increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>Master Bai's secret massage techniques could also unblock the meridians, relieve muscle fatigue, and rapidly restore physical strength, greatly increasing the intensity of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Combining the two approaches.</p><p></p><p>The effects were multiplied.</p><p></p><p>Adding in the Chuntian Thunder Breathing Method as well.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts cultivation technique, while not well-known in the Main World, had been refined over thousands of years, with immortal cultivators who had dedicated their lives to the martial dao making improvements. So it was certainly no inferior to any top-tier cultivation method in the Great Landscape World.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>The land of the Divine Continent had been researching martial arts for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Nearly every generation had produced martial dao masters, which could be considered a long and illustrious tradition, leaving behind many essences and national quintessences.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of teachers like Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, and a few others, Yu Xiao was provided with a lot of fundamental theoretical skills, which were obviously things he couldn't learn in the Main World, but were equally helpful for his martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>Two months later.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's blood qi was overflowing, circulating endlessly within him, having penetrated all his meridians. His physical strength, endurance, qi, and overall bodily constitution had all surpassed the critical limits that ordinary people could achieve through mere training.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded!" </p><p></p><p>He was naturally overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew his natural talents were mediocre, but by relying on the cultivation methods of the Main World, as well as the cultivation resources of the Great Landscape World, from learning the Chuntian Fist technique to cultivating his martial artist's blood qi and connecting it throughout his body, it had only taken him two and a half months.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>He had become an Entering the Realm martial artist in the Great Landscape World.</p><p></p><p>In the Main World, he had entered the initial stage of the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most terrifying thing was that Yu Xiao had basically been in the Great Landscape World for these two and a half months, while only a little over a day had passed in the Main World.</p><p></p><p>If Li Ye and Elder Brother Wei Biao were to find out that someone had learned the Chuntian Fist and entered the Blood Refining Realm in just one day, what would they think?</p><p></p><p>A genius?</p><p></p><p>Of course not.</p><p></p><p>Even geniuses have to follow logic!</p><p></p><p>In this situation, they would probably think he was some kind of monstrous freak!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Winter had already arrived in Dajing.</p><p></p><p>Although winters in Guangyue Province weren't cold, there was still a noticeable chill in the air.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sat in a large chair in the courtyard, watching over a dozen men and women practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Among them were Yu Xiao's adopted son and personal disciple "Yu Daniu", as well as Tang Yang's daughter "Tang Yue", along with seven or eight martial arts talents selected from the school.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the four main maids of the Yu household, and even Yu Ruqian had joined in.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao taught without discrimination - whether adopted children, bodyguards, or servants and maids, all could learn the Spring Thunder Fist.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he only taught a few basic forms, while the most essential fighting techniques still required selecting people with the right aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it was enough for strengthening the body and improving health.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, besides Yu Daniu, only a few masters had mastered the complete 36 forms.</p><p></p><p>This martial art wasn't necessarily suitable for everyone, but it was undoubtedly an authentic grandmaster-level practice. Using it just to refine one's vital energy was extremely effective.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Master Bai Yajie had successfully broken through, advancing from sixth rank to fifth rank.</p><p></p><p>For these martial artists to become high-level experts in Dajing, their innate talent and potential must be considerable, at least not much inferior to Wei Biao. Wang Zhong, Tang Yang, and Bai Yajie may even surpass Wei Biao.</p><p></p><p>The group had been with Yu Xiao for some time now.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had gained a sufficient understanding of their character and personality.</p><p></p><p>Now by teaching them the Spring Thunder Fist techniques, he also hoped to cultivate them further, so they could help him accomplish more in the future.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, "Worthy nephew!" Yu Qinghai personally came to visit.</p><p></p><p>He had recovered from the grief of his father Yu Guotai's passing. Now as both the Yu family patriarch and leader of the militia, he was very busy every day. Upon arriving before Yu Xiao, he immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He continued: "Your latest order of weapons has arrived safely. It was personally escorted by Chief Escort Lei of the Wanhai Escort Agency!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanhai Escort Agency was one of the top escort agencies in Jiaying Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>An escort agency may sound similar to a courier company, but in these chaotic times with bandits everywhere, those who could still escort goods and deliver cargo across the country were undoubtedly highly skilled experts!</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the top escort agencies in various regions were also top-tier jianghu organizations.</p><p></p><p>The chief escort of Wanhai Escort Agency was named Lei Wanhai.</p><p></p><p>His strength was among the best in Jiaying Prefecture. It was said that in his youth he had reached the third rank. Due to injuries and aging, his vital energy had declined significantly, but even so he still had at least fourth rank abilities.</p><p></p><p>In terms of reputation and personal strength, looking at the entire Jiaying Prefecture, he could be ranked in the top five jianghu leaders!</p><p></p><p>Over the past few months, Yu Xiao had been continuously purchasing weapons from the provincial capital and Macau. The channels he used were various gangs in Meixian and Jiaying Prefecture, so he naturally connected with the Wanhai Escort Agency.</p><p></p><p>The Wanhai Escort Agency had extensive connections, many channels, and a good reputation.</p><p></p><p>In Jiaying Prefecture, only they had the ability to transport the smuggled weapons Yu Xiao bought from those foreign devils in Macau to Xiaohe Town.</p><p></p><p>The Wanhai Escort Agency seemed to have good strength and credibility.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had thoughts of recruiting or even investing in them.</p><p></p><p>And he was very generous in his dealings.</p><p></p><p>For the Wanhai Escort Agency, he was also an extremely rare big client.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, both parties cooperated very happily. This shipment was personally escorted by Chief Escort Lei, which also provided an opportunity to formally establish a relationship with this martial arts leader famous throughout Jiaying Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A quarter hour later.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of Tang Yang and Wang Zhong, Yu Xiao arrived at the militia's shooting range in Xiaohe Town. He saw box after box of weapons being unloaded - some filled with ammunition, some containing firearms, totaling fifty boxes.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu!" A stern-looking elderly man with piercing eyes, a prominent chin and tiger-like whiskers stepped forward and cupped his fists in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Beside him was a sword-carrying young man. Though his skin was rough from long exposure to wind and sun, he still had an imposing appearance. However, there were several sword scars on his face, showing he had been through many battles.</p><p></p><p>"I am Lei Wanhai, and this is my son Lei Changfeng!"</p><p></p><p>"Changfeng pays his respects to Mr. Yu. I've long admired your great reputation!"</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao nodded, "Thank you all for your hard work!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai said, "The cargo has been delivered in full, and all seals are intact. Please verify!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao gave Yu Qinghai a look, "Open them!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai led people to open all the boxes. Thirty-five boxes of ammunition were laid out before their eyes, and the other fifteen boxes contained various types of weapons, each one brand new and gleaming.</p><p></p><p>At a glance.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of handguns and rifles.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of explosives, landmines, and grenades.</p><p></p><p>Among them were even five light machine guns and two mortars!</p><p></p><p>This batch of weapons was purchased directly from the foreigners in Macau through Xu Xiao's connections.</p><p></p><p>These guys would sell anything for money, and every item was high-end foreign goods, all the most advanced equipment of this era.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao picked up a light machine gun.</p><p></p><p>In this era, firearms were generally semi-automatic, with not very fierce firepower.</p><p></p><p>This Madsen light machine gun was the most advanced in the world and also the first mass-produced machine gun. It was extremely rare in the Great Jing country, and almost no one had seen such a weapon.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Money talks.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao purchased the first batch of five at the hefty price of 500 yuan each, with plans to continue purchasing more in the future.</p><p></p><p>500 yuan each was a price that definitely exceeded people's understanding. It's worth noting that at this time, a domestically produced handgun only cost two or three yuan, and even came with some free ammunition.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter! Money was the least of Xu Xiao's concerns!</p><p></p><p>This Madsen light machine gun had a theoretical firing rate of 450 to 500 rounds per minute. The suppressive fire from one gun would not be inferior to ten or twenty Mauser pistols firing simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao said, "I want to test the gun!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai quickly replied, "The shooting range is ready!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao carried two machine guns to the shooting range. After loading two full magazines, he raised the guns, aimed at a row of wooden targets in front, and pulled the triggers.</p><p></p><p>Ratatatatat! Ratatatatat! Flames spewed from both gun muzzles simultaneously, instantly spraying countless bullets like a fierce storm sweeping across. Under the terrifying firepower, the wooden targets were shattered to pieces in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lei Wanhai and Lei Changfeng, father and son, widened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't have imagined, even in their dreams, that the weapons they were transporting had such terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang and Wang Zhong also stared wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>This firepower.</p><p></p><p>This power.</p><p></p><p>It exceeded their understanding of foreign guns!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they felt a strong sense of defeat.</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that Western weapons had developed to this extent! With such weapons, was there still any meaning in learning hidden weapons? In the face of such weapons, was there still any point in practicing iron cloth techniques?</p><p></p><p>In front of weapons like these, was there still any meaning in practicing martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the legendary masters couldn't withstand such firepower! How many masters were there in the whole world?</p><p></p><p>And once these weapons were mass-produced, even untrained soldiers could use them on the battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao hadn't thought that far.</p><p></p><p>The light machine gun had strong recoil, and ordinary people couldn't control it barehanded. It needed to be fixed with a support for stable shooting. But for Xu Xiao, a seventh-rank martial artist, handling two at once was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>The greatest feeling was exhilaration! If he had had such weapons when he encountered Jin Peng, would he have needed to look for an opportunity to strike? Probably in just one face-to-face encounter, he could have turned him into a sieve or a hornet's nest!</p><p></p><p>This is what you call a gun!</p><p></p><p>Against this kind of firepower, those below the middle stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>They would have almost no chance to struggle and would be instantly killed!</p><p></p><p>Even against a cultivator at the middle stage of Qi Refining, if they were only at the fourth or fifth layer of Qi Refining, once directly covered by this firepower, it would be a situation of nine deaths and one life!</p><p></p><p>In other words! With such weapons in hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao could basically walk sideways in Baiyun Fang.</p><p></p><p>If he carried such weapons and went hunting with Senior Brother Wei, wouldn't it be a one-sided sweep?</p><p></p><p>Mere blood bat monkeys?</p><p></p><p>Just first layer Qi Refining trivial beasts.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, fear comes from insufficient firepower.</p><p></p><p>And now Xu Xiao couldn't wait to participate in this hunt!</p><p></p><p>This time, not only would he help his senior brother, but he would also take the opportunity to break through to the sixth rank of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

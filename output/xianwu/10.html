            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Residence of the Yu Family.</p><p></p><p>Finished the Thirty-Six Martial Arts Forms.</p><p></p><p>Although every muscle felt fatigued, it was no longer as exhausted and depleted as before.</p><p></p><p>These days.</p><p></p><p>Many things have been handled.</p><p></p><p>Yet the martial arts training has not been neglected.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao felt that with diligent practice and the supplementation of rich foods, his body had become increasingly sturdy, with a faint sense of martial qi emerging, though it was still too weak. </p><p></p><p>If he didn't practice for two days, it would dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Far from reaching the level of circulating through all the meridians.</p><p></p><p>"The master is so formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"The master has worked hard!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp and melodious voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Four maidservants, with refined and beautiful appearances and well-dressed, came forward. One brought a stool, one massaged his shoulders, one offered tea, and one wiped the sweat with a towel.</p><p></p><p>"Is my current life too decadent? This is truly an evil feudal society!"</p><p></p><p>Recently, Yu Xiao had hired thirty-five healthy laborers through the labor market and various channels, and had also adopted fifty-two children, mostly boys, planning to cultivate them from a young age.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of these generous actions over the past few days,</p><p></p><p>It has attracted the attention of some gangster forces.</p><p></p><p>These four maids were top-quality professional servants specially sent from the provincial capital by a matchmaker.</p><p></p><p>Each of them was carefully selected and trained, exclusively for wealthy families. Not only could they read and write, but they also had outstanding appearances. Of course, the price was also extremely high, each costing 300 taels.</p><p></p><p>After being purchased,</p><p></p><p>They became part of the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao named them Mei, Zhu, Lan, and Ju.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, the four would be the household maids, mainly responsible for taking care of the master's daily life.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was not a moral saint. Although he had abolished feudal rituals like kneeling, he did not have to advocate the idea of universal equality.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is still a world of the survival of the fittest, and the West still has many plantations using black slaves.</p><p></p><p>The four maids had been educated and trained since childhood to serve the master.</p><p></p><p>Outside, it was a time of chaos and hardship.</p><p></p><p>Being a maid, although of a lower status, at least ensured food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yu Xiao was not a moral degenerate either, and would not force the servants to do things they were unwilling to do, or ruthlessly exploit them like cattle and horses.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the four maids,</p><p></p><p>There were now thirty-five laborers.</p><p></p><p>The laundry, sweeping, and other miscellaneous tasks of the Yu Residence did not require so many people.</p><p></p><p>Most of these laborers were assigned to reclaim land and cultivate spiritual rice and spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>He had brought a batch of spiritual rice and tea seeds from the main world, which, while not too large in quantity, were enough for about a hundred acres, and had consumed 4 points of Fate, twice the value of tens of thousands of taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>The Fate points remaining were 94.</p><p></p><p>He had no plans to bring more for now.</p><p></p><p>All these seeds were used for self-cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Hiring dozens of laborers was to take care of the crops.</p><p></p><p>In the future, based on this, he would cultivate second-generation rice varieties and hand them over to the villagers to plant.</p><p></p><p>Although the quality might be slightly inferior compared to the first generation, even if it was diluted for five or eight generations, it would still be ten times better than ordinary rice, and would certainly have great competitiveness in this great dynasty.</p><p></p><p>If he could brew spiritual rice wine with the spiritual rice,</p><p></p><p>He would easily dominate the domestic and foreign markets.</p><p></p><p>He reckoned that with this as a foundation, it would not be difficult to gain the titles of "Huang Jiu King" and "Tea King".</p><p></p><p>Not only could he further gain prestige, but he could also obtain more social status, and then enter more industries, which fit his persona as an industrialist, and could also increase his standing in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao-ge!"</p><p></p><p>A young man with thick glasses and a bookish appearance ran over.</p><p></p><p>The four maids retreated a few steps in a well-coordinated manner.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian panted: "Xiao-ge, why are you still at home? Today is the opening day of the Yu Family's Martial Arts Academy!"</p><p></p><p>"What's the rush? I'm just about to get going!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao felt his strength had recovered, changed out of his training clothes into formal attire, and rode in a sedan chair to leave.</p><p></p><p>The small town of Xiaohe had only one main street, with dozens of shops on both sides, from barbers and laundries to tea houses and restaurants, to weddings and funerals, providing a full range of services, truly a small but complete town.</p><p></p><p>On a street corner, lanterns were hung and firecrackers were constantly popping.</p><p></p><p>There were many onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Fifty-some thin and sallow-faced children, wearing brand new clothes, with a touch of excitement mixed with nervousness on their small faces, were looking around, waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao appeared,</p><p></p><p>The children were like seeing their mainstay.</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive Father!"</p><p>"Adoptive Father has come!"</p><p></p><p>Facing the children, Yu Xiao also smiled and nodded in greeting.</p><p></p><p>This scene undoubtedly aroused the curiosity of the crowd, and they couldn't help but start discussing.</p><p></p><p>"The Yu Family Martial Arts Academy?"</p><p>"What is this all about?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" "This is the place where Mr. Yu specifically takes in impoverished children from the clan and poor orphans from society!"</p><p></p><p>"What? There's such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, look at these children. They were all bought back from the county city and the market!"</p><p></p><p>"Other gentlemen buy servants, who do not use them as cattle and horses? Mr. Yu is different, he not only does not let these children do any work, but has also established a charity school to take them in, teach them to read and practice martial arts, and cultivate them."</p><p></p><p>"That must cost a lot of money, right?" "How can there be such a great philanthropist in this world."</p><p></p><p>"You know nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu is a wealthy overseas merchant, this amount of money is nothing to him!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>From the discussion of these local villagers, it is not difficult to know what Mr. Yu has done.</p><p></p><p>The dozens of children that Mr. Yu brought back from the market, most of them are under the age of ten, naturally not for him to use as servants, but to be cultivated from a young age.</p><p></p><p>For this purpose, he has invested in establishing the "Yu Family Charity School"! This is a charitable organization similar to an orphanage and a hope primary school.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu will adopt a large number of unfortunate orphans, or subsidize the poor children of the Yu family village.</p><p></p><p>The charity school will provide these children with their basic living needs, and also teach them to read and write, or practice martial arts to strengthen their bodies.</p><p></p><p>If they have a good talent for studying, they can be sent to the big cities for further study in the future, and even be sponsored to study abroad to learn advanced knowledge. If they have a good talent for martial arts, they will also be given corresponding resources in the future, striving to make them become martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Even if they are not successful in academics or martial arts, the charity school will also subsidize them to learn a skill.</p><p></p><p>In the future, they can also help the Yu family with affairs and have sufficient survival skills.</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu's establishment of the charity school may have private interests, but such a charitable organization in this era is absolutely a great deed of immense merit. After the news spread, he naturally gained considerable reputation.</p><p></p><p>A horse-drawn carriage appeared. </p><p></p><p>The township head of Small River Township has arrived.</p><p></p><p>He is the one commonly known as the township chief.</p><p></p><p>The Great Landscape does not have the administrative division of the "township" level, so Small River Township can actually be called Small River County.</p><p></p><p>Generally, more than a hundred households can be a li, more than ten li can be a county, and the li chief and county chief are officials responsible for grassroots governance and tax supervision.</p><p></p><p>The inauguration of the Yu Family Charity School is a big event in the township.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the township chief (county chief) must come in person to grace the occasion.</p><p></p><p>County Chief Ma said with flattery, "Congratulations, Mr. Yu, for creating this charitable cause, you are really young and capable!"</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>The reputation is still rising.</p><p></p><p>The current reputation value has already approached 90 points.</p><p></p><p>This is close to the 100-point milestone.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>He might as well add some more fuel to the fire.</p><p></p><p>"County Chief, you have overpraised me. This time I returned home, I just wanted to do some practical things, both to develop the industry and to help the people. Opening this charity school is just the first step."</p><p></p><p>County Chief Ma couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Yu, what are your plans next?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's better to strike while the iron is hot. Today, I'll just go ahead and announce this matter!"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu cupped his hands to the people present: "This charity school is a place to adopt orphans, and I also plan to invest 3,000 taels of silver to establish the Universal Benevolence Hall to provide for all the lonely and destitute elderly in the ten counties and eight townships of Mei County!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the whole audience was stunned!</p><p></p><p>The charity school for adopting orphans was an original idea.</p><p></p><p>But the Universal Benevolence Hall is a well-known public welfare institution in the Great Landscape.</p><p></p><p>They have been established in various places, especially in the capital region, but relatively fewer in the south.</p><p></p><p>The Universal Benevolence Hall, as a民间救济性 (民-people, 救济-relief, 性-nature) public welfare organization, is basically self-funded by local gentry, mainly to provide basic food and medical services for the lonely and destitute elderly over the age of sixty.</p><p></p><p>Each Universal Benevolence Hall is limited to a thousand people, and if the quota is full, the applicants will be signed and placed in a bamboo tube, and when there is a vacancy due to death or voluntary departure, a draw will be made to fill the vacancy.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>"3,000 taels of silver?!"</p><p>"That's real gold and silver!"</p><p>"Mr. Yu is truly a great philanthropist!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The people were all shocked by Mr. Yu's generosity.</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>The reputation value continued to rise.</p><p>96...97...98...99...100!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu was overjoyed in his heart, finally achieving his goal of reaching 100 points!

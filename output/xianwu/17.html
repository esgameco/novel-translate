        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>What Yuexiao needs to consider is.</p><p></p><p>How to deal with the bandits in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying shouted fiercely, "I'm sworn brothers with the famous Guo Shanhu, if you dare to kill me, he will never let you off the hook, you will all have to pay with your lives!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong angrily said, "Such a big mouth, do you think we are all trash?!"</p><p></p><p>Tao Yang: "People like you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>The other six masters also showed angry expressions, they were hired at least three times the market price, and they were not just private tutors, but also Yuexiao's personal bodyguards! This bastard!</p><p></p><p>How dare he threaten the young master? It's simply slapping their faces!</p><p></p><p>These days, they have been eating and drinking well, living a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>If they can't even stop this scum, where else can they find such a good job in the future!</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying felt the murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to slap himself twice.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>The boss is only a sixth-rank.</p><p></p><p>This kid has two fourth-rank experts by his side!</p><p></p><p>He must be out of his mind to come and kick this iron plate!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this is instigated by Liu Changui, I can help the young master deal with this bastard!"</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao examined Zheng Laoying, this man was over forty years old, his right palm was pierced by a willow leaf dart, and he was also injured internally by Wang Zhong's iron shirt, so his current strength should not be strong.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to live?"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please spare me, I'll do anything for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then fight with me, and if you can win, I'll give you a chance to live!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie hurriedly persuaded, "Young master, your identity is precious, why bother fighting with this desperate criminal?"</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao: "It's fine, I've been practicing martial arts for two months, but I've never had a real battle, so I'll use him to practice today."</p><p></p><p>The masters looked up to him with respect.</p><p></p><p>Without tempering.</p><p></p><p>Without fighting.</p><p></p><p>One can never become a true martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The young master's determination to learn martial arts is not a passing fancy, he sincerely wants to become a martial artist, and for a rich young master like him to have such will and resolve is undoubtedly admirable.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao is not stupid either.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying is injured, and even with seventh-rank cultivation, he cannot fully display his strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the eight masters are all present, with two fourth-rank and four fifth-rank, the risk is completely under control.</p><p></p><p>And this Zheng Laoying, even if he is not a top expert, is a ruthless desperate criminal with rich combat experience, he is a good target for practice.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao knows well that staying in the comfort zone for too long.</p><p></p><p>Is not conducive to one's mentality and growth.</p><p></p><p>It will only make one numb and dull.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, no matter in the great world or in the immortal cultivation world, occasional tempering is necessary, of course, the premise is that the risk is controllable.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There is another reason</p><p></p><p>That is, this evil bandit's reputation is not small.</p><p></p><p>If he can personally kill him in public today.</p><p></p><p>Then, let people spread the inside story and news, not only can it increase his personal prestige, but it can also effectively gain him a reputation.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"I will not go back on my word, masters, release him."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying regained his freedom, and couldn't help but sneer inwardly, he was really too lucky to encounter such a stupid fool.</p><p></p><p>Practicing for only two months.</p><p></p><p>Dare to challenge him? What a big joke!</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying is absolutely confident that he can crush him.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't believe that Yuexiao will keep his promise, so he is preparing to capture him as a hostage, as long as this kid's life is in his hands, no matter how many experts are present, they will be afraid to act against him.</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll show my humble skills!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying's blood boiled, his eyes suddenly burst with a fierce light, his left hand formed into an eagle claw, and he directly attacked the face.</p><p></p><p>Facing the fierce claw wind, Yuexiao immediately sidestepped to avoid it, and then struck Zheng Laoying's right arm with a backhand punch, instantly pushing him back several steps, with a stunned and disbelieving expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>This speed, this strength... at least eighth-rank! Practicing for two months?</p><p></p><p>Bullshit! I've been practicing for twenty years.</p><p></p><p>Now I'm only at seventh-rank cultivation.</p><p></p><p>How can this kid reach eighth-rank in just two months! Although the idea is a bit tricky, but at the moment, he can't care about that much.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying roared, quickly rushing in close, the second claw, the third claw, the fourth claw... each attack was aimed at the face, throat, and groin, or attempted to lock his shoulders and arms.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ru Qian and the others revealed looks of horror.</p><p></p><p>Several maids were so frightened that they covered their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Zheng Laoying was indeed a notorious outlaw, who had just been in a severely injured state, but at this moment he was as fierce as a fierce tiger or wolf, and under such a fierce offensive, ordinary people would have died many times over.</p><p></p><p>The several masters all revealed tense expressions.</p><p></p><p>Although Zheng Laoying was injured, his ten years of eagle claw kung fu was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>He had rich combat experience, with cunning and ruthless attacks, which looked quite dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang's hands in his sleeve gripped the willow leaf darts, and if Yu Shao was suppressed or in danger, he would decisively strike and kill this outlaw! "Your kung fu is nothing!"</p><p></p><p>When Zheng Laoying heard this sentence from Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>His face quickly flushed red, already angry and ashamed! A young man who had just grown up, living in luxury, dared to mock him?</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying exerted all his strength, his left hand again forming an eagle claw, sweeping towards Yu Xiao's chest, and from the fierce gust of this attack, it was clear that he had used his full force!</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying's left hand was as hard as iron! Not to mention flesh and blood, even if it was made of cement, it could scratch out several deep marks.</p><p></p><p>If Yu Xiao was hit in the chest, even if he didn't lose his life, he would be seriously injured and lose his combat power, and it would be impossible for him to recover in a short time! "Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The several masters saw the danger.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang's willow leaf darts were also poised to strike.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an unexpected thing happened, Yu Xiao not only did not dodge this fierce attack, but instead stood firm and issued a sharp shout, then directly attacked Zheng Laoying with a fist!</p><p></p><p>The blood qi force throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Was almost drained in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao threw this punch.</p><p></p><p>It exploded the air with a thunderous sound! Zheng Laoying had roamed the rivers and lakes for many years, and although he had not seen the various kung fu styles in the south and north, he had at least heard of them, but he had never encountered such a fierce and violent fist technique.</p><p></p><p>The sound of bones breaking resounded! Yu Xiao's fist came after, hitting Zheng Laoying's chest like a heavy hammer, instantly causing his chest to cave in, breaking half of his ribs, and he was blown back ten meters and crashed into the wall, spitting out a mouthful of blood, his face full of shocked despair.</p><p></p><p>"This is... what kind of fist technique..."</p><p></p><p>Not only Zheng Laoying.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong, Tang Yang and the others were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had also never seen the Spring Thunder Fist technique before! Although they knew earlier that this was a top-notch fist technique, they didn't expect the explosive power to be so terrifying! With one punch from Yu Xiao, not only were six or seven ribs crushed, but the heart and lungs also suffered serious injuries, and there was basically no chance of survival with such injuries! A few seconds later.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying died!</p><p></p><p>He stared wide-eyed and did not close his eyes in death!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't believe he died at the hands of a pampered and refined young master!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's blood qi gradually calmed down, and when faced with Zheng Laoying's corpse, this was the first time he had killed in his two lifetimes, and he had thought he would feel a little disgusted.</p><p></p><p>But it's fine.</p><p></p><p>There was not much discomfort.</p><p></p><p>He had also seen blood! Yu Xiao's tone was calm: "Ru Qian!"</p><p></p><p>Ru Qian had a look of reverence on his face, "Xiao... Xiao Ge, please give your orders!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "You go back yourself and tell Uncle and the old clan leader what happened here, they should know what to do next!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>It was not yet dawn.</p><p></p><p>More than 200 young and strong men from the Yu family village came in a fierce manner.</p><p></p><p>These villagers all had angry expressions, a few holding torches, knives, pitchforks, and homemade guns, but more had imported high-end foreign long spears and short guns.</p><p></p><p>The firepower was so fierce!</p><p></p><p>The patrol police station didn't dare to interfere. "What... what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Such a scene.</p><p></p><p>Had never been seen before!</p><p></p><p>Ma Xiang was so scared that he wanted to run away.</p><p></p><p>He thought it was bandits or rebels attacking.</p><p></p><p>When he fully understood the situation and came to the scene.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the Liu mansion was already in ruins, and the big landlord Liu Changui and his son Liu Fuyuan, as well as many adult members of the Liu family, had been beaten up by the angry villagers of the Yu family village, and were hanged to death at the gate in front of many people.</p><p></p><p>The local tyrant of the small river town did not have a small force.</p><p></p><p>He had been bullying and abusing for so many years, and he must have never dreamed that he would end up like this.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The news that Liu the old master colluded with bandits and was killed spread throughout the town.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's bare-handed killing of Zheng Laoying, the second-in-command of Shihutai, was also known to all.</p><p></p><p>The armed force secretly organized by the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Was first revealed to the people, shocking them.</p><p></p><p>After this upheaval, there were no more three big landlords in the small river town, and the Yu family would become the sole overlord!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate's office.</p><p></p><p>The temple fair had been raided.</p><p></p><p>This left Magistrate Ye both shocked and furious. </p><p></p><p>Stone Tiger Stronghold had been wreaking havoc for years, doing nothing but robbing merchant caravans and plundering homes. He never imagined they would be so brazen this time, causing such a commotion in broad daylight!</p><p></p><p>"Your Honor!" </p><p></p><p>The deputy magistrate Gao Zhi hurried over. "Most of the hostages taken by Stone Tiger Stronghold are young children from various villages."</p><p></p><p>"It seems they must have a scheme in mind!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing said gravely: "First we need to figure out Stone Tiger Stronghold's purpose!"</p><p></p><p>Children are easy to control and low risk. Coming from different villages, using them as hostages could bind many clans, inevitably achieving the maximum pressure effect.</p><p></p><p>Enough to make the authorities hesitate to take action! The hostages are certainly safe for now. Barring the unexpected, Stone Tiger Stronghold will soon make demands. If their demands can't be met, these heartless criminals will start killing people one by one to increase pressure.</p><p></p><p>The authorities would lose all credibility.</p><p></p><p>It could even trigger a popular uprising.</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi: "Guo Shanhu's main target is the young master of the Yu family."</p><p></p><p>Magistrate Ye was taken aback: "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi took out a handwritten letter: "This is a letter left by Guo Shanhu of Stone Tiger Stronghold. It has already spread to all the villages. Please take a look, Your Honor."</p><p></p><p>It was a threatening extortion letter.</p><p></p><p>The contents were as follows:</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>To Yu Xiaojun:</p><p></p><p>I have long heard of your esteemed name.</p><p></p><p>I am writing this letter regarding a certain matter.</p><p></p><p>I am Guo Shanhu of Stone Tiger Stronghold. Though I lead a band of outlaws in the mountains, I still know loyalty and righteousness. However, I grieve to hear that you, young master, committed violence against my brother Zheng Laoying, and now intend to gather a militia to exterminate us. This is truly an unrighteous act that pains me deeply.</p><p></p><p>To seek justice, I have joined with other mountain strongholds in a righteous cause, and taken 50 innocent children as hostages. </p><p></p><p>They are currently unharmed, but their safety now rests entirely on your decision! Our demands are as follows:</p><p></p><p>First: Disband the militia as a show of sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Second: Prepare 50,000 silver taels to compensate Stone Tiger Stronghold for our losses.</p><p></p><p>If these are completed within five days, the hostages will be safe and sound, and returned to their villages.</p><p></p><p>If young master Yu harbors false hope, and attempts to delay or resist, then the hostages' lives cannot be guaranteed. When blood flows like a river then, you will be the true murderer! Though I am a mountain bandit, I know the way of benevolence and righteousness, and do not wish for innocents to be harmed.</p><p></p><p>I hope young master Yu will consider carefully, and prioritize the lives of the innocent rather than acting rashly and losing the greater for the lesser! Though 50,000 silver taels is a large sum, I imagine it would not be difficult to raise with your family's wealth. How can you ignore human lives which are as weighty as heaven? If young master Yu understands the bigger picture, our grudge will be wiped clean. From then on we will never trouble your household again, nor harm the local villagers in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>I give my word.</p><p></p><p>I will absolutely not go back on it!</p><p></p><p>Signed, </p><p>Guo Shanhu</p><p></p><p>Written on the 15th day of the 9th month in the 78th year of Emperor Qian of the Great Jing Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>"Too outrageous!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing's face turned ashen.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had killed Zheng Laoying, the second-in-command of Stone Tiger Stronghold. Given Guo Shanhu's personality, he would definitely seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was surrounded by skilled fighters.</p><p></p><p>And he had been staying in Xiaohe Town for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Even if the bandits wanted revenge, they had no opportunity.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Magistrate Ye was not worried. But he never imagined that Guo Shanhu would pull such an underhanded move! Taking advantage of villagers bringing their children to the temple fair, he led his men to suddenly raid the fair and kidnap dozens of children as hostages, using this to threaten Yu Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Since returning to Mei County, all of Yu Xiao's actions had been righteous deeds, accumulating a very good reputation and prestige.</p><p></p><p>But if he ignored the bandits' threats,</p><p></p><p>Resulting in dozens of hostages dying unjustly,</p><p></p><p>Then no matter who the real culprit was, it would be difficult for the villagers not to blame Yu Xiao, ultimately causing his reputation to plummet, or even possibly incurring resentment and dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>But if Yu Xiao met Stone Tiger Stronghold's demands, he would have to disband the militia and pay a huge ransom.</p><p></p><p>Would that solve the problem? Not to mention, this Guo Shanhu was already a two-faced, despicable person. Even if</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu truly fulfilling his promise, and Yu Xiao compromising with the bandits, would greatly diminish his prestige! Whether he responds or not, whether he compromises or not, it would be difficult to conclude this matter! It's too vicious.</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi sighed: "We also bear responsibility for this situation escalating like this. Guo Shanhu's gang alone actually wouldn't have been enough to raid the temple fair."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "Indeed, if we hadn't let Yu Xiao create a militia under the pretext of suppressing bandits, which made nearby mountain bandits feel threatened, Guo Shanhu probably couldn't have pulled off something this big."</p><p></p><p>Although the Stone Tiger Gang was the largest bandit group near Mei County, they only had about 100 members in total. But this temple fair robbery involved at least 200-300 bandits.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Guo Shanhu's description in the letter, this villain has likely united all the nearby bandit forces! Just to avenge the second-in-command Zheng Laoying, it would be difficult to gather so many people at once. Only when the bandits face a common threat would they unite like this.</p><p></p><p>And that threat is the Xiaohe Town Militia!</p><p></p><p>Once this militia is successfully established, even if they can't completely eliminate the bandits, having such an armed force protecting the area would make it much harder for bandits to raid villages in the future!</p><p></p><p>It would cut off their source of income and livelihood! How could these desperate outlaws tolerate that? In the end, they conspired to commit this shocking major crime!</p><p></p><p>Magistrate Ye: "We can't just sit and wait for doom. I'll write to the prefect requesting troops for reinforcement!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid there's not enough time!" Gao Zhi said with a bitter smile. "You know better than I do about the efficiency of the Great Jing Dynasty government. And with hundreds of mountain bandits gathered in the forests, how easy would it be to eliminate them? Who would be willing to take on such a thankless task?"</p><p></p><p>To eliminate several hundred bandits of the Stone Tiger Gang, at least three to five times as many elite troops would be needed!</p><p></p><p>The Great Jing Dynasty is not only corrupt in its court politics, but most of the military are also just a bunch of good-for-nothings. For this kind of thankless bandit suppression mission with no profit, probably no commander would be willing to make an effort.</p><p></p><p>They can't even eliminate a bunch of bandits! They can only let them prey on the common people at will!</p><p></p><p>The incompetence of the Jing court is evident!</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tiger Gang is so cunning and vicious, and they've set up such a difficult dilemma. I wonder how Young Master Yu will respond.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had just finished reading the letter from Guo Shanhu, the leader of the Stone Tiger Gang.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that Guo Shanhu's ability to become a bandit leader and terrorize several counties including Mei County for years proves he does have some brains.</p><p></p><p>He can't not avenge Zheng Laoying.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be hard to command respect in the future.</p><p></p><p>But if Guo Shanhu actively sought out Yu Xiao, or tried to find a chance to ambush and kill him, he wouldn't even get close.</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao spent huge sums to buy large quantities of advanced foreign guns and cannons, and recruited the most capable militiamen from all around to form the militia, it made these bandits feel even more afraid.</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu's move.</p><p></p><p>It can't directly threaten Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But it can put pressure on and strike at Yu Xiao's prestige, possibly derailing the militia, thereby nipping this threat in the bud.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this situation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao just sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned to start dealing with the Stone Tiger Gang after successfully cultivating and returning to the Great Jing Dynasty this time, on one hand to eliminate a potential threat to himself, and on the other hand to take the opportunity to further build up his reputation.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Tiger Gang gathering many bandits.</p><p></p><p>Making a big fuss all at once.</p><p></p><p>This not only gives Yu Xiao a better excuse to take action, but can further expand Yu Xiao's fame.</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu is indeed a clever person.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Yu Xiao cares about his reputation, so he took so many hostages as a threat.</p><p></p><p>But this is meaningless in Yu Xiao's view. On one hand, although Yu Xiao needs reputation, he won't be held hostage by this. On the other hand, Yu Xiao is now a cultivator, and his methods are beyond what these bandits can comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"I have two Lightness Talismans, two Invisibility Talismans, and a vial of Hundred Snakes Powder... These should be enough!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>A mere nest of bandits is nothing to worry about! The bigger the fuss this time, the greater the reputation and benefits will be after successfully suppressing the bandits!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

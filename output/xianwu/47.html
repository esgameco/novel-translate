        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao also began using Blood Essence Pills to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that at his current level of cultivation, under normal circumstances without injuries, it took about 8-10 days to fully digest and absorb one Blood Essence Pill. </p><p></p><p>If he took a pill before entering the Great Realm each time, let the medicinal effects start working, and then cultivated in the Great Realm world, he could enjoy the cultivation environment and services of the Great Realm without consuming destiny.</p><p></p><p>And so.</p><p></p><p>During this period.</p><p></p><p>He went back and forth repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Spending most of his time in the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>And two months passed in the blink of an eye in the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>One day.</p><p></p><p>Under the shocked gazes of martial arts masters Wang Zhong, Tang Yang, Bai Yajie, Xu Qingfeng and others.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao threw a punch at a wooden stake. His blood energy surged, shaking the air and producing a loud boom that could be heard clearly even outside the courtyard walls.</p><p></p><p>Bang! His fist landed heavily on the wooden stake.</p><p></p><p>The entire stake instantly split open, leaving a fist imprint several centimeters deep!</p><p></p><p>"Huff!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao exhaled deeply. The white breath condensed without dispersing, shooting out like an arrow twice as far as before - a sign of greatly increased blood energy!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu stared wide-eyed, nearly pulling out his own beard.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth rank... Young Master Yu is now a sixth rank expert!"</p><p></p><p>Fast! Too fast! The eight masters had arrived in Mei County in mid-June last year.</p><p></p><p>It was now the end of January - only seven and a half months in total.</p><p></p><p>When they first arrived in Mei County, Young Master Yu was still a novice who hadn't even cultivated blood energy. But in just over half a year, he had already reached the sixth rank!</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts of the Great Realm, there was always talk of the upper three ranks, middle three ranks, and lower three ranks.</p><p></p><p>The sixth rank was an important watershed!</p><p></p><p>Within the seventh rank, one was just considered skilled.</p><p></p><p>Above the seventh rank, one qualified to be called an expert.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had now reached the sixth rank of blood energy, entering the middle three ranks and joining the ranks of experts in just over half a year!</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The masters wouldn't have believed such a genius could exist in this world.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, Young Master Yu might reach the first rank within 10 years, and have a chance of becoming a grandmaster within 20 years! This might sound like a long time?</p><p></p><p>But it was actually incredibly fast progress!</p><p></p><p>After all, in blood energy cultivation, the difficulty increased dramatically with each level. And martial arts grandmasters were legendary existences!</p><p></p><p>Young Master Yu was only in his early twenties.</p><p></p><p>In 20 years he would just be in his early forties.</p><p></p><p>At that time he would be in his prime. Don't underestimate the value of a grandmaster in his prime. Throughout history, at most only one or two such figures appeared in each era.</p><p></p><p>Such figures could often dominate the martial arts world for 30-40 years, becoming revered masters who dazzled an entire era. To the vast majority of martial artists, they were legendary existences!</p><p></p><p>To follow such a figure.</p><p></p><p>To witness his rise to prominence.</p><p></p><p>What great fortune that would be!</p><p></p><p>Their names might even be recorded in the annals of history!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was also satisfied with his cultivation progress. Since the last hunting trip, he had been cultivating diligently, using a total of five Blood Essence Pills to achieve this breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but mock himself again.</p><p></p><p>When Senior Brother Wei Biao planned to break through to the late stage of Blood Refining.</p><p></p><p>He had only planned to prepare five Blood Essence Pills at first!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's true martial arts talent was far inferior not only to true prodigies like Yu Daniu, but even to Wei Biao.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was just average.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be said to have no aptitude at all, but he was certainly no uncut jade or raw talent either.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing the admiration on Wang Zhong and Tang Yang's faces, and the worship in Bai Yajie's eyes, he knew these people's misunderstanding of him was getting deeper and deeper.</p><p></p><p>But this wasn't a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>The image Yu Xiao had always crafted for himself was one of extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>This way, when his martial arts reached great heights and shocked the nation in the future, it wouldn't seem incongruous. And it could also effectively increase his prestige.</p><p></p><p>That day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao held a family banquet to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>He raised a cup of spirit wine and toasted the eight masters: "Thank you all for your guidance these many days. Without your painstaking instruction over the past half year, my martial arts could not have improved so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this.</p><p></p><p>He paused, then continued: "However, all good things must come to an end. My training in Mei County may be coming to a close."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned to hear this.</p><p></p><p>What did Young Master Yu mean by this? Did he no longer need the guidance of martial arts masters? If so, that would be normal. After all, with Young Master Yu's current sixth rank cultivation, he was already an expert himself. And with his abundant wealth, hiring one or two upper three ranks experts would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this.</p><p></p><p>The eight martial arts masters all</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feeling deeply disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Such a well-paying job was not easy to find.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, after following Young Master Yu these days, they had been conquered by his personal charm and were willing to follow such a person from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao continued: "I expect to go to the provincial capital after the Spring Festival. In the future, I may spend less time in Mei County, but if you are willing to continue following me, we can draft a new full-time employment contract. Whether you want to follow or not is entirely up to you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone immediately felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie was the first to stand up and offer a toast: "Young Master Yu has treated me well and even helped me break through to the fifth rank. As long as Young Master Yu doesn't drive me away, I absolutely don't want to leave!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong: "I'm also willing to follow Young Master Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang also stood up and raised his glass: "I've lived in the provincial capital for decades and am very familiar with it. Following Young Master Yu, I can be of some help."</p><p></p><p>"I am willing to follow Young Master Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"This old man is willing too!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone offered toasts one after another.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>When these people were invited, thorough background checks had been done.</p><p></p><p>Each person's character and abilities were good.</p><p></p><p>After more than half a year of getting along, they had become familiar with each other, and it would indeed be uncomfortable to replace them all.</p><p></p><p>The eight masters obviously had no intention of leaving either. They were willing to follow Yu Xiao to venture into the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>After all, for more than half a year, Young Master Yu had not mistreated them. Not only did they eat and drink well, but they were also given training. Young masters like Wang Zhong and Bai Yajie had improved their martial arts skills considerably!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, everyone had witnessed Yu Xiao's actions.</p><p></p><p>Even in the provincial capital, full of hidden talents, with his abilities, he would certainly be able to make a name for himself!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao then exchanged new employment contracts with the eight masters. Originally, the eight had joined Yu Xiao's ranks as martial arts instructors for the household, principally to teach Yu Xiao martial arts and incidentally protect the home.</p><p></p><p>From now on, they would become full-time bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>This role required more obligations.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao would not mistreat anyone. Everyone's salary was increased by 20%, and he would increase their training in the future so that they could be of greater use by his side!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That evening!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao returned to Baiyun Fang.</p><p></p><p>He had spent nearly two months in Dajing.</p><p></p><p>Due to several round trips in between, time in the main world had also flowed.</p><p></p><p>However, only two days had passed since the last hunt ended and the pills were refined.</p><p></p><p>Before heading to the provincial capital, Yu Xiao needed to use the main world to practice for a while to consolidate his strength.</p><p></p><p>He set three goals.</p><p></p><p>First, practice the Spring Thunder Fist ten to twenty times every day to consolidate his blood energy.</p><p></p><p>Second, refine the Green Light Sword to be able to wield and control it.</p><p></p><p>Third, work hard on Qi cultivation, striving to approach the second level of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>His senior brother was still in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall had gained a new member, Lü Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>She was a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator and her theoretical knowledge was much stronger than Wei Biao's.</p><p></p><p>So Yu Xiao asked her for guidance on Qi Refinement and techniques for refining the Green Light Sword.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, fifteen days passed.</p><p></p><p>This period of time was very beneficial.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard of the Spring Thunder Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao made a hand seal and shouted lightly: "Rise!"</p><p></p><p>A small green sword flew out from his sleeve, instantly growing several times larger, turning into a green light. However, it failed to hit the wooden stake and directly pierced into the courtyard wall.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!" Lü Lingyun commented, standing to the side.</p><p></p><p>"You have barely mastered this magical weapon, but to make it respond to your will as if it were an extension of your arm, you still need to continue refining it with spiritual power for some time."</p><p></p><p>Cultivators' magical weapons couldn't be used just by picking them up.</p><p></p><p>In most cases, from obtaining an unfamiliar magical weapon to using it skillfully, it required a considerable amount of time for spiritual power refinement and adaptation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had been refining the Green Light Sword for half a month.</p><p></p><p>He could barely activate it.</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun continued: "Moreover, your spiritual power is still too weak. You can only activate the Green Light Sword four or five times at most. You need to reach at least the second level of Qi Refinement to truly unleash its power in actual combat!"</p><p></p><p>Second level of Qi Refinement?</p><p></p><p>Even though his blood energy had broken through, Yu Xiao still felt it was quite challenging.</p><p></p><p>As the two were talking, suddenly a powerful surge of blood energy was released from a certain direction in the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Upon sensing this energy, Yu Xiao's spirits lifted: "Senior brother has broken through!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

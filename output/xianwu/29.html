        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stone Tiger Fortress.</p><p></p><p>Hidden in a densely forested mountain valley. </p><p></p><p>Surrounded by mountains on all sides, with steep slopes and sheer cliffs.</p><p></p><p>There was only one winding narrow path, at its narrowest point just wide enough for a single horse to pass.</p><p></p><p>The fortress gate was built of thick logs, covered in iron spikes. Watchtowers were set up at high vantage points. Numerous traps and hidden sentries were placed nearby, making it very difficult to launch a surprise attack.</p><p></p><p>The mountain stronghold had a year-round spring as a water source, always stocked with one to two months of supplies, and many secret caves and escape tunnels for hiding.</p><p></p><p>The bandits had around a hundred long and short firearms.</p><p></p><p>They also had grenades, landmines, explosives, and homemade cannons.</p><p></p><p>For government troops, forget about wiping out these bandits - even just breaching the fortress would be extremely difficult. So the bandits grew increasingly brazen, having nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>Inside the fortress walls, buildings were scattered about, including a main hall, storehouses, stables, and training grounds. At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Night had fallen. </p><p></p><p>The entire fortress was festively decorated and bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of bandits, mostly gathered around bonfires, were drinking heavily and feasting on meat, thoroughly enjoying themselves.</p><p></p><p>"This was a great haul."</p><p></p><p>"All thanks to the boss's courage and strategy!"</p><p></p><p>"Brothers! Let's all raise a toast to the boss!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of bandits collectively raised their bowls toward the seat of honor. The man there appeared to be in his forties or fifties. Though he had an imposing physique, his features were unremarkable, except for a pair of fierce, tiger-like eyes.</p><p></p><p>This man was none other than </p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu, the leader of Stone Tiger Fortress! In his youth, Guo Shanhu's family had been fairly well-off, allowing him to study and practice martial arts. But after a series of misfortunes, he ultimately became an outlaw. In less than seven years, he had established his base at Stone Tiger Fortress.</p><p></p><p>This clearly showed that</p><p></p><p>This man was not only highly skilled,</p><p></p><p>But also extremely cunning and had the makings of a formidable leader.</p><p></p><p>"Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu raised a large bowl and drained it of alcohol in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"Bravo!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"The boss is a true hero!"</p><p></p><p>"We can't lose face!"</p><p></p><p>"Drink up everyone! I want to see you all drink!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>These bandits had successfully raided a temple fair. Not only had they kidnapped hostages according to plan, they had also brought back large quantities of money, grain and alcohol. As per custom, they were sure to celebrate for a full day and night.</p><p></p><p>"If that Yu Xiao kid really comes up with 50,000 silver dollars, won't we be set for life?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just one lifetime - that's 50,000 silver dollars! We couldn't spend it all in two or three lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>"If we really get the money, I suppose we could let him go."</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>"If he can come up with 50,000, he can definitely come up with more. Such a fat sheep ripe for the slaughter - wouldn't it be a waste not to bleed him dry?"</p><p></p><p>"Well said, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>"Bottoms up!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The bandits all indulged in fantasies of sudden wealth.</p><p></p><p>After all, for them, 50,000 shiny silver dollars was an unimaginable sum!</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu coughed.</p><p></p><p>A bandit beside him quickly said, "Everyone be quiet, quiet down now, listen to what the boss has to say!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu stood up.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the assembled bandits.</p><p></p><p>In a highly inflammatory tone, he said: "Brothers, in the world today, the emperor is incompetent, the court corrupt and useless. We are on the brink of chaotic times. Do you really want to be bandits all your lives, forever living in hiding?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>If not bandits, what else could they be? None of them had clean backgrounds!</p><p></p><p>"As the saying goes!"</p><p></p><p>"The times produce heroes!"</p><p></p><p>"How can the nobility claim a monopoly on power?"</p><p></p><p>"Since chaos is coming to the world, we should take this opportunity to raise money and gather supplies, buy guns and cannons, and bide our time!"</p><p></p><p>"When change comes to the world, we will emerge in full force and turn everything upside down!"</p><p></p><p>"Grand ambitions of conquest may not be out of reach."</p><p></p><p>"At worst, we could become warlords!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu gestured with his hand</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pointing at his subordinates, "At that time, you'll be generals, commanders, and marquises. What won't you have? Women, money, territory - as much as you want!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of bandits immediately blushed.</p><p></p><p>These people weren't very educated, most of them were fugitives who had committed murder or serious crimes. They couldn't return to the civilized world, so they gathered in the mountains and became bandits.</p><p></p><p>The leader's words.</p><p></p><p>Ignited the desires and ambitions in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>The bandits were all boiling with excitement, wishing they could immediately pick up their guns, follow the leader in rebellion, and then create a great enterprise. When the time came, the leader would become emperor, and they could become marquises!</p><p></p><p>"We'll follow the leader to the death!"</p><p></p><p>"Long live the leader! Long, long live!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Just as the bandits were shouting slogans fervently.</p><p></p><p>An unexpected situation occurred.</p><p></p><p>One of the bandits spat out a large mouthful of black blood.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Before those around could react.</p><p></p><p>Another bandit suddenly screamed and fell to the ground, bleeding from all seven orifices.</p><p></p><p>A third, a fourth... This situation spread like a plague throughout the entire camp. In no time, dozens of bandits fell, each with a greenish-black face, bleeding from seven orifices, and dying shortly after.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>He immediately felt his blood qi dispersing, his internal organs burning, his head dizzy, and a foul odor coming from his mouth and nose.</p><p></p><p>Poisoned! Someone had poisoned them!</p><p></p><p>Who did this!</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu first thought of the bandit leaders he had brought in to help, but when he angrily went to find the two, he saw they were already lying on the ground, dead.</p><p></p><p>"It's the wine! Someone poisoned the wine!"</p><p></p><p>When Guo Shanhu saw the bandits in the camp falling one after another from poison, he realized there was a problem with the wine. Could there be a traitor in the camp? Otherwise, how could an outsider possibly poison the wine!</p><p></p><p>The poison was extremely potent.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment.</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu felt dizzy and unsteady. Even with his sixth-rank strength, he couldn't resist. The other bandits were even worse off. By now, at least half of the bandits had died from the poison.</p><p></p><p>A moment ago.</p><p></p><p>It was still bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>Now it was a field of corpses.</p><p></p><p>The entire camp had become a hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu used his blood qi to seal off his major acupoints, then staggered back to his room, rummaging through boxes and cabinets for an antidote. But at that moment, a figure appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>From invisible to visible.</p><p></p><p>Appearing out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Are... are you human or ghost!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu wondered if he was hallucinating from the poison.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao held a revolver in his hand, with the muzzle already pointed at Guo Shanhu, and said in a calm tone, "Let me introduce myself. I'm Yu Xiao from Xiaohe Town."</p><p></p><p>"It's you!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Even in his dreams, he couldn't have imagined Yu Xiao appearing here.</p><p></p><p>"Everything that happened in this camp was your doing!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded, "I didn't expect the Hundred Snake Powder to be so effective. Looks like it will save me a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu still couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Stone Tiger Camp had a treacherous terrain, easy to defend and hard to attack, with multiple traps and hidden sentries. How could this Yu Xiao possibly break in alone? Could he turn into a bird and fly in?</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu spat out a mouthful of black blood.</p><p></p><p>"I can't accept this. Even if I have to die, I, Guo Shanhu, want to die in a fair fight!"</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and said, "I heard you killed my second brother Zheng Laoying with your bare hands. Now I'm deeply poisoned, with less than a tenth of my strength left. If you're really a man, then fight me one-on-one!"</p><p></p><p>Bang! A gunshot rang out! A hole appeared in the center of Guo Shanhu's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao pursed his lips, "I have a gun, why wouldn't I use it? Do you think I'm an idiot?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

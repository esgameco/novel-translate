        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two sides faced off.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Knife Gang had only 15 members.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Thunder Fist School had a clear numerical advantage.</p><p></p><p>Except for the five inner disciples and five guardians,</p><p></p><p>the rest were just outer disciples who paid to learn the art.</p><p></p><p>They had no obligation to fight to the death, so they naturally avoided it.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Golden Knife Gang were all refined blood martial artists, some even had refined qi cultivation, and with Gold Phoenix present, their combat power was clearly higher.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!" </p><p></p><p>Gold Phoenix laughed loudly: "Li Yan, you're actually more resilient than I imagined. Waiting until now to start your closed-door breakthrough, but it's a pity that I'm here, so you'll never succeed."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao angrily said: "You surnamed Gold! Do you have to be so ruthless?!"</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the right to speak?!"</p><p></p><p>Gold Phoenix instantly rose from the ground and rushed over, his momentum like a fierce tiger descending the mountain, ferocious and violent.</p><p></p><p>The battle saber was drawn.</p><p></p><p>A slash came sweeping in!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was already highly alert, and immediately dodged. The blade just grazed his face, sweeping across a moss-covered boulder and slicing it in half like fragile tofu.</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao revealed a look of shock.</p><p>This Golden Sect Master didn't mince words, and was preparing to directly kill Wei Biao. His movement speed was extremely fast, and his saber techniques were fierce and violent. If it were him, he probably couldn't even withstand one round.</p><p>The Golden Sect Master sneered, "Hehe, your reaction is quite fast. Let's see how many blows you can dodge!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was well aware of the gap in strength, and immediately activated two talismans - a smoke talisman and an invisibility talisman.</p><p></p><p>The former instantly created a large area of smoke.</p><p>The latter caused his figure to enter an invisible state.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sect Master lost sight of him and could not pursue for the moment. He coldly snorted, "Petty tricks!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a roar, and his blood qi surged and erupted, turning into a shockwave that dispersed the smoke.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sect Master gave the order.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of gang members launched their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Gao Han, Fang Dashan, Peng Tiesheng, and the guardian masters hurriedly resisted.</p><p></p><p>Although the Fist School had more people, the average combat power was far inferior, making the defense extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao also encountered an opponent during the process, a large man wielding a saber, about a seven-grade blood qi, one of the weaker gang members, but his techniques were wide-open, still putting considerable pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not evade.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, he had already seen blood.</p><p>On the other hand, after a month of training in the Great Scenery, sparring with fourth and fifth-grade experts daily, he had sufficient adaptability. Even against a seven-grade master, he would not be completely powerless.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare opportunity for actual combat!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sect Master activated his perception to lock onto Wei Biao's location.</p><p>The invisibility technique was a low-grade refined qi art, only able to conceal the body, not the aura.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a killing intent came from the side.</p><p></p><p>This kid must be trying to attack using his own weak point.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wei Biao unleashed a full-power punch, exploding the air, the force like thunderous lightning, reaching at an almost imperceptible speed. But to his surprise, a golden glow appeared on Gold Phoenix's body.</p><p></p><p>This punch could crush a millstone.</p><p>Yet the golden light only dimmed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A golden light spell?!</p><p>Wei Biao's expression changed drastically!</p><p>This was one of the most difficult but also most practical spells for refined qi cultivators in the early stage.</p><p></p><p>Gold Phoenix definitely didn't have the ability to instantly cast the golden light spell, so he must have used a talisman to invoke it!</p><p></p><p>Not good!</p><p>There was no time to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sect Master swung a backhand slash.</p><p>The blade radiance bloomed, the tiger roar piercing the air, sweeping Wei Biao away dozens of meters.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's outer garment was shredded, revealing an inner armor made of demonic beast hide, which barely blocked the previous strike. Otherwise, he would have been cleaved in two.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the injury was severe.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao had refined qi at the second layer and fourth-grade blood qi. In the Great Scenery, he was an absolute top-tier expert, even capable of defeating a third-grade master!</p><p>But facing the Golden Sect Master, he was defeated in just two rounds!</p><p>The gap in their strength was truly immense!</p><p></p><p>"You're really lucky, but this kind of luck won't come a second time!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Golden Clan let out a sinister laugh. </p><p></p><p>He was preparing to deliver the final blow and kill Wei Biao.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao instinctively reached for his gun.</p><p></p><p>But this Golden Phoenix was incredibly fast!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Xiao wasn't sure if he could hit him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice rang out, causing everyone's faces to change.</p><p></p><p>"Enough!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was not loud, but everyone heard it clearly.</p><p></p><p>A tall, thin figure emerged from the cave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, the members of the Golden Knife Clan retreated in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was also very surprised. Who else could this be but Li Yan himself?</p><p></p><p>Compared to his usual sickly appearance, Li Yan now looked vibrant and full of vigor, as if he was about to erupt like a volcano.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't supposed to be in seclusion? Seclusion training at a critical juncture. </p><p></p><p>If one is interrupted during the breakthrough, the consequences could be severe, leaving hidden injuries at best, and even endangering one's life at worst.</p><p></p><p>But now he has appeared. There could only be one reason for this!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Phoenix's face darkened as he angrily said, "You're fucking with me?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!" </p><p></p><p>Li Yan's figure flashed, becoming a blur, and his fist struck with the force of thunder. </p><p></p><p>The Golden Light Curse was shattered.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Golden Phoenix was sent flying, crashing into a tree trunk thick as a man's waist, shattering it. Although he was not seriously injured, he was now visibly shocked. "You...you've already taken the Blood Marrow Elixir!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Marrow Elixir, worth hundreds of spirit stones, could greatly enhance one's blood qi and bring the body to its prime condition! The leader of the Golden Clan knew that Li Yan had opened the martial arts hall for years just to save up spirit stones to buy this critical breakthrough item. But he never expected Li Yan to use it prematurely.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan calmly said, "I've been planning and preparing for many years. The Blood Marrow Elixir is just one of the methods I'm using to break through. But what I'm still missing is an even more important thing."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Your life!"</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Li Yan had released the news of his breakthrough as bait. His real target tonight was to kill the Golden Clan leader, so that not only would he avenge his grievances, but he could also use the sharpness of slaying his enemy to enhance his mental state and increase his chances of breaking through to the next realm. </p><p></p><p>The Blood Marrow Elixir was just an auxiliary medicine, while the Golden Clan leader was the main ingredient for his breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, so you're using me as a whetstone for your breakthrough?" The Golden Phoenix said in a deep voice. "But with just one Blood Marrow Elixir, you won't find it so easy to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's expression was calm as he said, "I've dedicated myself to the Dao all these years, and life and death no longer concern me. But you have been living in fear and cowardice, and your blade may no longer be as sharp as it once was."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's see!"</p><p></p><p>The battle was about to erupt. The others couldn't interfere at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan moved like a ghost, each punch thundering with immense force that could easily shatter stone and gold.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Clan leader fought like a ferocious tiger, each slash savage and accompanied by roars, the blade winds extending for dozens of feet and whipping up fallen leaves, seeming unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>During the fight, they also used magical talismans and spells, dazzling Yu Xiao and deeply impressing him.</p><p></p><p>After some twenty or thirty exchanges, the Golden Clan leader fell into a disadvantage, directly coughing up blood and beginning to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could see that the two were indeed evenly matched. However, Li Yan had recovered his peak condition through the Blood Marrow Elixir, while the Golden Phoenix had lost an arm's worth of combat power, greatly affecting him.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's willpower, fighting spirit, and killing intent were clearly stronger. He had staked everything, having the momentum of an unstoppable force, while the Golden Phoenix was afraid of death and lacked the resolve of a do-or-die battle.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the outcome was decided.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan said, "Golden Phoenix, you've lost!"</p><p></p><p>The heavily injured Golden Clan leader fell to the ground, but a sinister smile appeared on his face. "Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan had no intention of wasting words, and was about to deliver the final blow, when suddenly his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>What was happening?</p><p></p><p>He felt a sudden, intense pain coursing through his meridians. His internal organs were burning and searing, as if they had been filled with strong acid.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha haha haha!" The Golden Phoenix let out a wild, exhilarated laughter. "How does the Rotting Bone Powder feel?"</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please vote!)</p>

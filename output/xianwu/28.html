        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Several town mayors and local gentry came to visit at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The bandits had taken advantage of the temple fair to deliberately kidnap hostages from different villages, including grandsons and younger relatives of landlords and gentry, who would certainly come seeking help.</p><p></p><p>This was to put extreme pressure on the militia.</p><p></p><p>Guo Shanhu had already issued harsh threats. </p><p></p><p>He demanded that all militia members must quit within three days.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would face retaliation.</p><p></p><p>Their entire families.</p><p></p><p>Not even chickens and dogs would be spared!</p><p></p><p>Stone Tiger Fortress had been rampaging for a long time and was notorious. Now that they had caused such a big incident, some people inevitably became fearful. These mayors and clan leaders came hoping Xu Xiao would appease the bandits. Some even suggested temporarily disbanding the militia.</p><p></p><p>"We can't compromise!"</p><p></p><p>"The militia can't be disbanded!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai, as the militia leader, was furious. </p><p></p><p>He stood up and faced the village heads and clan leaders: "What kind of person is Guo Shanhu? How could he keep his promises? If we lay down our weapons, it will only invite more severe retaliation!"</p><p></p><p>Several militia captains were indignant: "That's right!"</p><p></p><p>"Fight them to the end!"</p><p></p><p>"They have guns, but so do we. Our guns are even better. What's there to be afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>A town mayor hurriedly said: "Everyone, don't act rashly. Stone Tiger Fortress is located deep in the mountains, easy to defend and hard to attack. Even with guns and men, how easy would it be to fight our way in?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>"The terrain in the mountains is complex."</p><p></p><p>"There are traps and hidden sentries of the bandits everywhere."</p><p></p><p>"The militia was established less than half a month ago, with no combat experience and insufficient training."</p><p></p><p>"Even if we could fight our way in, the militia would suffer heavy casualties, and the lives of the hostages would be difficult to guarantee!"</p><p></p><p>"Human lives are at stake. It's not compromise, just an expedient measure!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's face remained calm.</p><p></p><p>He watched as the two sides argued heatedly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly voice spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao, don't listen to these spineless cowards. We must not compromise with the bandits of Stone Tiger Fortress!"</p><p></p><p>An elderly man in his 80s or 90s walked over, supported by Yu Ruqian.</p><p></p><p>It was Yu Guotai, the old clan leader of the Yu family.</p><p></p><p>Another old clan leader stood up and said: "Old Yu, you are also a respected elder. Are you only concerned about the interests of your own clan and not the lives of the villagers?"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai directly rebuked sternly: "Ask yourselves, since Xiao returned to the village, which of the things he has done was for himself? What does the bandit problem in Mei County have to do with him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai continued: "Xiao has done so many good deeds for the villagers. He has proven with his actions his passionate dedication and determination to serve the nation above and support his hometown below!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a person is our hero!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, our hero is being threatened by a gang of evil bandits. This is the time when he needs support. How can we retreat?"</p><p></p><p>"We can't all rush forward shamelessly when there are benefits, but avoid responsibility and leave him alone to bear the burden when trouble comes. Where is the logic in that? How can we as human beings lack even the most basic conscience!"</p><p></p><p>The old clan leader struck the ground with his cane.</p><p></p><p>He was emotionally agitated, making many people look ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao, don't mind the others. The entire Yu family supports you. No matter what happens, I will take any responsibility. We Yu family members are not afraid to take on burdens!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Guotai's gaze swept across those present: "If these spineless cowards don't have the guts to go, even if this old man has to carry a gun himself and risk my life, I will go with you to eliminate the bandits!"</p><p></p><p>The old clan leader was over 80 years old.</p><p></p><p>He had been known all his life for being cautious about his reputation.</p><p></p><p>Now he was actively standing up to support Yu Xiao, willing to take on responsibility, and even falling out with others. This move was indeed touching.</p><p></p><p>"The old clan leader trusts me and vouches for me with his reputation. I, Yu Xiao, will not disappoint the villagers."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao slowly spoke a number: "How about this - just three days."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, Young Master Yu?"</p><p></p><p>"In three days, Stone Tiger Fortress will be destroyed. I will personally bring the hostages back!"</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao said this,</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What? How is it possible to eliminate the bandits in just three days?"</p><p></p><p>"Last year, when the government organized..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We've been fighting bandits for half a month without success, and suffered heavy losses."</p><p></p><p>"Although the militia is better equipped than the official army, the militiamen lack training. It's feared they can barely protect themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu, please reconsider!"</p><p></p><p>"We can't provoke these desperate outlaws any further!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid there's no chance of victory!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd clearly thought Yu Xiao was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>How could such a wealthy young man who had just returned from overseas know about the ferocity of bandits? Suppressing bandits is no different from fighting a war - how could it be treated so lightly? Yu Xiao gave a look to Wang Zhong beside him.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong took a deep breath and shouted in a low voice: "Shut the hell up, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>This shout.</p><p></p><p>It shook the roof tiles.</p><p></p><p>Making people's eardrums ache.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was frightened pale.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong: "Young Master Yu said three days, so it's three days. This is not a discussion with you, but a notification. Understand?!"</p><p></p><p>How powerful was the aura of this fourth-rank martial artist built like an iron tower with a fierce face? It made all the village elders and clan leaders present fall silent like cicadas in winter! They couldn't help but think of Liu Changgui's family - no one dared to truly offend the young master before them.</p><p></p><p>"Ruqian, see the guests out!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao no longer paid attention to these people.</p><p></p><p>When he walked into the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang, Bai Yajie and others.</p><p></p><p>All looked at him with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked: "What's wrong with you masters?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingfeng stroked his beard and said: "Young Master Yu understands righteousness deeply and is neither overbearing nor servile. It truly makes us admire him."</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang cupped his hands: "I am willing to lend Young Master Yu a hand in suppressing the bandits!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong: "Count me in too!!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie: "Although I am just a woman, I cannot stand by and watch these evil spirits bully a young hero like Young Master Yu. I am also willing to contribute my meager efforts."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The eight masters spoke up.</p><p></p><p>They actually volunteered to join the battle.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Yu Xiao a little.</p><p></p><p>Because although these eight were all skilled experts, they were ultimately hired by Yu Xiao as tutors, and incidentally acted as daily bodyguards and household guards. The salary Yu Xiao offered was only about 3-4 times that of working in a normal martial arts gym.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing bandits is very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>That's not something that can be done at this kind of price.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, the eight masters had come to greatly admire Yu Xiao's character.</p><p></p><p>Especially when faced with threats from such vicious bandits, he could still remain fearless in the face of danger, calm in handling matters, unmoved even if Mount Tai collapsed before him. His personal charisma was admirable.</p><p></p><p>And was such a heroic figure not worth following? At this moment, disregarding personal safety and actively choosing to participate was not only to repay the kindness of knowing them, but also an acknowledgment of Young Master Yu!</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>They had seen the militia's equipment.</p><p></p><p>They had even personally taught some skills in the militia.</p><p></p><p>The eight masters believed that even an equal number of official troops would be defeated by this militia. With such a force, they were fully capable of wiping out a group of mountain bandits.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>These eight had been almost completely won over.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could cultivate and trust them more.</p><p></p><p>"If you masters are willing to lend a hand, that would be best of course. For all who join me in suppressing the bandits, this month's salary will be doubled."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>They weren't doing it for the money.</p><p></p><p>But who would complain about earning too much?</p><p></p><p>Following Young Master Yu.</p><p></p><p>They wouldn't lose out.</p><p></p><p>They could dedicate themselves to him with peace of mind!</p><p></p><p>That day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao began to take action.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with or without the help of the eight masters, this operation was going to be a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao hadn't been unprepared over the past few days. He had already obtained maps of Stone Tiger Fortress and the surrounding terrain, gaining a fairly detailed understanding of Stone Tiger Fortress.</p><p></p><p>With the militia's armaments.</p><p></p><p>Launching a frontal assault on Stone Tiger Fortress would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>But there was no need to do so, to avoid causing too many casualties.</p><p></p><p>Destroy Stone Tiger Fortress?</p><p></p><p>He alone was enough!</p><p></p><p>And it wouldn't even take three days!</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please vote!)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

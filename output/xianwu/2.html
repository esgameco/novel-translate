        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the market in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Cloth shops, rice shops, pawn shops, Chinese medicine shops, clothing and hat stores, clock and watch shops, etc. are lined up densely.</p><p></p><p>The peddlers are pushing small carts or carrying shoulder poles, with cries of selling goods echoing all around, full of the atmosphere of a marketplace.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao has changed his appearance, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a well-tailored suit, a pocket watch, a white shirt, a necktie, and delicate leather shoes. He is currently reading the newspaper in the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>An attendant respectfully said, "Young Master Yu, we can set out now."</p><p></p><p>Outside, four sedan chair carriers are carrying a large sedan chair, and twenty porters are carrying heavy shoulder poles, with ten mules fully loaded with all kinds of goods.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sat down in the sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>This high-profile behavior </p><p></p><p>is a deliberate plan for the future.</p><p></p><p>For the past month, he has been extremely cautious, even walking on thin ice, mainly collecting intelligence. Now he can make an interim summary.</p><p></p><p>First,</p><p></p><p>the time flow speeds between the two worlds are 100:1!</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao is in the main world, the time flow speed in the sub-world will be reduced by a hundredfold. </p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao is in the sub-world, the time flow speed in the main world will be reduced by a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>It has been a month here,</p><p></p><p>but only seven hours have passed in the main world.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao closed his eyes and communicated with the ancient stele.</p><p></p><p>Some information appeared on the ancient stele:</p><p></p><p>--</p><p>Name: Yu Xiao</p><p>Cultivation: None</p><p>Reputation: 0/100 (Nameless)</p><p>Aura Growth: 0 points per year</p><p>Current Aura: 98</p><p>--</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao originally had 100 points of aura, but he has consumed 2 points, leaving 98 points.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the aura has two major functions known:</p><p></p><p>【The first: Increase lifespan.】</p><p>As long as there is aura, the lifespan will not be consumed. Each 1 point of aura is equivalent to 1 year of lifespan. </p><p>If the remaining aura is not used at all, Yu Xiao can live 98 years longer and will never show any signs of aging.</p><p></p><p>This discovery </p><p>greatly excited Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>With such cross-world or multi-world travel, even with a 100-fold time difference, there is no need to worry about rapid aging.</p><p></p><p>In theory, as long as there is enough aura, Yu Xiao's lifespan can be infinite, and he will never age. This is true immortality!</p><p></p><p>【The second: Resource exchange!】</p><p>The things from one world cannot be directly brought into another world.</p><p>This involves conflicts and rejections at the law level, and aura can offset the conflicts and rejections, allowing the circulation of resources between different worlds. The higher the grade and the stronger the attributes of the item, the more aura it will consume.</p><p></p><p>In theory,</p><p>living beings can also be transported.</p><p>But the consumption will be ten or even a hundredfold, and there will be many restrictions.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao used all his assets of 1080 gold ingots (10,800 taels) to conduct an experiment.</p><p>Probably because gold is a mundane item without attributes, and this world also commonly uses gold, the consumption of aura is only 2 points. Subsequent entries and exits will not consume any more.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that</p><p>aura is a crucial resource.</p><p></p><p>How to obtain aura? This has also been researched.</p><p></p><p>The ancient stele issued two tasks, one is a world task, and the other is an aura task.</p><p></p><p>The former requires cultivating to the "Heavenly Realm" of this world, which is speculated to be the threshold for opening the next world gate.</p><p></p><p>The latter is to accumulate reputation in this world. The higher the reputation level Yu Xiao has, the more aura he can generate each year.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the reputation value is 0, </p><p>and the level is "Nameless".</p><p>Unable to generate any aura.</p><p></p><p>So he must find a way to gain reputation.</p><p></p><p>To gain reputation,</p><p>he must first understand this world.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao has also spent a lot of effort on research.</p><p>This world's pattern is similar to the previous one, but due to the existence of real supernatural powers, even if only of low martial strength, it can bring about many changes, so the historical process is similar, but the details are somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it is the late 19th century.</p><p>The Industrial Revolution has broken out, and productivity has soared.</p><p>However, the "Great Scenery Empire" ruled by the feudal system controls the Central Plains, and from top to bottom, it is rotten to the core. It has been defeated by the powers many times, signing unequal treaties, establishing concessions and opening ports, presenting a scene of the end of a dynasty.</p><p></p><p>This is undoubtedly a bad era.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The empire is decaying, surrounded by powerful enemies, with bandits everywhere, and the people struggling to survive. </p><p></p><p>However, in the decaying soil, an unprecedented vitality is sprouting - various progressive ideas and advanced concepts are emerging, with scholars and masters debating, about to arrive at a crucial crossroads in history.</p><p></p><p>This is the background investigation.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the big picture is important.</p><p></p><p>But the people's livelihood is also very important.</p><p></p><p>The main currency is silver dollars and copper coins.</p><p></p><p>Or there may be extraordinary powers that have enhanced productivity.</p><p></p><p>The population is larger than the late Qing period, so the purchasing power of gold and silver is slightly higher.</p><p></p><p>The silver dollars are also called "taels", and one tael of gold can be exchanged for 100 taels, while one tael can be exchanged for 100 copper cents.</p><p></p><p>The coastal province of Guangyue has many commercial ports and a relatively prosperous economy.</p><p></p><p>A rickshaw puller can earn one tael per month, while a relatively respectable job like a patrol officer can earn 3-4 taels per month to support a family of three.</p><p></p><p>As for specific prices:</p><p>Rice is 2 cents per jin, pork is 10 cents per jin, live chicken is 12 cents per jin, beef is 15 cents per jin...</p><p>Cooking oil is 6 cents per jin, cotton cloth is 12 cents per jin, salt is 3 cents per jin, white sugar is 6 cents per jin, ordinary tea is 2 cents per jin, ordinary cigarettes are 3 cents per pack...</p><p></p><p>Gold in this world has surprisingly strong purchasing power! This delights Yu Xiao! He can exchange a gold bar for 1,000 taels, which can buy about 50,000 jin of rice, 10,000 jin of pork, or 6,000 jin of beef... And he can earn 3 gold bars per day from mining! With the over 10,000 taels of gold he has saved up over the past two years, he is undoubtedly extremely wealthy! Even if he does nothing, he can become a tycoon in this world, not only no longer worrying about food, clothing and living expenses, but also living a respectable life!</p><p></p><p>Of course!</p><p></p><p>This is a chaotic world of cannibalism, with the existence of extraordinary powers.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao is an ordinary person without any background. Considering his personal safety, he cannot easily reveal his wealth and needs to quickly establish a foothold.</p><p></p><p>The question is, without a background or identity, and unable to explain his origins, how can he quickly integrate into this world? If he cannot quickly integrate, how can he build a reputation and take advantage of the dual-world crossing?</p><p></p><p>After repeated deliberation, he has come up with various plans, not lacking in ways to quickly establish himself and become famous. But in the end, he decides to play it safe.</p><p></p><p>Since he has no identity, he will fabricate one. In this era when Western learning is in vogue, not only the upper and middle classes are sending their children abroad to study, but even the common people have a large number going to North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia to work or seek their fortunes.</p><p></p><p>Guangyue Province is the place that exports the most overseas Chinese. Meixian is even known as the hometown of overseas Chinese.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao learns that there is a large Yu family village nearby, and in the past 40-50 years, a large number of young and able-bodied people had gone abroad to build railways in places like Singapore, Canada, and France. </p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, most of these workers have already become bones under the railroad ties. Even if a small number have survived, in this era of inconvenient transportation, they have mostly settled overseas and are unlikely to ever return to their homeland! Through certain channels, Yu Xiao has obtained a genealogy of the Yu family village.</p><p></p><p>He decides to impersonate a descendant of the overseas Yu family.</p><p></p><p>In this era, the people are robust, and the concept of clan is deeply rooted in people's hearts. This move can take the opportunity to rally a group of "relatives" from the local gentry. In this way, he can take root in this world, have a legitimate identity and local connections, and it will be much easier to get things done.</p><p></p><p>For example, he can get some firearms and ammunition. These hot weapons are meaningless to high-level cultivators, but they are still quite effective against the lowest-level scattered cultivators. As an outsider, even if he has money, without any background or connections, inquiring about purchasing them will invite trouble. But if he entrusts it to the local gentry, the difficulty will be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Another example is that Yu Xiao wants to deal in tea and medicinal herbs from the main world. These things may not be much in the main world abundant in spiritual energy, but in the low-cultivation background of the Great Landscape, they are extremely rare and coveted by various forces. If he does not have trustworthy people and a power base, rashly taking action may lead to an unknown death.</p><p></p><p>So this "returning home in splendor" act is crucial for Yu Xiao, and he must perform it well!</p><p></p><p>The new book sets sail, with two updates per day, around 1 pm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

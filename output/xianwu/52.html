        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Early morning.</p><p></p><p>The passenger ship approached the dock.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao officially arrived at his destination, the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>As the morning mist gradually dispersed, a bustling, vibrant city full of contemporary charm unfolded before his eyes like a painting.</p><p></p><p>"Finally here!"</p><p></p><p>This was an ancient city steeped in culture, now the most dazzling pearl of the South and the number one city for import and export trade in the entire Da Jing Empire! Even before disembarking,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could already feel the prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Along the Pearl River, sails clustered like forests and merchant ships wove a dense tapestry.</p><p></p><p>There were luxurious wooden ships from Da Jing, as well as Western steam giants.</p><p></p><p>Among the Western steamships and local sampans, merchants from all over the country and abroad bustled about. There were local wealthy merchants in brocade robes, Westerners in suits and leather shoes, and Indians wrapped in red turbans.</p><p></p><p>On the dock,</p><p></p><p>Dockhands worked in pouring sweat.</p><p></p><p>Goods from various countries piled up like mountains.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian adjusted his glasses: "The provincial capital is truly prosperous beyond compare!"</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao disembarked,</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu, you've finally arrived. I've been waiting for some time!" </p><p></p><p>A man with short hair, slightly chubby, wearing an old suit and a flat cap, with a capable demeanor, approached.</p><p></p><p>"This is Chen Tingfeng from the Yangcheng Newspaper, who personally went to Meixian County to interview Brother Xiao," Yu Ruqian explained, as if worried Yu Xiao might forget: "I wrote a letter in advance asking Brother Chen to come meet us."</p><p></p><p>Of course Yu Xiao remembered.</p><p></p><p>The article that had further elevated his fame, "The Legendary Figure of Meixian County, Yu Xiao: Bandit-Suppressing Hero, Returned Scholar, and Great Philanthropist's Extraordinary Life" was written by this man.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian writing the letter,</p><p></p><p>That was also Yu Xiao's idea.</p><p></p><p>He nodded: "The article was well-written!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng: "I'm humbled. My meager writing skills are insufficient to portray the great benevolence and courage of sir!"</p><p></p><p>Why seek out Chen Tingfeng? Firstly, Yu Xiao was unfamiliar with the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this man was an experienced journalist. Although somewhat mercenary, he wrote good articles, was very familiar with the provincial capital, and was extremely well-informed. There would be times in the future when he could be useful.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng said: "Mr. Yu, on your first visit to the provincial capital, you indeed need a guide familiar with the local area. I, though unworthy, am a native of this place and am very willing to serve sir at any time if needed."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded: "Mm, I do want to understand this city's customs and local conditions more thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"Please!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng was very enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>Such a wealthy and powerful tycoon newly arrived would be in need of assistance. Serving him well now would surely bring benefits in the future.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked: "Where are we currently?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng: "This is Xiti Dock, one of the two major docks in the provincial capital. The other, Tianzi Dock, is for official use and civilian ships cannot berth there, so in terms of liveliness, this side is definitely more bustling."</p><p></p><p>Xiti Dock.</p><p></p><p>The water gateway to the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Besides serving as a hub for water transportation,</p><p></p><p>It was also adjacent to the prosperous urban area, with a strong commercial atmosphere nearby.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had just left the busy dock area when a large area of Southeast Asian-style arcade buildings appeared before his eyes. Nearby were gathered many shops, teahouses, restaurants and other commercial facilities.</p><p></p><p>Interesting! As Yu Xiao walked into the commercial district,</p><p></p><p>A sense of the era hit him.</p><p></p><p>One of the most eye-catching and characteristic features of this main street was undoubtedly the various advertisements and signboards.</p><p></p><p>Take the signboards for example.</p><p></p><p>The signboards of this era were very non-standardized.</p><p></p><p>They differed in size, shape, color, style, and placement method.</p><p></p><p>Some hung horizontally, some vertically, some at doorways, some on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A considerable portion still retained the handwritten tradition, with various unique fonts and calligraphic arts interweaving.</p><p></p><p>Many signboards were the work of famous artists, with beautiful characters engraved on wooden boards, not only full of traditional beauty but also full of human touch. Walking down the street was like viewing a calligraphy exhibition.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a large portion of signboards kept up with the times pursuing Westernization, so they used brilliant colors and even various neon lights as decoration, paired with English or French, adding to the intoxicating atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>East and West intertwined. Tradition and trends collided.</p><p></p><p>Various electric wires chaotically intertwined.</p><p></p><p>At first glance it seemed somewhat crowded and messy,</p><p></p><p>Yet it well reflected the unique character of this era.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "The provincial capital</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are there any places worth visiting?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng immediately began explaining: "Yangcheng is very large, mainly divided into: Old City, New City, Shamian Island, and the East, West, South, and North Gates. Most of these areas have places worth visiting."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had plenty of time. </p><p></p><p>He could slowly get to know the city.</p><p></p><p>So he asked, "What are the characteristics of each area?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng patiently explained:</p><p></p><p>"The Old City refers to the old urban area, which is the earliest district of Yangcheng. It was already very prosperous several hundred years ago."</p><p></p><p>"However, because it was surrounded by city walls on all four sides, the space became too limited to accommodate the growing population. Additionally, with the rise of shipping in the last 100-180 years, the old urban area has fallen behind."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, in terms of historical heritage and number of ancient sites, the Old City is definitely the most worth visiting. Moreover, most of the provincial government offices and yamen are concentrated in the Old City."</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a classic old district.</p><p></p><p>In the last 100-180 years, too many people had poured into Yangcheng.</p><p></p><p>The Old City's early development had become a disadvantage, with narrow streets, aging buildings, overly high population density, and poor public security. Wealthy merchants and tycoons had all moved out. With the rapid rise of the port, many new areas had formed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng continued to introduce other areas.</p><p></p><p>"The New City is the new district formed in recent decades after the population overflow from the Old City. The living conditions and business environment here are more prosperous than the Old City. There's also the famous Martial Arts Street here, with many martial arts schools opened to teach students."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Shamian Island is the concession of England and France. There are many European-style buildings here, and it's where most foreigners live. There are many foreign firms and Far East headquarters of multinational companies."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if we're talking about the most prosperous places,"</p><p></p><p>"That would be the West Gate and South Gate areas."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng continued his detailed explanation.</p><p></p><p>Before coming to the provincial capital, Yu Xiao had also done some basic research on this information, but it certainly wasn't as vivid and detailed as Chen Tingfeng's description.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>He was a local.</p><p></p><p>And a journalist.</p><p></p><p>He was well-versed in culture, economy, and interesting facts.</p><p></p><p>Besides the old and new urban areas and Shamian Island as a concession,</p><p></p><p>The most important areas were the "East, West, South, and North" Gates formed by the old city walls.</p><p></p><p>These four gates were like four city districts, each carrying different functions, closely related to urban layout, economic development, population distribution, and cultural characteristics.</p><p></p><p>The North Gate was the quietest, with high terrain, serving city defense and military garrison functions.</p><p></p><p>The East Gate was also relatively quiet, roughly an industrial development zone. Many textile industries, handicraft industries, and various foreign-invested factories were gathered here, with a weak commercial and living atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The South Gate and West Gate,</p><p></p><p>Were typical commercial centers.</p><p></p><p>Both were set along the Changdi and adjacent to the Pearl River, with all ports within them.</p><p></p><p>The South Gate area was home to many money shops, pawnshops, commercial firms, and private companies, more like a private business center or CBD, gathering many domestic and foreign elites.</p><p></p><p>The West Gate area was even more prosperous, with the famous Thirteen Factories and Shangxiajiu Road located within its range.</p><p></p><p>This West Gate area was not only convenient for living but also spacious and had a very good environment.</p><p></p><p>It was a good place for wealthy merchants, tycoons, and prominent officials to settle down.</p><p></p><p>There were numerous grand mansions mainly in the Lingnan style.</p><p></p><p>Collectively known as "West Gate Mansions"!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao thought it was good.</p><p></p><p>He would live here!</p><p></p><p>Although he had made many plans before coming to the provincial capital, waiting to implement them on a large scale,</p><p></p><p>Before getting started, he still needed to find a sufficiently convenient, comfortable, and luxurious mansion for himself!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing.</p><p></p><p>The Magistrate of Mei County.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was buried in reviewing the documents in the archives of the county office.</p><p></p><p>After half a year in office, the accounts of the annual summer and autumn taxes, various miscellaneous levies, and income and expenditure were still unclear.</p><p></p><p>The legal taxes of Mei County last year were 18,000 taels of silver. In reality, due to "rat damage", "fire damage", and other common excuses, an additional 6 mace and 4 fen were collected for every tael of silver, but the extra 11,520 taels were unaccounted for.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the regular taxes, there were also large amounts of special taxes such as "military tax" and "disaster tax", mainly used to pay the huge indemnities to the Western powers.</p><p></p><p>Just for Mei County alone, an extra 20,000 taels of silver had been paid.</p><p></p><p>There were also numerous non-tax levies and exactions.</p><p></p><p>For example, last year, 5,000 taels were donated just for the repair of the Imperial Mausoleum in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Biqing flipped through the tax and rent records, he found that the taxes paid by the gentry and landlords were even less than before, so it was clear who had borne the brunt of all these taxes and levies.</p><p></p><p>This year, the court had suffered another defeat. The navy, which had cost a huge amount to build, was completely destroyed by the Eastern Barbarians at sea, and an additional debt of hundreds of millions of taels of silver was owed as war reparations. So the military tax in Mei County was expected to double!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, for the Qing Emperor's centenary birthday, massive construction of luxurious gardens was required, naturally requiring the local governments to cut public spending and increase taxes.</p><p></p><p>The finances of Mei County had been squeezed to the limit. The academies, water conservancy, roads, bridges, and bandit suppression all urgently needed silver, but there was no money to use. Even the procurement of military equipment and the repair of city walls were difficult to continue!</p><p></p><p>Not only was there no money, but the granaries of the Changping Storehouse, which were the last line of defense against natural disasters, had been emptied by the previous administration, and were now filled with deceptive sand.</p><p></p><p>"The court is rotten to the core, how can it not perish?" Ye Biqing sighed, "Alas, the 800 million common people!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Ye!" A man in his thirties, dressed in a dark blue official robe, walked in. He was the county magistrate Gao Zhi.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing dismissed the clerk: "How did the investigation go?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi said, "Liu Changguei from Xiaohe Town indeed colluded with bandits to assassinate Yu Xiao, but Yu Xiao was already prepared, and not only thwarted the plot, but personally killed the bandit chief Zheng Laoying, and then used the public outrage to kill the Liu family."</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate Ye frowned.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying of the Shihutai bandits had at least a dozen murders on his hands, so killing him was justified.</p><p></p><p>And Yu Xiao's killing of him would certainly boost his reputation.</p><p></p><p>But the Liu father and son were different. They had official titles and were descendants of imperial examination graduates, so they could not be killed so easily.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao did not personally order the killing. The villagers collectively "righteously" attacked the Liu family, resulting in this outcome. It was a case of "the law does not blame the masses, and the imperial power does not reach the county", so it was really difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi continued, "After the Liu father and son died, their family property was divided by the collateral branches and sold to the Yu family at market price, the process was legal and flawless."</p><p></p><p>"And another landlord, Zhang, had already been considering selling his land. After seeing the fate of the Liu family, he immediately sold all his farmland and shops at the previously negotiated price."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "So the young master Yu has become the sole big landlord of Xiaohe Town?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi: "Correct. Yu Xiao publicly announced that he would reduce all tenant rents by 80% for the next three years, and now the ten-li eight villages all want to worship him."</p><p></p><p>Not only is the young master Yu extremely wealthy, but his methods, courage, and generosity also make people sigh in admiration. He privately established an armed force, killed the Liu clan, and consolidated all the land and property of the town. Strictly speaking, there are major problems, but the county government finds it very difficult to intervene in such matters, especially his rent reduction operation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of villagers from the surrounding areas all became loyal supporters and defenders of Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>County Magistrate Ye did not dare to rashly confront this force, otherwise a large-scale peasant uprising would occur, which would be beyond the control of a mere county magistrate.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Yu Xiao was wealthy and influential, with several hundred reliable armed forces tied to his clan.</p><p></p><p>Each of them held advanced foreign firearms, a firepower sufficient to make the county yamen's patrol guards hesitate to approach.</p><p></p><p>For any county magistrate who has such a troublemaker in their jurisdiction, if they cannot obtain reinforcements from the prefect, they can only show weakness, appease, and compromise.</p><p></p><p>"This man has money and means, dares to defy the great laws and decrees, and has grown up with a clean background overseas, learning advanced Western theories and thoughts - he is truly an outstanding hero!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi paused and asked, "Why not invite him to join the Great Xia Society?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing's expression changed upon hearing this. He hurriedly gestured for silence and said in a lowered voice, "Our Great Xia Society bears the mission of recreating the world. The recruitment of new members must be cautious. This Yu Xiao is indeed a good prospect for development, but it's better to observe him for some more time before deciding."</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi: "Then how should we handle this? Yu Xiao has caused such a commotion, and the Liu family in Jiaying Prefecture also has some connections, so the prefect will soon know about this."</p><p></p><p>"The law does not punish the masses, and Liu Changgui's death was not at the hands of Yu Xiao, and he deserved to die for colluding with bandits..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing thought for a moment and continued, "However, privately organizing armed militias, even if they are one's own clan, is ultimately illegal. This matter cannot be easily covered up."</p><p></p><p>"So, what does County Magistrate Ye intend?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing said, "The Stone Tiger Stronghold bandits have been rampaging in the villages for years, and the county yamen's attempts to suppress them have all been in vain. This time, we can request that Yu Xiao organize a militia to eliminate the harm to the people."</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi: "Excellent, excellent! If Yu Xiao agrees to help the county suppress the bandits, not only can we resolve a major internal threat, but the establishment of the militia can also be legitimized."</p><p></p><p>This move could be considered a win-win situation. Ye Biqing immediately sent Gao Zhi to communicate with Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon, Gao Zhi returned. "County Magistrate Ye, it's done."</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Biqing had already guessed that Yu Xiao would not refuse, he did not expect him to agree so readily.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "Good, this is an opportunity for us to observe this person more carefully and see if he is suitable to participate in the great cause of changing the world and recreating the Mandate of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi: "There's another piece of good news!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiao is willing to donate 5,000 taels to support the teaching at Mei County Academy, as well as the repair of water conservancy, roads, and city walls."</p><p></p><p>"Really?!"</p><p></p><p>Five thousand taels is an astronomical sum for ordinary people. Even if it doesn't solve Mei County's financial problems, it is enough to temporarily alleviate the pressing needs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing was overjoyed after confirming this. The local gentry are all tightfisted, and it is difficult to even collect taxes from them, let alone get them to donate. But this Yu Xiao, after spending tens of thousands of taels to acquire the assets of Liu and Zhang, can still casually donate such a large sum.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he is satisfied with the way the county magistrate has handled this matter. This money is essentially a gratuity, expressing that he has plenty of money and is not stingy with spending, so in the future, the county yamen must cooperate well and serve him satisfactorily - he will not withhold his generosity.</p><p></p><p>This is such a domineering attitude! As the saying goes, "Money can make the devil push the millstone." Whether corrupt officials or upright ones, as long as they are in charge of the county yamen, they will find it difficult to openly confront such a super-wealthy patron.</p>

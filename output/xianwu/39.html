        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was just a speck of dust.</p><p></p><p>Almost no one would notice him.</p><p></p><p>No one had ever truly cared about him.</p><p></p><p>He also had almost no friends, but Wei Biao could count as one! Since Yu Xiao joined the Chunlei Boxing Gym, Wei Biao had even been like half a teacher, never impatient no matter what time or what problem, always enthusiastically providing help.</p><p></p><p>In this cold world,</p><p>People like Senior Brother were rare.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't want Wei Biao to take risks, and also hoped to help him overcome difficulties, so he immediately rushed to learn about the detailed situation.</p><p></p><p>First was the "Blood Essence Pill" Wei Biao mentioned.</p><p></p><p>This pill, also known as the "Minor Blood Marrow Pill", was a high-value medicine for low-level cultivators! Yu Xiao knew about the Blood Marrow Pill - it could not only transform meridians and cleanse marrow, treating most congenital defects, but was also a major blood energy medicine used by peak Blood Refining realm martial artists to break through.</p><p></p><p>Master Li had attempted to break through to Marrow Refining.</p><p>He had used a Blood Marrow Pill as an aid.</p><p></p><p>From this, it's not hard to see how precious the Blood Marrow Pill was.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Essence Pill could be called a "Minor Blood Marrow Pill". Although its effects were far inferior to the Blood Marrow Pill, it had its own unique qualities and was also a major blood energy supplement.</p><p></p><p>It could repair the aftereffects caused by massive blood loss, and could also quickly heal internal and external injuries.</p><p></p><p>High-level cultivators directly used Blood Essence Pills as a high-quality medicine for treating injuries.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists,</p><p>The Blood Essence Pill had even greater effects.</p><p></p><p>Especially for martial artists before late Blood Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>This pill basically had no side effects and was an ideal secret medicine for blood energy cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was currently at the peak of the 4th rank of Dajing (peak of mid Blood Refining stage). With his current cultivation level and skill, if he could get a batch of Blood Essence Pills, breaking through to the 3rd rank (late Blood Refining stage) would be no difficult task.</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p>Although Blood Essence Pills were good,</p><p>They were very expensive.</p><p></p><p>Each pill cost about 25 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was just a 2nd level Qi Condensation stage cultivator. Although Master Li's remaining real estate and various belongings were worth some money, it would at most be 180 spirit stones or so, but he needed at least five Blood Essence Pills to break through!</p><p></p><p>Such a large expense,</p><p>Wei Biao couldn't afford it with his abilities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it was just a matter of spirit stones, that would actually be easy to solve.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao had spent quite a few spirit stones on buying spirit herbs and pills and maintaining the Double Penetration Gate, he had been constantly reselling goods during this period, and the overall number of spirit stones in his possession was increasing. He had once again saved up to 54 stones.</p><p></p><p>He could completely lend them to Wei Biao.</p><p>Or find a way to get more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The problem was, in a place like White Cloud Town, Blood Essence Pills were very rare. Even with money, they might not be able to buy them.</p><p></p><p>So,</p><p>Wei Biao thought of a solution.</p><p></p><p>"The reason Blood Essence Pills are scarce and expensive is mainly because during the refining process, a material called 'Blood Essence Stone' is needed. This substance is only produced inside special demon beasts, and has an extremely short shelf life, so it's very difficult to buy on the market."</p><p></p><p>Saying this,</p><p>He revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"However, I'm lucky. Recently, someone discovered a Blood Monkey Bat's nest 12 miles outside White Cloud Town. This demon beast happens to be able to produce Blood Essence Stones."</p><p></p><p>"So Senior Brother's trip this time is to hunt Blood Monkey Bats?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao nodded: "If we can obtain fresh Blood Essence Stones and then return to town to find an alchemist to refine them, we can save at least half the cost, and can quickly get the pills. This is the best solution at present!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed it was!</p><p></p><p>Regarding Blood Monkey Bats,</p><p>Yu Xiao had heard of them.</p><p></p><p>They were a type of lowest-level demon beast.</p><p>Their strength was probably equivalent to Qi Condensation stages 1 or 2.</p><p></p><p>These demon beasts were bloodthirsty and ferocious by nature, liked to move in groups, and fed on the blood of various wild animals and humans. Blood Essence Stones could condense in their heart apertures.</p><p></p><p>Although the quality of the material was average,</p><p>Blood Monkey Bats usually appeared in groups.</p><p></p><p>If enough could be hunted, it would be sufficient to make up for the lack of quality. Every seven or eight stones would be enough to refine one Blood Essence Pill.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao's move,</p><p>Was not a bad solution.</p><p></p><p>However, going out to hunt was still taking a risk.</p><p></p><p>Because in this process, there were too many unpredictable risks. White Cloud Town had many who made a living by hunting</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For independent cultivators struggling to survive, the annual casualty rate is quite high.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you don't need to worry needlessly. There's a powerful formation protecting the area around Baiyun Fang, so even high-level demon beasts can't enter. I've also found a few formidable fellow Daoists to accompany me. I'm confident we can handle a group of blood monkey bats with ease!"</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Yu Xiao said:</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, for this matter, please count me in."</p><p></p><p>"What? You want to go too?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao immediately shook his head: "No, absolutely not. Although blood monkey bats aren't strong, they're still vicious demon beasts after all. How could I let my junior brother take such a risk with me?"</p><p></p><p>Dangerous? </p><p></p><p>Perhaps. Yu Xiao didn't like risks.</p><p></p><p>Nor would he do anything without certainty.</p><p></p><p>But this hunt sounded like it wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was just next to Baiyun Fang, and only involved the lowest level demon beasts.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao believed that with his current strength, he could easily handle blood monkey bats. Even if he encountered a truly urgent situation, he could instantly retreat into his stone hall space. Not even a Daluo Golden Immortal could harm a hair on his head there.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Besides concern for his senior brother,</p><p></p><p>There was another important reason.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had also become interested in the "Blood Essence Pills"!</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had hit a bottleneck, and breaking through to the sixth rank seemed far off at present. If he could get a few Blood Essence Pills, he could definitely break through within a few months, without any difficulty to speak of.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this killing two birds with one stone? He could help his senior brother,</p><p></p><p>And help himself at the same time!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "There's no need to worry. I don't want to be a delicate flower in a greenhouse. I need to experience some real combat in advance to accumulate experience. If I'm afraid to face even a group of blood monkey bats, how will I participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao wavered.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Yu Xiao to help him.</p><p></p><p>But what Yu Xiao said did make a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>Although this junior brother had extraordinary talent that amazed people, his biggest problem at present was lack of experience.</p><p></p><p>As an independent cultivator!</p><p></p><p>This was fatal!</p><p></p><p>How perilous is the path of cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Heaven knows what dangers one might encounter! Those cultivation geniuses who always grew up smoothly and were well-protected often perished easily in various accidents!</p><p></p><p>Especially since,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had mentioned the Immortal Ascension Assembly! Having followed Li Yan for so many years, how could Wei Biao not know the dangers of the Immortal Ascension Assembly?</p><p></p><p>It was said that more than half of the independent cultivators who participated in each Immortal Ascension Assembly would die or be injured.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had obtained Li Yan's Immortal Ascension token and would participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly in the future. It was very necessary to participate in this wilderness hunt in advance and accumulate some practical combat experience!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, have you forgotten? I have some family heirloom firearms. I'm not someone who can't even tie up a chicken."</p><p></p><p>"Haha! That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao immediately recalled the scene of Yu Xiao killing the golden roc. His firearms were not only powerful and fast, but could also attack from a long distance. They were perfect for dealing with or suppressing and driving away blood monkey bats.</p><p></p><p>With these in hand,</p><p></p><p>His combat power might not be weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then we brothers will go together. This way we can also look out for each other!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao had thought it through and no longer hesitated: "This opportunity is quite rare. If we can get a share of some blood essence stones, it will greatly benefit your cultivation, junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>That's for sure! Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to participate in this kind of hunt,</p><p></p><p>He would definitely make thorough preparations!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said: "I've arranged to meet with three fellow Daoists tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"We're taking action tomorrow? I'll go back and prepare right away!"</p><p></p><p>The timing seemed rushed,</p><p></p><p>But it was more than enough for Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>For his first time participating in a group activity with other independent cultivators,</p><p></p><p>He would certainly make good preparations. So he hurried back to his residence, first used his perception technique to sense if anyone was nearby, and when he confirmed there was no one around, he immediately crossed over into the stone hall, then entered the Great Scenery World.</p><p></p><p>Only one night.</p><p></p><p>The time seemed short.</p><p></p><p>But it was actually very ample.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could even spend a month or two preparing!

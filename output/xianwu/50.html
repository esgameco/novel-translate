        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The small town of Xiaohe held a temple fair.</p><p></p><p>It was festively decorated and lively, with dragon and lion dances, opera performances, acrobatics, and various other shows.</p><p></p><p>Villagers from miles around came to attend the fair and enjoy the sights. Many people wore new clothes they hadn't worn in years, their faces beaming with joy and excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa! Grandpa!" </p><p></p><p>A little girl suddenly noticed her grandfather was in tears.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing what had happened, she quickly went to help wipe his tears. "Don't cry during New Year's, Grandpa, don't cry!"</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, Grandpa is happy. I haven't seen such a lively scene in many years," said the weathered old man, wiping his eyes. "If your grandmother was still here, she would have loved this. She always enjoyed joining in the festivities!"</p><p></p><p>The old farmer thought of his wife of fifty years who had been his lifelong companion.</p><p></p><p>Two years ago, in order to save food for the family to get through winter, so that her husband would have strength to plow the fields and feed the children in spring, she had chosen to starve herself to death.</p><p></p><p>There were many others shedding tears like the old farmer.</p><p></p><p>For the town of Xiaohe, this was undoubtedly the best year in a decade. There were few reports of people selling their children in the surrounding villages, and no elderly people had frozen or starved to death this winter.</p><p></p><p>Because.</p><p></p><p>There was a Yu family charity house in town.</p><p></p><p>It specifically took in orphans without parents, or children from extremely poor families who could barely survive.</p><p></p><p>The town also opened a relief hall, taking in nearly a thousand elderly widows and widowers from surrounding villages who had no ability to work or were struggling to make ends meet, providing them with food and even basic medical care.</p><p></p><p>Even the opera troupe and acrobats for this Spring Festival temple fair.</p><p></p><p>They were hired by Master Yu, who paid for it all.</p><p></p><p>Master Yu was truly a great benefactor! His merits were boundless!</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>At the charity house in town.</p><p></p><p>They had been busy since before dawn.</p><p></p><p>Over 300 children got up on their own initiative, neatly folded their bedding, and began sweeping and cleaning with brooms.</p><p></p><p>This was not only a traditional Spring Festival custom, but also because the children learned that their adoptive father would be coming to spend the Spring Festival at the charity house this year.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for any child not to like their adoptive father.</p><p></p><p>He would visit the charity house several times every month.</p><p></p><p>Each time he came, he would bring various small gifts for the children.</p><p></p><p>His reputation and status in Xiaohe town, as well as his heroic deeds in wiping out the Stone Tiger bandits, inspired admiration in everyone.</p><p></p><p>The children spent half a day cleaning.</p><p></p><p>The entire charity house was spotless.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly someone shouted: "Adoptive father is here!"</p><p></p><p>All the children excitedly ran out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>A large group of people escorted a horse-drawn carriage to the front of the building.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao got down from the carriage. The guards, maids and attendants from the Yu family mansion all came to the charity house, bringing rice, flour, oil, and other New Year's goods such as cured meat and cloth.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had also specially prepared a gift and a red envelope with New Year's money for each child.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't much money.</p><p></p><p>Just a few cents.</p><p></p><p>Mainly for good luck.</p><p></p><p>The children also presented Yu Xiao with a gift in return.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yue held out a large blessing knot to Yu Xiao: "We wish the master good fortune and health in the new spring!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Guozhong stroked his beard and explained: "Each red string in this blessing knot was personally woven by the children."</p><p></p><p>The children at the charity house.</p><p></p><p>Their ages mainly ranged from 8 to 12 years old.</p><p></p><p>At this age they couldn't make very complex handicrafts, so they joined forces, with each person weaving one red string, and then used hundreds of red strings to weave this blessing knot.</p><p></p><p>It carried the children's wishes for Yu Xiao's good fortune and health.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao accepted the blessing knot. Although this handicraft looked a bit rough, it contained the purest and simplest blessings in the world.</p><p></p><p>Every child was watching eagerly.</p><p></p><p>They were clearly nervous.</p><p></p><p>Would such an important person as their adoptive father like such a crude little gift? But this was all they could do!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao smiled and said: "Not bad, I like it very much. It would be perfect to hang in the mansion!"</p><p></p><p>The children were all overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sound of firecrackers erupted outside.</p><p></p><p>The maids and guards brought in large amounts of flour and fillings.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "Children, we can't do without dumplings for Spring Festival. I've specially prepared 50 jin of flour and 100 jin of pork filling. Today let's make pork dumplings together."</p><p></p><p>When the children heard this.</p><p></p><p>They all started salivating!</p><p></p><p>Even the maids and attendants were looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>In this era, being able to eat fragrant pork dumplings was a very happy thing!</p><p></p><p>"Eat dumplings!"</p><p></p><p>"Eat dumplings!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone cheered.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao, the guards, maids, attendants, and the children all started making dumplings together.</p><p></p><p>That evening they ate hot, freshly made dumplings.</p><p></p><p>Everyone ate to their heart's content.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao spent the whole day with the children. It seemed like he didn't do anything, but he really enjoyed this atmosphere and sense of everyday life.</p><p></p><p>In this world.</p><p></p><p>The purpose is not</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Important. The most important thing is the experience.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xu Xiao diligently practiced martial arts and cultivated immortality was not to pursue ultimate power, but simply to have better, more comfortable, and more interesting experiences in his long life.</p><p></p><p>If one only focuses on blindly charging towards their dreams:</p><p></p><p>If successful, emptiness. </p><p></p><p>If unsuccessful, melancholy.</p><p></p><p>Then life would be too meaningless.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced Mei County pretty thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Next he would go see a broader world and universe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He decided to announce this news to his adopted children: "Children, after spring begins, your adoptive father plans to go develop his career in the provincial capital. In the future I may only return a few times a year."</p><p></p><p>"When I'm not here, you must study hard and obediently listen to your teachers and masters."</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>When Xu Xiao announced this news.</p><p></p><p>The children were stunned at first, then fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>It's unclear which child started crying first, but then as if contagious, all the children burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p></p><p>"Adoptive father, don't go!"</p><p></p><p>"We'll miss you, adoptive father!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Xu Xiao was also very moved. When he first established the orphanage, he didn't think too much about it and didn't have particularly noble aspirations.</p><p></p><p>He simply wanted to gain more fame by adopting orphans, and then cultivate these children to become his future assistants.</p><p></p><p>As for doing some good deeds.</p><p></p><p>It was just going with the flow.</p><p></p><p>However, after spending so much time together, the children of this era were too well-behaved and sensible, to the point it was heartbreaking.</p><p></p><p>Humans are not unfeeling plants.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Xiao gained a deeper understanding of the suffering in this world.</p><p></p><p>He felt his connection to this originally unfamiliar world become even closer.</p><p></p><p>"Children."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be sad!"</p><p></p><p>"You must study hard and practice martial arts diligently in town!"</p><p></p><p>"Your adoptive father promises you, in the future I will build a big school in the provincial capital, and bring all the children who study well and work hard there."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The orphanage director Yu Guozhong also said: "Your adoptive father is a great hero. He's going to do great things like developing industry to strengthen the country and save the people. If you truly like and admire him, then you should work even harder to be able to help him in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the children's sadness finally eased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>One by one, their eyes filled with determination as they silently resolved to study hard and practice martial arts diligently, because only then could they stay by their adoptive father's side!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Festival atmosphere had not yet faded.</p><p></p><p>But farmers were already busy preparing the fields, seedlings and agricultural materials, making efforts for the upcoming early rice spring plowing.</p><p></p><p>In these times, leisure time was brief and luxurious. Ordinary people were busy year-round to the point they could hardly catch their breath. Everyone had to use all their strength just to survive.</p><p></p><p>The situation was such that it wouldn't change in a short time, and was also difficult to change because of one person.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao set out.</p><p></p><p>He had nine attendants in total.</p><p></p><p>Besides Yu Ruqian in the role of household manager.</p><p></p><p>Four maids to take care of daily life.</p><p></p><p>There were also four guards: Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, Bai Yajie, and Xu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>As for Master Liao Zhen and the other masters, they were left in Mei County to teach martial arts to the children.</p><p></p><p>Yu Daniu, Tang Yue and the other children were still too young. It would be safer and more stable for them to live in Mei County for now. They could be brought over when they were a bit older.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day.</p><p></p><p>In the early morning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing and Gao Zhi personally came to see them off.</p><p></p><p>"A farewell is inevitable even when seeing a friend off a thousand miles. The situation in the provincial capital is very complex. I hope sir will take good care of himself!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "No matter what troubles you encounter, you can publish the distress signal in the newspaper as I described. At that time, our Daxia Society's forces in the provincial capital will naturally stand up to fully support sir!"</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Xiao had not joined the society.</p><p></p><p>He had already donated large amounts of money and supplies to the Daxia Society.</p><p></p><p>He never asked about where these funds and supplies went. This kind of trust deeply moved Ye Biqing, who naturally became even more appreciative of this extraordinary young man before him.</p><p></p><p>Such a person.</p><p></p><p>Must not come to harm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately the Daxia Society had considerable strength in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Even if something happened, they should be able to look after him!</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao didn't say much, just cupped his hands and said: "Until we meet again!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Xu Xiao and his group depart into the distance, Gao Zhi sighed: "Who knows how long it will be before we meet again!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing smiled and said: "As long as we walk the same path, no matter how long or how far, there will always be a time when we meet again."</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please vote!

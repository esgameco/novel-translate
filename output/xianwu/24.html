        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was in the boxing gym.</p><p></p><p>He had been resting for five days.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the gym had been somewhat oppressive recently.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao was unaffected, continuing his cultivation steadily, going back and forth between the two realms, firmly and steadily.</p><p></p><p>Adding up the time in the two realms, it had been over ten days, but there were still no signs of a breakthrough in his blood qi. The cultivation of the Azure Wood Technique was going smoothly, with the spiritual energy in his dantian becoming increasingly dense. He estimated that in at most a few months, he would definitely be able to cultivate spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Thunder Boxing Gym and the Golden Knife Gang had both suffered heavy losses in this battle.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao had gained some benefits from this fight.</p><p></p><p>In addition to accumulating a full 21 spirit stones, he had also figured out the functions of the other spoils of war.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pills included: 5 Blood Replenishing Pills, 2 Small Restoration Pills, and 1 bottle of Hundred Snake Powder.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Replenishing Pills and Small Restoration Pills were relatively common but valuable recovery pills. The former could stimulate the body's potential, thereby accelerating the healing of external injuries and increasing the recovery speed of blood qi, while the latter could quickly restore spiritual power and also had some effects in treating internal injuries and recovering physical strength.</p><p></p><p>As for the Hundred Snake Powder? It was a potent poison refined from the toxic blood of snake demons. It would take effect in just two hours, was odorless and colorless, and could be dissolved into various alcohols, waters, and foods. Once it took effect, it could quickly cause the victim to die, without any discomfort beforehand... A single bottle of this was said to be able to kill at least 500 ordinary people! It was undoubtedly an extremely dangerous thing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao carefully put it away, as it might be useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>The talisman scrolls included: 2 Lightness Talismans and 2 Invisibility Talismans. Of course, they would be useless before he succeeded in cultivating his qi.</p><p></p><p>Even the lowest-level talisman scrolls, with the techniques sealed within, required spiritual power to activate.</p><p></p><p>As for the battle saber left behind by the Gang Leader, although it was not a spiritual weapon, it was forged from a hundred-times tempered copper and could cut through iron like mud. It was quite valuable, and Yu Xiao could either use it himself or exchange it for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Adding up the value of all these spoils of war, it was at least worth thirty to forty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>For a core disciple of a prominent sect or a cultivator's family, this was not a significant amount, but for a wandering cultivator like himself, it was by no means a small sum!</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao came up to him: "Master Li wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Has Master Li recovered already?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the situation is not too good. Master Li has decided to leave White Cloud Manor and return to his hometown."</p><p></p><p>"What? Master Li is leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was surprised, but also felt that it was understandable.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Manor was a remote and impoverished place. How could it be as comfortable as the secular world? If it weren't for seeking immortality and finding a place to cultivate, few would be willing to live there.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan had failed to break through, with no hope of advancement. His spirit had been deflated, and now that he was getting older, returning home to retire and spend his remaining years was undoubtedly the right choice.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the main hall, he saw Li Yan. His complexion had improved slightly, but there were more white hairs and wrinkles on his face, making him appear gloomy and even with a hint of death.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was only around 50 years old, and his cultivation was at the peak of the Blood Refining Realm. Normally, he should be able to live for 180 years or more. But now, his aura was no different from a decrepit old man on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li!"</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities, sit down and let's talk."</p><p></p><p>"I heard from Senior Brother Wei that Master Li is preparing to return home."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I already had an old illness in my body. This time, even though I didn't encounter any accidents, it was still a matter of life and death to forcefully break through. Now, preserving this remnant of life, I likely only have one or two years left. It seems the heavens have taken pity on me, allowing me to return home to my roots."</p><p></p><p>Only one or two years left? The depletion of his vital energy was indeed more severe than imagined!</p><p></p><p>"The immortal cultivation world has countless miraculous pills, spiritual treasures, and heavenly materials. There may still be ways to save you!"</p><p></p><p>"No need, my foundation is already ruined. Even if I could extend my lifespan a bit more, what would be the use? It would only be a pitiful existence, struggling in a cage. After being away from my hometown for decades, I should go back and take a final look."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao fell silent, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, he had only been a disciple for a short time. On the other, even if he wanted to help, he currently lacked the ability to do so.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan reminisced on his own accord: "I was born into poverty. Besides me, there was also an elder sister and two elder brothers. During that famine year, my parents sold me to the local gang to survive."</p><p></p><p>"I joined the gang at the age of nine, doing odd jobs for several years. One day, I unexpectedly gained the favor of the Gang Leader and was taught martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"At seventeen, I became the top fighter in the gang."</p><p></p><p>"By the time I was nineteen, I had defeated all challengers in the city and had no equal."</p><p></p><p>"At twenty-one, I not only became the Deputy Gang Leader, but also used ruthless methods to eliminate all my rivals, quickly gaining a reputation that shook the surrounding area for hundreds of miles, with all the heroes in the land showing reverence."</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I was young and successful, full of ambition. If I had continued on that path, I would have surely refined my essence by now, and in the secular world, I would have established a reputation that commanded the respect of thousands, with a life surrounded by descendants and concubines."</p><p></p><p>As Li Yan recalled those memories, his gaze momentarily brightened, perhaps the most glorious period of his life.</p><p></p><p>"But that year, I encountered..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The true cultivator. "I, this frog sitting at the bottom of a well and only seeing the sky above, have realized for the first time that the world is so vast."</p><p></p><p>"My power, my achievements, all that I have pursued - in their eyes, they are mere child's play. It turns out that all people are but fleeting mayflies, living from dawn to dusk!"</p><p></p><p>"I am not content with this!" </p><p></p><p>"I am truly not content!"</p><p></p><p>"So, in order to pursue the lofty Dao of immortality, to seek the legendary eternal life, I have forsaken my blood-related family, my life-or-death brothers, and the beloved female companions who loved me..."</p><p></p><p>"In a flash."</p><p></p><p>"It has been almost thirty years!"</p><p></p><p>"My parents and elder siblings have long since passed away, and the jianghu world has changed so much that I doubt anyone still remembers my name, leaving me as a solitary, withered remnant just eking out an existence here."</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao did not know how to comfort the senior before him who was at the end of his life and full of regret.</p><p></p><p>He could only be a silent listener.</p><p></p><p>When Li Yan emerged from his recollections,</p><p></p><p>his gaze fell on Yuanxiao: "When I was your age, I only felt proud to be a frog at the bottom of a well, looking up at the sky, which was truly laughable and pitiful."</p><p></p><p>"But now, looking back, what's wrong with being a frog at the bottom of a well?"</p><p></p><p>"Not knowing the vastness of the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Not understanding the depth of the earth."</p><p></p><p>"Not concerning myself with the busy affairs of the world."</p><p></p><p>"Not lamenting the passing of time."</p><p></p><p>"Not needing to toil and struggle."</p><p></p><p>"In this small space, finding contentment within - this life would be enough!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I am already old!"</p><p></p><p>"I no longer have the chance to choose!"</p><p></p><p>"You are still young, with limitless possibilities. If you can let go of some delusions, enjoy the present life, with your talents and abilities, perhaps you can live more comfortably and safely."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan stared at Yuanxiao and asked, "So, after hearing my story, do you still want to continue down this path?"</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao did not answer.</p><p></p><p>He only counter-asked, "If time could turn back to when you were twenty years old, Master Li, and you had the chance to choose again, what choice would you make?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan paused for a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>Then he burst into loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>The laughter lasted for a full minute.</p><p></p><p>Laughing until tears spilled from the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, if I could live again, I, Li Yan, would still choose this path!"</p><p></p><p>He said, "Some people are destined to be unable to be content as a frog at the bottom of a well, since this world is so fascinating, and we happened to be born into it. It seems we are of the same kind!"</p><p></p><p>After calming his emotions,</p><p></p><p>he seemed to have made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Wei Biao has followed me for thirteen years. I plan to leave the martial arts school and related businesses to him. As for you, Yuanxiao... I owe you a life, but I don't have much left to give you."</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao immediately said, "Master Li's help has already been more than enough!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He took out a red wooden box from a hidden compartment beside him.</p><p></p><p>Carefully opening the box,</p><p></p><p>inside was a white talisman.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan caressed the talisman calmly and said, "This is the Ascension Talisman, not a priceless treasure, but something that wandering cultivators would fight over to the death. You... take it."</p><p></p><p>Ascension Talisman?!</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao's eyes widened!</p><p></p><p>The reason why the White Cloud Pavilion could gather so many wandering cultivators was largely due to the fact that the White Cloud Pavilion would periodically distribute Ascension Talismans. A single Ascension Talisman was worth at least hundreds or thousands of spirit stones - extremely rare, not something that could be bought with just spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This was a key that could change the fate of a wandering cultivator!</p><p></p><p>That's why the cold-hearted Gao Han, despite betraying his teacher and destroying his sect, was so determined to seize it. And now it was being handed to him just like that.</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao couldn't help but hesitate, "This is too precious."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan smiled and said, "It's fine, it's useless to me now. If you can cultivate to the third layer of Qi Refinement within seven years, take it and go participate in the Ascension Assembly."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, we wandering cultivators without a lineage, without resources, and without cultivation methods, are destined not to go far."</p><p></p><p>"How many beautiful sights are there in this world?"</p><p></p><p>"I definitely won't be able to see them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Although our teacher-disciple relationship has only been for a short few months, I hope you can continue on this path in my stead, and properly appreciate the countless wonders of this great world!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, </p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao could not refuse.</p><p></p><p>He reverently accepted the talisman.</p><p></p><p>He felt it was a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>After all, it had once carried Li Yan's lifelong dream.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seven days had passed.</p><p></p><p>After Yuexiao joined Li Yan's school,</p><p></p><p>He worked in the mines every day and trained in martial arts after work.</p><p></p><p>When he was tired, he would rest in the grand scenery, which had been his life for over ten days now.</p><p></p><p>During this time, senior disciple Wei Biao was responsible for daily guidance, and Li Yan had also taught a few times, though not one-on-one, but in group lessons for the outer disciples. Even so, Yuexiao benefited greatly from it.</p><p></p><p>On this day,</p><p></p><p>In the evening,</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao was practicing punches, his movements not too fast. Each technique, each form, was accompanied by special rhythmic breathing.</p><p></p><p>Spring Thunder Fist.</p><p></p><p>Practicing the forms and techniques.</p><p></p><p>Outer disciples can only learn the forms.</p><p></p><p>The forms are divided into two parts: "Thirty-Six Forms of Spring Thunder" and "Spring Thunder Breathing Method".</p><p></p><p>The punching techniques he was practicing now were the Thirty-Six Forms of Spring Thunder, each movement requiring a specific breathing method. Only by doing so can the training effect be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of seemingly ordinary movements, when practiced with the specialized breathing technique, are far more exhausting than an hour of continuous mining.</p><p></p><p>After completing the thirty-six movements,</p><p></p><p>He was drenched in sweat, his whole body scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>His muscles were twitching, almost completely depleted.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao laughed heartily: "Good, your physique and stamina are not bad, you've grasped the forms faster than I expected!"</p><p></p><p>After seven days of learning,</p><p></p><p>And twelve days of practice,</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had completed the full set of thirty-six forms.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary person, it would take at least a month of training strength and stamina to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao had been mining for two years, so his physical strength was sufficient. He had also cultivated for a month before starting martial arts, so his overall condition was better, allowing him to progress faster than most.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao couldn't help but ask, "Does this mean I've entered the door?"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan said,</p><p></p><p>He would only teach for three months.</p><p></p><p>Only by entering the door can one progress to the inner court.</p><p></p><p>Become his personal disciple.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there would be no need to continue training.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was a man of principles. For someone like Yuexiao, a poor person, even if he had the money, Li Yan wouldn't bother accepting him.</p><p></p><p>In his words,</p><p></p><p>Without talent, don't force it.</p><p></p><p>Mastering the forms is enough to strengthen the body and be a normal person, living a good life is the most important.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Yan had accepted many registered outer disciples, based on Yuexiao's observation, including Wei Biao, there were probably no more than five who could truly enter the inner court for cultivation, showing that it was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Don't even dream of it!" </p><p></p><p>Wei Biao rolled his eyes. "You've just grasped the forms, you're still far from entering the door. You at least need to cultivate the warrior's vital energy and have it flow through your entire meridians before you can be considered a true beginner!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's clear you know nothing about the martial dao. Then let me explain it to you from the beginning!"</p><p></p><p>The martial dao is divided into three realms: Refining Blood, Refining Marrow, and Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>Corresponding to the initial, middle, and late stages of qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators refine the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into spiritual power, preparing for the foundation establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>Warriors, on the other hand, refine their own blood and qi, then use the refined vital energy to temper their meridians and viscera, strengthening their physical body. Only after the meridians and viscera have been thoroughly tempered can they lower the difficulty of qi cultivation and have a chance at foundation establishment.</p><p></p><p>This is the way of martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Comparing cultivation to an off-road journey,</p><p></p><p>Then the road conditions are one's natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Some have good talent and smooth roads, so they can easily reach the destination.</p><p></p><p>Some have poor talent, with rugged and steep roads, unable to force their way through, so they must pave the way first. Cultivators practice martial arts not as a goal, but to temper their bodies for better qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The path of martial cultivation is not easy.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts not only require talent,</p><p></p><p>But also diligent practice, adequate resources, and a master's guidance are equally important.</p><p></p><p>Without enough medicinal supplements, good food, and a teacher's hands-on instruction, it is difficult to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the window period for martial cultivation is relatively short. As one ages, the body decays, and the vital energy will quickly decline, making the possibility of a breakthrough lower and lower.</p><p></p><p>What Wei Biao mentioned as "vital energy flowing through the meridians"</p><p></p><p>Refers to a specific martial cultivation method, continuously cultivating and activating one's potential to nurture the vital energy. When the vital energy circulates through the entire meridian network, it is considered to have reached the "Refining Blood" realm, officially entering the door.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the regular meridians,</p><p></p><p>The human body also has the Extraordinary Meridians.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation process of a Blood Refining Realm martial artist is to continuously temper their qi and blood, opening and refining the eight extraordinary meridians one by one. Each time a meridian is successfully refined, the blood qi will be strengthened by several times the original foundation.</p><p></p><p>Take Li Yan for example. He has completely refined all eight extraordinary meridians! </p><p></p><p>Therefore, he has already reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yu Xiao roughly understood.</p><p></p><p>Using the example of the Nine Ranks of the Great Landscape martial artists, when one cultivates their martial artist's blood qi and connects the main meridians, they can be considered to have entered the Rank martial artists, reaching the Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the eight extraordinary meridians are still in a closed state. Going forward, each time an extraordinary meridian is opened and connected, the blood qi will grow several times stronger, and the martial artist's rank will also rise by one level, with their strength significantly enhanced as well.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Wei Biao said he was far behind.</p><p></p><p>According to the standard set by Li Yan, one is only considered a true disciple after cultivating the blood qi and connecting the main meridians.</p><p></p><p>In other words, one must at least reach the entry-level of the Great Landscape Realm.</p><p></p><p>How easy is that? Yu Xiao spent over ten days just to grasp the cultivation method, and the process from grasping the method to cultivating the martial artist's blood qi is likely to be extremely long, while connecting the main meridians also requires tremendous effort.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, even a year and a half would be considered lightning fast! It's not unusual to take three to five years.</p><p></p><p>Those who can truly cultivate the blood qi connection in just a few months, either had a foundation beforehand, or are true geniuses of martial cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Poverty in literature, but rich in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the martial path requires more resources than same-level cultivators of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he has the Double Penetration ability to enter the Great Landscape World.</p><p></p><p>With the exchange of resources between the two realms, the resource problem can be easily solved.</p><p></p><p>With a hundred-fold time difference, he can become a martial cultivation genius in Li Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>With the theoretically infinite lifespan, he can maintain his peak condition and undiminished blood qi, walking further on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That night, in the manor.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan put down the medicine bowl: "How is the new disciple doing?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao reported Yu Xiao's situation: "His foundation is not bad, and he is also very diligent. He has already grasped the cultivation method, but unfortunately he is a bit too old, and he is a miner, otherwise he might have the potential to achieve something remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan just casually asked.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating martial arts at 23 is too late.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he is a poor miner who cannot afford the expensive martial cultivation supplements and tonics. Even if he can reach the Blood Refining Realm threshold, his lifetime limit would at most be the first or second layer of the Qi Refining Realm.</p><p></p><p>This potential is not worth expecting.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan started coughing again.</p><p></p><p>"Master Li, your health..."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I only have less than two years left. I must break through to the Marrow Refining Realm as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>A trace of worry flashed in Wei Biao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's greatest dream has always been to truly enter the Immortal Cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Possessing a superior spiritual root, he could not possibly become a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He must have long been recruited by major sects or clans.</p><p></p><p>Since he became a wandering cultivator, his spiritual root must not be good, so he chose to cultivate the martial path.</p><p></p><p>As a wandering cultivator, joining an immortal cultivation sect is the only way to participate in the Immortal Ascension Assembly, but there are several very rigid conditions to participate.</p><p></p><p>Before the age of 30, one must cultivate to the third layer of Qi Refining.</p><p>Or before the age of 50, one must cultivate to the fourth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan reached the peak of the Blood Refining Realm in his early 30s, and then cultivated to the third layer of Qi Refining, participating in the Immortal Ascension Assembly at the time, but unfortunately he failed at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but he also suffered a hidden injury.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his cultivation has been difficult to advance for many years.</p><p></p><p>Now, Li Yan is already 48 years old. Given his talent, it is impossible for him to break through to the middle stage of Qi Refining. The only way is to first enter the Marrow Refining Realm through the martial path, and then he can smoothly advance to the fourth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>As a martial artist, he is too old.</p><p>He has also suffered a hidden injury before.</p><p>His blood qi has already begun to decline.</p><p>Further advancement will undoubtedly be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan is not reconciled and has never given up.</p><p>He has been charging tuition from his disciples over the years, just to accumulate spirit stones to purchase various resources, hoping to make one last attempt before the age of 50!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter complete)</p>

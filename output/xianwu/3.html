        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at the Yujia Village.</p><p></p><p>The village was more dilapidated than expected.</p><p></p><p>The villagers had sallow complexions and thin frames, their clothes patched up, and the ancestral hall looked worn and neglected.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Great Dynasty had been plagued by natural disasters and suffered consecutive military defeats, resulting in massive reparations. This had led to a continuous increase in land taxes and grain taxes, as well as a proliferation of various onerous miscellaneous taxes, such as "acreage levies," "pig taxes," and "manure taxes."</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate would also frequently extort the people under the pretext of road and bridge repairs.</p><p></p><p>The common folk bore an immense burden.</p><p></p><p>It was hardly a time of prosperity.</p><p></p><p>In its heyday, Yujia Village was said to have had over a thousand households, but now there were only two or three hundred, with a total population of around a thousand. </p><p></p><p>Life was truly arduous!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elderly man with a cane was leading around 150 villagers to welcome them at the village entrance.</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his homecoming in glory.</p><p></p><p>He had made preparations for half a month, and the village had long been informed in advance.</p><p></p><p>The old man was the village chief and clan leader, Yuguotai. He had attained the title of xiucai (recommended scholar) in his youth and was now nearly eighty years old. He had lived an upright, incorruptible, and benevolent life, earning great respect not only in Yujia Village but also in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>Facing the imposing and dignified Yuanxiao, Yuguotai excitedly stepped forward and grasped his hand: "Are you the descendant of Awang?"</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao nodded with a joyful expression: "Elder clan leader, I am Yuanxiao. My grandfather, in his final moments, deeply regretted not being able to return to his roots. Today, I am here to represent him and reconnect with our ancestral home."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful!" </p><p></p><p>The elderly man, overcome with emotion, reminisced about the past.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, if it weren't for the struggle to survive, no one would have chosen to die abroad. Those years, many of our clansmen were forced to go overseas, and Awang was among the earliest. But not a single one was able to return and be laid to rest in their homeland!"</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao couldn't help but feel saddened as well. According to the information he had gathered, most of these people had worked on the railways in the West, with nine out of ten dying on the journey or during construction. Even those who managed to survive could only become the lowly of the local society, never receiving the respect they deserved.</p><p></p><p>The persona Yuanxiao had crafted for himself was that his grandfather, Yuguowang, was one of the earliest adventurers from Yujia Village. He had participated in the construction of the Pacific Railway in the Maple Leaf Country and married a local laundry worker. The couple later opened a restaurant, accumulated some savings, and then moved to Victoria, British Columbia, where they gave birth to Yuanxiao's father, Yuqingshan.</p><p></p><p>Yuqingshan received his education at the Oriental Home school run by a missionary association. At the age of fifteen, he started his own business and now has industries in North America and Southeast Asia. He is a wealthy but exceptionally low-profile businessman. However, due to the constant hard work and strain, his health has been deteriorating, leading him to long for his father's final wish - for his only son, who has just turned twenty, to return and reconnect with their ancestral roots.</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao explained, "My father is too busy to take time off, and his health has not been good lately. He is unable to withstand the long journey... But Elder Clan Leader, please rest assured. As soon as my father has recovered, he will be the first to come back and reconnect with our roots!"</p><p></p><p>What a clever ruse! Why bother fabricating a non-existent "father"? It was simply to convey the message that there were powerful forces behind him, that although he was wealthy, the money was his father's, and the businesses were all under his father's control. This would instill a sense of caution in others.</p><p></p><p>Yuguotai responded, "No worries, no worries at all. Having you here to represent Qingshan and Guowang is already a great joy for this old man."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a square face, Yuqinghai, the son of the elder clan leader, asked, "Anxiao, how long do you plan to stay this time?"</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao clasped his hands and said, "This trip back is not only to reconnect with our roots, but also to represent my father in investing domestically and establishing businesses. I will not be leaving anytime soon. In the future, I hope the elders and fellow villagers will continue to look after me."</p><p></p><p>The villagers enthusiastically cheered.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p>"He's got talent!"</p><p>"Returning in glory to serve the country, as it should be!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>No one would doubt the identity of the person before them. Although they were unsure of the true scale of Yuqingshan's overseas business, the value of the young man's attire alone was beyond the reach of ordinary people, even if they didn't eat or drink for years.</p><p></p><p>Such a distinguished young master, if not for his ancestral ties here, why would he bother coming to this remote and impoverished place to reconnect with a group of poor relatives? </p><p></p><p>It would be wise to curry favor with him.</p><p>Perhaps they could even get a taste of the soup in the future.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Yuanxiao had guessed the villagers' ulterior motives. These people, with their simple clothes and sallow complexions, were clearly struggling. Now that they had this connection, it would be easy to win them over.</p><p></p><p>Yuanxiao said...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To celebrate his successful return to the country, he took it upon himself to purchase a batch of supplies, planning to host a banquet to repay the local villagers.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he waved his hand, instructing the porters to bring the items up.</p><p></p><p>"Here are 5,000 pounds of rice, 1,000 pounds of pork, 1,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables, 500 pounds of cooking oil, 50 jars of liquor..."</p><p></p><p>It cost around 300 silver dollars, which was nothing to Xu Xiao, but it completely stunned the elders and villagers before him.</p><p></p><p>The impact was too strong.</p><p></p><p>How much money did this cost? An ordinary person would probably have to work for over 20 years without eating or drinking to earn this much.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao continued, "Additionally, I also have a small gift prepared on behalf of my father for the elder clan leader and the other clan elders."</p><p></p><p>So generous! So magnanimous!</p><p></p><p>He must be a wealthy tycoon!</p><p></p><p>Xu Guotai found it hard to believe: "This, this... this is too extravagant. You've just returned to the country, you shouldn't be so lavish."</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao smiled and comforted him, "Don't worry, this is nothing for my father. It's just a small token of appreciation. As a newcomer to this land, I will need the care and guidance of the clan elders and seniors in the future."</p><p></p><p>Nothing? Just how wealthy is Xu Qingshan?</p><p></p><p>Xu Guotai smiled with wrinkles all over his face: "Good, good, you're such a good child!"</p><p></p><p>The next day, the banquet was held in a lively and bustling manner.</p><p></p><p>In those days, the staple food for the poor families was bran and millet, and even the better-off villagers often gathered tender tree leaves, elm nuts, and wild vegetables, steaming or stir-frying them with corn flour, which was not only difficult to swallow but also very hard on the stomach.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao provided thousands of pounds of rice, allowing everyone to eat to their heart's content, causing an uproar that can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>The banquet lasted for three days. Neighboring villages were also invited.</p><p></p><p>Many villagers did not hesitate to walk dozens of miles, bringing their whole families, just to have a few bowls of hot, oily rice!</p><p></p><p>In those days, the common people not only lacked material enjoyment, but their spiritual enjoyment was also extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao also specially spent 50 silver dollars to invite a famous local opera troupe to perform for three days, enveloping the entire village in an atmosphere more lively and festive than the New Year.</p><p></p><p>The happiest one was the elder clan leader, Xu Guotai. He found Xu Xiao, this young man, more and more likable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao had successfully gained his identity and established his image. Even the county magistrate specially sent someone to express his congratulations to the Xu family village.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Xu Xiao felt the prompts from the stone tablet:</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>A homecoming with a three-day banquet had directly earned him 20 reputation points! The experience bar for his reputation level was directly filled by 20%!</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao was naturally overjoyed. This was indeed the correct way to acquire reputation. Reputation, it seems, was just positive fame.</p><p></p><p>In the future, the more he did in this world, the higher his reputation level would be, and the more blessings it would bring.</p><p></p><p>After the banquet ended, Xu Xiao distributed the remaining rice and flour to the villagers of Xu family village. He also bought beef, mutton, pork, shrimp, crab, grouper, and fine yellow wine, and laid out a sumptuous family feast, specifically inviting the clan elders.</p><p></p><p>"The Xu family village hasn't been this prosperous for a long time. This time, we've really benefited from Xiao's grace. Uncle Xu, I'll drink to you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai, representing the elder clan leader, raised a toast to Xu Xiao: "You have studied abroad and are a learned and capable person. In the future, when you start your business, please take care of the younger generation of the Xu family. If there is anything we can be of help, please don't hesitate to let us know!"</p><p></p><p>After a few days, the timing was ripe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao felt that he could now discuss the real matter.</p><p></p><p>He said, "You all should know that the court is tottering and a great chaos may break out at any time. We should prepare early to cope with the troubled times, especially to ensure that the Xu family can live well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>The current situation was on the verge of chaos, yet a noble young man could give up his comfortable life abroad and return to the country to settle down and care for his fellow villagers. This was truly admirable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guotai, with tears in his eyes, said, "Xiao, although I am not a great figure, I do have some connections and influence in this local area, and the Xu family is united as one. We will certainly give you our full support!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai said, "Yes, just tell us if you need any help. As long as we can do it, we will not refuse!"</p><p></p><p>The Xu clan was not stupid. This was a heavenly bestowed golden thigh! How could they not cling to it tightly?! (End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng immediately offered to help: "Mr. Yu, your vision is truly extraordinary. The mansions in Xiguan are the most prestigious residences in the provincial capital. However, Xiguan covers a large area with many streets and alleys. The areas available will vary greatly depending on different budgets."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Regarding the budget, there are no limits. I only seek the best houses. If we can acquire neighboring properties as well, that would be even better!"</p><p></p><p>Expensive? That word wasn't in his dictionary.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't find that word!</p><p></p><p>He was prepared to directly buy three to five or even eight houses.</p><p></p><p>This would provide convenient living while also increasing security. </p><p></p><p>The extra houses could also be used to accommodate trusted associates and subordinates, laying a better foundation for his future development in the provincial capital!</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time he had seen someone buy houses like this.</p><p></p><p>How was this any different from shopping at a vegetable market? Those were prestigious Xiguan mansions that symbolized status and nobility! Chen Tingfeng hurriedly said: "I will do my utmost to inquire. If I discover any suitable properties, I will notify you immediately..."</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao said: "That efficiency is too low. I have a better method."</p><p></p><p>A better method? What method? The residents of Xiguan mansions were either from prominent families and high officials, or wealthy merchants and tycoons. How could such houses be easily bought? Every inch of land in Xiguan was worth its weight in gold. Whether one could buy a good house required a bit of fate.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao did not explain his method.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao saw that Ru Qian and the maid both looked tired.</p><p></p><p>Although touring the provincial capital felt fresh and exciting, it was ultimately a very physically demanding activity, especially for ordinary people without martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>"Ru Qian, don't we have an appointment?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we have an appointment with the owner of Guangfu Old Wine. We plan to visit the winery in the next couple days to discuss the acquisition."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded: "Good. Since we have business to attend to, let's find a place to rest early. What are some good hotels nearby?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng immediately suggested: "There are many luxury hotels near Changdi. You can also enjoy the night view of the Pearl River."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>The day tour ended.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had Ru Qian and the others go check in to the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Yu Xiao had a cup of coffee by the riverside.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun cast its glow on the river's surface, a cool breeze blew, and the water sparkled.</p><p></p><p>Flower boats sailed by one after another, brightly lit and with melodious music. Songstresses danced gracefully, and the gentle tones of Cantonese opera could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Along the riverside, neon lights of various colors gradually lit up the shops. The coffee shop was filled with people in suits and ties, and a foreigner in a tailcoat was playing the piano.</p><p></p><p>When the piano and Cantonese opera echoed each other in the distance,</p><p></p><p>There was a dizzying sense of time displacement.</p><p></p><p>This ancient city, standing at the crossroads of history, truly embodied contradictions and integration everywhere. Western popular elements and Eastern traditional culture could be seen all around.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao took out a 10 yuan silver note and handed it to Chen Tingfeng: "A small token of appreciation, consider it payment for your trouble."</p><p></p><p>10 yuan! Chen Tingfeng's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>This was three months' salary for him! "Mr. Yu... I can't possibly accept this..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. I'll be troubling you again in the coming days, Mr. Chen."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's tone was calm but had an undeniable forcefulness. Chen Tingfeng stopped refusing, as he indeed needed the money right now.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu, if you need anything, as long as I can help, I won't refuse!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Money makes the world go round.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes spending a little extra money can bring a lot of convenience.</p><p></p><p>"What Mr. Yu saw today were the most prosperous areas of Xiguan and Nanguan. However, beneath the flourishing and beautiful exterior, the provincial capital also has many gruesome and bloody aspects."</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng solemnly warned: "Please be careful, sir."</p><p></p><p>Yangcheng.</p><p></p><p>Visited by people from all nations.</p><p></p><p>Thriving in commerce and trade.</p><p></p><p>An unparalleled pearl of the south.</p><p></p><p>But it would be too superficial to only see the prosperous and beautiful facade without seeing the piles of corpses underneath.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this city, 80-90% of the population was still struggling to make a living. Poverty and opium addiction ravaged every corner, with millions of ordinary people racking their brains and exerting all their efforts just to survive.</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng hesitated slightly and lowered his voice, saying: "Especially the three gangs and four clans, large foreign companies, Western nobles, and certain corrupt officials..."</p><p></p><p>Interesting.</p><p></p><p>This basic intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already investigated and clarified it in advance.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that Chen Tingfeng could tell him these things showed that this person was not someone who only cared about money and profit. On the contrary, it made Yu Xiao regard him more highly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao, along with Yu Ruqian, Chen Tingfeng, and two bodyguards, Tang Yang and Wang Zhong, took a horse-drawn carriage to the East Gate.</p><p></p><p>Although automobiles were available as a means of transportation in those days, buying and maintaining them was inconvenient, as were most road conditions. So their display value was higher than their practical value, and horse-drawn carriages were still relied upon for longer journeys.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sat in the carriage with nothing to do.</p><p></p><p>So he asked, "Has Mr. Chen heard of this Guangfu Old Wine?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng quickly replied, "Of course, Guangfu Old Wine has a long history that can be traced back to the previous dynasty, over 300 years ago. It's one of the oldest wineries in Guangyue Province with the most historical heritage."</p><p></p><p>"Guangfu wine was once all the rage, a taste in the memories of many older generations in Yangcheng."</p><p></p><p>"However, it's a great pity that in recent years, due to various problems, Guangfu Old Wine's business has been declining day by day. It's said to be on the verge of bankruptcy."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already made contact with the winery before the new year.</p><p></p><p>This special trip was to acquire this winery.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had brewed spirit rice yellow wine in Mei County, and had successively acquired several wineries. Now all the links were connected, and acquiring Guangfu Old Wine was the final piece.</p><p></p><p>Although Guangfu Old Wine was poorly managed and on the verge of bankruptcy, it still had extremely high name recognition, with both its brand and sales channels ready-made.</p><p></p><p>As long as he bought this winery.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao would use Guangfu Old Wine's influence to launch a spirit wine brand, hype it up as a unique luxury brand, and in turn revitalize the stagnant Guangfu Old Wine.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the wineries under his name were working overtime.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Guangfu winery was in hand, multiple new products could be launched immediately, quickly occupying the provincial capital's market.</p><p></p><p>Whether this business was profitable or not.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>He just needed the identity of an industrialist, and also needed an entry point to enter the industry and control more social resources.</p><p></p><p>The provincial capital was not like Mei County.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed more resources and opportunities.</p><p></p><p>But the forces were deeply entrenched, and the waters were really too deep.</p><p></p><p>If Mei County was a small pond, then the provincial capital was truly a great river and lake. Therefore, establishing oneself here couldn't be as simple and crude as in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had two goals.</p><p></p><p>The first goal: Create his own force first!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao planned to use martial arts schools as an entry point, controlling all the martial arts schools in the provincial capital in the shortest time, thus forming a powerful martial force no less than the three gangs and four clans.</p><p></p><p>The provincial capital had numerous martial arts schools.</p><p></p><p>There was no shortage of nationally renowned first and second-grade ancient martial arts masters!</p><p></p><p>If they could truly be united into one force, it would be a powerful strength that any party would be wary of. It would not only be enough for Yu Xiao to establish himself in the provincial capital but also greatly help his martial arts cultivation! As for the second goal: naturally, it was to create the identity of an industrialist.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use this to enter true high society, control enough social resources, and strengthen his reputation, thus making it more convenient to achieve other goals.</p><p></p><p>For example, using various channels to buy and gather large amounts of spirit herbs and medicines to better aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Another example was Yu Xiao's plan to control a foreign firm, laying out in advance in other countries and colonies around the world, in order to spread his business and influence globally in the future, as well as obtain resources needed for cultivation from all corners of the globe.</p><p></p><p>The above.</p><p></p><p>Required time and patience.</p><p></p><p>For now, let's start with acquiring Guangfu Old Wine.</p><p></p><p>Let himself become the "Yellow Wine King" first!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

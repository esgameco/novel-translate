        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Back to the main world.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao returned to his tattered robe.</p><p></p><p>The dilapidated wooden hut was bare and empty.</p><p></p><p>Damp, cold, and permeated with a musty smell.</p><p></p><p>In the grand world, he was a young and talented overseas returnee, wealthy and extravagant, able to spend money freely.</p><p></p><p>But in the main world, he was still a common person at the bottom of society, insignificant like an ant.</p><p></p><p>However, he was clear-headed and would not indulge in temporary pleasures. Only by striving and progressing could he see more of the world, otherwise, he would end up as nothing more than a dried-up skeleton in a grave when his lifespan was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The 100-fold time difference was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>He had stayed in the grand world for more than a month, but in the main world, it was only the next morning, not even daybreak yet.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the time flow in the grand world would also be slowed down by 100 times.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao sat on the bed that emanated a musty smell, and he began to consider his next plan.</p><p></p><p>First, he still had to work as a miner. Earning thirty taels of gold per day was not bad. This could be exchanged for three thousand silver yuan in the grand world, an amount that ordinary people could not earn in a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Yu Xiao truly cared about was not the gold. During his time in the grand world, he had purchased a lot of daily necessities, including soap, refined salt, and white sugar.</p><p></p><p>These basic living supplies were not very valuable in an industrialized society, but in the "Baiyun Fang" deep in the mountains, where there were no towns for miles around, they were scarce. A few taels of coarse salt could be exchanged for dozens of taels of gold, so there was no need to work hard in the mines just for a bit of gold! He would continue to work as a miner.</p><p></p><p>The main reasons were twofold.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he could not leave yet. This spiritual mine was the industry of the Qinglan Valley, the largest Taoist sect in the area for thousands of miles. As an outer disciple worker, Yu Xiao was brought here from far away and could not come and go as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>Miners needed five spiritual stones to redeem themselves. For every thirty spiritual stones mined, they could earn one as a reward. Calculating an average of three spiritual stones mined per month, the most they could earn in a year was one spiritual stone. It would take at least five years to save up the redemption fee.</p><p></p><p>Once redeemed, the past five years would have been wasted. But that couldn't be the end, right? He still needed to save up travel expenses and retirement money. Most miners would grit their teeth and continue working, but the hazardous mine environment often left those who managed to return home with injuries and illnesses.</p><p></p><p>The second reason was that Yu Xiao did not want to leave. Although the interdimensional gate had been opened, maintaining its activation required the consumption of ten spiritual stones per year, which was not a small amount for him.</p><p></p><p>As the hardest currency in the cultivation world, one spiritual stone could easily be exchanged for two thousand taels of gold, but a few thousand taels of gold might not necessarily be able to buy a single spiritual stone. There were very few ways for ordinary people to acquire spiritual stones.</p><p></p><p>While Yu Xiao could sell a large number of daily necessities and crafts from the grand world, he dared not openly collect spiritual stones. As the saying goes, "Wealth should not be revealed." If people knew he had spiritual stones, he would have to sleep with one eye open and walk on eggshells every day.</p><p></p><p>Low-key! Survive!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual mine was still the safest and most hidden way to collect spiritual stones. As long as he only handed over one-tenth or one-fifth of the mined stones, the rest could be secretly stored in his spatial ring, and no one would suspect or know about it.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could maintain the interdimensional gate and accumulate a nest egg for future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I can't give up the job. I need to learn martial arts quickly and also collect some local specialties to bring to the grand world."</p><p></p><p>Baiyun Fang was not only home to a large number of miners but also many wandering cultivators and nearby mountain dwellers.</p><p></p><p>These wandering cultivators generally had low cultivation and aptitude, but they came to Baiyun Fang for two reasons: the abundant spiritual qi around the spiritual mine was suitable for cultivation, and they hoped to join the Qinglan Valley sect through the "Ascension Assembly" held once every few years.</p><p></p><p>Among them were practitioners who cultivated the martial path. In the main world, they might be the lowest-level wandering cultivators, but in the grand world, they were typically mid-level or even master-level experts.</p><p></p><p>If Yu Xiao could learn from these people, he would quickly gain the ability to defend himself in the grand world. And with the 100-fold time difference between the two worlds, he believed he could also attract attention in the main world, thereby gaining the opportunity to change his fate.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, several hours had passed.</p><p></p><p>The morning light appeared, and the sky gradually brightened.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious and vast cultivation world entered daylight once again.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao stopped thinking and left the small hut. The nearby miners were also gradually going out, everyone wearing dirty and tattered clothes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tattered and worn-out jacket, disheveled hair, sallow complexion, and bloodshot eyes - they looked like a group of walking corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yu-ge, you're here quite early today. Hot buns, would you like a piece?"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man in his forties, with rough skin, emerged from the neighboring shack, holding a few blackened buns and offering one to him, his face full of simple kindness.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Uncle Chen, I've already eaten."</p><p></p><p>Chen Shi was a veteran miner of nearly ten years. He was a genuinely caring person and one of the few co-workers with whom Yu Xiao could have a conversation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Shi had already earned enough to buy his freedom and save up for his retirement and his children's future, but he chose to stay at the Baiyun Fang mine, hoping to accumulate more spirit stones to provide his children with cultivation opportunities.</p><p></p><p>In his own words, this was all he had in this life, but he hoped his children could live with more dignity.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Little Yu-ge, you've been looking well lately."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had been living in the Grand Spiritual World for a month, so of course, his complexion would be good. He had done his best to mess up his hair and darken his face, but it seemed he couldn't hide it.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, I've managed to get some good stuff recently."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of stuff?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao returned to his room and brought out a small bag, handing it to Chen Shi.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, what are you being so mysterious about? Let me see what good thing you have here."</p><p></p><p>Chen Shi opened the bag and found a white powder. He took a pinch and put it in his mouth, his eyes suddenly lighting up. "Ah, good salt!"</p><p></p><p>Salt was an essential commodity, especially for those engaged in heavy physical labor. This small bag of salt, while not a rare item, still held considerable value.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, you've taken good care of me, so I've saved a bit for you. Please don't tell anyone else."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's very thoughtful of you. I've been hoarding some old wine that I haven't had the heart to drink. How about we have a drink together after work today?"</p><p></p><p>"Sounds good!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>They joined the queue to enter the mine. A new day's work had begun.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao shouldered his mining basket, put on his dust mask, and picked up his pickaxe.</p><p></p><p>The spirit stone mine was massive, and each miner had their own independent mining slot, so they had little interaction with each other during the arduous work, which left them exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Swinging the pickaxe, he began striking the rock wall. The gray-white stones that emitted a faint glow were the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>First, they would use the large pickaxe to remove the ordinary rock and soil, exposing the spirit stones containing spiritual energy. Then, they would use the specially-made small pickaxe and hammer to crush the stones, finally loading the fragments into the baskets to be taken out.</p><p></p><p>The spirit stones contained various energies, some of which were highly unstable. If struck too forcefully, they could cause explosions or release toxic fumes. This was why the mining had to be done manually, as it required both physical strength and meticulous technique.</p><p></p><p>Ding-dong, ding-dong!</p><p></p><p>The work was incredibly monotonous, but Yu Xiao had already grown accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>By the morning, he had mined two hundred pounds of spirit stone fragments. Perhaps due to his recent better diet, he didn't feel as exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He started to slow down his pace, not wanting to draw unnecessary attention by mining too much.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the rock wall was cracked by the iron pickaxe, and a soft white light shone through the fissure.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's eyes widened, and after ensuring no one was around, he carefully pried it open with his iron gloves. A white crystal the size of a quail egg appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I'm so lucky!"</p><p></p><p>The crystallized spirit energy within the spirit stones was called a natural spirit stone. These special crystal structures had a fixed size, not too large or too small, making them the standard currency in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he pocketed it.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was in a great mood. Once he had gathered three hundred pounds of spirit stones, he would slack off until the end of the shift.</p><p></p><p>As he was carrying his basket out of the dark mine tunnel, he noticed a crowd gathered ahead, seemingly observing something.</p><p></p><p>Another accident?</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to ask. Yu Xiao knew what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stone mining was a dangerous task, and accidents happened frequently, with casualties being a common occurrence. This time, he heard a phrase that made his face change: "It's Old Chen!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen is dead!"</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

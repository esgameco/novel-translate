        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cups and plates were shattered all over the floor.</p><p></p><p>Liu Yonggui was furious.</p><p></p><p>The maids and servants were too scared to even breathe.</p><p></p><p>This was the old master Liu of Xiaohe Town, whose family had been the big landlords of the town for three generations. Even the county magistrates had to show him respect, and it would not be an exaggeration to call him the "soil emperor" of this small piece of land.</p><p></p><p>For many years, he had bullied men and oppressed women, exploiting and extorting. </p><p></p><p>Who in the ten-mile radius did not both respect and fear him? Recently, a young upstart had dared to challenge him, which was unacceptable. If he could not swallow this humiliation, how could he continue to lord over and terrorize as the old master Liu?</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man walked in. </p><p></p><p>It was Liu Yonggui's eldest son, Liu Fuyuan.</p><p></p><p>He whispered in his father's ear: "Second Master Zheng has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Yonggui's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He immediately dismissed the servants around him.</p><p></p><p>"Invite him in!"</p><p></p><p>That young man surnamed Yu had money and influence, and his recent actions had earned him a good reputation in the ten-mile radius. Moreover, he had the backing of the Yu clan of over a thousand people, so it would not be wise to openly confront him.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Liu thought he had a better, more decisive solution.</p><p></p><p>For example, </p><p></p><p>to collaborate with the Shihuzhai bandits.</p><p></p><p>Shihuzhai was a notorious bandit stronghold known for miles around, led by the "Panther of the Mountains" who was highly skilled in martial arts and extremely ruthless, having raided villages and killed at least a hundred people. Among his underlings were also some fierce characters.</p><p></p><p>For example,</p><p></p><p>the man who just walked in, removing his hat and veil to reveal an ugly, scarred face.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying.</p><p></p><p>Whose real name was Zheng Jianshan.</p><p></p><p>He was the second-in-command of the Shihuzhai bandits.</p><p></p><p>Not only was he an excellent marksman, he also had formidable eagle claw kung fu, able to crush skulls with his bare hands, making him one of the top fighters in the Shihuzhai bandit gang.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Old Master Liu, you've come to the right people this time!" Zheng Laoying said smugly.</p><p></p><p>"How confident are you, Second Master?" Liu asked.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying sneered, "He's just a rich young master. We have experience dealing with this kind of fat sheep. With my seventh-rank kung fu, there's no one in Mei County who can stop me. And the five brothers I brought from the stronghold are all top-notch fighters too, plus with Old Master Liu's cooperation and cover, it's foolproof!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Yonggui was delighted: "As long as you can take care of this young man, I'll find a way to secretly liquidate his family assets, and we'll split it evenly between our two families without anyone knowing!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Zheng Laoying's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Yu's reputation had been rising lately. </p><p></p><p>This fat sheep was too high-profile, so why not slaughter him?</p><p></p><p>Although Young Master Yu might have a powerful background overseas, his local support was just a bunch of ordinary villagers. </p><p></p><p>Even if they were fierce, they were still just common folk. If the bandits hid in the mountains after killing him, how could the authorities catch them? Even if the government organized a manhunt, it would be hard to eliminate these hidden bandits in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>The only trouble was:</p><p></p><p>How to sneak in undetected, and how to dispose of the evidence and divide the assets afterwards.</p><p></p><p>But Old Master Liu was the biggest local tyrant, having collaborated with Shihuzhai before. Now that he also had a grudge against Yu Xiao, using him to provide convenience, it was 100% guaranteed to succeed!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That night.</p><p></p><p>Dark and windy.</p><p></p><p>Six bandits appeared near Yu's manor.</p><p></p><p>"Second Master, is this it? Sure enough, a fat sheep living in such a nice mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"But the mansion can't be taken away!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't be taken away? Then let's just burn it down!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, if we can't have it, no one else will enjoy it either!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying: "After we go in, we'll tie up the Yu guy first, then take him to the storehouse to get the money. Once we have the money and the deed, we'll slaughter him. </p><p></p><p>As for the other troublesome people? Not a single one will be left, they'll all be eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After the bandits finished planning, they put on face masks and quickly scaled the wall, heading towards the inner courtyard. Suddenly, a cold voice came from above.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, arriving unannounced in the dead of night, that doesn't seem quite right, does it?"</p><p></p><p>The bandits were all startled. </p><p></p><p>They hadn't noticed when a middle-aged man in a long robe, looking pensive and elegant, had taken a standing position on the eaves, looking down at the uninvited guests below.</p><p></p><p>"Mistake, wrong place!"</p><p></p><p>"But your attire doesn't seem like that of someone who would get lost."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Laoying's eyes flashed with ruthlessness, and he drew the pistol from his waist, ready to strike first and kill before the other could react!</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought!</p><p></p><p>As soon as he drew his gun, a willow leaf dart flew through his palm.</p><p></p><p>Old Eagle Zheng immediately let out a pig-like scream of agony. </p><p></p><p>His gun also slipped from his hand and fell several meters away.</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>It was completely impossible to see the hand that released it!</p><p></p><p>This was a true master!</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The other five bandits also had guns.</p><p></p><p>They immediately drew their handguns, ready to open fire.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang swiftly released two more darts - the bandits hadn't even managed to fire a single shot before two more of them were hit, one in the throat and one in the heart, falling without even a groan.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three bandits hurriedly opened fire.</p><p></p><p>Bang, bang, bang! All the shots hit the eaves of the house.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang's figure vanished like a ghost, evading the gunfire. He then launched two more projectiles in mid-air, hitting the two remaining men. Afterwards, he lightly leapt from the rooftop, running vertically along the 90-degree wall, and propelled himself towards the last bandit.</p><p></p><p>He first twisted the man's right hand. </p><p></p><p>Then he struck him hard in the chest.</p><p></p><p>The bandit was knocked back, slamming into the courtyard wall and losing consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Old Eagle Zheng was now staring in horrified amazement. The five skilled men he had brought were all taken down in just a moment. This person's kung fu must be at least at the fifth level! Damn it!</p><p></p><p>To have such a high-level master! </p><p></p><p>Liu didn't even mention him! Zheng was now filled with both hatred and fury, but he didn't have time to avenge his men. He immediately turned and fled towards the main gate, only to be blocked by a towering, burly man.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of my way!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng drew a short axe and brought it down hard on the man.</p><p></p><p>Facing the powerful, heavy strike, Wang Zhong easily avoided it, but he didn't dodge - he just slightly tilted his head, letting the axe hit his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It struck, but it was as if he had hit a rock wrapped in cowhide.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong's body surged with energy. He suddenly stepped forward and rammed into Zheng, sending him and the axe flying back into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Iron cloth armor?!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng fearfully noticed that the man's shoulder, where the clothes had torn, revealed bronze-colored skin with only an insignificant red mark, no real injury.</p><p></p><p>Iron cloth armor was extremely renowned. </p><p></p><p>There were not few who cultivated it.</p><p></p><p>But to be able to withstand blades and axes was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>This person not only had mastered the iron cloth armor, but his inner energy must also be at least at the fifth level! </p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Even at the sixth level, one would be a top master in Mei County. </p><p></p><p>Fifth level or above - not just in Mei County, but in the entire Guangyue Province, they would be elite experts! </p><p></p><p>Yet in this small town, in this little Surplus Manor, there were two of them!</p><p></p><p>How could this make any sense?</p><p></p><p>There was no explanation for this!</p><p></p><p>The commotion soon drew the attention of others in the manor.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of several senior disciples, Young Master Yu Xiao emerged from the main house.</p><p></p><p>Six bandits were already dead or seriously injured, except for Zheng and one skinny bandit whom Tang Yang had intentionally left alive as a captive.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu, get the details!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang stepped forward to report: "They are bandits from Stone Tiger Stronghold, hired by Liu Changgui."</p><p></p><p>"What? Lord Liu?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Ruotan let out a shrill cry.</p><p></p><p>He angrily said, "That old man actually dared to hire bandits to go after Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>Although they had conflicting interests, it was far from a life-or-death struggle, and no one had expected such ruthless actions. Fortunately, Young Master Yu Xiao had made preparations in advance.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was not angry, but pleased: "Good, this is them actively coming to my doorstep and handing me a knife!"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to continue expanding his influence.</p><p></p><p>He needed to stir up a major incident to completely control the small town of Hejiang.</p><p></p><p>And Lord Liu, as the largest landowner in Hejiang, was an obstacle.</p><p></p><p>If the other party was still around, it would not be easy to move against him in the short term, as Liu had considerable local power, and Yu Xiao had to consider his own reputation and influence, not wanting to appear too tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>But now, the fact that they dared to collude with bandits and hire assassins - this was an excellent opportunity with a righteous cause!</p>

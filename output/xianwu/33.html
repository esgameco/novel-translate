        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing claimed to be a member of the Daxia Society.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had seen news about this organization in the newspaper more than once.</p><p></p><p>The Daxia Society.</p><p></p><p>Also known as the Xia Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The Daxia Tiandi Society.</p><p></p><p>This was a patriotic organization jointly initiated by intellectuals both at home and abroad to save the country.</p><p></p><p>In the past twenty years, the empire had rapidly weakened and was forced to sign numerous humiliating treaties that surrendered rights.</p><p></p><p>After Western powers forced open the doors of the Great Jing Empire with their powerful ships and cannons, they began to strut around arrogantly on this ancient land.</p><p></p><p>Concessions were forcibly established in various places, allowing foreigners to act as superior beings.</p><p></p><p>And opium dens spread like tumors, constantly growing and metastasizing.</p><p></p><p>Internally, the imperial court was corrupt and incompetent, while land annexation by the wealthy was extremely severe. The common people had no land of their own, yet had to bear all kinds of harsh taxes and levies, living in misery every day.</p><p></p><p>The country was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>The rivers and mountains were shattered.</p><p></p><p>How could this not make people angry? Thus, revolutionary ideas for renewal were on the rise!</p><p></p><p>The slogans and goals of the Daxia Society included: "Oppose the imperial system, equalize land ownership, equalize human rights", "Expel the foreign invaders, revive the Great Xia", and so on.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yu Xiao reassessed this man:</p><p></p><p>"For a county magistrate like Mr. Ye to join the Daxia Society is already extraordinary news. And now he's even extending an invitation to someone like me who owns thousands of acres of land. This seems..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Daxia Society's program, one could tell their nature.</p><p></p><p>This was an organization that opposed the emperor and the landlord class who lived off others' labor.</p><p></p><p>And Yu Xiao happened to be a big landlord!</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing laughed heartily: "Although I'm not very learned, I do have some skill in judging people."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you own thousands of acres of land and appear to be a big landlord, but in reality you never covet tenant rents. Instead, you reduce and exempt rents, establish charitable schools and relief halls. These are actually actions against landlords, for equalizing land ownership and human rights!"</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I believe!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu deeply understands righteousness."</p><p></p><p>"You are one of our like-minded companions!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Xiao felt somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>It was true that he had done good deeds.</p><p></p><p>But deeply understanding righteousness and sacrificing himself for others? He didn't have such a high level of consciousness - at least not now! After all, he had only descended into this world for a few months at most. How could he have developed any strong sense of belonging in such a short time? Although he couldn't be called someone who sought fame and profit, his starting point for everything was still his own reputation and interests.</p><p></p><p>At most, he did some easy good deeds.</p><p></p><p>He intervened when he saw things he disapproved of.</p><p></p><p>Do the good that's right in front of you.</p><p></p><p>Punish the evil that's right in front of you.</p><p></p><p>That's all.</p><p></p><p>But in Ye Biqing's eyes, Yu Xiao was indeed perfect.</p><p></p><p>He had no ties to the imperial court, had long lived abroad with more advanced thinking, possessed abundant wealth, and his reputation was growing day by day.</p><p></p><p>This time, in suppressing the bandits at Shihu Stronghold, he had fully displayed his intelligence, bravery and exceptional abilities. Therefore, even though there were some risks, Ye Biqing still wanted to personally reveal his identity and invite this man.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"You have seen it!"</p><p></p><p>"This land is decaying and rotting, covered in wounds. Only through great destruction and rebuilding can it be reborn!"</p><p></p><p>"I deeply know the dangers of this matter, but if we don't do it, our descendants will have to!"</p><p></p><p>"If we don't shed blood, our descendants will have to shed even more!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing's gaze was firm as he said: "The enlightened members of the Daxia Society are now spread throughout the country in all walks of life. For the sake of our nation's righteousness, we are all willing to dedicate our lives to gamble on a future!"</p><p></p><p>The Daxia Society's ultimate goal!</p><p></p><p>Was to overthrow the Great Jing Empire!</p><p></p><p>They were accumulating strength, waiting for an opportunity! Upon hearing Ye Biqing's words and feeling his passion,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao couldn't help but feel a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Jing was similar to the modern era of his previous life, it was after all not the same world.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in Ye Biqing, Yu Xiao saw some similar vivid figures that touched him somewhat.</p><p></p><p>For such righteous people, Yu Xiao held respect in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of rebelling and overthrowing the emperor,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was certainly very interested.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside talk of righteousness, what could gain more prestige and gather more fortune than overthrowing an empire and establishing a brand new country?</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p></p><p>To Ye Biqing's invitation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao firmly declared: "I will not join the Great Xia Society!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing's face was full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is dangerous, with an uncertain future. It was indeed inappropriate for me to rashly extend an invitation..."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, please let me finish. Although I won't join the Great Xia Society, I agree with its actions and am willing to provide free assistance within my capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao continued: "In fact, there has never been only one way to save the country and revitalize the nation. Relying solely on overthrowing the Great Jing imperial system may not necessarily bring new life to this land, and might even make the situation worse."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "I'd like to hear more."</p><p></p><p>Since he was considered a righteous person, he might as well maintain this image, as it would make things more convenient in the future.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao calmly explained: "The logic is very simple!"</p><p></p><p>"Overthrowing the Jing court and expelling the Tatars."</p><p></p><p>"Relies not on words but on guns and cannons."</p><p></p><p>"But where will your guns come from, and where will your cannons come from?"</p><p></p><p>"And after overthrowing the old country and establishing a new one, when everything needs to be rebuilt, how will you ensure healthcare, employment, transportation, and guarantee that the country becomes strong and wealthy, not falling behind the West again?"</p><p></p><p>"If the country is riddled with holes and in ruins, and external enemies take advantage of the weakness to invade, how will you deal with that then?"</p><p></p><p>"Destruction is often easier than construction."</p><p></p><p>"But someone always has to do the construction."</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His eyes lit up, suddenly realizing, and he became excited again.</p><p></p><p>This land not only urgently needs to overthrow the decaying empire, but also needs education, industry, enlightenment of the people, and development of practical industries! The former is very important.</p><p></p><p>The latter is also very important.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even more important.</p><p></p><p>The former is just removing the disease.</p><p></p><p>While the latter can make the body strong.</p><p></p><p>We must build while destroying, only then can we enrich the country and strengthen the people, keep up with the trends of the times and stand firm in the world! The Great Xia Society is mainly doing the former, while Mr. Yu Xiao's return to invest in practical industries is clearly focusing on the latter.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing bowed deeply: "Sir, you are truly righteous!"</p><p></p><p>"I have no interest in military or political affairs, so I won't actively participate or publicly join your movement."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "All I can do is provide necessary support, and this must be based on the premise that the Great Xia Society is worthy of assistance."</p><p></p><p>He paused.</p><p></p><p>Then emphasized: "Please remember your own mission and principles. If one day the Great Xia Society deviates from its original intentions or the tide turns against it, I will withdraw without hesitation and support a second Great Xia Society."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao won't personally join.</p><p></p><p>But he can provide support in terms of finances and resources.</p><p></p><p>This is also a way to protect himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, who knows if the Great Xia Society will succeed? Getting too deeply involved.</p><p></p><p>Might lead to trouble.</p><p></p><p>If in the future the Great Xia Society truly gains momentum and has a chance to achieve great things.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao will let his subordinates, adopted sons, and clan members join, while he only needs to observe the situation's development and provide some help when necessary.</p><p></p><p>Deep in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A small hope that couldn't be shared with others was also stirring.</p><p></p><p>He hoped that the world's development trajectory would align with his will and ideas.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps more than a hundred years later, this world could approach a familiar appearance, maybe even become more perfect and powerful than the once-familiar world.</p><p></p><p>That world.</p><p></p><p>Probably can't be returned to.</p><p></p><p>Having a similar substitute.</p><p></p><p>Might also slightly alleviate homesickness! Late at night.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao personally went out to see them off.</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing and Gao Zhi got into the carriage to return.</p><p></p><p>Gao Zhi couldn't help asking: "Mr. Ye, you couldn't recruit Yu Xiao, why are you still so happy?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing: "Haha, there's no more worries now, because even if the Great Xia Society fails, I believe the country and the nation can still be saved, after all, there are people like Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

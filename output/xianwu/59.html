        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This ginseng had a complete structure with numerous roots, was pale golden all over, and had a faint, fresh fragrance.</p><p></p><p>"Please take a look."</p><p></p><p>"No need to inspect it further."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said directly: "Name your price!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu is indeed a straightforward person. Since that's the case, I won't beat around the bush either."</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu said: "Years ago, when the father of Zhang, who was then Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, fell seriously ill, he paid 30,000 silver dollars for a thousand-year-old ginseng to prolong his father's life... This ginseng in our shop is in perfect condition and of even better quality than that one. It's worth at least 30,000 yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the quoted price, Yu Ruqian and Lei Changfeng sharply inhaled.</p><p></p><p>A single medicinal herb selling for 30,000 yuan? That would be enough to buy thousands of acres of good farmland in the countryside and become a major landlord! Yu Xiao remained completely unfazed.</p><p></p><p>He even felt like laughing.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy contained in this thousand-year ginseng, if placed in the White Cloud Pavilion, would be worth an estimated 150-200 spirit stones. Even with spirit stones in hand, one might not necessarily be able to buy it. The appearance of such cultivation resources is a matter of fate!</p><p></p><p>30,000 yuan!</p><p></p><p>Based on the gold price in the Great Jing world.</p><p></p><p>30,000 yuan was equivalent to only 300 taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>While a single spirit stone was worth at least 1,000 to 2,000 taels of gold.</p><p></p><p>Of course, given the income levels in Great Jing, a laborer in a provincial city would earn only about two yuan a month working themselves to death. They couldn't afford it even if they didn't eat or drink for a thousand years. So this asking price was certainly too high! This world most likely had no cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The greatest value of thousand-year ginseng was in replenishing qi and prolonging life.</p><p></p><p>The reason it could replenish qi and prolong life was purely due to its abundant spiritual energy. During the natural digestion process, although 99% couldn't be absorbed, a tiny amount would nourish the body, thus awakening some of its vitality.</p><p></p><p>Very wasteful.</p><p></p><p>But there was no other way.</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual roots or cultivation, it was impossible to refine spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Even for Yu Xiao, a Qi Condensation cultivator, consuming the ginseng raw and forcibly refining it would lose most of its medicinal effects. Only by refining it into a pill could one maximize absorption and utilization.</p><p></p><p>Although important figures in Great Jing might use thousand-year ginseng to prolong life, its effectiveness and cost-performance ratio were not actually high, and it might not be suitable for all body types. Using the high price paid by former Governor-General Zhang as a comparison was clearly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't haggle, but simply asked: "I heard this ginseng is your shop's prized treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu nodded: "That's right!"</p><p></p><p>"If it's your prized treasure, why are you looking to sell it?"</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a few seconds, Bao Jinyu candidly said: "Baicao Hall has expanded too quickly recently, resulting in a cash shortage. Otherwise, I wouldn't be willing to sell such a rare and precious herb!"</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper Bao is quite forthright!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "How about this - forget about 30,000, I'm willing to pay 50,000 yuan!"</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu was stunned. Although he had quoted 30,000 yuan, his bottom line was actually 20,000 yuan. The extra 10,000 yuan was just room left for negotiation.</p><p></p><p>This young Mr. Yu wasn't playing by the usual rules! Who negotiates like this? Yu Xiao continued: "Of that, 20,000 silver dollars will be for buying the ginseng, and the other 30,000 silver dollars will be to invest and buy shares in Baicao Hall!"</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu's expression changed as he hurriedly said: "Baicao Hall is the Bao family's ancestral business. It absolutely cannot be sold."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said: "Don't worry, I only want a small share. I won't interfere with daily operations, and I can bring huge performance improvements to Baicao Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Well... I'd like to hear the details."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao continued: "First, I'm not only in the alcohol business, but I also plan to greatly expand into the martial arts academy business. In the future, we'll consume at least 100,000 yuan worth of medicinal herbs every month. We have to buy these herbs from somewhere, so why not deepen cooperation with Baicao Hall? It would be a win-win!"</p><p></p><p>"Second, I hope to use Baicao Hall's channels and influence to continue acquiring medicinal herbs. For every transaction of herbs over 300 years old that is facilitated, you can receive 10% of the transaction amount as commission."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shopkeeper Bao's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Buying 100,000 yuan worth of herbs every month? If this was true, it would certainly be an enormous business! However, Shopkeeper Bao was a bit skeptical - what kind of martial arts academy consumed so many herbs? It seemed too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>As for helping Mr. Yu find herbs?</p><p></p><p>With Baicao Hall's capabilities, it certainly wouldn't be</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Difficult! These ancient medicines, often hundreds or thousands of years old, are extremely expensive and involve huge sums of money. If a 10% commission could be obtained on each transaction, it would be a very considerable profit.</p><p></p><p>But the question is: Does he really use so much medicine? At this point, Yu Xiao took out a small bottle of spirit wine and asked Bao Jinyu to taste it.</p><p></p><p>After Bao Jinyu tasted the spirit wine, his concerns were immediately dispelled by half... He felt that Mr. Yu would not only become a famous yellow wine king throughout Guangyue, but even become a national or world wine king.</p><p></p><p>With the quality of this wine,</p><p></p><p>Plus the hype of thousand-year-old ginseng and other medicinal materials,</p><p></p><p>It will soon receive the pursuit of global high society.</p><p></p><p>At least the acquisition of ancient medicinal materials is likely to be reliable.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "I am willing to draft an agreement with Manager Bao. If the medicinal materials I purchase do not reach the predetermined amount, or if I fail to collect all the ancient medicines provided by Baicao Hall, you have the right to propose termination of the contract and request a refund of investment and shares."</p><p></p><p>At this point,</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment,</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu felt there was no reason to refuse, so he happily accepted the proposal.</p><p></p><p>This would both solve the urgent need of the pharmacy and secure a big customer for the future!</p><p></p><p>"It's a pleasure to work with you!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao got the spirit medicine as he wished.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he get the spirit medicine as he wished,</p><p></p><p>He also bought a 15% stake in Baicao Hall for 30,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>This Baicao Hall is not only the largest medicinal shop in Yangcheng, but also one of the largest suppliers of Chinese medicinal materials in Yangcheng, owning several of its own medicinal planting and procurement bases. This investment price is not too expensive.</p><p></p><p>The reason Yu Xiao generously invested in Baicao Hall</p><p></p><p>Was mainly to plant a seed for convenient entry into the pharmaceutical industry in the future.</p><p></p><p>The current shareholding is a bit small.</p><p></p><p>More financing can be added gradually in the future!</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang has already contacted more than a dozen top martial arts masters. Although the negotiations are not going smoothly at present, as long as Yu Xiao copies and sends the secret manuals from the stone hall space, he believes his plan will soon be pushed forward!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao will use money and martial arts as a double bargaining chip.</p><p></p><p>To recruit at least a dozen or twenty martial arts masters to work for him.</p><p></p><p>He will then take over several of the largest martial arts schools in the provincial capital, and then establish a huge martial arts alliance, uniting the scattered martial arts world into a huge force!</p><p></p><p>Once the "Martial Arts Alliance Plan" is implemented,</p><p></p><p>The monthly consumption of medicinal materials will be far more than 100,000 or 200,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Acquiring several small and medium-sized medicinal material shops and investing in several large medicinal material merchants is a natural approach. This is called keeping the profits within one's own circle!</p><p></p><p>That evening,</p><p></p><p>Carrying the thousand-year-old ginseng,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao returned to the main world.</p><p></p><p>[Luck -3!]</p><p></p><p>A small ginseng root caused a high luck consumption of 3 points.</p><p></p><p>If he received thirty to fifty thousand-year-old ginsengs, even if his luck went bankrupt, he wouldn't be able to bring them to Baiyun Fang.</p><p></p><p>Increase income and reduce expenditure! Must increase income and reduce expenditure!</p><p></p><p>How to increase income? Of course, it's to quickly improve reputation, thereby gaining more basic luck growth, as well as trying to promote merit tasks to obtain additional luck supplements.</p><p></p><p>How to reduce expenditure?</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's to avoid unnecessary consumption, and in addition, to improve the efficiency of luck usage.</p><p></p><p>For example, the luck consumed by 100 taels of gold is about the same as 100 taels of gems and diamonds, but the value of the latter is hundreds or even thousands of times that of the former. Giving up the use of gold and using these jewels to exchange for silver can obtain more profit at a smaller cost.</p><p></p><p>This is improving the efficiency of luck usage!</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Unnecessary consumption must be avoided! Some pills can be used in the main world or inside the stone hall, and after the body digests them, then enter the Great Landscape. This way can avoid luck consumption, while the medicinal effects can still work in the Great Landscape - and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>These are all expedient measures.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is to learn to refine pills as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>If one can refine pills oneself, why repeatedly transport medicinal materials?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The signal was received.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaohe Town Militia began their attack.</p><p></p><p>They had expected to encounter a fierce battle of attack and defense.</p><p></p><p>But after Tang Yang took out several sentries and fleeing bandits with hidden weapons,</p><p></p><p>The militia basically entered the stronghold gates without much effort, and didn't even encounter any decent resistance. When these people walked into the mountain fortress, an unforgettable sight appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Shihu Fortress.</p><p></p><p>It was like hell on earth! Corpses were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>These evil bandits.</p><p></p><p>These ruthless killers.</p><p></p><p>All were bleeding from seven orifices, their faces contorted, their deaths miserable and horrifying.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"What on earth happened here!"</p><p></p><p>"Could there be evil spirits in Shihu Fortress? These bandits have finally met their retribution!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, Bai Yajie, as well as Yu Qinghai and the other militiamen from Xiaohe Town, were all shocked to the core, their scalps tingling!</p><p></p><p>"Where's Young Master Yu?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is Young Master Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was worried about Yu Xiao's safety.</p><p></p><p>The doors of the main hall in Shihu Fortress were opened.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look anymore, I'm fine." Yu Xiao appeared directly in front of everyone, leading several dozen blindfolded children. "Not one is missing. Quickly take them down the mountain and return them to their villages!"</p><p></p><p>"Y-Yes... Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces were full of awe and fear.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of Shihu Fortress was his work alone!</p><p></p><p>One man's strength.</p><p></p><p>Had annihilated the entire fortress! This matter was so absurd, completely beyond imagination!</p><p></p><p>And after killing over two hundred bandits, Young Master Yu was unscathed and unperturbed... Such skill, such composure, was truly rare throughout history, making it hard not to admire and respect him!</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong couldn't help but exclaim: "Young Master Yu is truly a hero!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang thought to himself, this accomplished young boss was no ordinary person. Given time, he might soar to great heights and bring huge changes to this world.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie's eyes were full of admiration. A young and handsome man who spent money like water and was decisive in killing - to her, his personal charm was maxed out, practically perfect!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "This fortress is not bad, the facilities are complete, and it's not far from Xiaohe Town. From now on, use it as the militia's base!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Xiaohe Town Militia was originally Yu Xiao's private army.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had occupied Shihu Fortress, in this area, given the current capabilities of the imperial court, they could only turn a blind eye, because the cost of trying to shake their position would be too great. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call them a small local warlord!</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The bandits' corpses were transported down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>They were sent to various county government offices for identification.</p><p></p><p>Because many were wanted criminals from various places.</p><p></p><p>This matter immediately caused a huge sensation in several counties, including Mei County.</p><p></p><p>All fifty hostages were safely rescued, and over thirty women who had been abducted to the fortress were also rescued. Throughout the entire process, not a single person was lost, only a few were injured.</p><p></p><p>The injuries were unrelated to the battle.</p><p></p><p>They were from falling while climbing the mountain at night.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao single-handedly wiped out the Shihu Fortress bandits. This news quickly spread through several counties.</p><p></p><p>Such a legendary feat, an incredible tale, naturally attracted media attention. Many newspapers rushed to print and publish it overnight. Yu Xiao's name spread throughout Jiaying Prefecture and even Guangyue Province!</p><p></p><p>With this,</p><p></p><p>He became truly famous!</p><p></p><p>Because the details of the bandits' demise were unknown,</p><p></p><p>It left room for imagination among the common people.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short days, several versions of the story emerged.</p><p></p><p>There was a lone hero version, and a version where he used strategy to take Shihu Fortress. In the future, it might even be adapted into a drama.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>Xiaohe Town.</p><p></p><p>Was decorated with lanterns and colored banners.</p><p></p><p>Gongs and drums were beaten.</p><p></p><p>Firecrackers sounded non-stop.</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen village heads, community leaders, local gentry, and merchants personally led a procession of several hundred people in an impressive display. They came to express gratitude on behalf of the rescued hostages and women, and also on behalf of the villagers for the achievement in eliminating the bandits.</p><p></p><p>They carried four brand new plaques.</p><p></p><p>With golden characters that read "Bandit-Eliminating Hero", "Protector of the Land and People", "Eternal Merit", and "Everlasting Fame".</p><p></p><p>The procession of several hundred people paraded through the small town with great fanfare for several laps.</p><p></p><p>Only then did they arrive in front of the Yu family compound.</p><p></p><p>They presented the plaques and gifts.</p><p></p><p>It was very ceremonious!</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao felt the villagers were perhaps a bit too enthusiastic, it wasn't a bad thing for him after all. These village heads, local gentry and merchants were all notable figures in the county. Establishing good relationships with them might prove useful someday.</p><p></p><p>So he played the role of gracious host to some extent.</p><p></p><p>It had been three days since the fall of Shihu Fortress.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Xiao checked the ancient temple stone tablet, on which his personal information was as follows:</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao</p><p></p><p>Reputation: 721/1000 (Rising Fame)</p><p></p><p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fate Growth: 2 points per year.</p><p>Current Fate: 89.</p><p></p><p>----</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's current reputation directly soared to over 700 points!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but the growth trend has not stopped. As the news of the Stone Tiger Bandits' destruction further spreads, it's estimated that his reputation could grow by another 200-300 points, possibly even directly challenging the next level! This is too awesome! Guo Shanhu really made things big.</p><p></p><p>It truly was an accidental help to Yu Xiao! There are 89 fate points left.</p><p></p><p>This is because in the process of dealing with the Stone Tiger Bandits, he used the main world's Lightness Talisman, Invisibility Talisman, plus a bottle of Hundred Snake Powder.</p><p></p><p>The Invisibility Talisman in the cultivation world is a basic talisman. This spell only conceals one's form, unable to hide sounds and smells, let alone conceal various auras, so it's actually very easy to see through.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, those with even a bit of cultivation have extremely keen senses, and even possess divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Such low-level spells are meaningless.</p><p></p><p>But in the Stone Tiger Bandit camp, snakes and dragons were mixed, various smells intertwined, and today many outside bandits had also entered.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao used the Invisibility Talisman to become invisible, paired with the Lightness Talisman and the Swallow Step, naturally allowing him to easily enter the bandit camp. The entire process wouldn't be discovered by anyone.</p><p></p><p>The lowest level techniques of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>In this world, it's a dimensional strike! No one could imagine it, so it's also hard to guard against!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao thought that in the future, it would be best to self-study some spells, which would be more cost-effective, to avoid wasting fate points.</p><p></p><p>After the reputation level increased.</p><p></p><p>Fate growth changed from 1 point per year to 2 points.</p><p></p><p>1 point is used to offset the loss of lifespan, leaving 1 point left each year.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But it's still not enough.</p><p></p><p>In this corner of Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Reputation has basically reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>It's time to prepare to expand influence or business.</p><p></p><p>He will start planning the next steps soon, after all, the Great Jing Empire is very large, the provincial capital of Guangyue Province, as well as port cities, magical cities, Jinmen, the capital and other places, are all worth seeing.</p><p></p><p>What is cultivation for, if not to see more scenery?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao has infinite lifespan, experiencing various lives while playing in the world is the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>He won't put the cart before the horse.</p><p></p><p>Turn himself into a cultivation maniac.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was exchanging pleasantries with various wealthy merchants, landlords, and local gentry.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian came in: "Brother Xiao, we received a visiting card, sent from the county office."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p></p><p>Has it alarmed the county office?</p><p></p><p>But it's not surprising.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter is too big! Yu Xiao, in front of everyone, didn't personally look at the visiting card, but let Yu Ruqian read it directly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian opened the visiting card, and a passage of vigorous handwriting appeared before his eyes. He couldn't help but praise, "Good handwriting."</p><p></p><p>Then.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>And read aloud the full text:</p><p></p><p>----</p><p></p><p>Respectfully presented to:</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu Xiao for your esteemed perusal.</p><p></p><p>Due to the rampant bandit problem, the common people could not live in peace. Fortunately, thanks to the wise and virtuous Mr. Yu leading the militia bravely, valiantly eliminating bandits, wiping out the thieves in one fell swoop, returning peace to Mei County, it is truly a blessing for our county and a fortune for the people.</p><p></p><p>I, Ye, humbly serve as the magistrate of Mei County. Upon hearing this victorious news, my heart surged with emotion, difficult to contain. Amidst my admiration, I further thought to personally pay a visit to express thanks.</p><p></p><p>Mencius said: "Those who follow the right path gain many supporters, those who follow the wrong path gain few."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Yu's actions not only demonstrate personal bravery and wisdom but also embody the great righteousness of caring for one's homeland and protecting the peace of the people, truly the pride of our Mei County and a pillar of the country and nation.</p><p></p><p>Although I, Ye, am in charge of this region, I still need to learn much from Mr. Yu regarding the ways of suppressing bandits and pacifying the people.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I specially write this card to inform that tomorrow at noon, I will personally visit your residence along with the county deputy magistrate Gao Zhi, firstly to express thanks in person, and secondly to discuss strategies for local governance.</p><p></p><p>I hope Mr. Yu can spare some time to grant us an audience, to discuss our fellowship and plan for development together.</p><p></p><p>If you would agree, it would be my utmost honor.</p><p></p><p>Sincerely,</p><p></p><p>Ye Biqing, Magistrate of Mei County, respectfully.</p><p></p><p>18th day of the 9th month, 78th year of Emperor Qian of the Great Jing Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>----</p><p></p><p>"It's Magistrate Ye!"</p><p></p><p>"The Magistrate himself wants to personally visit!"</p><p></p><p>County Magistrate, seventh rank official of Great Jing, the top leader of the entire county!</p><p></p><p>County Deputy Magistrate, eighth rank official of Great Jing, the second-in-command of the entire county! Although not considered very high-ranking officials, they are after all the parent officials governing a region, their power and status in the hearts of local people are quite high! The top two leaders personally visiting.</p><p></p><p>In the visiting card.</p><p></p><p>The attitude is extremely humble.</p><p></p><p>Full of flattery.</p><p></p><p>Using flowery words of praise and compliments to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine Young Master Yu's current status in Mei County! Even the county magistrate has to flatter him! How dare these local gentry and merchants not show respect?!</p><p></p><p>----</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please keep reading! The data is not very optimistic, the follow-up reading in the next few days is crucial, especially tomorrow's reading data, everyone please try to keep up with the reading!)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>White Cloud District.</p><p></p><p>Spring Thunder Martial Arts School.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao pushed open the door and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Rich spiritual energy permeated the air in all directions. In terms of natural environment and air quality, this place was far superior to Yang City!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao would be staying here for most of his time in the near future, as he had already met all the conditions for breaking through to the second level of Qi Refinement. He also wanted to take the opportunity to learn the art of alchemy and new spells, which would take some time.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lü!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao arrived at Lü Lingyun's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>She was drying herbs in the yard. Not only was she now one of the Three Friends of Spring Thunder, but she had also become a somewhat famous alchemist in the district, receiving many alchemy commissions every day and keeping very busy!</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, Fellow Daoist Yu..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun looked Yu Xiao up and down.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Is there something off about my appearance today?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't quite put my finger on it. It's probably just my imagination, but I feel like your state has changed quite a bit even though we just saw each other last night."</p><p></p><p>"I guess I just slept particularly well last night!"</p><p></p><p>The speaker meant nothing by it.</p><p></p><p>But the listener took note! Yu Xiao thought he had been very careful.</p><p></p><p>Every time before returning to the two realms, he would tidy himself up thoroughly in the stone hall, restoring himself to the state he was in before crossing over. Someone as unobservant as Wei Biao definitely wouldn't notice any issues.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Lingyun was extremely detail-oriented and saw him every day, so she was bound to occasionally notice some subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>He would have to be even more cautious in the future.</p><p></p><p>It would be best not to stay in one world for too long.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't return for five or six months straight, only about two days would pass here.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation progressed, there would inevitably be subtle changes in his overall aura and state, even if normal people wouldn't think much of it. But it never hurt to be careful!</p><p></p><p>In the future.</p><p></p><p>He would either have to be a loner.</p><p></p><p>Or if he spent a lot of time with others.</p><p></p><p>It would be best to come back every few days to sleep and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>That way, even those who spent time with him daily would find it hard to notice anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>"What did you come to see me for? If it's nothing, hurry up and get out of here. I'm very busy now, I can't keep up with all the alchemy orders!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun and Yu Xiao were already quite familiar with each other.</p><p></p><p>So she spoke rather casually.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had wanted to ask Lü Lingyun to help refine pills for his breakthrough, but he felt it was too sudden and couldn't come up with a reasonable and flawless explanation for where this spirit ginseng had suddenly appeared from.</p><p></p><p>So he decided not to rush it! Yu Xiao: "Since you're so busy, let me help you."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun paused, then side-eyed him: "Offering help for no reason, you must be up to no good. Come on, what are you after?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said frankly, "I want to learn the art of alchemy!"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun was shocked.</p><p></p><p>She suspected Yu Xiao's brain had been squeezed by the door on his way out.</p><p></p><p>Why on earth would he want to learn alchemy out of the blue? Was alchemy something he could learn? Didn't he know his own circumstances? Which alchemist wasn't raised on spirit stones? Although Lü Lingyun was young now, she had spent thousands of spirit stones just on wasted medicinal materials when learning alchemy in her family before!</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun didn't want to discourage her friend, so she said: "You're aiming for the Ascension Assembly next year. Learning alchemy now is not a wise move. I advise you to be more clear-headed and not get distracted by this."</p><p></p><p>"I'm confident about participating in next year's Ascension Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao first stated his position, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"It's just that there are many talented people in the major sects. Given my age and aptitude, even if I join a sect, I'm afraid it would be hard to be valued by the sect. If I could master a skill beforehand, perhaps I could find another path of development within the sect."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun: "Alchemy isn't easy. You'd better think it through..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded: "Don't worry, I'll just dabble in it. I won't let it interfere with my cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun: "Alright, since you insist, I can teach you some basic knowledge about medicinal pills first. But to learn real alchemy techniques, you'll need to reach at least the second level of Qi Refinement."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Yu Xiao reached for his storage pouch: "Let me pay the tuition fee first!"</p><p></p><p>Alchemy was a valuable skill.</p><p></p><p>The tuition naturally wouldn't be cheap.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, how boring. It's not like I'm short on spirit stones." Lü Lingyun waved her hand dismissively: "Just come over every day to help me out. Consider it learning while working to pay off your tuition!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lü</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How generous of you!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had known Lü Lingyun for nearly half a year and saw her almost every day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao knew her temperament. Since she didn't want tuition fees, he shouldn't insist on giving them, otherwise this young lady would get angry!</p><p></p><p>Over the next month or so, whenever Lü Lingyun went to the market to purchase supplies, searched for medicinal herbs in the wild, or refined elixirs, Yu Xiao was there to observe or assist. He learned about many types of herbs and mastered a lot of basic knowledge about alchemy.</p><p></p><p>In addition, by taking advantage of the time difference between the two realms, he quickly memorized many basic alchemy texts.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yu Xiao's "astonishing memory" and how effortlessly he learned the alchemy texts, Lü Lingyun felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Three Spring Thunder Friends continued to hunt regularly. The results varied each time but were generally quite good. They also made sure to collect blood essence stones, and managed to accumulate enough to make five more blood essence pills.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One day, when the time was right, Yu Xiao approached Lü Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lingyun, look at this!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun's eyes lit up when she saw the thousand-year-old ginseng.</p><p></p><p>"Is this some kind of spirit ginseng I've never seen before? Where did you get it?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said, "I bought it from an old cultivator in town for 100 spirit stones. I'm not sure if it was a good deal or not."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun said, "It's a great deal! Although I haven't seen this variety before, the spiritual energy it contains is very pure. I estimate it's worth at least 150 spirit stones, maybe even more in a larger gathering place for cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it really that valuable?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, this ginseng can be used to refine Spirit Ginseng Pills, which are very beneficial for cultivators in the early and middle stages of Qi Condensation."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun continued, "You've already accumulated enough at the first level of Qi Condensation. With the help of a Spirit Ginseng Pill, you'll definitely break through to the second level!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed he didn't need to break through his blood energy first, and could directly breakthrough his Qi Condensation realm!</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun was also happy for Yu Xiao. If he could break through to the second level of Qi Condensation, he'd have a great chance at next year's Immortal Ascension Conference!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later, with Lü Lingyun's help, the Great Scenery Thousand-Year Ginseng was refined into a Spirit Ginseng Pill.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao immediately went into seclusion to cultivate. Wei Biao and Lü Lingyun put aside their affairs to personally guard him.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, this day has come!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's cultivation had been stuck at the first level of Qi Condensation for half a year. If he continued to cultivate conventionally, even with sufficient spiritual medicines and herb pills to assist, it would take at least two years of hard cultivation! Even if his blood energy broke through to the fourth grade, it would probably take three to five months to break through!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was patient and didn't mind the passage of time. But if he could break through earlier without any side effects, he wouldn't refuse such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>He took the Spirit Ginseng Pill and began to meditate, practicing the Green Wood Technique.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could clearly feel that after the Spirit Ginseng Pill entered his body, it immediately turned into surging spiritual energy, flowing through his meridians to his limbs and organs, finally gathering in his dantian sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>In the dantian sea of qi, a large vortex of spiritual energy formed. This vortex of spiritual energy was the foundation of his magical power. As it rotated, it constantly converted spiritual energy into magical power.</p><p></p><p>Now, the spiritual energy vortex was continuously absorbing the medicinal spiritual energy produced by the Spirit Ginseng Pill.</p><p></p><p>Because the Spirit Ginseng Pill had been refined through special methods, the impurities in the ginseng's spiritual energy had already been purified, and it had been harmonized into the most easily absorbable state. So when the medicinal effects began to take effect, the spiritual energy vortex started to rotate frantically.</p><p></p><p>During this process, he continuously circulated the Green Wood Technique. The spiritual energy in the surrounding heaven and earth all gathered towards his body, constantly entering through his pores, washing his flesh and internal organs.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he reached a certain spiritual threshold.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could clearly feel that his spiritual vortex underwent a dramatic change, actually forming a second vortex arm.</p><p></p><p>When the two arms of the spiritual vortex rotated simultaneously, both the speed of refining spiritual energy and the intensity of magical power output increased significantly!</p><p></p><p>The entire process was smooth and without obstacles.</p><p></p><p>The second level of Qi Condensation was achieved!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

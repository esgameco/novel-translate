        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>First, buy a house.</p><p></p><p>Second, buy a gun.</p><p></p><p>Third, cultivate and train.</p><p></p><p>Fourth, invest in property.</p><p></p><p>Why buy a house?</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao is not originally from Xu Family Village, and his future secrets will become more and more. Living in the village is not very convenient.</p><p></p><p>He needs to buy a house as a residence, which can not only improve the comfort of life, but also make it more convenient to operate and live in the Greater Landscape world.</p><p></p><p>He has money in hand.</p><p></p><p>This is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Why buy a gun? Theoretically, Xu Xiao has an infinite lifespan.</p><p></p><p>He can accept low efficiency, but safety must be guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Weapons such as hand grenades, handguns, and submachine guns are not only useful in the Greater Landscape, but can also deal with some early-stage cultivators in the main world.</p><p></p><p>The Greater Landscape does not have a comprehensive gun ban policy.</p><p></p><p>These days, with chaos and turmoil, bandits and thieves are everywhere, and the common people are living in dire straits. It is normal for them to obtain some guns for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>There are already many homemade guns and muskets in Xu Family Village, which are used to shoot birds and rabbits, and to deal with thieves and even collective disputes when necessary.</p><p></p><p>Of course, homemade guns are of little significance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao wants the most advanced large-caliber firearms and powerful submachine guns.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing definitely cannot be bought on the market, so he needs some special channels and connections.</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai immediately said, "When I was young, I worked in the county government office and knew some businessmen and even gang members who were secretly engaged in arms trade, but the prices..."</p><p></p><p>"Money is not a problem!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao continued without hesitation, "Uncle, without causing any trouble, I hope to have as many as possible, so that I can arm a militia to provide a strong backing for the future self-defense of our clan."</p><p></p><p>What a grand plan!</p><p></p><p>Firearms are not cheap! If the Xu clan really has its own militia...</p><p></p><p>In the future, even if the world is in chaos, they will have enough bargaining chips, and at least they won't be bullied easily! Someone is willing to open their wallet.</p><p></p><p>And it is also a big matter related to the survival of the clan!</p><p></p><p>The old clan leader immediately excitedly slapped the table and said, "Ah Xiao, since you have this intention and ability, we must definitely make this matter a success!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai hurriedly made a military order: "Seven days! Within seven days, I will definitely get it done!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll wait for your good news, uncle!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao also proposed to cultivate and train in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He explained that although he has been living overseas, he has been devoted to Chinese martial arts since he was young. This time, after crossing the sea and returning to the country, he naturally wants to take the opportunity of his youth to refine his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Learning martial arts is great!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Guotai praised: "On this land of ours, the whole nation has been valuing martial arts since ancient times. On a small scale, it can strengthen the body and temper the will; on a large scale, it can uproot the strong and support the weak, defend the country... </p><p></p><p>In recent years, as Western firearms have become more and more fierce, many people have advocated the uselessness of learning martial arts, but I don't think so. And Ah Xiao, that you can have this enterprising spirit after living overseas for a long time is very good."</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Xiao's understanding of the Greater Landscape world, although there are extraordinary beings, their level is only low-level martial arts, similar to the level in wuxia novels.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation systems of different countries are slightly different, and the Greater Landscape area has a long history of ancient martial arts, with clear level divisions for martial artists, from the lowest ninth rank to the highest first rank.</p><p></p><p>Even a top-level first-rank expert would not be able to physically block bullets.</p><p></p><p>If these extraordinary beings could generally be unafraid of firearms, how could the Greater Landscape court be defeated by the Western powers step by step? If the extraordinary beings in this world were so strong, they might not even be able to develop industrial civilization.</p><p></p><p>However, above the first rank, there are also the existence of grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>It is said that they have the ability to withstand light firearms with their bare hands. </p><p></p><p>But at most, they can only deal with about ten handguns at the same time.</p><p></p><p>And the martial arts grandmasters of each era can be counted on one's fingers, and they are not representative.</p><p></p><p>Xu Qinghai said, "Our Mei County is not a big city, but there are also some skilled ancient martial arts masters, some of whom can reach the sixth or seventh rank, but most of these experts are mixed up with gangs."</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao was not very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>These county-level experts not only have insufficient strength, but their background is also not very good.</p><p></p><p>He recruited martial arts masters not only to assist in his cultivation, but also to serve as bodyguards, so reliability and safety are the most important considerations.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't have to be from this county, I can invite masters from the provincial capital, other provinces, or other cities. I want ones with good reputation and high skills!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we can find someone more powerful, but it will take some time, and the price will likely be quite high."</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"To have a Fifth-Rank cultivator come to our door, it would cost at least fifty to eighty taels of silver per month."</p><p></p><p>This is just a small amount of money.</p><p></p><p>It's nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>Money is the least of his concerns.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu was not content to be an ordinary person for the rest of his life, but due to his inferior spiritual root, not only was his cultivation progress slow, the hope of reaching the Foundation Establishment stage was virtually zero, making it almost impossible for him to join the major sects.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew that some cultivators had attained the Dao through martial arts, establishing their foundation despite having inferior spiritual roots, and their foundations were even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Attaining the Dao through martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty is immense.</p><p></p><p>After all, the suitable age for martial arts training is only around twenty to thirty years. For normal people, their vitality would decline after forty or fifty years old, completely missing the best opportunity to attain the Dao through martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu was already twenty-three years old.</p><p></p><p>At this point, starting martial arts training would be too late, and it would be almost impossible for him to achieve any accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the Stone Palace's Dual Penetration Door and the ability to extend his lifespan, and all of this could be changed!</p><p></p><p>Of course, although he planned to hire a group of martial arts instructors in the Great Landscape, they would mainly be for sparring and security purposes. The real place for him to learn the art would be in the Main World.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple.</p><p></p><p>The Great Landscape only has a history of a few thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The cultivating world of the Main World, on the other hand, has a history of hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Even the most basic martial arts, the Great Landscape, a low-cultivation world, cannot compare to the foundation of the Main World.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu planned to learn the martial arts in the Main World, and then come to the Great Landscape world to cultivate and refine, relying on the hundred-fold time difference between the two worlds, to achieve the goal of attaining the Dao through martial arts and ultimately walking the path of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>The discussion about buying a house, buying a gun, and cultivating is over.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he discussed with the clan elders the matter they were most interested in - real estate investment.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu obviously would not lack money to spend, and starting a business was not his primary goal for making money, but rather to better fit his persona, conceal his identity, and also to improve his social status and gain prestige.</p><p></p><p>His core ability is longevity.</p><p></p><p>And to achieve longevity, he needs to accumulate auspicious qi.</p><p></p><p>Only by gaining prestige can he nurture auspicious qi.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that.</p><p></p><p>There is a small fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not return to his previous life, the Great Landscape is very similar to the late Qing Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>From the late 19th century to the 21st century, it's only about a hundred years, which may not be a long time for him. Theoretically, as long as he waits patiently, a modernized world with high technology and information will eventually come.</p><p></p><p>The extraordinary powers of this world.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the future world, they may not be worth much.</p><p></p><p>But a world with top-notch industrial capabilities, technological capabilities, and production capabilities is not without value.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu can participate in and drive the technological progress of this world, and eventually step by step, shape it into his ideal form... Of course, it's still far away, he'll take it one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>The political situation in the Great Landscape court is chaotic.</p><p></p><p>But this era of industrial revolution and surging productivity offers many opportunities.</p><p></p><p>However, Mei County is not an international metropolis, nor is it near a commercial port, so it is not suitable for engaging in popular industries like finance, manufacturing, transportation, or textiles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although these industries contain great opportunities, the big sharks and powerful forces involved are also numerous. With his current foundation still weak, it is not advisable to enter them immediately, or else even if he succeeds, he may be targeted.</p><p></p><p>It's best to utilize the advantages of the two worlds.</p><p></p><p>First do some industries with small competition, low thresholds, and the ability to make a fortune quietly.</p><p></p><p>Such as light handicrafts and planting industries.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific operation?</p><p></p><p>Simple.</p><p></p><p>Introduce some spiritual grains, tea trees, medicinal materials, or wood, jade, and other materials from the Main World, then purchase land and build farms and workshops around Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Sell spiritual grains, tea leaves, medicinal materials, wood carvings, and jade carvings.</p><p></p><p>The profits will be quite considerable.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, whether it's planting or handicrafts, they all require recruiting a large number of personnel. When there are thousands or even tens of thousands of people relying on you for their livelihood, a power base will naturally form!</p><p></p><p>With a power base.</p><p></p><p>Who would be afraid of lacking prestige?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu swept his gaze over the people present.</p><p></p><p>He silently thought to himself: I'm impersonating a descendant of the Yu family, borrowing the identity of the Yu clan, so that's why I've been able to take root in this world so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Then, as a repayment, I'll ensure your family enjoys three generations of prosperity!

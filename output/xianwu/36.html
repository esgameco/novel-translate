        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Da Niu Yu was brought in.</p><p></p><p>He looked a bit sturdier than half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>Overall, he still appeared dark-skinned and thin.</p><p></p><p>This appearance didn't quite match his name.</p><p></p><p>And it was completely impossible to tell he was a one-in-a-million martial arts prodigy!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, adoptive father!" Da Niu Yu was very excited.</p><p></p><p>The adoptive father was the idol and hero in the hearts of every child in the institute.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, he single-handedly wiped out the bandits of Stone Tiger Fortress. This event was heavily publicized in the institute.</p><p></p><p>It had a huge impact on the young hearts of the children!</p><p></p><p>How did the cultured and refined adoptive father manage to take down hundreds of fierce and vicious bandits? Could it be that he knew magic?</p><p></p><p>The already towering image of the adoptive father now seemed godlike!</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous, let me take a look." </p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu placed his hand to sense Da Niu Yu's pulse. He felt streams of martial artist's qi flowing smoothly through the body. This was indeed a sign that all the meridians had been opened.</p><p></p><p>With qi reinforcing the body, physical constitution would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>Even though Da Niu Yu was only ten years old and hadn't fully developed yet, if he were to arm wrestle with adult men, probably few ordinary people could be his match.</p><p></p><p>"Good, even faster than expected. It seems you've really been working hard!"</p><p></p><p>Da Niu Yu was overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>He quickly said: "It's not hard!"</p><p></p><p>These days, he would get up to practice martial arts before the rooster crowed every morning. And at night when all the other children were asleep, he would still practice alone in the dark, all for the sake of earning his adoptive father's praise and recognition again!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu was naturally very gratified.</p><p></p><p>He had randomly adopted a group of orphaned children.</p><p></p><p>And unexpectedly picked up such a fine uncut jade.</p><p></p><p>With Da Niu Yu's aptitude,</p><p></p><p>As long as he worked hard enough and with proper guidance,</p><p></p><p>He would likely be able to reach the level of first-rank ancient martial arts master in the future!</p><p></p><p>And if he had sufficient resources and lucky encounters, it wasn't impossible for him to enter the realm of grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>What does it mean to be a one-in-a-million martial arts prodigy? This was a true one-in-a-million martial arts prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu's own mediocre skills weren't worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>But this was truly grandmaster potential!</p><p></p><p>The Great Jing Empire had a population of 800 million.</p><p></p><p>There were only about ten grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Such beings had already reached the pinnacle of martial arts, and could be counted on one's fingers in the martial world of every era.</p><p></p><p>If Xiao Yu could nurture such an impressive martial artist, it would greatly boost his reputation and prestige!</p><p></p><p>In the future, whether Da Niu Yu roamed the martial world or joined an organization like the Great Xia Society to make a career, all his accomplishments could be attributed in part to Xiao Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, you'll come here to practice martial arts. I'll personally teach you fist techniques and martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, adoptive father!"</p><p></p><p>Although Xiao Yu had practiced martial arts for less than a year, he had already become quite proficient in the Spring Thunder Fist. He had also often observed Wei Biao teaching disciples in the martial arts hall, so he was confident in teaching the Spring Thunder Fist to Da Niu Yu.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to teach the fist technique,</p><p></p><p>He might as well teach more people.</p><p></p><p>Among the children, there were others with good physiques who showed potential for martial arts. Even if they hadn't reached Da Niu Yu's level, they could also be called to listen in. The guards, and even the maids and servants could learn if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>The several masters were very surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Spring Thunder Fist sounded ordinary,</p><p></p><p>But it was definitely a top-tier grandmaster-level fist technique.</p><p></p><p>Such techniques were invariably closely guarded secrets of various schools and sects. Yet they, who were just private tutors and training partners hired by Young Master Yu, were actually allowed to learn such a high-level martial art. This was definitely a stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>Did this mean</p><p></p><p>That Young Master Yu regarded them as his own people?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was planning to groom them as his trusted aides!</p><p></p><p>When they realized this, the masters became even more excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two weeks later.</p><p></p><p>Da Niu Yu had mastered the 36 forms of the practice method.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu's life was still quite leisurely. On one hand, he was steadily cultivating with the goal of reaching the sixth rank. On the other hand, he was setting up businesses and factories and recruiting people in the Great Jing Empire. He also spent quite a bit of time practicing minor spells in the immortal cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>For him,</p><p></p><p>Almost thirty days had passed in total.</p><p></p><p>The late rice in Mei County was starting to be harvested.</p><p></p><p>The 100 mu of spirit rice paddy had indeed yielded a bumper harvest.</p><p></p><p>Each mu was estimated to produce an average of 800 jin of unhusked rice.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yu did a rough calculation. The total of 80,000 jin of unhusked rice, with a milling rate of about 70%, would produce 56,000 jin of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Even if the quality was inferior to the White Cloud Workshop's spirit rice,</p><p></p><p>It was still a rare and unheard-of good rice in the Great Jing Empire.</p><p></p><p>If this batch of rice were transported back to White Cloud Workshop to be sold...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>...could also make a big profit in spirit stones, after all the scale is there, but there's no need for that.</p><p></p><p>The quantity is too large! 56,000 jin would be difficult to move. Crossing realms would also consume a lot of luck.</p><p></p><p>Reselling refined salt and white sugar is more profitable than selling rice.</p><p></p><p>Of this year's bumper harvest of 80,000 jin of rice, the plan is to use 20,000 jin for breeding. Next year the scale will be expanded twentyfold, planting 2,000 mu of spirit rice all at once.</p><p></p><p>Each mu of spirit rice consumes 5 jin of seed rice.</p><p></p><p>Two thousand mu would require 10,000 jin.</p><p></p><p>Even if the quality declines with future third and fourth generation spirit rice, there will still be surplus second generation spirit rice that can be used to create different grades of products based on different qualities of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>The rest will all be used for brewing alcohol.</p><p></p><p>Brewing yellow wine from spirit rice is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>The first trial batch succeeded in just fourteen days.</p><p></p><p>This wine has a slightly deeper color than ordinary yellow wine, but is transparent like amber, and gives off an aroma even stronger than aged old yellow wine.</p><p></p><p>As for the taste.</p><p></p><p>It is sweet, mellow and has a long-lasting aftertaste.</p><p></p><p>Although the alcohol content is not very high, a few cups make one's body feel warm all over, and blood circulation becomes much smoother, showing its remarkable efficacy.</p><p></p><p>In the White Cloud Workshop.</p><p></p><p>It would only be considered a middle to low grade spirit wine.</p><p></p><p>But in Da Jing it is a rare and sought-after good wine.</p><p></p><p>Not only is the taste no less than top-quality fine wines, it also has the effects of nourishing yin and replenishing yang, promoting blood circulation, and has very high health and fitness value. It can even assist martial artists in combat and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the future.</p><p></p><p>Drinking some spirit wine before practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Will make blood circulation smoother and improve the effects of practice.</p><p></p><p>After practice, a bowl of ten-ingredient qi-replenishing soup to restore blood and strengthen the body.</p><p></p><p>Finally, have Master Bai give a massage to eliminate soreness, fatigue, and further consolidate the body, leaving no aftereffects.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating like this.</p><p></p><p>How can the effects not be significant?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had several masters participate in the tasting.</p><p></p><p>They were all amazed and delighted, giving extremely high praise.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked: "Does this wine have the ability to become an instant hit in the provincial capital?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang: "This wine is very beneficial for health and fitness, and for martial artists' cultivation. The provincial capital not only gathers many wealthy merchants and tycoons, but is also full of martial arts schools and countless martial arts practitioners. I think there will be a situation of demand exceeding supply when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Then I can rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded with satisfaction: "Once everything at hand is settled, I will go to the provincial capital to develop!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat sudden.</p><p></p><p>But it felt normal.</p><p></p><p>Mei County is ultimately too small.</p><p></p><p>How could it contain a dragon and qilin like Young Master Yu? This return to the country, with the first stop in Mei County, was to establish a foothold and give back to the hometown.</p><p></p><p>Now Yu Xiao's foundation is stable and his power is strong enough. With the winery, jewelry factory, and the annexation of more and more land, the lives of Mei County's people have already improved a lot.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Yu needs a bigger stage!</p><p></p><p>Bai Yajie and others felt anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The provincial capital is different from Mei County.</p><p></p><p>It is one of the most prosperous places in the world.</p><p></p><p>If Mei County is a pond, then the provincial capital is a vast sea. Who knows what kind of waves this dragon will stir up after entering the sea!</p><p></p><p>As Yu Xiao was making preparations to go to the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian came with red eyes bringing bad news: "Brother Xiao... my grandfather... he's not going to make it!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had heard.</p><p></p><p>The old clan leader had not been doing well recently.</p><p></p><p>He even had Yu Ruqian send back several high-quality medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>But it seems they were still powerless to save him? This time it really appears to be the end of his life! Yu Xiao had always respected this old man.</p><p></p><p>Not only because his rise in Mei County began with meeting him.</p><p></p><p>Back when the Stone Tiger Stronghold kidnapped hostages, Yu Guotai stood up and firmly trusted him, angrily confronting the village elders and clan elders, even willing to stake his lifelong reputation as a guarantee, showing his integrity and responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Although with Yu Xiao's skyrocketing fame, status and power.</p><p></p><p>He no longer needs the support of Yu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>But he will fulfill the promise in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That is.</p><p></p><p>Having borrowed the Yu family identity.</p><p></p><p>He will ensure the Yu Family Village's prosperity for three generations.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao decided to go pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>This was a very ordinary old man.</p><p></p><p>This was also an old man worthy of respect.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

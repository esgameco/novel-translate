        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was gloomy and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao emerged from the deep mining tunnel, dumping out the ore from his backpack to be counted.</p><p></p><p>"Today we mined a total of 300 jin of spirit ore!"</p><p></p><p>The manager felt a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Mining spirit ore was arduous and dangerous work, so the wages were paid daily - 10 taels of gold per 100 jin of spirit ore.</p><p></p><p>This sounded like a lot, but in reality it was just the basic wage. Gold had little purchasing power, only circulating among the lowest-level cultivators for exchanging the most basic living necessities.</p><p></p><p>The true goal of the miners was spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It took thousands of jin of spirit ore to refine a single spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>And the areas rich in spirit ore had a chance of naturally producing spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Each spirit stone found would earn a bonus of 100 taels, and accumulating 30 could earn a commission.</p><p></p><p>This mine had average quality, with not many natural spirit stones. But most miners could still dig up around 3 spirit stones per month on average.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao had been mining for two years, working diligently, but the number of spirit stones he found was only one-tenth that of the average miner. He still hadn't managed to save up 10 spirit stones, an exceptionally bad streak of luck.</p><p></p><p>Hoarding them?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! The management of the spirit ore was extremely strict. There were all kinds of detection formations around. The miners were just ordinary laborers, unable to secretly hoard spirit stones, let alone take them out of the mine.</p><p></p><p>The manager didn't think much of it, casually grabbing three gold ingots from the towering pile and tossing them over, waving his hand impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manager!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao took the hard-earned money and left the mine. The bitter winter wind was like knives, and he couldn't help but shiver.</p><p></p><p>He wrapped his tattered coat tighter: "Three years... the days have been so damn hard!"</p><p></p><p>That's right. Xu Xiao was a transmigrator! In this world, the immortal cultivators lived for thousands of years, able to move mountains and control the weather with a flick of their fingers...</p><p></p><p>But what did that have to do with him? As a low-level cultivator, he was still little different from an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still hadn't found a path to cultivation, remaining just a mortal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao had tried hard to seek out opportunities for cultivation, even fantasizing about joining an immortal sect and one day becoming a carefree immortal soaring through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But reality was cruel. Without any family background or exceptional talent, if he hadn't persistently trained his body before transmigrating, he wouldn't even have been able to get a miner's job. Fortunately...</p><p></p><p>From today on, everything will change.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao quickened his pace back to his residence.</p><p></p><p>The spirit ore mine was in a remote area, with towering mountains stretching for thousands of miles around. To accommodate the thousands of miners who needed food and housing, a settlement called "Bai Yun Fang" had gradually formed nearby, also attracting many wandering cultivators, now with a population exceeding 30,000.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yun Fang wasn't large, but it had all the basic amenities. It was divided into different classes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xiao lived in the worst slum area. This kind of place was free land, where people built their own shacks. But they still had to pay a hefty 200 taels of gold per month in protection fees.</p><p></p><p>The miners worked from dawn to dusk, earning an average of 20 taels of gold per day. Yet due to Bai Yun Fang's isolation and inconvenient transportation, even the most basic living supplies and everyday goods were exorbitantly priced.</p><p></p><p>The hardship of life was unimaginable! One unexpected accident or serious illness could have devastating consequences.</p><p></p><p>Bang! He closed the dilapidated door behind him.</p><p></p><p>Back in the familiar little hut, Xu Xiao's whole body relaxed.</p><p></p><p>An oppressive excitement welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>First confirming there were no hidden eyes or ears, he took a deep breath, and his figure vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiao appeared in an ancient stone palace.</p><p></p><p>This "stone palace" was Xu Xiao's greatest secret - a personal spatial dimension. No matter the time or place, he could enter or exit it just by thinking of it, and others could never sense its existence.</p><p></p><p>Though he didn't know where this stone palace came from, it was clearly his only hope to change his fate!</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I've saved up 100 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had placed all his important assets in the Stone Palace space.</p><p></p><p>This included 100 crystals that emitted a white glow.</p><p></p><p>He would become a miner.</p><p></p><p>It was just to collect spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>100 spirit stones would be an astronomical sum for ordinary people, and it would be extremely difficult and dangerous to obtain them through any means, but only in this way could he achieve his goal without drawing attention or envy.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the spirit stones, </p><p>there were also a small pile of gold bars.</p><p></p><p>Around 10,000 taels.</p><p></p><p>It was the savings from two years of mining, living frugally.</p><p></p><p>Based on the international gold price of over 550 RMB per gram before his transmigration, the total value of this gold was about 300 million RMB. He didn't know if it would be of any use going forward.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Stone Palace stood a stone stele, surrounded by one large and nine small, a total of ten stone gates.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao stood in front of the largest gate, and compared to the nine tightly closed stone gates, this one was wide open, with the interior scene being the small wooden hut he had just left.</p><p></p><p>The other nine gates were tightly shut and could not be opened at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He turned his attention to the stone stele.</p><p></p><p>A readable text appeared on it:</p><p></p><p>"Please collect 100 spirit stones to activate the 'Qi Refining' world!"</p><p></p><p>According to the ancient stele's instructions, each of the nine stone gates represented a different world. </p><p></p><p>If the one Yu Xiao was in was the main world, then these nine were different sub-worlds. </p><p></p><p>Each world seemed to correspond to a different realm, and the current one only met the prerequisite conditions for the 'Qi Refining' world, but he needed to collect enough spirit stones to formally open it.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the idea of completing the task arose, the ancient stele lit up, the Stone Palace shook violently, and the 100 spirit stones released their energy, all of which was infused into the first stone gate.</p><p></p><p>"Aura +100!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient stele had a new prompt.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what use the aura had yet.</p><p></p><p>But this wasn't the time to worry about that.</p><p></p><p>The stone gate slowly opened.</p><p></p><p>From blurry to gradually clear.</p><p></p><p>A new world appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The sunset shone on the blue brick alleys, with most of the houses being brick and wood structures. On the street outside, there were footsteps and hawkers' calls.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rickshaw passed by, with the driver wearing a shabby short jacket and a sweat towel around his neck, while the female passenger wore a dignified yet sexy cheongsam.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be... the Republican era?!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>His emotions were a mix of many flavors.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already anticipated that the world behind this gate would not be his previous one, actually confirming it still left him with a sense of disappointment. But at least the artistic style of this world was familiar, which brought him a certain sense of solace.</p><p></p><p>A realm similar to the Republican era.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the purchasing power of gold would be high.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't his 10,000 taels of hard-earned gold then have a place to be used? With such a large sum of money, he could live a life of luxury in the Republican era!</p><p></p><p>The days of being hungry and cold, working himself to the bone, might finally be over!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but through these sub-worlds, he might even have a chance to change his fate! Yu Xiao no longer hesitated and stepped through the gate.</p><p></p><p>As he passed through the double gates and arrived in the unfamiliar alley, the entire world came alive.</p><p></p><p>"I've truly arrived in a new world..." Bathed in the sunset, Yu Xiao had a dreamlike feeling. But just then, he seemed to have noticed something, "Huh, why is there a small sun next to the big sun?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this was not the Republican era after all?</p><p></p><p>But the scenery, clothing, and text were all quite similar to the Republican era style. This world was not as simple as he had imagined - it was probably a parallel realm that was both similar and different.</p><p></p><p>He had to be more cautious and stabilize his footing first.</p><p></p><p>As Yu Xiao was thinking this, he suddenly felt a sensation, and the ancient stele in the Stone Palace began to shake, with two new text prompts appearing on it:</p><p></p><p>"Refine to the Celestial Realm, and you can open the next level world!"</p><p></p><p>"Gain more prestige to nurture more aura!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

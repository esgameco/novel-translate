        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao devoted the vast majority of his time to the main world.</p><p></p><p>According to plan.</p><p></p><p>He would head to the provincial capital in early spring.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he must master the "Invisibility Technique" and "Perception Technique".</p><p></p><p>Although these two spells have no offensive capabilities, they are very practical and can bring many conveniences. Of course, they can also prevent many dangers, thereby greatly increasing one's trump cards and survival abilities.</p><p></p><p>Several months later.</p><p></p><p>At the Spring Thunder Boxing Gym.</p><p></p><p>"I've mastered it!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's face showed delight.</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining the spells.</p><p></p><p>It took a cumulative four months.</p><p></p><p>He finally mastered the two minor spells of the first level of Qi Refinement - "Perception Technique" and "Invisibility Technique".</p><p></p><p>The uses of the Invisibility Technique need no explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Perception Technique can greatly enhance vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. It can also vaguely sense various changes beyond the five senses, and even perceive things on a spiritual level like killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already mastered two spells.</p><p></p><p>There was still some distance to go before he could use them skillfully.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that Yu Xiao's efficiency in cultivating spells was not high. After all, the Perception Technique and Invisibility Technique are just basic minor spells of the first level of Qi Refinement. Top-tier geniuses could learn to use them freely in just eight or ten days.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he felt the gap between himself and geniuses!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>What does it matter?</p><p></p><p>Being a bit slower doesn't hinder anything.</p><p></p><p>In the past four or five months, he spent 60% of his time in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Because practicing spells consumes spiritual power, and the spiritual energy in the Dajing world is extremely scarce and inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when he returned to the Dajing world, he continued to cultivate steadily with blood-boosting supplements, and promoted the improvement of the Civilian Protection Corps, winery, and jewelry factory.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaohe Town Civilian Protection Corps had been fully established.</p><p></p><p>This was a well-equipped private army of about 500 people. If Yu Xiao were to raise the banner of rebellion and occupy a mountain as his base now, this would be enough to become a small warlord.</p><p></p><p>And the rice harvested in October.</p><p></p><p>30,000 jin of rice had already been brewed into wine.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao spent 5,000 silver dollars to set up a winery.</p><p></p><p>A total of 14,000 to 15,000 jin of spiritual wine was all stored in purple clay jars and placed in the wine cellar for aging. Through time, it would further improve the quality and taste, and the medicinal effects would also be further stimulated and enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The first generation of spiritual wine.</p><p></p><p>Would not be directly put on the market.</p><p></p><p>After fully satisfying his own needs.</p><p></p><p>The rest was planned to be packaged as a top-tier luxury product.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when the second and third generations of spiritual rice are harvested, the amount of spiritual rice available for brewing is expected to increase more than tenfold consecutively. These large quantities will be used to open up the global market and will be enough to sweep away all competing products on the market.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao extended his influence beyond Mei County and laid out plans.</p><p></p><p>For example, he planned to invest about 10,000 yuan to acquire one or two old brand wineries in the provincial capital. This way, in the future, he could use mature brands to promote his exclusive spiritual rice yellow wine, and also quickly open up the market.</p><p></p><p>He also planned to invest in or acquire some martial arts gyms, escort agencies, herbal medicine shops, jewelry stores, department stores, and so on.</p><p></p><p>This was in preparation for expanding his commercial territory in the future, then entering important industries, and facilitating his own cultivation. Of course, it was still in the preparation and planning stage, and it would probably take some time before it could be implemented.</p><p></p><p>The above industries.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't matter whether they make money or not.</p><p></p><p>The key is to be able to enhance prestige and status.</p><p></p><p>They can both assist in cultivation and improve quality of life, and also provide cover for nearly unlimited wealth.</p><p></p><p>Currently.</p><p></p><p>On the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>The personal information was: ————</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Age: 23 years old.</p><p></p><p>Actual age: 24 years old.</p><p></p><p>Prestige: 1198/2000 (Famous in the region).</p><p></p><p>Luck growth: 3 points per year.</p><p></p><p>Current luck: 90.</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>Recently.</p><p></p><p>Prestige growth had encountered a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>But luck points had increased from 88 to 90.</p><p></p><p>This was because it had been over a year since opening the Dajing world. According to the current luck growth standard, he had successively gained 2 points of growth.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen.</p><p></p><p>The time in the ancient palace.</p><p></p><p>Is based solely on Yu Xiao's perceived experience.</p><p></p><p>As for why it's not 3 points? Because the luck level increase happened in the past few months. After the actual age increased.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't the luck decrease? It's estimated that the loss of lifespan is spread out over each day. The consumption of 1 luck point had already been consumed in daily life.</p><p></p><p>"This</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's already been over a year so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Reflecting on the past year, Yu Xiao had frequently traversed between two realms, consuming vast resources from both, yet had only managed to raise his martial arts cultivation to the seventh rank and his qi cultivation to barely the first layer, along with mastering one or two minor spells.</p><p></p><p>He was quite satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Because without the complementary resources from both realms, not to mention one year, even three or five years might not have yielded the current results.</p><p></p><p>And if not for the stone hall gathering fortune and offsetting the passage of lifespan, even with numerous fortuitous encounters, it would ultimately be fleeting, unable to escape the fate and end of becoming dried bones in a grave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>The spell was complete.</p><p></p><p>The advance to the provincial capital became more stable.</p><p></p><p>Guangyue Province was no ordinary province, and Yangcheng was no ordinary provincial capital. This place had the largest and most numerous trading ports in the Great Jing Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The current Yangcheng was not only extremely developed in commerce and trade, but the situation was also intricate and complex, with various forces from within the Great Jing Kingdom as well as Western powers entrenched.</p><p></p><p>Hidden dragons and crouching tigers!</p><p></p><p>One couldn't be careless!</p><p></p><p>After half a year of development in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had gained some power and reputation.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the true top-tier powerhouses in the provincial capital's underworld, the court's high-ranking officials, and the forces of various foreign powers, he was still just an inconspicuous local wealthy gentry!</p><p></p><p>"Before and after going to the provincial capital!"</p><p></p><p>"It's best to break through to the sixth rank!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao set a goal for himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he could hire more bodyguards for himself, bring more guns, and with his current reputation, fame, and social status, it should theoretically be enough to deal with various dangers and make various forces wary.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao still hoped to be as stable as possible.</p><p></p><p>A sixth-rank martial artist, equivalent to the middle stage of blood refinement, would see a significant overall increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after breaking through to the sixth rank, his physique would be further improved, clearing the obstacles between the first and second layers of qi cultivation, thus having a greater chance of advancing further in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough was crucial! However, blood energy cultivation became more difficult with each step.</p><p></p><p>Even with Xu Qingfeng's All-Nourishing Qi Soup, plus Master Bai's blood energy massage assistance, it would likely take at least three to four years.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the sixth rank in blood energy.</p><p></p><p>From the first to the second layer of qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated to take at least another three to five years.</p><p></p><p>Difficult! Too difficult! And it would take far too long! Although there was plenty of time to wait, if there were better methods and shortcuts, without any side effects, and with controllable risks, he had absolutely no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao finished his rest.</p><p></p><p>He walked into the main courtyard of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Spring Thunder Martial Arts School was now cold and deserted, with only two guardian instructors left, plus three or four scattered disciples.</p><p></p><p>Old Li had left Baiyun District for several months, and without Old Li as the signboard, Wei Biao, who was only at the middle stage of blood refinement, obviously couldn't support a martial arts school on his own.</p><p></p><p>These days, the disciples were almost all gone.</p><p></p><p>"You've come at the right time, I was just about to look for you."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao walked up to Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This man with a face full of thick flesh.</p><p></p><p>Had recently failed in his attempt to break through to the next level.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the declining martial arts school, he was so worried that what little hair he had left was almost falling out.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked, "Senior Brother, is there something?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao forced a smile and said, "I'm ashamed, your elder brother is dull-witted, I failed to break through recently."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao comforted him, "At Senior Brother's age, there will be plenty of opportunities in the future."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the deserted martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>This big man slowly said, "Although your foolish elder brother has mediocre talent among Old Li's disciples, I've been learning martial arts by Old Li's side since I was fifteen, watching this martial arts school being built from nothing. I was an orphan from childhood, and only found a home when I came here."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was moved inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This seemingly rough man.</p><p></p><p>Was actually a person who valued relationships and had a delicate heart.</p><p></p><p>He liked being with his martial brothers and was full of affection for the martial arts school, so he didn't want to see it decline and eventually disappear without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao continued, "I must break through to the late stage of blood refinement!"</p><p></p><p>But he had failed to break through recently.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't try again in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said, "There's still one way now."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Essence Pill!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao said, "If I can get this pill, I will definitely break through, but there are some risks in obtaining it. If something happens to your foolish elder brother, please look after the martial arts school for a while!"</p><p></p><p>Chapter 37 has been blocked, even though it's the most positive chapter, it's really frustrating. It should be released tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

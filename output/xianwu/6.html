        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had become a pile of severed limbs and shredded flesh.</p><p></p><p>The culprit behind this tragic accident was a spirit-mining worm.</p><p></p><p>This low-level spiritual beast resembled an enlarged watermelon worm.</p><p></p><p>They feed on mineral stones containing spiritual energy and like to build nests and live near the spirit mines.</p><p></p><p>These worms generally do not prey on humans, but only become ferocious and aggressive when they feel their nest is threatened, which is one of the common threats miners face in their work.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p></p><p>Seen in the morning,</p><p></p><p>And now forever gone!</p><p></p><p>Chen Shi was an old miner, known to many people, so it was inevitable that they would feel saddened by his loss.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p>"Old Chen could have retired by now!"</p><p>"I had advised him earlier to quit while he was ahead, but he just wouldn't listen!"</p><p>"Now not only is he gone, but all his savings have been wiped out as well..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao felt a bit choked up.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Chen had worked diligently for many years.</p><p>At the very least, he had managed to save up ten spirit stones.</p><p>For an ordinary person, this was an astronomical sum, certainly too much to carry on oneself, so he must have kept it deposited at the mine, intending to withdraw it when he eventually returned home.</p><p>If he had retired in time, he could have used five stones to redeem himself, leaving another five plus his accumulated gold, ensuring a carefree life in his later years.</p><p>But now, with his death,</p><p>Ten years of hard labor,</p><p>All for naught! Cruel? Perhaps! But there are still plenty of young and able-bodied men eager to take his place in the mines. This tragedy is not the first, and certainly won't be the last.</p><p>This is the sorrow of the weak in a world of the survival of the fittest.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Yu Xiao came to the chaotic burial ground, where this old miner, who had dedicated ten years to the spirit mines, now lay without a proper grave, just hastily covered with a tattered mat after his body was recovered.</p><p>No tombstone.</p><p>The burial ground was filled with abandoned graves.</p><p>All were miners who had met violent or untimely deaths.</p><p>Their remains scattered about, dug up by wild beasts.</p><p>"The weak have no dignity!"</p><p>"I must become stronger!"</p><p>Before leaving, Yu Xiao poured a jar of old yellow wine over the grave.</p><p>His own life remained unaffected, continuing to work and mine every day as usual.</p><p>Miners face dangers, but he needed the spirit stones.</p><p>Yu Xiao had a personal stone palace that allowed him to instantly take refuge inside and avoid accidents with the mining worms or other hazards, which was a relatively safe and efficient approach at this stage.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p>Five days had passed.</p><p>Another spirit stone was excavated.</p><p>This time, he did not choose to secretly keep it, but turned it in.</p><p>It was normal to have poor luck, and completely failing to find any spirit stones would also raise suspicion.</p><p>If Yu Xiao wanted to keep working in the spirit mines, he couldn't just take without giving back, so he would have to turn in one or two stones out of every ten.</p><p>This spirit stone earned a bonus of 100 taels of gold, and combined with the past five days of producing around 300 jin of spirit ore per day, he had accumulated a total of 250 taels of gold.</p><p>This was just enough to pay one month's protection fee for the shantytown.</p><p>But in the capital, it could be exchanged for 25,000 silver dollars, more than enough to arm and train a militia.</p><p>Yu Xiao was not solely focused on mining; he was also collecting intelligence and seeking out potential teachers.</p><p>The White Cloud Pavilion had many reclusive cultivators.</p><p>They too needed to make a living, and some openly accepted disciples to pass on their arts.</p><p>After careful analysis, Yu Xiao had selected his target - Li Yan, a 48-year-old living in the first alley of the south gate of the White Cloud Pavilion.</p><p>There were three reasons for this choice:</p><p>First, Li Yan had a good reputation in the market for being trustworthy, although he had a somewhat aloof temperament.</p><p>Second, Li Yan openly accepted disciples as long as they paid the fee.</p><p>Third, Li Yan was among the most accomplished of the reclusive cultivators, and his path of cultivating through martial arts was most suitable for Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>That day,</p><p>After work and washing up,</p><p>He changed into clean clothes and entered the White Cloud Pavilion.</p><p>The White Cloud Pavilion was home to many low-level reclusive cultivators, better than the shantytown where the miners lived, but still lacking the refined air of the immortal abodes, instead having a bustling, marketplace atmosphere.</p><p>The streets were filled with messy stalls.</p><p>Some sold spirit rice porridge, the vendors stirring and calling out their wares.</p><p>Others piled up strange-shaped spirit herbs and rusted ancient talismans.</p><p>Yuexiao even saw a stall with spiritual beasts, simple cages holding several young cubs, though it was hard to say if they were truly spiritual creatures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Cultivator with a Background</p><p></p><p>Most of them were recruited by various major sects.</p><p></p><p>Even the scattered cultivators with some abilities have their own cultivation caves.</p><p></p><p>More than 95% of the scattered cultivators in the White Cloud Pavilion are at the Qi Refining first or second layer of cultivation. Although they have a certain amount of spiritual power, they are at the lowest level in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>They gather here.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is to compete for the Ascension Talisman.</p><p></p><p>This item is the proof of participation in the Ascension Assembly, and the only opportunity for scattered cultivators to join a sect and change their fate.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the marketplace.</p><p></p><p>No interaction with others.</p><p></p><p>Scattered cultivators are not lacking in those with eccentric personalities and volatile temperaments.</p><p></p><p>The lowly followers at the bottom of the cultivation world are still formidable existences to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao came to a courtyard with a simple house, and saw a sign hanging at the entrance that read "Spring Thunder Fist Hall". From inside, he could hear the sound of people practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>A burly man with a fierce appearance blocked Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to become a disciple and learn the art."</p><p></p><p>"Become a disciple? The tuition is one Spirit Stone, or five thousand taels of gold. Do you have enough?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao definitely wouldn't take out any Spirit Stones, nor was he planning to easily hand over the gold, after all, it cost him 2 points of Luck to bring this gold to the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>The burly man had little patience.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have any money, do you? If you don't have money, you can't learn martial arts here. Scram!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I haven't saved up enough money, I have a good family heirloom that Master Li might like."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao took out a brass pocket watch, which was a high-end item he had bought for 650 silver taels from a pawnshop in Mei County. Whether in craftsmanship or design, it was extremely exquisite, and could even be considered a work of art even in the future world.</p><p></p><p>The time in the two realms is both twenty-four hours.</p><p></p><p>This pocket watch is still very useful.</p><p></p><p>"This is a painstaking work of a craftsman from my hometown, worth at least ten thousand taels of gold. Please give me a chance."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>There were four or five guards and more than a dozen young people practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have time to look around much.</p><p></p><p>He was immediately led into the main hall of the manor.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was sitting on a chair in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He was playing with the pocket watch in his hand, seemingly quite fond of it.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He took a closer look at the other party.</p><p></p><p>This was a handsome old man with frost at his temples, deep eyes, and an extraordinary bearing.</p><p></p><p>His complexion was very pale, giving the impression of being somewhat frail... but don't be deceived by his sickly appearance! He was a cultivator at the peak of the Qi Refining third layer, and followed the path of martial cultivation. He was one of the most powerful scattered cultivators in the White Cloud Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>In the Great Realm, he was a grandmaster of ancient martial arts at the pinnacle of the first rank.</p><p></p><p>There were none in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>None in Jia'an Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Probably not many in the Guangyue Province either! Moreover, Li Yan was not only at the pinnacle of the first rank, but also a cultivator at the Qi Refining third layer, so he could use spells and magical artifacts. His combat power was far beyond that of a first-rank grandmaster in the Great Realm, and he might even be comparable to the legendary martial dao masters.</p><p></p><p>If Li Yan lived in the Great Realm, he would undoubtedly be a greatly revered figure.</p><p></p><p>But in the cultivation world, he was just a relatively powerful scattered cultivator at the bottom tier.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Yu Xiao."</p><p></p><p>"What do you do?"</p><p></p><p>"I work in a spirit mine."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"As a miner, why do you suddenly want to learn martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao hesitated for a moment, then said, "Because I don't want to be a miner for the rest of my life. I want to see a broader world."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, young man, ambition is good, but you must act according to your abilities. Everyone has their own destiny, you can't force it."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan shook his head: "Well, even if you don't understand what I'm saying, I'll take you in as a registered disciple. But according to the rules, I'll only teach you for three months. Whether you can truly enter the door in the end depends on your own fate and abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"You pay the tuition, I teach the martial arts, it's just a transaction. You don't need to call me Master, just address me as Master Li."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Li!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough..." Li Yan suddenly broke into a violent coughing fit. He took out a bottle of elixir from his sleeve, quickly swallowed a pill, and his pale complexion became a little more ruddy. "Wei Biao, take him down and teach him the Spring Thunder Breathing Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man obeyed the order.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, Yu Xiao remained calm.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting for this day for too long.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

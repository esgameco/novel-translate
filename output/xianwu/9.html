        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the banquet.</p><p></p><p>Father and son Yu Guotai find Xu Xiao to talk.</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch said, "Reducing the land rent for the villagers is a great deed, but it may bring you some trouble. After all, there are still a few landlords in Xiaohe Town, and their land is also being cultivated by the villagers around..."</p><p></p><p>It's just like selling steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>They were selling well at two dollars each.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a troublemaker jumped out, insisting on selling them for one dollar each, or even giving them away for free. Isn't this causing trouble? Those landlords are unlikely to just sit back and watch!"</p><p></p><p>"Old patriarch, don't worry. Since I'm going to do this, I've already thought through the consequences and impact."</p><p></p><p>"A few local wealthy landlords don't dare to mess with you. In the future, how will you deal with the big sharks, warlords, and even the great imperial court, or even the Western powers? Even if you have to compromise a little, there's no need to compromise to such an extent. How can you establish a reputation if you're so timid?"</p><p></p><p>The old patriarch saw that Xu Xiao was not acting on impulse and was reassured.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao, although the landlords are not easy to deal with, we Yus are not to be trifled with either!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai said, "You've helped everyone so much. Whoever dares to go against you, the villagers won't let them off!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, uncle. By the way, how did those few things I mentioned the other day go?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai hurriedly said, "I've looked into the channels for buying guns in the county. Although it's not difficult to buy guns, the prices are really not cheap. I think it's better to send someone to Yangcheng to get the goods directly from the 'foreign devils'."</p><p></p><p>In the Guangyue province, with the convenience of the "free port", smuggling and trading of all kinds of goods is rampant. Now in the capital Yangcheng, trading companies and foreign firms are all engaged in smuggling business to varying degrees, some even making it their main business. Military supplies are undoubtedly the top priority for smugglers.</p><p></p><p>Every day, a large amount of military supplies are transshipped from Aocheng and Gangcheng into the inland. As long as you're willing to pay, you can get not only foreign guns, but even cannons.</p><p></p><p>This is also why banditry is rampant in Guangyue province.</p><p></p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, Xu Xiao temporarily chose to give up going to Yangcheng.</p><p></p><p>While it's true that more varieties and cheaper military supplies can be obtained there, as the wholesalers are those "foreign devils" and compradors, there are two risks:</p><p></p><p>First, the transportation risk. It's 700 li from Meixian to Yangcheng. If the news leaks out, the bandits will certainly swarm. Although the imperial court is decaying, it has not yet completely collapsed. The Great Dynasty's laws prohibit civilians from possessing guns, especially smuggling firearms. If caught, the consequences would be unimaginable, and he might even be accused of plotting a rebellion.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the local risk. This kind of business involves too many interests. Although the local channels are just second-hand dealers, they are basically all gangsters, local tyrants, or even officials. Bypassing them to directly purchase from the provincial capital will infringe on their interests. Xu Xiao is not afraid to offend a few small local landlords, but without sufficient strength and confidence, it's best not to get into conflicts with the tough ones.</p><p></p><p>On that day, with the help of Yu Qinghai, Xu Xiao met with several gang leaders and business owners. In the end, they purchased in batches a total of 15 Mauser military pistols and 8 Mauser M98 rifles, which were the most advanced imported goods at the time, with excellent firepower and performance.</p><p></p><p>The total cost was 1,050 silver dollars, with each pistol plus 400 rounds of ammunition costing 70 dollars, and each rifle plus 500 rounds costing 250 dollars.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bullets cost a total of 960 silver taels.</p><p></p><p>On average, each gun with 500 bullets costs 120 taels.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the above two types of firearms, 36 old shotguns and hunting rifles were also purchased this time. Although their power and quality are much inferior, the total cost, including the bullets, is less than 300 taels, less than 10 taels per unit.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen from this.</p><p></p><p>Imported goods are indeed expensive.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if you go to the city of Australia and buy directly from the red-haired foreigners,</p><p></p><p>The double-barreled shotgun would only cost a little over ten taels per piece, and the quantity and variety available would be even more.</p><p></p><p>Machine guns, cannons, and land mines are not a problem!</p><p></p><p>A lot of money was spent.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>With the two double-barreled shotguns strapped to his waist, walking on the streets of Mei County, his backbone became even straighter.</p><p></p><p>These two guns are enough to pose a huge threat to Xianxia practitioners who have not reached the Qi Refining Third Layer, especially when they have never seen firearms and are psychologically unprepared. A single shot can directly cause serious injury or even instant kill.</p><p></p><p>In the White Cloud Pavilion of the Main World, Qi Refining Third Layer is already the top-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>In other words, with these two guns in hand, Yu Xiao has the basic self-defense capability, and even if he faces the scattered Xianxia practitioners in the Pavilion Market, he can hold his head high and no longer need to be overly cautious.</p><p></p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p>[Reputation +1!]</p><p></p><p>After buying the guns, his reputation has increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although the purchases were made in batches, the quantity was a bit too much for this small place, inevitably attracting some attention, which is why he gained the increase in reputation.</p><p></p><p>"There is a human market in Mei County, do you want to go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai said, "You have already become a landlord, you should have some servants to command."</p><p></p><p>Human market?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The estates of the great kings and ministers have long been practicing the custom of keeping slaves, and since the founding of the country, the normal buying and selling of the lowly people has been allowed, with "human markets" established, alongside horse markets, cattle markets, and sheep markets.</p><p></p><p>In the late years of the dynasty, when the people were living in misery,</p><p></p><p>There were many who sold their children and daughters just to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Human markets" naturally flourished everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only the kings and ministers, but even ordinary landlord families keeping dozens of servants and maids is a very normal thing.</p><p></p><p>And this kind of human trade market with sales contracts as valid certificates is still legal and compliant.</p><p></p><p>Most people sell themselves voluntarily, just to have a meal to eat.</p><p></p><p>Or the family is too poor to support them.</p><p></p><p>They just want to find a good family for their children.</p><p></p><p>These things are shocking to modern people, but in the old times, under the feudal society, whenever there was war or great disaster, the scene of starving corpses everywhere would make the talk of human rights and freedom seem ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Since there are legal and compliant human markets,</p><p></p><p>There are naturally also illegal human trafficking and even smuggling abroad.</p><p></p><p>The source of these illegally traded humans is mostly obtained through forcible seizure, deception, and enticement, and they are subjected to beatings, abuse, and starvation, their tragic fate even worse than that of black slaves!</p><p></p><p>According to Yu Xiao's understanding,</p><p></p><p>There are two types of sales contracts: living contracts and dead contracts.</p><p></p><p>Living contracts are the very common long-term workers in the old society.</p><p></p><p>This type of contract is for ten or twenty years, not much different from servants, and if they encounter bad masters, they are treated like livestock. The only difference is that they can decide whether to stay or leave at the end of the term, and some who do well can even redeem themselves early.</p><p></p><p>As for the dead contracts, it is pure slavery.</p><p></p><p>In this case, even the name and surname have to be changed, and from then on they become the private property of the master. Although the Great Landscape laws have protections for the lives and rights of household slaves, in most cases, even if someone dies, the local yamen (local government office) is too lazy to bother.</p><p></p><p>According to the current market price,</p><p></p><p>A healthy, not yet grown-up boy, or an ordinary-looking girl, the market price is around 10 taels.</p><p></p><p>A young and strong laborer with a skill, or a girl with a relatively outstanding appearance, the market price is around 30 taels.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos of the times,</p><p></p><p>Human life is so cheap.</p><p></p><p>With his noble and young appearance, Yu Xiao entered the human market.</p><p></p><p>Many people rushed to try to sell themselves, even fighting each other.</p><p></p><p>Whoever sells, as long as it's to a good master, their life can be a little better.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yu Xiao also sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, he not only wants to buy, but to buy in large quantities.</p><p></p><p>He has an almost unlimited lifespan and an endless supply of money, so he can pick and choose from them, and cultivate a truly loyal following, which may become the key to establishing his power and expanding his reputation in the future.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

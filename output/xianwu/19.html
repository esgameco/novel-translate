        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>On the main street.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was sitting in a large sedan chair carried by eight people, surrounded by four maids, twenty attendants, and several masters.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople respectfully made way and performed obeisance.</p><p></p><p>They were filled with reverence from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The small town was not large, with only one street where all the shops and stores were concentrated. A quarter of them belonged to Yu Xiao, and the surrounding ten-li and eight counties, over 3,500 acres of land, were all his personal property.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that.</p><p></p><p>The livelihoods and lifelines.</p><p></p><p>Of the entire town were in Yu Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>A single word from him could cause countless people to lose their jobs.</p><p></p><p>A single thought of his could affect the livelihood of thousands.</p><p></p><p>A mere gesture of his could make the young ladies of the surrounding villages scramble to line up at his door, and a single order from him would have many working tirelessly for him.</p><p></p><p>In this small area.</p><p></p><p>He wielded more influence than the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>Even the county magistrate Ye did not dare to do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>What is a "local emperor"? This is what a "local emperor" is!</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao never abused his power. Instead, he engaged in extensive philanthropy, reduced rents, and was generous, appearing to treat money as worthless as dirt. It is precisely because of this that his reputation has been steadily increasing.</p><p></p><p>Current reputation value: 349/400.</p><p></p><p>About to reach 350 and continue growing.</p><p></p><p>However, the growth rate is slowing down, and it is estimated to stagnate around 370-380.</p><p></p><p>There is still a gap.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is not significant.</p><p></p><p>Once the Stone Tiger Stronghold is exploited, a new wave of growth will be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The higher the reputation level.</p><p></p><p>The more blessings he will receive.</p><p></p><p>This is of utmost importance to Yu Xiao!</p><p></p><p>Maid Xiao Mei: "Master, we have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao arrived at the Yu Family Charity Hall he had founded.</p><p></p><p>The twenty attendants and porters began to unload various supplies.</p><p></p><p>The charity hall currently shelters nearly 300 children, most of whom were purchased from child traffickers, and some are orphans or destitute children from the Yu Family Village.</p><p></p><p>The charity hall has been in operation for a month.</p><p></p><p>It is now running smoothly.</p><p></p><p>These children in the hall have food to eat, books to read, and can even practice martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Although they are young, they have all experienced hardship and know how difficult life outside can be. They are extremely grateful for their current life and hold their adoptive father, the benefactor, in high esteem and admiration.</p><p></p><p>"The benefactor has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, come out to welcome him!"</p><p></p><p>"Greet the benefactor! Greet the benefactor!"</p><p></p><p>The children rushed out, their faces filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao has been coming to visit every few days over the past month, and each time he brings the children small gifts. With the sincere education provided by the teachers, his prestige and authority in the children's eyes have been steadily increasing.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>A seventy-year-old man with a white beard and wearing reading glasses came out. </p><p></p><p>This person is one of the clan elders of the Yu family, Yu Guozhong, the younger paternal uncle of the old clan leader. He also has the title of "xiucai" (literary scholar) and is currently one of the managers of the Yu Family Charity Hall.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao said, "I've come to check on everyone. The children are at the stage of rapid growth, and I'm worried that their nutrition may not be keeping up, so I've brought fifty chickens from the countryside. Please have the kitchen prepare them as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The children's eyes lit up, and they were eagerly swallowing their saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Xiao, you are so thoughtful!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Guozhong was filled with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The Yu clan is indeed fortunate to have such a remarkable person!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "I've also brought some paper and writing supplies for the children. As long as they perform well, they can go to the provincial capital's university or even study abroad in the West in the future!"</p><p></p><p>In addition to the paper and writing supplies, there were also candies and other small gifts that the children liked.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the children lined up excitedly to receive their gifts.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was very satisfied with the scene.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he noticed a child who stood out from the rest.</p><p></p><p>A young girl, about eight or nine years old, with fair, delicate skin, large eyes, and a beautiful appearance. She did not seem to be from a poor family.</p><p></p><p>"This child is..."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, this is little Yue'er!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang hurriedly stepped forward to explain: "I brought her from the provincial capital. Since she didn't have any playmates, and I didn't have much time to take care of her, I temporarily placed her here."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Master Tang is a loyal and righteous man.</p><p></p><p>His entire family was persecuted and killed by the foreigners. Yue is the only one left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An only daughter.</p><p></p><p>And this is also the reason why Yu Xiao can use him with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Master Tang has always been very concerned about his daughter's mental health.</p><p></p><p>After all,</p><p></p><p>That was such a brutal incident.</p><p></p><p>Even adults find it difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a child under the age of nine?</p><p></p><p>It's likely to have a significant impact on her personality!</p><p></p><p>At this time, he saw that the Yijian Hall had a large group of children of about the same age, and most of them also had tragic backgrounds. But here, not only could they study and practice martial arts, the atmosphere was also optimistic and uplifting, so he also sent his daughter here.</p><p></p><p>He hopes that the child can make some sisterly friends here.</p><p></p><p>And have a normal and happy childhood.</p><p></p><p>It's really heartfelt.</p><p></p><p>Tang Yue respectfully bowed and said in a childish voice, "Yue pays respects to the master!"</p><p></p><p>This child seems to have matured much earlier than her peers, not only because she has been raised in a wealthy family, but more importantly, she may have experienced or even witnessed some cruel events.</p><p></p><p>"Yue, from today on, this is your home."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked Little Zhu to bring some candy and a beautiful Western mirror, "For our first meeting, this is a small gift, please feel free to accept it."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a teacher came up.</p><p></p><p>Liao Zhen, a fifth-rank expert, is one of the eight teachers of the Yu family mansion. </p><p></p><p>Master Liao's personal strength is second only to Tang Yang and Wang Zhong. He comes from a large martial arts school in Fucheng, is proficient in various martial arts, and has rich teaching experience. He is currently the chief martial arts teacher of the Yijian Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao nodded slightly and asked, "Are there any suitable martial arts talents?"</p><p></p><p>Liao Zhen immediately said, "There are quite a few good talents, especially one called Yu Daniu, who is likely to be a rare martial arts genius."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Is that so? Bring him over for me to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>A ten-year-old boy was called over.</p><p></p><p>This is a simple-looking young man who is dark and thin, but his hands are already calloused, showing that he has experienced a lot of hardship in the past.</p><p></p><p>"Yiyi...yi father!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Daniu didn't expect to be summoned alone by the master he admired and was grateful for. He was excited, his eyes wet and his face flushed red, but because he was not good with words, he couldn't say a word for a long time, and finally just knelt on the ground and kowtowed three times.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao personally reached out to check his pulse.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, this thin and dark little boy actually already has a trace of strong qi circulating in his body.</p><p></p><p>"How long has he been practicing?"</p><p></p><p>"About 14 days."</p><p></p><p>What? Able to reach this level in just two weeks? Then in two months, he should be able to have his qi fully circulated and become a true martial arts practitioner! This boy is only just over ten years old, his physique has not fully developed yet, and he doesn't have proper nutrition, cultivation methods, or supplements, but he can still practice to this extent?</p><p></p><p>What is a martial arts genius?</p><p></p><p>This is the true martial arts genius! "Not bad, he just looks a bit too thin, have the kitchen prepare more meat dishes for Daniu in the future to quickly build up his physique."</p><p></p><p>Yu Daniu was so excited he couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao patted his shoulder, "Keep practicing, and when you reach the inner realm, I'll personally teach you better martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, yi father!"</p><p></p><p>"Daniu will definitely work hard!"</p><p></p><p>"Daniu will never disappoint yi father!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Daniu is a true orphan, having experienced the torment of being sold by human traffickers. It was not until he encountered yi father and came to this Yijian Hall that his life finally took a turn for the better.</p><p></p><p>In fact,</p><p></p><p>He has no interest in martial arts or studying.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he likes is his current life.</p><p></p><p>Yu Daniu has no ambition or dreams, and has never thought of becoming a master.</p><p></p><p>His greatest wish and desire is to be able to stay in the Yijian Hall forever, and his greatest pursuit is to hope that he can satisfy yi father.</p><p></p><p>This is not only his gratitude towards yi father,</p><p></p><p>But also a deep-rooted sense of insecurity within him.</p><p></p><p>In the past, in order not to starve to death, he had to do a lot of work every day, even when he had a high fever.</p><p></p><p>Once, he ate a moldy bun and was mercilessly beaten by the human traffickers, bedridden for several days, almost losing his life.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know why he deserves this current life.</p><p></p><p>Now it's good.</p><p></p><p>He has a goal!</p><p></p><p>Since yi father likes me to practice martial arts! Since practicing martial arts can make yi father happy!</p><p></p><p>Then I'll practice hard! Day and night! No matter how difficult, I won't be afraid! (End of chapter)</p>

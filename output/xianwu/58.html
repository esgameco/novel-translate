        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if someone had comprehended the martial way since the beginning of civilization, the foundation that could be developed would still be limited.</p><p></p><p>How many years of civilization does the immortal cultivation world have?</p><p></p><p>This is probably something no one can say for sure! Many immortal cultivation families and sects have histories spanning thousands or tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore,</p><p></p><p>Whether in terms of historical foundation and depth,</p><p></p><p>Or the quality and scale of talent,</p><p></p><p>The Dajing world cannot compare to even one millionth of the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The martial way does not require spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people can all cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>There are countless mundane countries in the immortal cultivation world, with innumerable martial artists, a base number tens of thousands of times that of immortal cultivators! Countless martial arts have been passed down from ancient times to the present, and most of these martial arts have undergone hundreds or thousands of years of continuous iteration and improvement, so one can imagine their quality.</p><p></p><p>The secret manuals in Yu Xiao's hands,</p><p></p><p>If exchanged in an era before the rise of firearms, the publication of any one of them would surely have sparked a bloody storm, causing countless martial arts masters and sects to fight to the death over them! Even in recent years,</p><p></p><p>As firearms have become increasingly powerful,</p><p></p><p>Various factions have reduced their emphasis on martial prowess.</p><p></p><p>These secret manuals can still be treasures of the martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>They were all thrown here like trash.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples came in and out of the martial arts gym.</p><p></p><p>These people who came to learn martial arts didn't even give them a second glance.</p><p></p><p>This is normal, as this is the immortal cultivation world, where martial arts manuals are not valuable!</p><p></p><p>When Old Li was still around, the tuition for Spring Thunder Martial Arts Gym was just 1 spirit stone, and they even accepted gold and other equivalents as payment. This fee wasn't even for the martial arts itself, but for at least three months of educational services from Old Li and the gym.</p><p></p><p>Spring Thunder Fist, like other martial arts,</p><p></p><p>Is not valuable in itself.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao carried a stack of secret manuals back to his residence, then habitually activated his perception technique to sense his surroundings. Only after confirming there was no one nearby did he bring the pile of manuals into the stone hall space.</p><p></p><p>First, he placed the manuals in the stone hall.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao certainly wouldn't release all these manuals at once, but would copy them section by section, then use them as bait to attract top martial artists from the provincial capital and even the whole world.</p><p></p><p>These old fellows,</p><p></p><p>Who have practiced martial arts all their lives,</p><p></p><p>Are mostly uncompromising martial arts fanatics.</p><p></p><p>They have limited lifespans and may not be interested in material enjoyment, so no amount of money may be able to move them.</p><p></p><p>But if these unheard of, unseen exquisite martial arts are used as bargaining chips, how many old fogeys in this world could resist the temptation? Once they have something to ask of him, difficult matters will become easy to handle!</p><p></p><p>Back in Dajing,</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao officially emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He announced the news of his successful breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong, Lei Changfeng and others all showed shocked expressions once again!</p><p></p><p>"He broke through?"</p><p></p><p>"So quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"I see Young Master Yu as having more than just the potential of a Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>"Could he possibly be aiming for the legendary..."</p><p></p><p>The several masters stared at each other wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>A concept burst forth in their minds: Martial Saint!</p><p></p><p>What is a Martial Saint?</p><p></p><p>This is a legendary realm! Almost every era has Grandmasters presiding.</p><p></p><p>In other words, experts at the Grandmaster level appear at most once every few decades. In some prosperous eras with flourishing martial arts, or in times like now with dense populations and advancing productivity, it's entirely possible for several Grandmaster-level experts to appear simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>A Martial Saint is different! This is a realm said to transcend Grandmasters! It's said that one appears only every few hundred or even nearly a thousand years! Yu Xiao started practicing martial arts in May or June last year, and in just about a year's time, he went from a complete novice to a fifth-rank expert, breaking through realms as easily as drinking water.</p><p></p><p>At this rate,</p><p></p><p>Reaching Grandmaster is without doubt!</p><p></p><p>If he can achieve Grandmaster within five years,</p><p></p><p>He may truly be able to touch that legendary realm!...</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao noticed,</p><p></p><p>After entering the fifth rank,</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong, Lei Changfeng and other guards became increasingly reverent towards him. Yu Xiao was very satisfied with this, and he had no intention of being low-key in martial arts matters. This prestige in the martial arts world...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not only could it increase Yu Xiao's prestige, but it would also make it easier for him to consolidate the martial arts world in the future.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yu Xiao planned to increase the training of young martial artists like Wang Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Xiao would be able to recruit a large number of experts in the near future, whether these people could be trusted still needed further examination. In the short term, it was still more reassuring to use the people around him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Yu Ruqian received some exciting news:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiao, we've received a letter from the manager of 'Hundred Herbs Hall'. This manager claims to have a thousand-year-old ginseng root."</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Herbs Hall? Is it reliable?"</p><p></p><p>"It's one of the top-ranked herb shops in the provincial capital, with an excellent reputation and fame. I think it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao immediately took it seriously and said, "Then set up a time. I'll meet with them in person. The sooner the better!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian quickly arranged it.</p><p></p><p>They would meet for talks at Lianxiang Restaurant tomorrow noon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao walked out of Qinglong Lane.</p><p></p><p>He was followed by two people - one scholar and one warrior.</p><p></p><p>The scholar was Yu Ruqian, wearing a long gown and glasses, looking very refined.</p><p></p><p>The warrior was Lei Changfeng, carrying an ox-tail saber and a revolver at his waist, responsible for security.</p><p></p><p>It was only a short six or seven hundred meters from the alley to Shangxiajiu Road, which was the most famous commercial street in the provincial capital, divided into Upper Nine Road and Lower Nine Road - actually two streets.</p><p></p><p>The two streets ran parallel to each other with many intersections allowing passage between them.</p><p></p><p>After Western powers opened up the Great Jing Country's trading ports, the once-thriving Thirteen Hong Street declined due to trade monopolies. Currently, Shangxiajiu Road had become the busiest commercial street in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>This street also had a long history.</p><p></p><p>It had been a commercial hub as early as the 6th century.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Shangxiajiu pedestrian street was 1,237 meters long, with buildings in a unique South Asian arcade style, providing spacious business areas for merchants and shelter from sun and rain for pedestrians.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yu Xiao strolled among them.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were bustling, with a constant flow of people.</p><p></p><p>There were Westerners in suits, wealthy merchants in fine silk clothes, and glamorous Xiguan ladies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also eager-faced peddlers, rickshaw pullers covered in sweat, disheveled beggars, as well as emaciated opium addicts with lifeless eyes.</p><p></p><p>The shops here were extremely dense, with a wide variety of categories and distinct local characteristics everywhere.</p><p></p><p>As Yu Xiao walked along, he saw many traditional crafts on display, such as silk and ceramics. He also saw Cantonese opera performances set up by merchants to attract customers. Even small vendors were creative and racking their brains to attract customers.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a kind of pickled white olive that was a very popular snack at the time.</p><p></p><p>These olive vendors, in order to attract customers, wore huge paper-mache roosters on their bodies, then played suona horns as they paraded through the streets. The olives they sold were all inside the rooster's body, with flavors for customers to choose from, commonly known as "rooster olives".</p><p></p><p>Similar features and folk customs could be seen everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Setting aside the darkness and ignorance of the era, such street scenes full of period and regional characteristics were much more interesting than the copy-paste internet-famous pedestrian streets and towns of his previous life. At least there were enough unique features and sense of the times to make people feel fresh, interesting, and fun.</p><p></p><p>But Yu Xiao wasn't here for sightseeing.</p><p></p><p>He arrived at Lianxiang Restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Yu, I am Bao Jinyu. I've long admired your reputation!" An elderly man in a long gown appeared before him, with two large men by his side. This was the manager of Hundred Herbs Hall.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, they sat down to talk.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao got straight to the point: "I'd like to see the herb first."</p><p></p><p>Bao Jinyu nodded and had his attendant bring forward an exquisite box. Even before it was opened, Yu Xiao could already sense an exceptionally abundant and pure spiritual energy emanating from it!</p><p></p><p>Very good!</p><p></p><p>Even without looking, he could judge the value of this medicine! Even if it wasn't exactly a thousand years old, it must be close.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's heart stirred. With the help of this medicine, there would be no need to bother cultivating to the fourth rank. Breaking through to the second level of Qi Refining would be as easy as turning over his hand!</p><p></p><p>(PS: It's the end of the month, please cast your monthly votes! They'll be useless if you don't use them now!)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

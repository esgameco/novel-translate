        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Its destructive power was enough to destroy armor or breach fortified defenses.</p><p></p><p>After being blasted into a bloody mess, the Ghost-faced Bat Demon let out a shrill scream and turned to flee. The other Blood Monkey Bats were agitated by this and became even more frenzied, swarming forward as if to avenge their leader.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao raised two Madsen light machine guns. The next moment, flames erupted from the muzzles as a dense hail of bullets sprayed towards the bat swarms in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Rat-tat-tat! Rat-tat-tat! Under the mad barrage!</p><p></p><p>Red-hot bullets mercilessly tore through flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Monkey Bats wailed and screeched incessantly as they fell one after another.</p><p></p><p>One burst of fire.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Blood Monkey Bats.</p><p></p><p>At least 30-40 were killed!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao reloaded and continued firing madly.</p><p></p><p>Soon he had killed another dozen or two.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a brutal assault, even with their low intelligence, the Blood Monkey Bats now knew the danger. Driven by survival instinct, they began to flee.</p><p></p><p>The ducks were cooked.</p><p></p><p>How could he let these feathered beasts fly away? Yu Xiao wasn't about to let them off.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother! Cover me! We'll fight our way out!"</p><p></p><p>He reloaded and walked out of the defensive area, firing as he went, pursuing the bat swarms to hunt them down. The Blood Monkey Bats were shot at and scattered everywhere, not a single one daring to resist anymore! Not to mention Lü Lingyun.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was also stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother is like a god descending to earth!"</p><p></p><p>He was only at the first level of Qi Refinement, yet with his strength alone, he suppressed over a hundred Blood Monkey Bats, chasing and beating these ferocious beasts. This scene was too shocking!</p><p></p><p>After the brief shock.</p><p></p><p>Wild joy welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao hurried over to protect him.</p><p></p><p>So that Yu Xiao could hunt down the Blood Monkey Bats without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao fired through eight magazines in one go. The ground was covered with a foul stench and the corpses of Blood Monkey Bats. At least 90% had been eliminated, with the rest hiding who knows where in nooks and crannies, at least not daring to come out for a while.</p><p></p><p>Soon after.</p><p></p><p>He found the Ghost-faced Bat Demon.</p><p></p><p>This guy's vitality was really tenacious.</p><p></p><p>After taking a point-blank grenade and being hit by several rounds from the light machine gun, it still hadn't died? But it was on its last legs, no longer a threat at this point.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado.</p><p></p><p>He took out his Mauser pistol.</p><p></p><p>And emptied the magazine into it.</p><p></p><p>The Ghost-faced Bat Demon was finally done for.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao exclaimed excitedly: "We're really going to get rich this time!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Please collect the spoils, Senior Brother. I'll go check on Fellow Daoist Lü's situation."</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao immediately got to work.</p><p></p><p>When Yu Xiao came to Lü Lingyun's side.</p><p></p><p>He saw Lü Song lying flat on the ground, eyes tightly shut, having breathed his last.</p><p></p><p>Dead?</p><p></p><p>The injuries were still too severe!</p><p></p><p>Wounded by magical weapons, with sword energy lingering, the wounds were difficult to heal.</p><p></p><p>Even though Lü Lingyun was skilled in healing spells, she was helpless in the face of such serious injuries. Add to that Lü Song's own depleted magical power, which accelerated the loss of vital energy, and in the end he couldn't pull through.</p><p></p><p>"My condolences!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had nothing else to say.</p><p></p><p>No one could have anticipated something like this happening.</p><p></p><p>But after going through this operation, Yu Xiao would be more careful in the future.</p><p></p><p>In this world.</p><p></p><p>There are all kinds of people!</p><p></p><p>Sometimes when traveling, the most dangerous things are not fierce beasts, but rather one's own kind or even companions!</p><p></p><p>In the future, he would need to maintain a degree of vigilance towards everyone, especially when teaming up with cultivators of unknown origins. He would have to sleep with one eye open.</p><p></p><p>Traces of tears remained on Lü Lingyun's face.</p><p></p><p>She had clearly already cried.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, Lü Song wasn't my brother, just a servant in my household. He watched over me since I was little... After my mother was killed by evil people and I was expelled from the family, he was the only one willing to stay by my side."</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun, at such a young age, had reached the third level of Qi Refinement and possessed precious magical artifacts for protection. She most likely came from some cultivator family.</p><p></p><p>How could someone like that appear in Baiyun Town?</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao wasn't interested at all.</p><p>He didn't want to inquire about it either.</p><p>He was just a minor independent cultivator.</p><p>He didn't want to get involved in any family feuds.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Song, you can rest in peace. Lingyun will take good care of herself!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Lingyun bowed to Lü Song's corpse, then cupped her hands towards Yu Xiao: "Thank you, fellow Daoist, for coming to my rescue. I, Lü Lingyun, owe you my life!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just mutual help, getting through difficulties together."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao finished counting.</p><p>He came back to report the situation.</p><p>"Including our previous hunt, we've killed a total of 124 blood monkey bats this time!"</p><p></p><p>124 blood monkey bats.</p><p>That means 124 blood essence stones!</p><p>How many blood essence pills could be refined from these? Wei Biao never thought that just one hunt could bring in so much income! Besides the 124 ordinary blood essence stones, they also obtained a high-grade blood essence stone from the ghost-faced bat demon, which was far more valuable than the former and could even be used to refine blood marrow pills.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p>It's the blood marrow pill that Li Yan used!</p><p></p><p>The three of them collected the blood essence stones and some materials, as well as several hundred spirit herbs and medicinal plants. Then, carrying Lü Song's remains, they left the cave and returned to the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, we see daylight again!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't have time to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>A sharp killing intent came from the forest ahead.</p><p></p><p>"There's an ambush!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of green light flew out from the woods.</p><p>Wei Biao was prepared and immediately threw a punch, deflecting the green sword light with his iron gauntlet.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Although he deflected the attack,</p><p>The gauntlet also shattered.</p><p>The sharpness of the green sword light was evident.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive? How surprising!"</p><p></p><p>A peculiar voice came from the forest, and then they saw the green sword light return to a young man in green robes.</p><p>This person was none other than</p><p>Jiang Hao, who had been waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>"Look at your miserable state. Even if you've saved your lives, you must be exhausted!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao said, "My spiritual power has fully recovered. If we were to fight, you'd be no match. Why don't you hand over the goods obediently? Perhaps you can still keep your lives."</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao angrily rebuked, "You ungrateful dog, have you truly lost all shame for such petty gains?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao sneered, "What do you think cultivation is?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation is fighting against heaven, against people, against all things. Taking from the weak to supplement the strong, survival of the fittest, life and death struggles, all for a slim chance!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao's expression twisted, "My Jiang family, three generations and nine cultivators - my grandfather, parents, uncles, elder brother, all died untimely deaths because they were too weak... And you, you're blocking my path, hindering my opportunity, so you must die!"</p><p></p><p>Not one can be left alive! Starting with Wei Biao! Jiang Hao summoned his green sword light again.</p><p>He was about to gather all his strength to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had already raised his light machine gun and sprayed a burst of bullets directly at Jiang Hao. At least seven or eight bullets hit, with several striking vital areas like the heart.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao just heard a series of rapid fire sounds.</p><p>Then he felt as if he'd been struck by a giant hammer.</p><p>His body involuntarily fell backward.</p><p>His green clothes were quickly dyed red.</p><p>He stared with wide eyes, full of disbelief, feeling like he had become a leaking kettle, with large amounts of life force irreversibly flowing out.</p><p></p><p>What's happening?</p><p>Am I dying? In his daze, Jiang Hao returned to his childhood.</p><p>He saw his grandfather's stern old face again.</p><p></p><p>"Hao'er, remember, cultivation is a great struggle. You must use every means necessary to fight for a chance at immortality, to fight for opportunity. If you win, you advance; if you lose, you perish."</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather, it seems I've lost this time..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Hao had long thought this day would come.</p><p>Everyone yearns for immortal cultivation.</p><p>Yet they don't know the cruelty of the cultivation world.</p><p>Cultivators are as numerous as fish crossing a river.</p><p>In the end, how many can die peacefully?</p><p>He just couldn't believe he would die at the hands of an insignificant nobody! Jiang Hao's family heirloom, the green sword light, lost its magical power and fell straight down, embedding itself in front of Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

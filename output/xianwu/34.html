        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This meeting.</p><p></p><p>The gains and significance were not small.</p><p></p><p>Magistrate Ye could now be considered one of their own.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's contact with the Daxia Society planted a crucial seed. In the future, relying on this organization, they might truly be able to accomplish great and moving deeds that would shake the world!</p><p></p><p>It would not only bring benefits.</p><p></p><p>It would also be an interesting thing.</p><p></p><p>The path of immortality is long.</p><p></p><p>Time flows endlessly.</p><p></p><p>One must always seek out meaningful things to do.</p><p></p><p>To witness with one's own eyes its sprouting, vigorous growth, and eventual abundant fruition.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After that.</p><p></p><p>Life returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>For Yu Xiao, twenty days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The life of traversing between two worlds was still quite leisurely.</p><p></p><p>After successfully cultivating qi.</p><p></p><p>The bottleneck in martial arts clearly loosened.</p><p></p><p>So he focused his cultivation efforts on breaking through in blood energy.</p><p></p><p>After all, before reaching the middle stage of blood refinement in martial arts, given his aptitude, it would be very difficult to make progress in qi cultivation. Therefore, there was no need to waste too much time on the Green Wood Technique, just a bit of daily reinforcement was enough.</p><p></p><p>Of course.</p><p></p><p>With his newfound powers.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao also wanted to find some magic techniques to practice.</p><p></p><p>However, very unfortunately, the Spring Thunder Martial Arts Hall had no magical inheritance.</p><p></p><p>If Yu Xiao wanted to learn magic, he would first have to save up enough spirit stones, then find independent cultivators in town who specialized in teaching magic, or purchase more rigorous and reliable magic manuals through official channels.</p><p></p><p>In comparison.</p><p></p><p>His martial arts progressed smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Due to successfully reaching the first layer of qi cultivation, along with the abundant medicinal and nutritional supplements in the Dajing world, plus the rotating guidance and sparring from Masters Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, and senior apprentice brother Wei Biao.</p><p></p><p>Without too much effort.</p><p></p><p>He successfully refined his second extraordinary meridian.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao officially broke through to become a seventh-rank martial artist of Dajing!</p><p></p><p>Up to now.</p><p></p><p>Time elapsed in the two worlds: Just over 4 months in Dajing.</p><p>Just over 5 months in the main world.</p><p></p><p>In other words, at this moment it had only been about 10 months since activating the dual-world gate, and he was already a cultivator at the first layer of qi refinement and seventh rank of blood energy!</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of top-tier geniuses.</p><p></p><p>This might still be an unremarkable achievement.</p><p></p><p>But for someone with average aptitude, or even below average, even counting all 10 months, this speed could be called miraculous!</p><p></p><p>And in the eyes of his several masters in Dajing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had only been practicing martial arts for 4-5 months in total.</p><p></p><p>In less than half a year he went from a complete novice to a seventh-rank expert!</p><p></p><p>If this speed wasn't that of a super genius, what was it? It was not inferior compared to most grandmasters in history!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Young Yu had the potential to become a grandmaster?!</p><p></p><p>The masters felt even deeper respect in their hearts! After all, if they could witness the rise of a grandmaster, and become trusted confidants of this grandmaster, what an honor that would be!</p><p></p><p>On this day.</p><p></p><p>As usual.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his daily basic cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao used his free time to read books and newspapers to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Lan who was reading the newspaper exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're in the newspaper again, this time on the front page of the Yangcheng Daily!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had accepted interviews from nearly ten newspapers in the past.</p><p></p><p>So far he had appeared in many major papers, but opportunities to be on the front page were rare.</p><p></p><p>The Yangcheng Daily was one of the highest circulation newspapers in Guangyue Province. If he could appear on the front page of this paper, it would be extremely beneficial for spreading Yu Xiao's personal reputation!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>The headline of the Yangcheng Daily's front page was "Meixian's Legendary Figure Yu Xiao: The Extraordinary Life of a Bandit-Suppressing Hero, Returned Talent, and Great Philanthropist".</p><p></p><p>Reading further.</p><p></p><p>It was quite extensive.</p><p></p><p>There were actually over a thousand words written.</p><p></p><p>The article began with a brief introduction of Yu Xiao's background, then focused on his bandit-suppressing exploits, charitable achievements, and plans for developing industry to strengthen the nation.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to describe the entire piece as singing his praises.</p><p></p><p>There was even a half-body photograph.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Although limited by current printing technology, the photo was rather blurry and not very clear, it still couldn't hide his handsome and dashing appearance! Not bad, it was worth Yu Ruqian's busy efforts, wining and dining these reporters for several days, and giving each a red envelope and local specialties as parting gifts.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao checked his reputation.</p><p></p><p>Current reputation: 956/1000!</p><p></p><p>In recent days, as the heat and impact of the Shihu Stronghold incident gradually subsided, his reputation growth had also slowed more and more. When it reached just over 900, it basically came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today it suddenly rose by fifty points! It seems that after this matter was reported in detail by mainstream newspapers, it once again broke through and spread more widely, probably attracting the attention of more social classes and important figures.</p><p></p><p>Another day passed. When Yu Xiao looked again.</p><p></p><p>The prestige level had successfully broken through.</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>Name: Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation: Qi Refinement First Layer.</p><p></p><p>Prestige: 1001/2000 (Famous in the Region).</p><p></p><p>Luck Growth: 3 points per year.</p><p></p><p>Current Luck: 89.</p><p></p><p>————</p><p></p><p>From the initial "Nobody" to "Somewhat Famous," then to "Rising Star," and now "Famous in the Region."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had essentially risen three levels.</p><p></p><p>Now the annual luck growth had reached 3 points.</p><p></p><p>Although the luck growth rate was still not fast, he believed that as the prestige level further increased, the luck growth span of subsequent levels would become larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts entered the seventh rank.</p><p></p><p>Prestige rose two levels consecutively.</p><p></p><p>This made Yu Xiao feel pleased.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian reminded him at this time: "You have an appointment with the various herb shop owners, today is the day to meet them."</p><p></p><p>Ever since finding a spirit energy-containing old ginseng among the spoils from Stone Tiger Fortress some time ago, he had been looking for similar herbs, so he contacted these herb merchants.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was not only looking for herbs.</p><p></p><p>He was also searching for records about ancient Qi cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although the latter records were very rare, some clues could still be found in some pre-Qin classics.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that ancient Qi cultivators really did exist.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly good news.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had always been worried about exposing his magic in Da Jing, wondering if he might be seen as a monster or anomaly. It would be bad if ill-intentioned people stirred up public opinion against him.</p><p></p><p>Now.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to worry anymore.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the ancient Qi cultivators were extinct.</p><p></p><p>But as long as this group once existed.</p><p></p><p>In the future, Yu Xiao could completely legitimize the techniques learned from the main world under this identity. Even if his magic was exposed in the future, it wouldn't lead to an unexplainable situation.</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had been openly seeking to buy various herbs.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, it was to collect spirit herbs to accelerate his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it was also to lay the groundwork for his future persona as an "inheritor of ancient Qi cultivators."</p><p></p><p>About an hour later.</p><p></p><p>He met with six herb shop owners.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Yu!"</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhao Youde from Zhao's Herb Shop, I've long heard of your great reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>These herb shop owners were ordinary herb merchants. When they met a public figure and wealthy tycoon like Yu Xiao, they naturally showed utmost respect and dared not be negligent.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't waste words.</p><p></p><p>He asked them to bring out the herbs.</p><p></p><p>These herb merchants all had some prized goods saved up.</p><p></p><p>For example, ginseng, lingzhi, and polygonum multiflorum that were over a hundred or even several hundred years old. They now had their attendants display them, giving elaborate explanations.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao only took a glance.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Although a few items did contain some spirit energy, their quality was far from reaching the level of spirit herbs. They could only be used to assist cultivation or recover magical power, and it was basically impossible to quickly increase cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Oh well.</p><p></p><p>It's better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao offered three times the market price.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the average price was only two to three hundred silver dollars.</p><p></p><p>The herb shop owners immediately happily presented the herbs.</p><p></p><p>Such a transaction.</p><p></p><p>Was by no means a loss.</p><p></p><p>Because herbs of the same quality, if purchased in Baiyun District, would be worth several spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao believed.</p><p></p><p>This world must be able to nurture higher quality spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Mei County was too small, and it wasn't easy to buy good products.</p><p></p><p>If in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>That would definitely be different.</p><p></p><p>Yangcheng was prosperous and developed in commerce.</p><p></p><p>Domestic and foreign goods converged there.</p><p></p><p>And various dignitaries, celebrities, and big shots gathered there.</p><p></p><p>What couldn't be bought in such a place? Yu Xiao felt that he should put the plan to go to the provincial capital on the agenda!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Guangfu Brewery.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of workers surrounded a man in a long robe.</p><p></p><p>"Boss!"</p><p></p><p>"We know you're in a difficult situation!"</p><p></p><p>"But we're struggling too!"</p><p></p><p>"If wages aren't paid in full again, we'll have no choice but to quit!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, my whole family's livelihood depends on me. I can't let my children go hungry!"</p><p></p><p>"This month's back wages must be settled. Even if it's only 80%, we'll accept it. We understand your difficulties, boss, but please also understand our hardships!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The owner of Guangfu Old Liquor was called Zheng Baokun.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the brewery had been operating at a severe loss and owed large amounts of external debt. It had long been unable to pay the workers' wages.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Zheng Baokun was a kind-hearted person. He sold off most of his family assets to pay the workers partial wages. So even though they were now collectively demanding their pay, the workers were quite polite and didn't take excessive actions.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was speaking up to demand their wages, suddenly a sharp voice rang out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, do you really have the heart to let one or two hundred old colleagues in the factory lose their jobs?"</p><p></p><p>A burly man stepped forward. </p><p></p><p>This was Foreman Wang, the initiator of the wage demand movement.</p><p></p><p>"What you all don't know is that since last year, several foreign firms have wanted to acquire the brewery. The factory can continue operating, and everyone's jobs can be saved. All it takes is for the boss to agree!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the workers all looked at each other in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun's face immediately turned red: "No way. Guangfu Old Liquor is a brand passed down from our ancestors. I, Zheng Baokun, would rather starve to death than sell it to foreigners!"</p><p></p><p>Foreman Wang cursed loudly: "You stubborn old fool! You can't even pay wages, yet you're still trying to preserve your reputation. How can you face all these colleagues who trust you?"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun's face alternated between red and pale. </p><p></p><p>He said: "Everyone, if you still trust me, Zheng Baokun, then please give me three more days. In three days, even if I have to sell everything I own, I will make up all of your wages in full!"</p><p></p><p>When they heard him say this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, don't say that. We've seen how hard you've worked all these years."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we don't want this outcome either."</p><p></p><p>"Since the boss has said this..."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, let's disperse!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>It seems Zheng Baokun had indeed treated the brewery workers well in the past.</p><p></p><p>And these workers also had feelings for the brewery and could understand the boss's insistence, so they dispersed voluntarily.</p><p></p><p>Just as the workers left, several young men approached.</p><p></p><p>The leader among them was Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian: "Are you Zheng Baokun of Guangfu Brewery?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun looked confused: "May I ask what business you gentlemen have with me?"</p><p></p><p>"I am Yu Ruqian from Meixian County. We've been in contact by letter. This is Mr. Yu Xiao. We're here to discuss the acquisition."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked excited.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Young Master Yu?"</p><p></p><p>After Yu Xiao became famous in Meixian County, his reputation had spread to the provincial capital. Zheng Baokun had clearly seen reports about Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This was also why he had accepted Yu Ruqian's acquisition invitation in the letter.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was not only a hero who fought bandits, but also a wealthy returnee from abroad who was passionate about charity. If he was willing to get involved, perhaps he could revitalize the brewery and give it a second life.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can save the brewery, as long as it's not sold to foreigners, as long as everyone can keep their jobs, I'll sell it immediately, even for just one cent!"</p><p></p><p>"No rush. Show me around first."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun led Yu Xiao on a careful tour.</p><p></p><p>This factory was the bottling plant for Guangfu Old Liquor. There were also two wineries in nearby counties.</p><p></p><p>There were over 200 workers in total, with over 3,000 yuan in unpaid wages! In addition, there was about 40,000 yuan in huge debts.</p><p></p><p>As for why Guangfu Old Liquor could no longer stay in business? Although there were indeed some strategic errors, the main reasons were external.</p><p></p><p>First was harassment from local thugs, including but not limited to protection fees from gangs and frequent bribes from some officials. If these demands weren't met, there would be sabotage and destruction, resulting in heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Second was suppression from foreign capital. Guangfu Old Liquor had always had a good reputation, which attracted the covetousness of several foreign firms. They fell into a high-interest loan trap while trying to upgrade equipment, causing external debt to rapidly increase.</p><p></p><p>It seems the situation is not unsalvable.</p><p></p><p>As for whether acquiring Guangfu Old Liquor would cause trouble? Every industry has its troubles, and the food and beverage sector is already considered relatively good.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao believed that with his current fame and influence, he could still keep this small factory under control.</p><p></p><p>The agreement was signed that day.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao invested 100,000 yuan. 50,000 yuan to purchase 90% equity in Guangfu Liquor, clear wages, and repay debts. The other 50,000 yuan was in the form of a loan to supplement the brewery's funds, used to replace equipment and clear sales channels to quickly restore operations.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Baokun retained a small portion of equity.</p><p></p><p>He would continue to manage the brewery.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yu Xiao established a new brand called "Xianfu Liquor".</p><p></p><p>From then on...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the future, "Guangfu Wine" will be incorporated under "Xianfu Wine" as a subsidiary.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao will next order all major wineries to supply production capacity for Guangfu Wine, allowing these ordinary wines to create products under the Guangfu Wine brand and rapidly sell on a large scale. As for the spirit wine Yu Xiao brews with spirit rice?</p><p></p><p>In the future, it will be used to create product lines under the Xianfu Wine brand.</p><p></p><p>Xianfu Wine and Guangfu Wine are related, but their positioning is different. </p><p></p><p>The former focuses on high-end luxury.</p><p></p><p>The latter is for mid to low-end consumer goods.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao plans to create three products for Xianfu spirit wine.</p><p></p><p>Ranked from low to high grade, they are "Welcome Immortal Brew", "Feast Immortal Brew", and "Intoxicate Immortal Brew".</p><p></p><p>Intoxicate Immortal Brew is the highest-end spirit wine directly brewed from first generation spirit rice. This wine is not intended for direct sale for now, and will only be introduced to the market through tasting events or other activities, using scarcity to raise its value and build the winery's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Feast Immortal Brew and Welcome Immortal Brew are yellow rice wines brewed from second and third generation spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Although the quality will be slightly inferior, they are still enough to instantly surpass all wines on the market. They will become high-end luxury consumer goods, used to conquer wealthy people worldwide, thereby creating enormous value and influence.</p><p></p><p>When the winery matters were settled.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao: "Reporter Chen, I plan to place ads in Yangcheng Daily. Do you know how they charge for advertising now?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Tingfeng was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly began to explain.</p><p></p><p>Yangcheng Daily is the largest newspaper in the provincial capital.</p><p></p><p>Its advertising fees are also relatively high.</p><p></p><p>They are mainly calculated based on word count, page space, and duration.</p><p></p><p>Generally, ads use 50 characters as the basic unit, charging 5 cents per character, which means starting at 2.5 yuan.</p><p></p><p>Advertising costs are affected by page position. The more prominent the page position, the higher the ad cost, up to 10 times higher! It's also affected by the number of days published. For example, 5 cents per character on the first day, 4 cents per character from the second to seventh day, and 3 cents per character after the eighth day. For long-term ads, certain discounts are often given.</p><p></p><p>Not cheap.</p><p></p><p>But for Yu Xiao, it's just pocket change.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to calculate how much it would cost - he directly contracted the best ad spots and all remaining vacant ad spaces! As for the ad content?</p><p></p><p>First, seeking to buy a mansion in Xiguan! Second, of course advertising for Xianfu Wine and Guangfu Wine.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao didn't directly promote the wines themselves.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he placed ads in the newspaper offering high prices to purchase medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>He claimed to need ginseng and lingzhi mushrooms over 200 years old as raw materials to brew medicinal wine, offering to buy in large quantities at any time for up to two to three times the market price! Such generosity!</p><p></p><p>It leaves a deep impression!</p><p></p><p>And using century-old herbs to brew wine?</p><p></p><p>This gimmick is enough to attract eyeballs and hype up the wine.</p><p></p><p>In fact.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's real purpose was to seek medicine!</p><p></p><p>However, this achieved three goals at once - it could advertise the spirit wine, purchase cultivation herbs to meet upcoming cultivation needs, and provide cover for his large-scale medicine purchases with great fanfare! Yu Xiao had more money than he could spend.</p><p></p><p>But he would still try to spend it valuably! Otherwise Yu Xiao wouldn't care, but he was afraid others would take him for a fool or an easy mark! Chen Tingfeng had never seen Yu Xiao operate like this before, and felt this young master was truly a marketing genius.</p><p></p><p>And when faced with such a big spender who didn't blink at costs.</p><p></p><p>Yangcheng Daily was also very accommodating.</p><p></p><p>They published the ads immediately.</p><p></p><p>[Prestige +1!]</p><p></p><p>[Prestige +1!]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>When the latest Yangcheng Daily was published.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was surprised to find his prestige had increased.</p><p></p><p>"This works too?"</p><p></p><p>Just buying a few ads.</p><p></p><p>It could actually increase prestige?</p><p></p><p>Although the increase was very limited, it was still real and tangible!</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case!</p><p></p><p>Might as well step it up!</p><p></p><p>Advertising just in Yangcheng Daily wasn't enough.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao immediately contacted "South Yue News", "Lingnan News", and "72 Trades Business News", placing ads in all of them, buying as much as possible!</p><p></p><p>Just from the ad blitz alone!</p><p></p><p>He spent several thousand yuan in total! </p><p></p><p>[Prestige +1!]</p><p></p><p>[Prestige +1!]</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>The advertising effect.</p><p></p><p>Quickly became apparent.</p><p></p><p>In just a short week.</p><p></p><p>Guangfu Wine sales skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>And various medicine merchants contacted Yu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>What pleased him even more was that while he could barely collect a few ancient herbs in Meixian County in ten days to half a month, they seemed to be everywhere in the provincial capital. All the major pharmacies had stocks, and he quickly acquired a considerable amount.</p><p></p><p>It seems.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation resources in this world.</p><p></p><p>Are actually far more abundant than imagined!</p><p></p><p>With the resources of this world to assist, the difficulty of Qi refinement will be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Besides this, many housing options emerged. Yu Xiao quickly selected a house that satisfied him most from among the many mansions.</p><p></p><p>The business content is only briefly mentioned, the process won't be described in detail, after all it's not the focus of this book.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

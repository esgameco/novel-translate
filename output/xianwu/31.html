        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That evening.</p><p></p><p>After finishing social engagements.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiao, we've received news that reporters from several major newspapers will be visiting in the next few days. They hope to interview you in person and take a photo for publication."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao asked, "Which newspapers?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Ruqian replied, "Yangcheng Daily, South Yue News, Lingnan Post, 72 Trades Business Journal, and also some influential papers from outside the province are making special trips."</p><p></p><p>In this era, </p><p></p><p>The newspaper industry was thriving.</p><p></p><p>It produced many famous press tycoons.</p><p></p><p>The press not only had strong commercial monetization capabilities,</p><p></p><p>But was also a weapon that could sway public opinion and discourse.</p><p></p><p>If one could control several major newspapers, it would greatly help elevate one's social status... So let's start by winning over the practitioners!</p><p></p><p>He glanced at his prestige again.</p><p></p><p>It had increased by 20-30 points in half a day.</p><p></p><p>It would be great to break through to the next level in one go! Yu Xiao instructed Yu Ruqian to receive the media personnel well. Not only could they write extensively about his legendary bandit-suppression experiences, but they could also publicize what he had done in Meixian County during this time.</p><p></p><p>Before he left Meixian County,</p><p></p><p>His reputation would spread first.</p><p></p><p>It would be much easier to develop in the provincial capital in the future.</p><p></p><p>A person's name, a tree's shadow - reputation is a stepping stone, and sometimes also a protective talisman.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had always been very clear about his positioning. Although he was working very hard at martial arts, he would not create an image of himself as just a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>In a low-martial world,</p><p></p><p>Even the strongest individuals have limitations.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, becoming a grandmaster could make one a great general worth a thousand men.</p><p></p><p>But in this era where guns and artillery were becoming increasingly powerful, even if one became a martial arts grandmaster, one still couldn't withstand the concentrated fire of dozens of foreign guns simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit that martial artists could reach was too low.</p><p></p><p>How could it compare to industrialists and capitalists who controlled the economic lifelines of billions of people globally?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yu Qinghai led a team of people to bring in dozens of boxes of supplies, including various long and short firearms, gold and silver valuables, and other miscellaneous items.</p><p></p><p>"Worthy nephew, please take a look. These are the spoils of war seized from Stone Tiger Fortress!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Tiger Fortress had been operating for two years, killing, arson, and plundering merchant caravans, naturally accumulating a considerable fortune.</p><p></p><p>Mere scrap metal!</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao didn't care for it at all!</p><p></p><p>If victims came forward with proof,</p><p></p><p>Then the items should be returned to them.</p><p></p><p>After all, he wasn't short of money, and it would earn some goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Of course,</p><p></p><p>Most of the items,</p><p></p><p>Could no longer be traced to their original owners.</p><p></p><p>So they would be sold off to supplement the militia's funds.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao was about to have people carry away these pieces of scrap metal.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>One item caught his attention - an unremarkable long box. When opened, it revealed an old ginseng root. Before he gained the ability to refine qi,</p><p></p><p>He certainly wouldn't have noticed anything special.</p><p></p><p>Now as a genuine cultivator,</p><p></p><p>Even with low-level cultivation, his perception far exceeded ordinary people, and he naturally sensed the spiritual energy emanating from it!</p><p></p><p>Yu Qinghai said, "Nephew, this old ginseng is at least 300-400 years old. It's a rare tonic. Why don't you keep it at your residence? It would be excellent for brewing tea or making soup. You work so hard, you must take good care of your health!"</p><p></p><p>Brewing tea or making soup?</p><p></p><p>What a waste!</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy contained in the old ginseng,</p><p></p><p>Was equivalent to at least one or two spirit grass pills.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could completely use it for cultivation or to replenish depleted spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>A question arose in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Did cultivators exist in this world? The Great Jing world's spiritual energy was extremely thin, seemingly impossible for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao's mere Qi Refining first layer cultivation level meant his dantian could nurture very little spiritual power. When he depleted his spiritual power in the White Cloud District environment, he only needed to rest for one night to naturally recover.</p><p></p><p>But in Great Jing,</p><p></p><p>Even with such low spiritual power,</p><p></p><p>It would take at least 8-10 days of meditation to recover!</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A small puddle cannot nurture whales!</p><p></p><p>How could Dajing possibly cultivate immortality?</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy is scarce.</p><p></p><p>But it's not completely absent.</p><p></p><p>That's why, over time, medicinal herbs like old ginseng can gradually develop. Although they haven't become true spiritual medicines yet, they already possess the ability to assist in cultivation!</p><p></p><p>So.</p><p></p><p>Is it possible.</p><p></p><p>That someone could utilize these meager resources.</p><p></p><p>And forcibly pioneer a cultivation method beyond martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao felt this possibility couldn't be ruled out. After some thought, he summoned Tang Yang, Wang Zhong, and Xu Qingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Master Tang was knowledgeable and experienced.</p><p></p><p>Master Wang came from the famous Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>Old Taoist Xu was from Dragon Tiger Mountain. He was advanced in years and had traveled the jianghu for many years, with rich experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yu is interested in cultivation methods beyond martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I'm very curious, and you three have broader knowledge. Have you heard of any? After all, China has had legends of immortals and gods since ancient times. Perhaps some legends aren't baseless."</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Zhong was the most straightforward.</p><p></p><p>"Our Chinese martial arts are the orthodox way. Even if other cultivation methods exist, they're heterodox paths not worth learning!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingfeng stroked his beard: "We can't be so absolute. It's just that some ancient cultivation methods have long been lost or are no longer applicable."</p><p></p><p>"Does Taoist Xu perhaps know some secret lore?"</p><p></p><p>"I only learned about the existence of ancient qi cultivators by chance from my grand-uncle when I was cultivating at Dragon Tiger Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Qingfeng paused: "However, this group gradually disappeared during the Han Dynasty. They've likely vanished in the long river of history for thousands of years. As for whether it's true or not, this old Taoist dares not be certain!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient qi cultivators? Yu Xiao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He immediately inquired about the specifics.</p><p></p><p>According to the information Xu Qingfeng revealed.</p><p></p><p>These ancient qi cultivators were likely immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if the ancient spiritual energy environment was more abundant than now, this world's cultivation environment was still extremely barren. Even if ancient qi cultivators really existed, their cultivation level probably wouldn't be very high, with an upper limit of around the third level.</p><p></p><p>These qi cultivators liked to live in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, records were extremely scarce.</p><p></p><p>Almost legendary.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao could completely understand.</p><p></p><p>Because in this world where spiritual energy was scarce, it was too costly for cultivators to use their powers. The higher their cultivation, the harder it was to recover. That's why they would seclude themselves in deep mountains, staying aloof from worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>"I've underestimated this world!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao believed that ancient qi cultivators must have existed, and as long as cultivators had existed in this world, there would be some legacy left behind, more or less.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was these legacies.</p><p></p><p>Or these spiritually rich medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>They could all help Yu Xiao's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It seems the value of this world is far greater than imagined!</p><p></p><p>Tang Yang: "I haven't heard of ancient qi cultivators, but I've seen cultivators beyond martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>This usually melancholic, gentle, and very refined uncle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as if recalling some deeply etched hatred, his eyes flashed with barely suppressed anger.</p><p></p><p>He said, almost gnashing his teeth: "Those demons from Nanyang and the West, their cultivation methods are completely different from ours!"</p><p></p><p>Ah, yes!</p><p></p><p>I almost forgot!</p><p></p><p>This world isn't just Dajing!</p><p></p><p>Outside, there are many forces that are either at their peak, rising steadily, or developing in secret.</p><p></p><p>Don't these countries have their own cultivation systems? Looking at it this way, this world is even more complex than imagined!</p><p></p><p>All along.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao had been staying in Mei County.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't had the chance to experience the broader world yet.</p><p></p><p>If he were to go to Yang City, as the capital of Guangyue Province and Dajing's most prosperous port city, where domestic forces and Western powers intertwine, the waters there would be hundreds or thousands of times deeper than in Mei County!</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiao wasn't afraid.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he became even more intensely interested!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He violently coughed up a large mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>He quickly sealed several major acupoints, trying to forcefully expel the deadly poison with his robust vital energy.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless, the poison has already seeped deep into you!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Peng sneered viciously: "This Corrosive Bone Powder is odorless and tasteless, but it can gradually corrode the meridians. Although there are usually no discomforts, once you exert high-intensity vital energy, the damage to the meridians will erupt - mild cases will completely lose combat ability, severe cases may even threaten your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Li!" </p><p></p><p>Four inner court disciples immediately rushed to guard him.</p><p></p><p>However, Yu Xiao grew alert and did not follow them.</p><p></p><p>Li Yan was an old hand in the jianghu, it would not be easy for outsiders to ambush him. This poison was most likely accumulated imperceptibly in his daily life over time...</p><p></p><p>At the Spring Thunder Fist Manor.</p><p></p><p>There must be a traitor!</p><p></p><p>Was it the eldest disciple Wei Biao? </p><p></p><p>Or the second disciple Gao Han? Wei Biao was in charge of the manor's daily affairs, so he had the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But he had been loyal to Li Yan for over a decade, there was no reason for him to scheme against Li Yan. It must be Gao Han! He was Li Yan's most favored disciple.</p><p></p><p>Gao Han was responsible for Li Yan's personal matters, including brewing tea and decoctions. Poisoning the tea or medicine would be entirely feasible! "There is a traitor!"</p><p></p><p>The words had barely left Yu Xiao's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gao Han had already drawn two daggers, stabbing them into the vital points of Fang Dashan and Peng Tieshen from behind - the two men were completely unprepared and immediately collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Bypassing them, </p><p></p><p>Gao Han directly attacked Li Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the warning, Wei Biao's heart was already filled with alarm.</p><p></p><p>But he could not react in time, only using his body to block the attack, grabbing the sharp daggers with both hands.</p><p></p><p>A muffled groan! The two gleaming blades </p><p></p><p>instantly pierced through his palms.</p><p></p><p>"You beast, I actually treated you like a brother, I must have been blind!" </p><p></p><p>The daggers were poisoned! After Wei Biao's hands were stabbed, a strange itchiness spread from the wounds, numbing half his body. Enraged to the extreme, he disregarded everything and forcefully activated his vital energy to charge forward.</p><p></p><p>"Despicable scoundrel! I'll take you down with me!"</p><p></p><p>But Gao Han immediately withdrew, retreating to stand beside Jin Peng.</p><p></p><p>He wore a regretful expression: "Almost!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Peng: "No matter, the Li fellow is doomed."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan gritted his teeth, full of resentment: "Why did you betray me!"</p><p></p><p>He never expected Gao Han to turn traitor! Among the four inner court disciples, Gao Han had the best natural talent, and his future accomplishments would surely surpass Wei Biao's - he could have been Li Yan's true heir.</p><p></p><p>Gao Han's tone was icy cold: "Don't blame me, blame yourself. At your age, you still can't let go. The Ascension Token in your hands is being wasted, it's better if I help you unleash its true value!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Han had poisoned Li Yan.</p><p>He had colluded with the Golden Sabre Gang.</p><p>It was all to seize the Ascension Token from Li Yan.</p><p></p><p>Betrayed by the one he most trusted and valued!</p><p>Li Yan was utterly disillusioned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>a sound of something slicing through the air rang out.</p><p></p><p>Jin Peng pounced like a fierce tiger descending the mountain,</p><p>attacking the now combat-incapable Li Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Our enmity of over twenty years!"</p><p>"Today, I can finally settle it completely!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan could only barely suppress the deadly poison with his cultivation, completely lacking the strength to fight back. How could he withstand the ferocious saber techniques of his opponent? Li Yan! Was he really going to die at the hands of a villain?</p><p>Jin Peng was extremely excited at the prospect of finally achieving his goal.</p><p>He felt he could finally sleep soundly from now on.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding his internal injuries, he swung his battle saber with full force, aiming to sever the head of his long-standing enemy before him.</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical juncture, a chill rose from his tailbone, causing all the hair on his body to stand on end!</p><p>Danger? Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Just as Jin Peng's attention was fully focused on Li Yan,</p><p>Yu Xiao no longer hesitated and decisively pulled the triggers of his two shotguns!</p><p></p><p>Bang bang!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p>The gang leader Jin Peng could feel two extremely fast projectiles approaching, their power might not be as great as a Refined Blood Grand Perfection discharge, but they were still a formidable threat! He had no choice but to forcefully resist the attack.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The surging qi transformed into a horizontal sword strike, using the blade to block two bullets.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Right then, Yuexiao emptied the entire magazine of the two guns!</p><p></p><p>At this distance, with such an attack, and a sudden sneak attack, there was no possibility of missing.</p><p></p><p>Jin Peng had only hastily blocked a few bullets, the rest, except for a few that went wide, all hit their mark, with one bullet directly hitting the eye and penetrating the skull, this single strike was enough to inflict an irreversible fatal wound.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>The Sect Leader Jin could only barely utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>His face was filled with shock and unwillingness, and he finally collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This peak-level unaffiliated cultivator of the Baiyun Pavilion, never in his wildest dreams would have thought that he would die so obscurely!</p><p></p><p>The others were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual artifact?</p><p></p><p>But why was there no fluctuation of spiritual power? How could Yuexiao, who didn't even have the first layer of cultivation, possibly activate a spiritual artifact?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the situation turn dire, Gao Han and Jin Dao Sect's disciples turned and fled. Li Yan quickly picked up a stone, catalyzing the blood qi to shoot it out with the power of a bullet, hitting Gao Han in the back of the head.</p><p></p><p>Jin Peng, dead!</p><p>The traitor Gao Han, dead!</p><p></p><p>The outcome of the battle was completely reversed!</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao stepped forward: "Senior brother, Mr. Li, how are you?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao: "Yuexiao junior brother, well done, what kind of spiritual artifact is this, it's so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao explained: "This is not a spiritual artifact, but merely a mundane ingenious trick, a mechanized weapon. I never expected it to be useful at this moment, it was just pure luck!"</p><p></p><p>He did not humble himself.</p><p></p><p>The speed and reaction of a First-Grade Martial Artist is far beyond expectation. </p><p></p><p>Jin Peng could feel and even see the bullets, even in that state, he could still split some of the bullets with his sword. If it was a one-on-one direct confrontation, just relying on two guns might not necessarily be enough to win against him.</p><p></p><p>Cannot be careless! If I encounter such a powerful expert again.</p><p>I must be extra careful.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "I need a weapon with greater power and firepower, one that can directly and forcefully eliminate even a peak unaffiliated cultivator like Jin Peng!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan stood up: "Protect me while I enter seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao was greatly alarmed: "Mr. Li, but your current physical condition..."</p><p></p><p>Li Yan spoke solemnly: "The effect of the Blood Essence Elixir is still ongoing, this is my last chance!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Li Yan returned to the cave dwelling. </p><p>The others continued to guard outside.</p><p></p><p>Wei Biao took an antidote pill and used healing spells, his condition much better now.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, the Spring Thunder Fist Pavilion suffered heavy losses, two guard masters died, and three inner sect disciples were killed.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao was responsible for cleaning up the battlefield. He searched Jin Peng's body and found fifteen spirit stones, three bottles containing medicinal pills, two different colored talisman papers, and an iron-shattering battle sword.</p><p></p><p>He also found six spirit stones and various spoils of war from the bodies of Gao Han and the other enemies.</p><p></p><p>All these things belonged to Yuexiao now.</p><p></p><p>When Yuexiao saw Fang Dashan and Peng Tiesheng, the two had their eyes wide open, their faces filled with disbelief, obviously dying with regret.</p><p></p><p>Yuexiao let out a sigh, closing their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The two had a good relationship with him, and they had interacted frequently during this period.</p><p>He never expected them to be separated from life and death in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The human heart is unfathomable... In the future, I must be more cautious!</p><p></p><p>The next day, Mr. Li emerged from seclusion.</p><p>The result was obvious.</p><p></p><p>Not only had Li Yan returned to his previous sickly state, but his hair had also turned white, and wrinkles appeared on his face, as if he had aged by more than a decade.</p><p></p><p>The miracle did not happen.</p><p>The breakthrough had still failed. Decades of effort had ultimately become an illusion.</p><p></p><p>This battle had no winners for both the Spring Thunder Fist Pavilion and the Jin Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

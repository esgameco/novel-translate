        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was being beaten up, the giant white bone hand repeatedly brutalizing him, but he was unable to destroy the giant white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>"This won't work."</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to explore the other abilities of the mysterious alley, to verify his guesses, but the giant white bone hand just wouldn't stop.</p><p></p><p>The second-stage anomaly had more intelligence, unlike the first-stage which acted purely by instinct.</p><p></p><p>The second-stage anomaly, just like this mysterious alley, at least knew that attacks on the spiritual soul were useless against the primordial energy. Whether it was a spiritual impact or a will impact, they were easily neutralized by the primordial energy.</p><p></p><p>Only this giant white bone hand was something Xuanhuang couldn't deal with.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's not like he had no options at all.</p><p></p><p>After trying a few more times, Xuanhuang made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, are you going to enter the tower for another trial? How long do you plan to persist this time? Remember last time you didn't even last two minutes before coming out? How long will it be this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I'd say it's better for you to accumulate points and meditate on the visualization diagrams, you're wasting points like this."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Young man, you should heed our advice."</p><p></p><p>The young man was quite annoyed by the comments from the crowd, and said: "I have plenty of points, my family was a renowned traditional Chinese medicine clan even before the anomaly resurgence, and after the resurgence, although we suffered some losses, we still have many preserved medicinal gardens with precious herbs, some of which have even grown stronger due to the spiritual energy. So don't worry, I have plenty of points."</p><p></p><p>The young man had an uncaring attitude.</p><p></p><p>His points were indeed accumulated from contributing many spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>After stabilizing the Heavenly Mechanism with the Jianmu, he had exchanged many herbs at the exchange center to accumulate points. </p><p></p><p>He was a cultivator, and had already comprehended the corresponding "Heavenly-Earth Law" Jianmu visualization diagram, it wasn't that he wanted to waste points, but his willpower was insufficient, so he could only enter the tower for training.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the ridicule from the crowd, the young man acted very arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"This time I must endure, to temper my willpower and control, and comprehend the visualization diagram as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The young man secretly made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>He strode towards the White Bone Treasure Tower.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the young man was about to enter the treasure tower, he suddenly stumbled and almost couldn't stand steady.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the treasure tower start to tremble, rapidly shrinking, until it turned into a beam of white light and flew down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"What? I, I just recharged my points, and I haven't even done the trial yet?"</p><p></p><p>The young man weakly said to the guard at the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the White Bone Treasure Tower trial has been temporarily suspended, the points will be refunded, or you can wait for the next use."</p><p></p><p>The staff at the hall also didn't know what had happened, only that the Xuan Master had been summoned by the Exorcism Department to provide support. </p><p></p><p>Now even the White Bone Treasure Tower had gone, it seemed the situation was very grave.</p><p></p><p>On Xuanhuang's side.</p><p></p><p>He was temporarily unable to deal with the giant white bone hand, and thought of the White Bone Treasure Tower.</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Treasure Tower had the ability to absorb and evolve bones, an ability that Xuanhuang had never paid much attention to.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he now encountered a situation that was perfectly suited for this ability.</p><p></p><p>"Director, look."</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Treasure Tower rumbled as it approached, the Exorcism Department members waiting outside the mist saw it.</p><p></p><p>"This is the White Bone Treasure Tower, a divine artifact forged by the Xuan Master."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual practitioners present all knew that this treasure tower could temper one's willpower, and they were also quite interested, but currently they had no use for it. Now the spiritual practitioners had gone to Qingyun Mountain, it was to alleviate the spiritual soul erosion, tempering willpower was not a priority, one was afraid of losing control, and alleviating the erosion was more important.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the situation inside is very bad, for the Xuan Master to summon the White Bone Treasure Tower." Gao Xiaolan said.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Treasure Tower arrogantly charged into the mist, although it had many enhancements, as a first-stage ability, it still struggled greatly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the White Bone Treasure Tower arrive, Xuanhuang began to plan his actions.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!" Small World Heavenly Will enhancement, domain fully opened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly! Temporarily restraining the incoming giant white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!" The void blade, enhanced by the blood energy, had a ten-zhang long blade light, like a giant heavenly sword, slashing towards the restrained giant white bone hand.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!" A huge impact, the surrounding mist violently fluctuated, the bricks and tiles of the surrounding buildings took flight, as if experiencing a violent earthquake.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!" A knuckle joint on the little finger of the giant white bone hand snapped.</p><p></p><p>Even just a single joint on the little finger was five meters long.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p></p><p>The suction force of the White Bone Treasure Tower attacked, the severed bone joint was swallowed into the tower.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!" Xuanhuang felt a twisting pain in his willpower.</p><p></p><p>The giant white bone hand violently struggled free from the domain restraint.</p><p></p><p>Causing Xuanhuang to receive the impact, with their wills connected, the giant white bone hand breaking the restraint was equivalent to shattering his will concentration.</p><p></p><p>"If it really doesn't work, I'll just tactically retreat, infiltrate the enemy's rear and make new plans."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang decided, no longer trying to directly fight the giant white bone hand, but using speed to evade, waiting for the White Bone Treasure Tower to subdue and absorb that severed finger bone.</p><p></p><p>His first-stage four-pillar abilities were still far inferior to this second-stage anomaly.</p><p></p><p>If he was at the second-door four-pillar level, Xuanhuang would have confidence in matching the giant white bone hand in strength, being able to fight back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Luckily he had multiple layers of protection, blood energy, willpower, Small World Heavenly Will enhancement, etc. to protect his body, or he would have been injured.</p><p></p><p>At the second-door four-pillar level, not only would his strength greatly increase, but his body and willpower would also be enhanced. The enhanced body and willpower could unleash the Small World's abilities to a greater extent.</p><p></p><p>And if he was at the third-door seven-pillar level or above, Xuanhuang would have confidence not only in defeating the giant white bone hand, but directly eliminating the hidden mysterious alley.</p><p></p><p>As for the fourth-door ten-pillar level? Xuanhuang wouldn't just resolve the giant white bone hand, he would directly eradicate the mysterious alley.</p><p></p><p>He was still too weak after all.</p><p></p><p>About the time it takes to burn an incense stick, the sky outside had already turned to dusk, the waiting crowd extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally seeing the churning black mist in the mist.</p><p></p><p>And with the joint efforts of the White Bone Treasure Tower and Guihu, they finally subdued one of the bone joints.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang quickly retrieved the White Bone Treasure Tower, seeing the giant white bone hand attacking again, he directly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The giant white bone hand still attacked, but its target was gone, hitting the already dilapidated buildings, which were instantly reduced to nothing.</p><p></p><p>The anomaly rules made the giant white bone hand sluggish for a moment, as if its target had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This truly confused the anomaly, in the anomaly rules if you don't get killed, it doesn't end, you either escape or it dissipates.</p><p></p><p>But to directly disappear? The operating mechanism of the anomaly rules could only disperse.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xuanhuang disappeared, the mist-shrouded street gradually cleared, the mysterious alley had vanished.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious alley had just disappeared, and Xuanhuang immediately reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it retreated underground and disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang found the direction where the mysterious alley had disappeared, it was silently and invisibly retreating into the earth, which would be difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"The anomaly has disappeared."</p><p>"Quick, look, it's the Xuan Master."</p><p></p><p>As the mist cleared, the waiting spiritual practitioners suddenly noticed the pensive Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Master?"</p><p>"Xuan Master, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi and the others approached, carefully examining Xuanhuang, seeing him deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Normal.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine." Xuanhuang turned to the crowd and said.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" The crowd let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, how's the situation?" Xu Ruyi asked.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang straightened up and said, "Not good, this mysterious alley is very troublesome. Not only are there various techniques, but it is also exceptionally powerful. I even suspect that this is a composite anomaly, not a simple mysterious alley."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Hearing Xuanhuang's words, the crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, do you have any discoveries?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "I have made a big discovery. By the way, I want to ask, I remember that a month ago when the mysterious alley last appeared, the report from Jin Ning at the time said... The Exorcism Department's spiritual practitioners fought to the death, suffering heavy losses, and then the mysterious alley retreated... May I ask how that Zhang Tianling practitioner managed to do that, did he have any discoveries?"</p><p></p><p>"This..." Suddenly, the people from the Exorcism Department felt embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Xu Ruyi said, "Master Xuan, that was just a figure of speech, haha."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi's face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"What was the actual situation?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Xu Ruyi said, "The actual situation is... The mysterious alley ravaged for a while and then disappeared. Our department's spiritual practitioners tried to probe it, but they were seriously injured, so they didn't dare to continue, and just quickly evacuated the surrounding people."</p><p></p><p>"This?" Xuanhuang understood, and could only criticize, "This is too much of a figure of speech."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Xuan, don't be too particular, after all, the public needs uplifting news, haha..." Xu Ruyi laughed unnaturally, his face flushed with embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang lost the interest to continue inquiring, as he had wanted to exchange insights with that spiritual practitioner.</p><p></p><p>Well, it turned out to be this kind of situation.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let me tell you about my discoveries. This mysterious alley first absorbed the fear of the living beings to strengthen itself. After I broke through that, there appeared a mist that assaulted the soul, as well as countless mutilated limbs that turned into puppets; then the mist condensed, and even appeared pure physical attacks of giant white bone hands, which were extremely powerful. Under the attacks of the white bone hands, I could only barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>Although I used a small trick to break off one of its finger bones, the effect was not great. Afterwards, I went into hiding, and the mysterious rules disappeared. After it disappeared, I immediately investigated and found that the mysterious alley had retreated into the ground to leave."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang finished describing, and the crowd pondered in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang continued, "So I suspect that this is a composite anomaly, the mysterious alley is one, and the white bone giant hand is another. It is the combination of the two that gives it such capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"Composite?" Xu Ruyi said in a low voice, "This kind of anomaly is not common, but it is very troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"The situation is as such. Just now, I was injured a bit by the attack of the white bone giant hand... Director Xu, I'll leave this to you all now, I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi hurriedly said, "Thank you, Master Xuan, for your assistance in saving the lives of three hundred innocent civilians. Our Exorcism Department will definitely publicize this without omission. We are grateful for your help."</p><p></p><p>"It's my duty. Director Xu, everyone, I'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang cupped his hands and then disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched his coming and going with amazement.</p><p></p><p>And this time, they dealt with a second-level anomaly without any losses, which was the first time they felt so relieved. As long as they left someone to guard, the spiritual practitioners felt a bit unaccustomed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi was very attentive to Xuanhuang's description.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had such a clear description of the abilities of the mysterious alley. The mysterious alley not only appeared in the South City, but also in other cities.</p><p></p><p>There were records of repelling the mysterious alley, and even injuring it, but there was no record of the white bone giant hand, nor the ability of the mysterious alley to retreat into the ground and disappear.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi couldn't help but suspect that his colleagues also liked to use "figures of speech".</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it shouldn't be like this.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the records of these anomalies cannot be fully trusted, and we need to have our own thoughts and careful consideration."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi decided that in the future, when encountering such situations, he could not rely too much on the descriptions of the anomalies in the files.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was fine, as it was the spiritual practitioners handling it, and they could decide among themselves. Others who wanted to refute it didn't have the strength, and the records of the Exorcism Department's spiritual practitioners were treated as the truth.</p><p></p><p>But now that Xuanhuang has appeared, more people from the martial and Taoist paths will come, and they can't be so sloppy.</p><p></p><p>Not only is it embarrassing to be discovered, but inaccurate records can also harm people at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual practitioners do need competition. In just six or seven years, this kind of blatant description has become commonplace. If this continues, won't it be a spiritual practitioner's monopoly, where whatever the spiritual practitioners say is the truth?"</p><p></p><p>"Where there is an organization, there will inevitably be power, and where there is power, corruption will inevitably arise. This is something that cannot be prevented in any matter." </p><p></p><p>"I have to maintain competition."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xuanhuang returned to Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xuanhuang return safely, Sun Tong, who was waiting outside the door, happily notified Sun Hui and the others.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was indeed injured, as the restraint on the white bone giant hand was broken, causing his will to be damaged. However, the injury was not serious, and he could recover with simple restoration.</p><p></p><p>Entering the small world, Xuanhuang took out the White Bone Pagoda, inside which a section of white bone was imprisoned.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of the Returning Void Great Grinder, the White Bone Pagoda was diligently refining it. The true meaning of the white bone was flowing towards the Returning Void Great Grinder, while the energy of the white bone was being absorbed by the White Bone Pagoda. This was a second-level anomaly, the white bone.</p><p></p><p>Even a small section of it was enough to satisfy the White Bone Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!" The White Bone Pagoda's aura was constantly rising, and the white bone inside was gradually disappearing.</p><p></p><p>By the next dawn, one section of the white bone had been completely refined.</p><p></p><p>Even though the true meaning was taken away by the Returning Void Great Grinder, the energy was enough for the White Bone Pagoda to advance.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the White Bone Pagoda was only at the early stage of the first level, but now it has reached the middle stage of the first level, and is even approaching the late stage.</p><p></p><p>Being able to consume so much in one go, if the source was not the Returning Void Great Grinder, the White Bone Pagoda's rapid advancement would have taken a lot of time.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the true meaning of the white bone, the Returning Void Great Grinder, although not a second-level existence, was indeed greatly nourished.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the continuous refining of the Returning Void power, the Returning Void Great Grinder has already reached the limit of the first level, on par with Tong Tian.</p><p></p><p>Currently, what is needed is not the accumulation of energy, but the degree of solidification of the true self.</p><p></p><p>If the solidification of the true self is complete, it would be at the fourth-level true self realm.</p><p></p><p>To reach the first level, one needs to solidify one part, the second level needs four parts, the third level needs seven parts, and the fourth level needs ten complete parts.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Returning Void Great Grinder and Tong Tian have both reached the solidification of three parts in the late stage, with Tong Tian at around 3.9 parts and the Great Grinder at around 3.8 parts.</p><p></p><p>Only the newly entered late stage Heavenly Earth Furnace is at 3 parts.</p><p></p><p>However, reaching the second level is not easy. This requires opportunities.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Xuanhuang enters the second level of Penetrating the Mystery, as the source, it can drive the three artifacts to enter the second level as well.</p><p></p><p>Or the three artifacts could consume the true meaning of a second-level anomaly.</p><p></p><p>This is not simple.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is still early, it will take him a year to enter the second level of Penetrating the Mystery.</p><p></p><p>But! There's always a "but".</p><p></p><p>The three artifacts have various opportunities, and with the appearance of the guiding beacon Zhen Ling Stele, they have already deviated from their original trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Ling Stele is too overpowered. Existences above the seventh-level true self will constantly absorb the Tao essence it circulates, and they will advance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

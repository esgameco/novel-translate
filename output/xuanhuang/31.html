        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a massive building as grand as a martial arts school, but the martial arts school building seemed more rugged. </p><p></p><p>This building had a more ancient and ethereal charm.</p><p></p><p>This was the Taoist temple that every city had.</p><p></p><p>It managed the entire city together with the Exorcism Department and the martial arts school, or even said to be in control of it.</p><p></p><p>In an office on the third floor.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing, the deputy director of the Taoist temple, was handling the temple's expenditures.</p><p></p><p>"Knock, knock!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of knocking came.</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing closed the account book and said, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>After the door opened, a woman in her early twenties walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zhao, what's the matter?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the visitor was Zhao Xi, the socialite of the Taoist temple, Xia Qing asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xia, I have something to report."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it, tell me."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing was quite familiar with this socialite, who was a celebrity in the Taoist temple.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xi was very clever, had a wide social network, and was known as an all-knowing person, not just in the entire Taoist temple, but in the whole southern city.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xia, my boyfriend told me a secret, asked me to keep it confidential, but I think it is related to our Taoist temple, even our current situation, so I want to report it to you."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing was taken aback, "Your... I mean, your boyfriend, where does he work, what kind of secret is so important?"</p><p></p><p>She almost slipped, after all, this woman had too many boyfriends.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xi caught the oddity, but didn't mind at all. </p><p></p><p>If she cared about that, she wouldn't have so many boyfriends. </p><p></p><p>Those who care about other people's opinions are the ones who want to save face, but those who don't care about face, how can they care about others' opinions?</p><p></p><p>"My boyfriend works at the martial arts school. They had a big event happen, I heard there appeared a extraordinary martial artist, my boyfriend said the spring of martial arts has come, and said our cultivation has no future, because we don't have the 'Mystic Master', anyway, his words were very strange, and asked me to keep it secret."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing remained calm, although Zhao Xi's words sounded absurd.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>What extraordinary, what incomprehensible 'Mystic Master'? What is this? In the martial arts field, not to mention the younger generation, even the elders are just assistants to the Exorcist Masters.</p><p></p><p>If these words came from someone else, Xia Qing would have paid attention, but coming from Zhao Xi's mouth, the credibility...</p><p></p><p>"Is it true?" </p><p></p><p>However, as the deputy director, she still had some social etiquette, so she asked perfunctorily.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xia, I know you don't believe me, but please believe me, my boyfriend from the martial arts school also assured me that they really have an extraordinary path."</p><p></p><p>"My boyfriend is always excitedly muttering 'will is king' 'will is king'"</p><p></p><p>"What: 'Everyone has thought of it, but only the Mystic Master has achieved my will as the will of heaven'."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Xi's earnest manner, Xia Qing was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of the word "extraordinary", she shook her head firmly again.</p><p></p><p>How can extraordinary be so easy?</p><p></p><p>"Alright Xiao Zhao, I understand. Later I will have someone investigate, if it's true, your contribution won't be overlooked, it will be converted into corresponding points, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xi then smiled brightly, "Master, whatever you say goes, the whole Taoist temple knows that Master Xia's words are trustworthy, you are the pillar supporting our temple..."</p><p></p><p>After sending Zhao Xi away,</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing let out a bitter smile, almost believing the praise herself.</p><p></p><p>This Zhao Xi really "knows how to come up with things".</p><p></p><p>Since it's like this, I'll have someone investigate, can't let my subordinates feel their words are not taken seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, I am the pillar supporting the Taoist temple...</p><p></p><p>Look, the praise rule is starting to take effect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the martial arts school side, unaware that their hidden secret had already been exposed by the love-crazed man.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Mystic Master didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Cultivation Pavilion was the most miserable existence that had been disturbed by the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator who had reached the realm of Concentration could not even defeat a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The enchantment of forged weapons had little effect, and they were still no match for the martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xuanhuang did not differentiate between cultivators, it just so happened that the martial arts pavilion was more familiar and more suitable for carrying out its own plans.</p><p></p><p>The "Jianmu Tong Tian Tu" and the "Guihu Da Mo Guan Xiang Tu" were prepared for cultivators who practiced Qi and Shen refinement.</p><p></p><p>It was just a little late.</p><p></p><p>The only one who cared was the Yujie practitioner, and that was the real trouble.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the righteous spirit masters who guarded the human world, those twisted spirit masters were the real enemies.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's future opponents must be them.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the bizarre is not that simple, the bizarre will constantly change a person's mind, thoughts, and emotions.</p><p></p><p>Some have maintained their human appearance, but have already lost their humanity.</p><p></p><p>These are pure lunatics. Even if you don't provoke them, they will still attack because humans have found a second way to deal with the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Just because you can be like me? Like me, you can deal with the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't my status as a spirit master be impacted? Even, why didn't you appear earlier, I'm already in this ghostly state, you only now opened up an extraordinary path, why not earlier? Die, be destroyed, if I don't have the chance, you won't have the chance either.</p><p></p><p>There must be many such Yujie practitioners.</p><p></p><p>Especially those Yujie practitioner organizations that have established cults.</p><p></p><p>Being discovered by these spirit masters is the big deal.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang did not know that the Zhenxie Department already knew about it.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenxie Department of South City! "Director Jia, look at what I've discovered," said the man named Wei Zixuan.</p><p></p><p>He was the young spirit master that Xuanhuang had seen with the other spirit master a dozen or so days ago.</p><p></p><p>And facing him was the deputy director of the South City Zhenxie Department, Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>A Yujie practitioner who had mastered two homogeneous bizarre beings, but had not yet reached the second level.</p><p></p><p>"What good news has the Spirit Master Wei brought me?" Jia Zhengyi asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of the bizarre corpse tree in Fulin Community. I went on patrol today and discovered that several people in the martial arts pavilion were all unable to hide their excitement and joy. So I used a little trick to check it out."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I discovered a big secret."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi was taken aback and said, "As a spirit master who guards the human world, using a little trick on an ordinary martial artist is just his good luck, there's nothing wrong with that."</p><p></p><p>Using bizarre abilities on ordinary people is not allowed openly.</p><p></p><p>No matter how you look at it, using bizarre abilities is equivalent to being invaded by the bizarre, and there will always be some harm.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Director Jia is still steady, able to help us poor souls who fight for the sake of mortals."</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand what's wrong with some of the people in our Zhenxie Department?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simply a weak-minded mentality, always in sync with some mortals."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the world is so unfair!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan sighed about the unfairness.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Spirit Master Wei, just tell me your discovery."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi chuckled, not wanting to get involved in this.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Recently, many people from the martial arts pavilion have been sacrificed, yet these people cannot hide their excitement..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan said, "I just swallowed a martial artist's memory to see what's going on, and guess what? There was a big harvest. The martial arts side has produced an extraordinary existence, opening up a new path for martial arts. His memory was very clear..."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>As Wei Zixuan described it, Jia Zhengyi could not sit still.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre being that Wei Zixuan controlled was a huge bloody mouth in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre mouth could not only devour tangible objects, but also devour the memories, emotions, and other intangible aspects of ordinary people whose willpower had not reached the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan had not hesitated to use this method to satisfy his "special" desires.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was once a good young man, but after controlling the bizarre, he changed.</p><p></p><p>...

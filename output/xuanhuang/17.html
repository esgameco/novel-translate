        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, don't go, it's dangerous."</p><p></p><p>A dirty little hand suddenly tugged at Xuanhuang's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>A bean sprout-like child, dirty and disheveled, with messy hair.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were full of holes, and it was already deep into autumn. The little boy didn't know if he was shivering from the cold or from fear.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't detect any ominous aura from the village children.</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled slightly, trying his best to appear amiable and approachable.</p><p></p><p>As for the elder leading him, he didn't seem to notice.</p><p></p><p>With a dazed expression, it was as if he hadn't noticed the little boy following them.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, run quickly, don't come to our village, there are monsters that eat people, my father was eaten by a monster."</p><p></p><p>Facing Xuanhuang's inquiry, the little boy seemed very frightened.</p><p></p><p>After saying a sentence to Xuanhuang, he hurriedly ran away.</p><p></p><p>Watching the little boy run away, Xuanhuang felt that it wasn't because he had scared him off, as he had been smiling amiably.</p><p></p><p>It should be for other reasons that he was scared off, perhaps because of Xuanhuang's inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"Eaten by a monster?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's gaze turned to the elder leading the way.</p><p></p><p>"It should be the work of the ominous aura in this place."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't give up, through the layers of mist, he would see the so-called Centipede King when the time came.</p><p></p><p>About three or four minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Following the elder, they arrived at the center of the village, an open square.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the square, a strangely styled building stood tall.</p><p></p><p>Sensing it, a dense ominous aura assaulted him, this was the source of the village's eeriness.</p><p></p><p>Many villagers in this place were busy building an altar.</p><p></p><p>In the most conspicuous part of the altar, three men and three women were kneeling on the ground, prostrating themselves.</p><p></p><p>Around them were many livestock.</p><p></p><p>Four blood-red wooden stakes stood around the altar, covered with dense, eerie inscriptions.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, these eerie inscriptions seemed like a group of crawling worms, moving rhythmically on the wooden stakes.</p><p></p><p>A faint pulsation emanated from the four wooden stakes, as if they were connected by a formation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>A cold gaze swept across.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a man in a black robe in the space between the eerie building and the altar, looking at Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>This person's gaze was extremely murky.</p><p></p><p>Although he was standing, he looked awkward in every way, not at all like a normal human posture.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to describe, as if the one moving inside his body was not a human, but insects.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him, Xuanhuang felt a deep sense of disgust.</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice came out.</p><p></p><p>The dazed elder suddenly said, "Envoy, this is the blood offering I present to the King."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang: ...??</p><p></p><p>Despicable local people.</p><p></p><p>You brought me here, but you're actually treating me as a blood offering, not "bestowing blessings" as you said?</p><p></p><p>"Very good, Jia Village Chief, you will be blessed by the Centipede King."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man called "Envoy" said.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xuanhuang: "Such a thick and rich aura of blood energy, and yet you have such cultivation. Not bad, not bad, the Centipede King will be very pleased."</p><p></p><p>The two of them completely disregarded Xuanhuang's feelings, appraising his flesh like a pig merchant and a butcher discussing.</p><p></p><p>As if they were just talking about a piece of meat.</p><p></p><p>"Are you done?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black-robed man suddenly became furious: "You little brat, do you think this is the age of martial arts and immortal cultivation? We're just going to treat you as a blood offering, and you still think you can resist?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang wasn't even angry.</p><p></p><p>This "Envoy" got so enraged just from Xuanhuang's one sentence, as if he hadn't just been appraising him like a piece of meat.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Moon Goddess descended..." the black-robed man mechanically bowed to the sky and said, "The era of you martial artists and immortal cultivators has passed."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, high and mighty, lawless, haha... Pitiful wretches, that's all you are..."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Envoy had a hideous expression, as if venting endless resentment.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't know about the past martial artists and immortal cultivators in this world.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, this person's behavior was simply hysterical.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a small person had suddenly become powerful, and he now instinctively hated those who were once high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Obeying the saying: "I hate others being high and mighty, why not me?"</p><p></p><p>Once he had turned the tables, he became even more repulsive than those who were once high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists, haha... Die for my sake."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Envoy suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>A black aura surrounded his hand, carrying intense spiritual pressure and corrosive power.</p><p></p><p>His distorted face squeezed out an expression of delight, as if killing Xuanhuang would bring him immense pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant! The delighted expression on the black-robed Envoy's face was still lingering.</p><p></p><p>A sharp pain suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the hand he had extended was already severed by a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the severed part was shrouded in a sinister gray mist that was even more ominous than the black aura around him, and it was actually dissolving his arm.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't be dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? A lowly martial artist, how could he have such power? Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The panicked black-robed emissary quickly leaped away. The black mist enveloped the severed part of the arm, and his attempts to expel the clinging gray mist were not successful.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, at the site of the severed arm, there was no normal human blood flowing out.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was twitching and writhing like the limbs of a centipede.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xuanhuang felt a sense of revulsion - this black-robed emissary was no longer human, only retaining human consciousness.</p><p></p><p>His body had already become a composite of insects, which was why he was so uncoordinated.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed emissary, his face distorted, pulled out a copper bell the size of a palm from his chest.</p><p></p><p>As he shook it, the villagers who were building the altar in the square began to rush towards Xuanhuang, howling.</p><p></p><p>They had no intelligence, just a group of puppets whose souls had been controlled.</p><p></p><p>The entire village was like a captive enclosure.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>Thought coalesced.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The Guihu Great Millstone appeared, flashing with black and white light.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers rushing towards Xuanhuang, as the great millstone appeared and began to spin, had their black auras start to become turbulent.</p><p></p><p>The great millstone was like a huge source of attraction.</p><p></p><p>Wherever Xuanhuang's will was directed, that was where it would target.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was very reluctant to simply kill these villagers who were under control.</p><p></p><p>Instead of that, it would be better for the Guihu Great Millstone to extract the source that was controlling them. Then it would be up to their own fate whether they lived or died.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing screams rang out, some convulsing, some already fallen and unable to rise, and some stubbornly supporting themselves on their knees.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed emissary was already in a state of panic, frantically running towards the strange building.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang chased after him.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the strange building, it was as if he had entered a layer of pitch-black mystery.</p><p></p><p>What met his eyes was a stone sculpture of a centipede.</p><p></p><p>This statue was dozens of meters tall, ferocious and icy cold, sculpted with great realism.</p><p></p><p>Just like the real thing.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>A crisp breaking sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha, everyone is going to die, everyone is going to die, die!" </p><p></p><p>Like a madman, the black-robed emissary, black blood flowing from his chest, began to wither as the black blood flowed towards the blood groove in front of the centipede statue.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Another sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>The black stone attached to the surface of the centipede statue began to shatter.</p><p></p><p>A red glow emanated from the cracks.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, a first-stage transcendent being?"</p><p></p><p>The red glow emanating, Xuanhuang sensed a tremendous threat. The intensity was absolutely at the transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>This was originally a petrified centipede, and now the black-robed emissary had awakened it.</p><p></p><p>"Great King... save..." </p><p></p><p>The black-robed emissary in front of the blood groove was instantly bitten and devoured by the half-exposed centipede head.</p><p></p><p>"Squeak squeak!"</p><p></p><p>It was like sucking fruit juice, and the already emaciated black-robed emissary was directly drained dry.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Xuanhuang feeling bewildered. Did he really die like this, going mad? But now was not the time to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took a leap, and the power of his entire body descended with a void saber slash.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Sparks flew, the scales of this demonic creature were indeed extremely hard. So far, the void saber could not prevail.</p><p></p><p>Only the added "Shock and Soul Extinguish" ability made the still-struggling centipede let out a howl, and its already chaotic consciousness became even more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, quickly run, the day demon that has been awakened has no reason, and will attack everything frantically until its spiritual soul is exhausted and it dies."</p><p></p><p>At this time, two young villagers supporting the old man who had previously led Xuanhuang into the village appeared at the door.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, quickly go!"</p><p></p><p>The old man hurriedly urged.</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at the centipede that was still struggling to break free from its petrification with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not hesitate either, since he could not break the armor, there was no use in staying. </p><p></p><p>He followed the three of them and ran out.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, quick, hide in the underground cave."</p><p></p><p>The old man, out of breath, was being supported.</p><p></p><p>He pointed his crutch at a house in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The four of them quickly entered a small courtyard, and on the left side of the courtyard was a large stone entrance to an underground cave.</p><p></p><p>Next to it was a huge stone block.</p><p></p><p>They let the old man enter first, and Xuanhuang was the last to enter. </p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang's body was halfway in, he pulled the stone block to block the cave entrance, and slowly descended downward.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading, if you have time, please turn to the next page for the updated continuation.

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the blood-stained calligraphy brush in his hand, Xuanhuang fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He took out the love letter and found that it had changed as well. </p><p></p><p>There were no sweet words, only a dilapidated paper with a large courtyard drawn in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The eerie brush should be called the "Ominous Dream Brush".</p><p></p><p>After it lost its uncanny power, Xuanhuang probed its abilities with his spiritual sense and easily uncovered its capabilities.</p><p></p><p>As long as the user of this brush paints a picture with their own blood and gives it to someone else, they can pull the holder of the painting into a dream through the Ominous Dream Brush.</p><p></p><p>In the dream, you can freely splash ink and wield the brush to kill the person you've pulled into the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the ink used to paint in the dream is the spiritual essence of the dream creator, and those who don't know how to use spiritual essence will end up sacrificing their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>It is an extremely ominous ability.</p><p></p><p>First, the painting that pulls someone into the dream requires the creator's own fresh blood. </p><p></p><p>Then, the painting in the dream requires the creator's spiritual essence and lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Drinking blood and extracting souls.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful dream-creating ability, yet it is used in such an evil way," Xuanhuang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"But this thing has great potential, if I use my own will to replace the blood, I can greatly benefit from pulling people into dreams."</p><p></p><p>As for the spiritual essence ink, that is something Xuanhuang has no shortage of. </p><p></p><p>Every time he refines the Abyss Grinder, it produces a large amount, which has been accumulating uselessly in his small world.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he needs it, he can just take it out and use it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether non-self spiritual essence is suitable or not?</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang declared: "Once they enter my world, they belong to me, for I am the will of heaven."</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait until I reach the First Realm before using it. Using it now would be like reviving its ominous power, which has just barely faded and settled. This is not the best time."</p><p></p><p>"When my will takes physical form, I won't fear its revival, as my will shall replace it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang temporarily put away the Ominous Dream Brush and the blood-stained paper.</p><p></p><p>This paper is also an ominous item, as it is a ready-made dream scene, that of the grand courtyard from the Republican era. </p><p></p><p>Although the paper appears dilapidated, it is very difficult to destroy. It will be very useful in the future.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is a self-reliant cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Any object can become a subject for him to study and analyze.</p><p></p><p>If he can mass-produce this kind of paper in the future, he can consider using it for talismans, paper-cutting, puppets, contracts, summonings, card-making, and more.</p><p></p><p>The essence remains the same, only the operating rules differ.</p><p></p><p>Carefully storing the Ominous Dream Brush and the blood-stained paper in a prepared jade box, Xuanhuang placed them away.</p><p></p><p>All the ominous beings sealed in this world must be stored in tightly sealed jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards...</p><p></p><p>He entered his spiritual space.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Grinder that had absorbed the Ominous Dream Brush was now floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it has indeed solidified."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-Earth Furnace, due to constant refinement of his will, was the closest to solidification.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the "Ominous Dream Brush Iron" one-stop service allowed the Abyss Grinder to be fully nourished.</p><p></p><p>It can now condense into the physical world.</p><p></p><p>In other words, he doesn't need to reach the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>He can now control the Abyss Grinder with his thoughts and manifest it in the real world.</p><p></p><p>This is the biggest harvest from this experience.</p><p></p><p>Although Xuanhuang is confident that he can reach the First Realm in ten days at the latest, having more methods is always better.</p><p></p><p>He has already sealed a ominous being, finally feeling a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Heavenly-Earth Furnace and the Heavenly Pillar again.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-Earth Furnace should be able to progress along with him into the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pillar is a bit lacking, being too illusory. It needs an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang thought of one of his starting points: the "Blood Pool Ominous Being".</p><p></p><p>After reaching the First Realm, he will seek an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>According to the painting seen in the Martial Hall, the Blood Pool Ominous Being is at the peak of the First Realm, and by utilizing the secret power of the Blood Pool Realm, it can reach the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not an easy problem to solve.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xuanhuang has another starting point, which is his own Grinder.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, this is his "true starting point".</p><p></p><p>His biggest asset right now is still in the Grinder space.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Small World in Between.</p><p></p><p>"We can't forget this old buddy, we need to get stronger quickly, we can't let the old millstone buddy wait too long."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang made a wish.</p><p></p><p>"But this thing should be the 7th A-level Bizarre Disaster 'Guihu', this one is not easy to ask for, anything with that name won't be simple."</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuanhuang has witnessed an A-level Bizarre Land.</p><p></p><p>The dream realm pulled in by the Nightmare Brush, is the 'Nightmare Space'.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, this existence cannot be strictly called Bizarre.</p><p></p><p>It's more like a world born from the fusion of myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>A small world dependent on the main world.</p><p></p><p>The endless desires of all living beings formed the 'Abyss'.</p><p></p><p>The endless dreams of all living beings formed the 'Nightmare Space'.</p><p></p><p>The endless spirits of all living beings formed the 'Sea of Suffering'.</p><p></p><p>The final obsessions of all living beings, as well as the dilapidated small worlds, formed the 'Guihu'.</p><p></p><p>The Karmic Retribution should be the 'Nine Underworld Hellfire Domain', the White Bone Remnant Souls are the 'Green Mud Yellow Springs', and the Bloody Return is the 'Sea of Blood'.</p><p></p><p>They are products of the fusion of worlds.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back in the safe house, as his will grew stronger, his power advanced rapidly, and he needed less and less time to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has gradually gotten used to cultivating through meditation.</p><p></p><p>After the impact of the Nightmare Brush, his will can continue to be refined.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took out the fierce wolves he had birthed that morning, planning to continue.</p><p></p><p>Three fierce wolves at a time, his will will advance to the ninth layer today.</p><p></p><p>Raging flames spread, the will being constantly forged is about to take shape.</p><p></p><p>Will is the integration of essence, energy and spirit, so it can exist in the Sea of Suffering, can exist in the Yellow Court, and can also exist in the Purple Palace.</p><p></p><p>The three dantians in a person, the will can control them all.</p><p></p><p>The method Xuanhuang deduced, after entering the first stage, the consciousness enters the Sea of Suffering.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Heavenly-Earth Furnace will also guard the Sea of Suffering.</p><p></p><p>When the first stage is perfected and the golden bridge across the Sea of Suffering is built, he will break through the middle dantian's Yellow Court, and then enter the Yellow Court through the Heavenly Pillar.  At that time, the will will also rise along the golden bridge, advancing into the Yellow Court.</p><p></p><p>This realm is extraordinary, the will must always be at the forefront, replacing the twisted will of the small self.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the will must be forged at all times.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day, the Essence Sea will not dry up, the Qi Sea will not be extinguished, the Spirit Sea will not perish, and the three seas of essence, energy and spirit will be integrated, and the will will be eternal.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there will be no need for forging anymore.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the exhaustion of the essence blood of the three fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>With a 'hum', the vast sky and boundless ocean.</p><p></p><p>The will seems to have broken free from the thick mud.</p><p></p><p>There is a sense of ethereal spirituality.</p><p></p><p>This is the highest point of the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The will has a stirring, just waiting to transform from formless to form, from cocoon to butterfly.</p><p></p><p>Can clearly feel this kind of fluctuation, but trying to use it is elusive, faint and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>"Phew - No hurry, just one step away from the Dragon Gate."</p><p></p><p>Calm the waves in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When he stood up again, it was a bright and sunny day.</p><p></p><p>His cousin Liu Wenhe called, Xuanhuang told him that he had completely solved the problem, and he was safe now.</p><p></p><p>In the cousin's dazed state, Xuanhuang hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>But Jin Ning's arrival brought both good and bad news.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that after two days of contemplating the 'Heavenly-Earth Furnace' visualization diagram, he felt the muddy sensation in his body had eased a bit.</p><p></p><p>This means that while he was concentrating on visualizing the diagram, his will was also being tempered.</p><p></p><p>This made Xuanhuang very satisfied, indicating that his idea was feasible.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning has also only cultivated the first layer of will, the highest he can reach is the second layer.</p><p></p><p>Stronger than the original owner, when Xuanhuang first arrived, the original owner didn't even have a single layer of will.</p><p></p><p>The bad news is that the Bizarre Alley has appeared again, and it's another painful lesson.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the incident in Fulin Community has even worsened the situation.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a bizarre tree hanging with corpses can be seen in the center square of the community, rampaging wildly.</p><p></p><p>"There will be changes in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Another sentence that confuses Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging the Heavenly-Earth Furnace visualization diagram, the two bid farewell to each other again.</p><p></p><p>...

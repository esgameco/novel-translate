        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't mind, and instead said, "This task was taken on by our martial arts school. It's right up our alley."</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts school? Don't you need to contact the Exorcism Department? Can the martial arts school also deal with the supernatural?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing her words, Xuanhuang didn't get angry.</p><p></p><p>"Now our martial arts school has expanded its business. Whether it's regular public security, beast disasters, or even supernatural incidents, they are all within the scope of our business."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't mean it that way, I'm just worried..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, no one will joke around with their own lives." He then said, "Wait, let me call someone."</p><p></p><p>In the woman's surprised gaze, Xuanhuang dialed Sun Hui's phone.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Headmaster Sun. Yes, it's me. There's a supernatural incident that needs to be handled. Yes, please arrange for a few people to come over, mainly for assistance and cleanup work."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay."</p><p></p><p>"No need to notify the Exorcism Department, we'll handle it ourselves, and take the opportunity to train a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, good. I'm at XXX, I'll wait here."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>He asked the woman, "By the way, is this the medical clinic you used to have?"</p><p></p><p>The woman hurriedly nodded, "Yes, it's the clinic we closed down before. I went to secretly take a look this morning, and sure enough, it's open. That 'colleague' of mine is running it herself."</p><p></p><p>"Your 'colleague', can you see anything different about her?"</p><p></p><p>The woman shook her head thoughtfully, "I can't see anything different. It's the same as before. I was so nervous at the time that I didn't observe it carefully."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she thought of something, "Oh yes, this morning when I went to the plastic surgery clinic, I saw her parents helping out there."</p><p></p><p>"Her parents?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was also puzzled, and asked, "Don't they know she's already dead?"</p><p></p><p>"They do, but I saw them there today."</p><p></p><p>The woman looked like she was about to cry again.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang calmly sensed the woman. If it weren't for his extraordinary willpower, he would have thought he had fallen into a classic plot twist, where the woman was actually the one who had died. Since that possibility has been temporarily ruled out...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang pondered, could the woman's colleague's parents also be in danger? Is the entire plastic surgery clinic now supernatural?</p><p></p><p>Is this a case of supernatural beings returning from the dead, and first eliminating the entire family?</p><p></p><p>Soon, a business car from the martial arts school stopped not far away.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang was the first to get off the car. Behind him were three others, the familiar Jin Ning, and a young man and woman.</p><p></p><p>The young man was familiar to Xuanhuang, he was the former genius of the martial arts school, already at the peak of martial arts, not far from the level of a martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>The woman was stunningly beautiful, a newcomer that even Xuanhuang had not seen before, but she also had the level of a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan," Wu Gang respectfully greeted Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"This is Sun Tong, the niece of Headmaster Sun Hui. She and Jin Ning will be your assistants from now on."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong stole a glance at Xuanhuang and respectfully said, "Master Xuan, I am Sun Tong. The school has arranged for me and Jin Ning to be your assistants."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't mind, it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts school genius, Yun Fei, also stepped forward and greeted, "Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group that had arrived, they all addressed Xuanhuang as "Master Xuan".</p><p></p><p>The woman suddenly felt that she had met an important figure.</p><p></p><p>"Hello everyone, and what should I call you, Miss?" Xuanhuang asked the woman.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Li Li, you can just call me Xiao Li."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, this is Miss Li Li, she encountered a supernatural incident. Let's go, we'll talk on the way..."</p><p></p><p>The group got into the car and, following Li Li's guidance, headed to the plastic surgery clinic.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the car, Xuanhuang briefly explained the situation to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang frowned deeply, as the martial arts school had never handled any strange incidents before. They had always followed the Zhenxie Department's spiritual practitioners to handle the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they were the main force, and although they all knew they were just there to make up the numbers, the key was Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>But it was still the first time, so they were quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, this should be a newly emerged strange incident that our martial arts school has no record of," Wu Gang summarized. "According to what Ms. Li said, the woman has already died, and it was a homicide. We can't guarantee the murderer is an ordinary person; it might be the work of something strange."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Ms. Li, who is handling the case?" </p><p></p><p>Li Li replied, "Since it's suspected to be a homicide case, the military police are handling it."</p><p></p><p>After Li Li's response, Wu Gang looked at Xuanhuang. "Master Xuan, there must be something missing here. They've just handled it as a simple case."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded and asked, "What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>The three young people pondered after Xuanhuang's inquiry.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong said, "Master Xuan, I agree with the master of the martial arts school's speculation. This seems to be a new strange incident, and not only has the deceased revived, but her family members are also in the clinic, so they must have encountered some misfortune. I suspect..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Go on, be bold in your thoughts and speculations," Xuanhuang encouraged.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan," Sun Tong continued. "Perhaps it's because I'm a girl, but I've thought a bit more. I suspect it might be similar to a 'Skin Flaying' strange incident, where the deceased woman was murdered and her face was peeled off. Unless it's a psychopath who killed someone and then removed their skin, this is worth suspecting."</p><p></p><p>After she said this, everyone fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Li Li, lead the way. Let's go check on your colleague's place first, before going to the shop," Xuanhuang said to the driver, Cloud Fly, after Sun Tong's words, as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"I feel the woman's parents might have actually encountered some misfortune," Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the woman's home first," he instructed.</p><p></p><p>Under Li Li's guidance, Cloud Fly quickly changed direction.</p><p></p><p>About 20 minutes later, the group arrived at an old residential area.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of a six-story building, they noticed there were mostly elderly residents, and the foot traffic was sparse.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the martial arts masters from the martial arts school?" an old man who was strolling by asked, seeing the group's attire and bearing.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning replied, "Yes, grandpa, we are from the martial arts school, here to follow up on the previous homicide case."</p><p></p><p>"The Jin family, they live right downstairs from me. I'm on the third floor, they're on the second. This wretched world is no place for people to live in. His daughter wasn't killed by some strange thing, but by a murderer. Can you believe it..." the old man lamented about the difficult times.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, have you noticed anything unusual recently? Like the deceased's parents not behaving erratically or anything?" Sun Tong asked, trying to steer the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"Unusual?" The old man pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to recall something, he said, "Does the foul stench from their home count? These past few days, whenever I pass by their door, I always smell this terrible stench. They've been neighbors for decades, and with the young Jin having lost his daughter, I didn't have the heart to say anything to him."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong nodded. "That counts. Anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" the old man continued. "Oh yes, they've been going out early and coming back late lately, and they're always carrying a doll. I even asked Jin what that was about, and he said it was a memento of his daughter, who used to be a doctor and had a clinic."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old man turned into a Conan-like detective and asked, "Are you suspecting a medical dispute? That the murderer might be one of the daughter's former patients?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning hurriedly shook his head. "No, no, we're just conducting normal investigations and inquiries. Alright, grandpa, you go about your business. We'll go take a look upstairs."</p><p></p><p>They quickly stopped the old man from spiraling into more speculations.</p><p></p><p>The group then headed upstairs.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

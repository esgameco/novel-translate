        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I was summoned by the Deputy Director, who said a major event had occurred, that the path of the Martial Way still had a future, and that humanity's hope had arrived."</p><p></p><p>"I was informed by the Vice Director of the Martial Arts, who said a transcendent martial arts master would be giving a lecture soon. I'm still a bit confused, as it seems you all didn't know about this either."</p><p></p><p>The gathered crowd discussed this after assembling in the training hall.</p><p></p><p>The words "transcendent martial arts" were so powerfully alluring.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the news that this could be achieved left everyone deeply puzzled and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible, how can one achieve transcendent martial arts without losing control? Didn't they say there was still no solution? Wasn't Master Liu, our former senior, at the peak of martial arts mastery, but had to leave our sect because he feared losing control?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Master Liu was a natural martial arts genius, reaching the peak in just three years, but had to temporarily leave the populated areas because there was no path forward. I heard his strength reached 6,000 kilograms a year ago."</p><p></p><p>"As for powerful experts, I've also seen some. There was a Taoist priest at the headquarters whose strength reached 7,000 kilograms. I don't know how he did it, but I've heard it's related to willpower."</p><p></p><p>"Willpower is so mysterious. People have been researching it for many years but still haven't found a solution."</p><p></p><p>The discussions among the crowd continued back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Until the three Deputy Directors and the Director arrived.</p><p></p><p>The crowd then stopped their discussions and looked up at the leaders on the stage.</p><p></p><p>Director Sun Hui's gaze was resolute, dispelling the lingering confusion.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang was the most excited, his excitement written all over his face, his thick beard unable to conceal it.</p><p></p><p>"Quiet down."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui said solemnly, "Now, please welcome the transcendent martial artist, Master Xuanhuang, to guide us on the path forward."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said these words, an uproar erupted.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang?</p><p></p><p>Everyone was very familiar with him. He had just entered the realm of martial artists a mere two weeks ago, and had since shown remarkable progress.</p><p></p><p>To say he had achieved the transcendent level, it would be more accurate to say that about Master Liu.</p><p></p><p>Among them was Liu Jinquan, who was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Not just them, even the three Directors who had not yet seen Xuanhuang were filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Believing it was one thing, but without seeing it, they still had doubts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous rumble swept through the entire hall.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling golden light could be seen emanating from one of the entrances, so brilliant it was intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an overwhelming sense of pressure.</p><p></p><p>All present were martial artists, though mostly at the disciple level. Yet this level of pressure, the stronger the cultivator, the more intensely they felt it.</p><p></p><p>The four Directors on stage felt it the most strongly.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang's pressure had been directed at any one of them, they might have collapsed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>No words were needed, this pressure alone conveyed everything.</p><p></p><p>If this was not transcendent, then what was?</p><p></p><p>Striding as if through the void, Xuanhuang came to the center and withdrew his pressure.</p><p></p><p>The intense oppressive feeling immediately vanished.</p><p></p><p>The Directors were convinced, their excitement evident on their faces as they gazed intently at Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings everyone, I am Xuanhuang. I have made some progress in the Martial Way, and have come today to share my insights with you."</p><p></p><p>His gentle tone was a stark contrast to the overwhelming pressure he had just exuded. It was hard to believe this amiable Xuanhuang was the same person.</p><p></p><p>"Applaud, applaud!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Gang's rough voice bellowed, his hands clapping loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Applause erupted"</p><p></p><p>The awestruck crowd hurriedly joined in the applause.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of Xuanhuang's previous state, at this moment he was undoubtedly transcendent.</p><p></p><p>As for anyone being dissatisfied? Unlikely. Even if he was only at the first level, this was a difference on a fundamental level of existence.</p><p></p><p>All the people present combined would not be a match for a transcendent. </p><p></p><p>The distinction between heaven and earth, challenging one's superiors would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Possible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, excluding Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"To achieve extraordinary martial dao, it's actually very simple, first achieve extraordinary will."</p><p></p><p>This was Xuanhuang's first sentence.</p><p></p><p>It is also the prerequisite for everything.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? The prerequisite for extraordinary martial dao is extraordinary will."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the previously puzzled pavilion master Sun Hui felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary will? How is that possible to achieve?"</p><p></p><p>"I've read the discussions about 'My Will Represents the Will of Heaven', saying that the will of Heaven is not complete, as long as my will represents the will of Heaven and I can achieve self-control, I can break through to the extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"But, isn't the condensation of will not just guesswork, but requires an extremely high starting foundation?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've also seen such discussions, saying that as long as you find a way to refine the will, and can make the will formless yet tangible, you can control yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this considered an impossible goal?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"How did Lord Xuanhuang achieve it?"</p><p></p><p>This was the common thought of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Then Xuanhuang spoke again: "The will is the integration of essence, qi, and spirit, it is the existence that is most like the Dao among us humans."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, it is so universal, everyone has it, but everyone also cannot control it, it seems simple but is actually difficult."</p><p></p><p>"To refine the will, I have a method, the 'Visualization of the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible'!"</p><p></p><p>"This method was created by me. To visualize this diagram, you need a firm mentality, a spiritual mind, and to depict the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible in the sea of consciousness... Forge the spirit and soul, use the breath as the guide, the inner qi and blood as the fuel... to continuously temper one's own will."</p><p></p><p>"The spirit is the master of man, the qi is the impetus of man, the essence is the foundation of man, the integration of the three forms the will. For those who cultivate this method..."</p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang unfolded the description,</p><p></p><p>The confused crowd suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Especially after hearing that this method was created by Xuanhuang himself, the crowd's gaze towards him became different.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought he was just a lucky one, but unexpectedly he was a master creator of methods.</p><p></p><p>Now, everyone still doesn't understand how Xuanhuang did it, such an existence shouldn't appear.</p><p></p><p>They are all within the system of the laws of heaven and earth, how did you create a system of your own?</p><p></p><p>Even if this system is very simple and insignificant compared to the system of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>How did he achieve it, Xuanhuang would not tell.</p><p></p><p>This relates to his biggest secret, and it will remain the biggest mystery.</p><p></p><p>"By learning this method, the will will be strengthened during the condensation of the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, all the way until the sea of consciousness is completely and fully condensed. Then there are two paths, one is the Refining Path, the other is the Imprinting Path."</p><p></p><p>"Refining Path: Continuously temper the will through your own will, but this method is very difficult. In my estimation, for those with outstanding natural talent, it would take at least three years; for those with average talent, it would take ten years; for those with ordinary talent, it's a matter of luck; for those with mediocre talent, it may be hopeless for life."</p><p></p><p>"Imprinting Path: After completely depicting the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, there are twelve inscribed texts. Imprinting just one text is refining the will at the first layer, imprinting nine texts is refining the will at the ninth layer, imprinting ten texts is perfection, and imprinting twelve texts breaks the limit to the ultimate level. Imprinting nine texts can already impact extraordinary will, but the risk of failure is very high, ten texts have a fifty percent chance, twelve texts are a sure success."</p><p></p><p>"The two paths can also be cultivated together, how to choose is up to you to decide."</p><p></p><p>This is the method Xuanhuang gave to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Refining Path is relying on the will of Xuanhuang's small world, replacing the distorted will of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>As for the Imprinting Path, it relies on Xuanhuang himself and the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, replacing the distorted will of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>These two methods, in the end, are just crowdsourcing immortal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One is adding bricks and tiles to Xuanhuang's small world, the other is adding bricks and tiles to the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was still in a daze, when suddenly the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible appeared.</p><p></p><p>The bronze-colored three-legged crucible was shining brightly, slowly rotating, emanating an extraordinary aura just like Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"This is because I felt the difficulty of refining the will, so I created the method and forged the visualization instrument at the same time. As long as one inscribed text is imprinted on it, it can link to this instrument, and this instrument can replace the will of Heaven to suppress the essence, qi, and spirit, which is the Imprinting Path I mentioned."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

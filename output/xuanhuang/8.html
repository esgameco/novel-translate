        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the wild boars gathered before him, Xuanhuang was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>There were at least six wild boars, totaling over 5,000 jin (2,500 kg). The boar king alone weighed over a ton.</p><p></p><p>"Plans are not as flexible as changes."</p><p></p><p>"Let's refine them."</p><p></p><p>Previously, Xuanhuang had planned that the level of will tempering was higher than the physical level, but now he could only refine the wild boars to enhance his physical level.</p><p></p><p>Will tempering requires time to recover and control, while the body can be freely manipulated.</p><p></p><p>With the six wild boars perfectly refined by Xuanhuang, he could reach the fourth layer of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was at the second layer of will refinement and the second layer of body refinement, very balanced.</p><p></p><p>The will refinement had just entered the second layer that morning, and it would take at least until the next day to become familiar and recover.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if the spiritual space was stable enough, he could have stored the 5,000-6,000 jin of wild boars, but the current limit was only 2,000 jin.</p><p></p><p>The decision was made, and he began.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang first collected three wild boars, nearly 2,000 jin in weight.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>In the spiritual space.</p><p></p><p>The Guihu Great Grinder began to rumble and turn, the gray remnant souls were drawn out and then ground away, leaving only three strands of transparent substance that merged into the Guihu Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>This time, he clearly discovered that the "spirit" of the wild boars, the true essence, was fused into the illusory Guihu Great Grinder, causing the grinder to solidify a little.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>The illusory Heavenly Pillar Tree's roots entwined, and the skin, fur, bones, and flesh of the three wild boars rapidly transformed, with the "qi" of the wild boars' true essence merging into the Heavenly Pillar Tree.</p><p></p><p>And then...</p><p></p><p>The remaining blood and essence were devoured by the Three-Legged Furnace, and the pure vital energy quickly filled Xuanhuang's body.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, like a surging river, Xuanhuang instantly reached the third layer of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>The "essence" of the wild boars' true essence was absorbed by the Furnace, and the Heavenly-Earth Furnace also solidified a little.</p><p></p><p>For a while, the pure vital energy continued to supplement him until Xuanhuang had fully absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>"So all beings with a spirit have a true essence hidden in their essence, qi, and spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang seemed to have understood where the true essence absorbed by the Guihu Great Grinder, Heavenly Pillar Tree, and Heavenly-Earth Furnace came from.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang put away the boar king and planned to reach the fourth layer of body refinement in one step.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>Repeating the process, continuously strengthening the level of body refinement, until the boar king was completely refined, and Xuanhuang reached the fourth layer of body refinement as planned.</p><p></p><p>An inexplicable restraint appeared, as if it would be dangerous to continue strengthening the body.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the situation faced by the martial artists in this world?"</p><p></p><p>With a body reaching 4,000 kg of immense strength, but a will only at the second layer, he suddenly felt a sense of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>"But I won't give you that chance."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked up at the sky, which seemed to be twisting and distorting.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two wild boars, totaling over 1,000 jin, were simple to collect, and with the fourth layer of body refinement, his will had also grown significantly.</p><p></p><p>At least in the middle to late second layer of will refinement, the spiritual space could hold more weight.</p><p></p><p>"It's 4:30 pm, time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Checking his watch, it was already past 4 pm, and Xuanhuang had a good harvest, so he planned to return.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Huh, something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Upon returning, Xuanhuang found that the thread he had pulled at the cave entrance was broken, and a blood-curdling scent that did not belong to the blood pool was permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his long knife, he cautiously approached the cave entrance, focusing his senses.</p><p></p><p>"Screechâ€”"</p><p></p><p>A harsh cry suddenly assaulted his mind, as if his head was being attacked. Fortunately, his will was not weak, and he had a spiritual space, or the situation would have been dire for an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>A gust of air rushed towards him, accompanied by a spiritual attack.</p><p></p><p>A huge bat with a wingspan of over a meter burst out of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Shing!" The fine thread he had pulled obstructed it, but it quickly broke through.</p><p></p><p>But that was enough.</p><p></p><p>After this slight obstruction, Xuanhuang had already struck the bat with his knife.</p><p></p><p>"Clang, clang!" The sound of metal clashing rang out.</p><p></p><p>This was a mutated, ferocious bat, and its transformed body collided with the blade, producing a metallic clash.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang's 4,000 kg of immense strength was no small feat either.</p><p></p><p>The bat's greatest killer move was the spiritual attack, and although its body had mutated, that was not the focus of its transformation.</p><p></p><p>Despite the metallic clashing, it was still split in two by Xuanhuang and plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Rattle, rattle, rattle..."</p><p></p><p>Knowing that this creature was like a puppet, Xuanhuang knew that if he didn't completely crush it, it would still cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not pause at all, and continued to hack at the bisected bat until it was completely shattered and unable to take shape.</p><p></p><p>He then stomped his foot and carefully sensed the interior of the cave.</p><p></p><p>Until he discovered that there was only one, not a group of bats, did he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"In just four hours, an animal has been attracted and mutated, the blood pool is ominous..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>"Does it only lure animals with just instincts?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang currently had no intention of entering the fissure in the cave to investigate the secret of the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>He was very self-aware, currently weak, so he would avoid danger as much as possible and wait until he was confident before resolving it.</p><p></p><p>The Master said: Weakness is not an obstacle to survival, but arrogance is.</p><p></p><p>Cautiously cultivate, step by step.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up, he found more dense silk threads to wrap around.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the broken mutated bat, Xuanhuang returned to the safe house.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged, focused his mind throughout his body, and when he opened his eyes again, it was already past 7 o'clock in the evening.</p><p></p><p>Outside, it was pitch black, and the devouring aura from the cave entrance permeated the air, like a demonic presence brandishing its claws.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm! The will is more stable, could it be a benefit of the body becoming stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly he realized - the will that would have taken him until tomorrow to settle, could now be tempered again.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing more to say about that.</p><p></p><p>He quickly ate some food and began forging.</p><p></p><p>The four-layer blood qi of the body refining, at least comparable to ten large elixirs' worth of firewood, and the two dead pigs in the consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble-" The three-piece set began to work hard.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the pain, the will in the furnace was repeatedly hammered by the iron hammer, the scorching aura like a raging fire refining it.</p><p></p><p>The two wild pigs were burned away.</p><p></p><p>The three-piece set each took what they needed, and by the time it was almost dawn, Xuanhuang had reached the third layer of will refinement.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the previous muddy feeling in his body and the shackled feeling in his spirit and soul had dissipated quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>The self-transcendence simulation had been repeated many times, but at this moment Xuanhuang was truly certain: - This path is viable!...</p><p></p><p>Morning.</p><p></p><p>"You weren't injured, were you?"</p><p></p><p>"No, you..." When Xuanhuang reported the situation from yesterday to Jin Ning, Jin Ning hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently checking on Xuanhuang, he suddenly felt that Xuanhuang had changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>It was like the feeling of looking at a martial arts master.</p><p></p><p>"I was not injured, there is no need to summon the deputy director, I can handle it easily." Xuanhuang also said, "I have had a slight breakthrough, it seems to be the progress stimulated by the environment."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was stunned, thinking, "Is this what a genius is like?"</p><p></p><p>How come he didn't feel this kid was so outrageous before?</p><p></p><p>Not only could he quickly adapt to the environment, but he could also quickly become proficient in combat, and even have a breakthrough after a crisis.</p><p></p><p>"You are stronger than me and have more talent, but I still need to advise you on a couple of things."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning said, "After breaking through to the martial arts master, you should have a sense of restraint, a premonition of impending crisis, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand the reason?"</p><p></p><p>"I've read the discussions of other martial arts masters on the martial arts forum."</p><p></p><p>"Good, the martial arts have temporarily reached their limit, and from now on you need to control yourself, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled and said, "I understand. Don't worry, I won't joke around with my own life."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you understand. Becoming a martial arts master, your personal safety will be greatly improved, so the dojo doesn't have to rush to find someone to replace you for now."</p><p></p><p>"Is there another situation?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning nodded, "Last night, two more comrades were sacrificed, and in addition, one spirit master was seriously injured, and thirty-four ordinary civilians were killed, with nearly a hundred injured."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Alley appeared in our city, and by the time it was discovered, it was too late. We suffered heavy losses but gained nothing, Zhang Tianling the spirit master risked his life to intervene, but he only managed to rescue the people inside the Mysterious Alley."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Alley is still there?"</p><p></p><p>"It disappeared." Jin Ning shook his head, and then said, "But once the Mysterious Alley appears in a city, it means it will appear at any time in the future, and the regularity of its appearance has not been summarized so far."</p><p></p><p>"There is no way to know what triggers its appearance."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang silently nodded, "I see, I don't need to find someone to replace me here for now, you can go back and convey this to the director."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, take care of yourself, see you tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"See you tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>A simple agreement, but now a mere wish.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble-"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning drove away.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked at the distant city, turned around silently and headed towards the mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>...

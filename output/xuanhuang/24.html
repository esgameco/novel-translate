        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Everything has been prepared, weren't you just wondering about it?</p><p></p><p>There must be something to replace the will of heaven, and it turns out there is indeed.</p><p></p><p>The law is created by Xuanhuang, and the tools are also created by Xuanhuang. This is truly the behavior of the great Dao master, even the ancestral Dao lord.</p><p></p><p>However, the crowd also has other doubts.</p><p></p><p>For example, the fusion of the law can be based on the three-legged bronze furnace.</p><p></p><p>What about the refining of the law? Where is the will of heaven and earth needed for the refining? It's not the distorted will of heaven at the moment.</p><p></p><p>This is a problem that everyone is smart, no one dares to ask, what do you want a bicycle for.</p><p></p><p>Then the crowd fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the law, fusing the law? Refining the law relies on self-refinement, which looks more independent, but the elder said it is more difficult, for those with outstanding natural talents, at least three years, I feel I'm still okay, I plan to take this path."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the outstanding natural talents in the elder's eyes may be different from what you understand. What if the elder compares it to himself?"</p><p></p><p>"This? This shouldn't be the case, right? If you compare it like this, what's the point?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what's the point of your independent and autonomous? Come on, tell me what's the point."</p><p></p><p>"Go away, a rotten tree cannot be carved."</p><p></p><p>"... "</p><p></p><p>"Old Sun, how do you choose between the two paths?"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun heard it and smiled leisurely: "What two paths? Isn't there just one path?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun joked: "It's clear that you didn't listen carefully. The elder said they can be done simultaneously, so it's not about choosing one and sticking to it. It's a simple matter, the priority is to save your life, so the simple fusion of the law is the way to go. Once your life is secured, you'll have room to maneuver, then you can learn the refining of the law."</p><p></p><p>Wow, the smart Old Sun, planning to contribute to Xuanhuang twice.</p><p></p><p>But it's undeniable that nine out of ten people choose this way.</p><p></p><p>Only half insist on refining the law, believing that they are geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Another half feel that they are just average, so they will firmly take the path of fusion, as practicing both will slow them down.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang gave the crowd enough time to think.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang put away the heavenly and earthly smelting furnace, and then said, "With a physique that transcends the mundane like mine just now, the power of qi and blood can detach from the body, and a single arm can reach a mighty force of 100,000 kilograms."</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang simply swung his fist, and a sharp sound of breaking the air appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The golden qi covering the fist flew towards a 30-centimeter-thick cement wall 10 meters away after separating from Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a large hole appeared in the wall.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the transcendent martial way?"</p><p></p><p>"It's too terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked at the several hall masters: "Sorry. This way you can have a more intuitive feeling."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, no problem, please continue, great one." Sun Hui quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang didn't even think of this, he was just as shocked and amazed as everyone else.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the key..." Xuanhuang continued: "What you just saw is just ordinary, just a little more strength. The most important thing is the qi and blood power of the transcendent first stage, each attack carries an intention within, this is a higher dimensional energy, a means to resist the bizarre."</p><p></p><p>This is the true ability of the transcendent first stage.</p><p></p><p>The corresponding is the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Including covering one's body, it can resist bizarre attacks and physical attacks. If you wield a weapon, you can also attach it to the weapon, and you can start from this to comprehend the Dao of the knife, the Dao of the sword, and so on."</p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang unfolded, the crowd beamed with joy, and a bright future lay ahead.</p><p></p><p>Including the Dao of the knife, the Dao of the sword, and so on that Xuanhuang mentioned.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation of the transcendent, this mysterious realm has a starting point, and it can be comprehended.</p><p></p><p>However, it is nothing more than relying on Xuanhuang's small world to comprehend various Dao, and to achieve the accumulation of Xuanhuang's small world.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether it is the will endowed on the protective visualization diagram or the source of spiritual rhyme, they all come from the small world.</p><p></p><p>It can also become the foundation for the cultivation of other cultivators, and the medium that connects various cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The various true intentions refined by cultivators are nothing more than different branches.</p><p></p><p>The true intention of essence is given to the heavenly and earthly smelting furnace, and the true intention of qi..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The true meaning was given to Jianmu, and the true meaning of the gods was given to the great Guihu Grinder.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of the true meanings of other small worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, be quiet for a moment." Xuanhuang said again: "In addition to the extraordinary physical abilities, everyone should feel the extraordinary display of will."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang detached from the ground and floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>Then a huge aura of will swept over.</p><p></p><p>The crowd almost couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>There was also a kind of near-Dao feeling, so strong, dangerous yet beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"The will is all-encompassing, exhausting the limits of thinking. I won't show too much, just tell everyone a little bit, that the will is the king, and therefore undefeatable at the same level."</p><p></p><p>"Including the bizarre."</p><p></p><p>Just being undefeatable at the same level represents everything.</p><p></p><p>Constant, unrelenting impact.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the curtain was drawn.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang came to the Southern City for three things: brightness, brightness, and still the damn bright future.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Hui immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow colleagues."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui said firmly: "Even if I don't say it, everyone should respectfully address Master Xuanhuang as 'Xuanshi', I think everyone has no objection?"</p><p></p><p>"No objection."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanhuang can be called a teacher for all ages."</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted, and Xuanhuang was startled, thinking: "It's still early, it's still early."</p><p></p><p>"Passed, passed, as long as there is a harvest. After I arrange it, I will hand over the visualization diagram, as well as the complete cultivation method and fusion method to the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>"From worm to dragon, it all depends on everyone's efforts."</p><p></p><p>After speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Xuanhuang!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Xuanhuang, for your teaching grace."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanhuang is not at all excessive, he can be called a teacher for all ages."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanhuang's righteousness!" "Master Xuanhuang is undefeatable!"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanhuang..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd stood up one after another, thanking and praising.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>These praises were incidental, his original intention did not change, and he did not expect everyone to be so grateful.</p><p></p><p>He did it because he wanted to do it, not because he wanted everyone to be grateful.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Dean Sun Hui led Xuanhuang to the conference room.</p><p></p><p>A few deans and deputy deans temporarily stayed behind to arrange the crowd. Later, they brought the management team and top martial arts masters to the conference room.</p><p></p><p>There were far fewer people in the conference room, no more than twenty in total.</p><p></p><p>After sitting down, Sun Hui said, "Master Xuanhuang, how do you plan to arrange things next?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the title "Master Xuanhuang", he did not refuse, as he had done what he should have done and gained everyone's respect. If he refused, it would seem hypocritical and make others uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"During my stay in Qingyun Mountain, I discovered a secret realm world, a world no less than the small worlds of the martial dao and the immortal dao. In this world, the blood moon hangs in the sky... but the monsters it spawns are treasures. After spreading the visualization method, the resources needed for martial dao progress are not small..."</p><p></p><p>"The demonic beasts can be used as tempering, and can also be used as assistance in the initial stage of the martial dao. We will try to take control of this world. This world is special and has no other bizarre phenomena. The blood moon's bizarreness will not be deliberately explored for now, and there is no danger..."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there is also the blood pool secret realm, and the catalyzed animals can also become assistance. Swallowing the blood and flesh of fierce beasts, their frenzied energy, is a rare elixir for tempering the will, as long as it is not out of control..."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I plan to go to the previous scenic area, where there are many buildings, but no one is managing them."</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Arts Headquarters can also go there and settle down at the appropriate time. The progress of martial artists requires forging, requires conquest and killing. In the city, it is safe, but too conservative."</p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang spoke, the crowd's breathing became heavy.</p><p></p><p>This is the future of the martial dao, and the Master has already made so much preparation.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that he has already planned the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the visualization diagram that had lost its spiritual essence in his hand, Xuanhuang stored it back into his consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the vitality Xuanhuang had imbued could only maintain it for a day. It would be fine once he reached the first realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Fulin Community that Jin Ning had mentioned, and the mysterious alley that had appeared again? "You've provoked me again, you'll get what's coming to you."</p><p></p><p>With that said.</p><p></p><p>Holding his blade, Xuanhuang headed towards the forest.</p><p></p><p>In front of a small pond.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>This was the valley behind Qingyun Mountain, about five li away from the mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>In the center was a small lake about twenty-some meters long and seven or eight meters wide.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang, who had sensed the moist aura from afar, planned to hunt beasts in this place.</p><p></p><p>But the moment he saw the lake surface...</p><p></p><p>"Could this desolate mountain be a feng shui treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>"How is there another secret realm entrance?"</p><p></p><p>A dense, eerie aura was emanating from the lake surface.</p><p></p><p>An invisible layer of black mist was shrouding the lake surface, like rising mist.</p><p></p><p>Having recently guarded the blood pool and fought the mysterious dream brush, Xuanhuang was already familiar with such eerie auras.</p><p></p><p>"It's from the bottom of the lake."</p><p></p><p>Judging from the aura emanating from the lake surface, it was coming from the bottom of the lake.</p><p></p><p>The deeper the perception went underwater, the more intense the eerie power became.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang quickly approached the lake surface.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>The moment he approached the lake surface, Xuanhuang sensed the danger.</p><p></p><p>But he did not stop, as if he had not noticed, and continued to approach.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>"Splash—"</p><p></p><p>A huge black fish about three meters long leaped out of the water, revealing its sharp teeth, and lunged towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"I was waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Blade instantly met it, with powerful and heavy force piercing through the black fish's mouth towards its brain.</p><p></p><p>"Gurgle—"</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Just as the long blade had deeply entered the fish's mouth and was about to pierce the black fish's brain,</p><p></p><p>A thick black water like ink suddenly sprayed out from the black fish's mouth towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not dare to be careless, and quickly retracted the Void Blade back into his consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>His body swiftly dove downwards, evading the black water from the black fish's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Just as the black fish was about to fall back into the water surface,</p><p></p><p>With reflexes far exceeding normal human speed, Xuanhuang grabbed the black fish's fin, and with fierce force, inserted it into the thick scales and flesh underneath.</p><p></p><p>He had never had a physical confrontation before, not because his physique was not strong, but because he had never had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Without the Void Blade, his monstrous physique alone was already at the level of a monster.</p><p></p><p>"Come up then!"</p><p></p><p>With half of its body already fallen into the water surface, the black fish was violently thrown up by Xuanhuang's single-handed, immense strength.</p><p></p><p>The huge black fish was tossed onto the shore, its body twisting.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Blade reappeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This time, he fully unleashed the blade's suppression, intent, and annihilation, slashing towards the black fish.</p><p></p><p>"Squelch!"</p><p></p><p>Like cutting into a watermelon, the black fish was sliced in half from head to tail, its two halves convulsing.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely a completely ferocious beast-like black fish.</p><p></p><p>And not the kind that was still immature, spawned from the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>It already had the ability to attack with "black water", which had strong corrosive properties and an pungent odor. The grass it sprayed on instantly withered and turned black.</p><p></p><p>If one was hit by it, it would be extremely painful.</p><p></p><p>The black fish had the strength close to a first-realm transcendent being, and it not only ambushed, but also used sneak attacks, seemingly even possessing intelligence.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Xuanhuang's curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous beasts he encountered, which were just crazed and frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"There must be a great secret hidden here."</p><p></p><p>The secret should be hidden at the bottom of the lake.</p><p></p><p>This place was connected to another world, and the black fish must have had some extraordinary encounter.</p><p></p><p>It was not even noon yet...</p><p></p><p>After exploring the underwater and finding no other such ferocious black fish, Xuanhuang planned to enter and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Entering the water, he quickly sank down.</p><p></p><p>Until a suction force came, and Xuanhuang felt he could control it, so he followed the suction.</p><p></p><p>"Splash—"</p><p></p><p>At a depth of nearly twenty meters, the pressure was not small, but it had no effect on Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In sight—</p><p></p><p>Another small water surface, and not far away, he could see a village with black smoke rising.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang surfaced from the water and came ashore.</p><p></p><p>His super-sharp vision swept across the distant village.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he could see the people of the entire village gathering.</p><p></p><p>And they were wearing ancient clothing, this should be a rare world with human civilization.</p><p></p><p>Existing in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Furthermore!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the village, a dense aura of evil was spreading.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the entire world was emanating a mysterious aura, luring people's minds to madness and inciting physical frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>After carefully sensing the surroundings, he found nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>He had to put it aside for now.</p><p></p><p>He then turned his attention to the consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>"As expected."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang discovered that he could freely enter the Great Grind Space here.</p><p></p><p>"The guess has come true."</p><p></p><p>"The Great Grind Space is the Seventh A-level Disaster Land."</p><p></p><p>The previous six A-level Disaster Lands, like the Great Grind Space, were existences that could be connected to all the worlds discovered by humanity.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grind Space, which Xuanhuang called the "Ruin Ruins", was no exception.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll be more at ease."</p><p></p><p>With a safe retreat, Xuanhuang's confidence grew.</p><p></p><p>His blood qi surged, quickly drying the water on his body.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang headed towards the village in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Outside the village...</p><p></p><p>A surprised old man saw Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The old man held a cane, wearing neither luxurious nor too shabby clothes, but very upright.</p><p></p><p>His hair had already turned white, with a meticulous and prominent hairstyle, and the wrinkles on his face were etched with the marks of time.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, as if trying to figure out where this young man with short hair and strange attire came from.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, where are you from?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang: "..."</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in speaking style left Xuanhuang a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Old sir, I'm a passing warrior, may I ask what this noble place is called?"</p><p></p><p>"Warrior?" The old man was puzzled: "Warriors are not often seen these days."</p><p></p><p>The old man's strange words were full of distrust towards Xuanhuang, but he didn't say it outright.</p><p></p><p>Since it's like this...</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, old sir, why are warriors not often seen?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know?"</p><p></p><p>The old man was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen such a rogue person.</p><p></p><p>I clearly showed my distrust, but you didn't care at all and continued to ask me.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, old sir, please enlighten me."</p><p></p><p>"You...! I've never..."</p><p></p><p>The old man was about to lose his temper.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Blood Moon appeared in the sky thirteen years ago, all the warrior immortals have fallen into madness, so naturally there are no more warriors."</p><p></p><p>The old man took a few deep breaths to calm his outburst.</p><p></p><p>"Such an event has occurred?" Xuanhuang feigned enlightenment, "May I ask, old sir, I see the villagers are busy, what are they doing?"</p><p></p><p>"This is..." The old man suddenly stopped, mysteriously smiling, "Haha, young man, you're in luck, you've caught the day of worshiping the Centipede King. Come, come, let's go receive the Centipede King's blessings."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the old man suddenly became enthusiastic and hospitable.</p><p></p><p>His lively face became inexplicably dull, as if he had become a different person.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang vaguely sensed a dark aura emanating from the old man's head. Especially when he mentioned worshiping the Centipede King, that aura became more and more dense.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'm truly a lucky person."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't refuse and followed the seemingly dazed old man into the village.</p><p></p><p>"...</p><p></p><p>What reason is it that when the Centipede King is mentioned, the old man suddenly changed into a different person, just like a puppet beast controlled by a blood pool?</p><p></p><p>The dark aura in his head? Centipede, centipede, is it a centipede? Could it be that there are worms controlling the old man's brain? Is it a worm or a curse?</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon appeared in the sky? Thirteen years ago? Is this place even earlier? There are also immortal cultivation and martial arts, but they have also lost control.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon, loss of control, Centipede, worms, could it be that the Blood Moon here can catalyze animal beasts?</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it's a bit similar to the Blood Pool, and these two are so close, could there be a connection?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless thoughts sprouted in Xuanhuang's mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Following the old man, they passed through the village houses.</p><p></p><p>A sense of dilapidation and gloom pervaded the village, and the villagers, except for the occasional timid children who glanced at Xuanhuang, were all like marionettes.</p><p></p><p>"Their bodies are vibrant, not pure puppets, but similarly, a dark aura shrouds their heads."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that all the people in the village have been controlled, except for those young children?"</p><p></p><p>As a tall and large man with strange attire, Xuanhuang was led into the village by the old man.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, everyone ignored him, as if he didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>This was not in line with the attitude towards strangers in a remote rural village in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Their dazed eyes.</p><p></p><p>The only action they took was to busily prepare for the worship of the Centipede King.</p><p></p><p>...

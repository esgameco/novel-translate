        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So you are Lin Fan?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Hui looked at the young man in front of him. The young man had handsome features and a solemn expression that seemed out of place for his youthful face.</p><p></p><p>After learning about the young man's experiences, Sun Hui understood the reason for his solemnity.</p><p></p><p>To have lost his parents at such a young age, while also needing to care for a sister who was only 3 or 4 years old, it was remarkable that the young man had grown up this way.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I am Lin Fan."</p><p></p><p>To Lin Fan, Sun Hui was an important figure, the Grand Administrator of the Martial Arts Alliance, one of the few who had fully comprehended the Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, very impressive. To have grasped the Visualization Diagram on your first attempt, and to have comprehended a third of it, your talent must exceed even mine." </p><p></p><p>After hearing the report the previous day, Sun Hui was delighted. He had finally found a young genius.</p><p></p><p>Without any mentor to guide him to enlightenment, Lin Fan had been able to comprehend a third of the Visualization Diagram in a single simple attempt - a feat that had taken Sun Hui himself a very long time to achieve. This young man's talent was truly worthy of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the genius that the mentor had spoken of - it remained to be seen if he could reach the level the mentor had described, of being able to fully comprehend the Diagram in a single guided enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you give me too much credit. I am not worthy of being compared to you." Lin Fan's youthful face broke into an ingratiating smile.</p><p></p><p>"There is no need for that. What you have been through is in the past now. As martial artists, we should neither be arrogant nor self-deprecating. Since the mentor imparted his teachings, our Martial Arts Hall has upheld the principles of establishing the heart through virtue, and standing firm through talent. One needs both virtue and talent, without the need to ingratiate oneself to anyone. Just focus on developing your own abilities and diligently cultivating yourself."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui did not criticize him excessively. One should not rashly judge others' hardships. Lin Fan's current demeanor was the result of the harsh experiences he had endured in his struggle for survival.</p><p></p><p>He would gradually improve.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Manager." Lin Fan's bearing became more upright.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Alliance had been newly established, originating from the Southern City Martial Arts Hall. The Alliance did not have a formal leader, as everyone recognized the mentor, Xuanhuang, as the true leader.</p><p></p><p>There were also no positions like Vice-Leader. Who could be compared to the mentor? Therefore, the positions of Grand Administrator, Deputy Administrator, Hall Masters, and Stewards were established instead.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they were to be called the "Xuanhuang Alliance", but the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions firmly objected.</p><p></p><p>"You can call him Mentor Xuanhuang, and we will also address him as Patriarch, Buddha Lord, or Venerable. You can formulate your Xuanbian, Tongxuan, Dongxuan, and so on. Anything more would displease the mentor himself.</p><p></p><p>The mentor is the Patriarch of the world, imparting the Dao to all beings. He cannot be limited to just your Martial Arts Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Alliance had no choice but to accept this, a ratio of three to one. Thus, Sun Hui had become known as the Grand Administrator, instead of the Hall Master.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui always felt this title was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first, the first selected for the Martial Arts Alliance's Talent Cultivation Plan. Your sole focus now is diligent cultivation. Our Alliance will provide you with all the necessary resources. As the first of the first batch, you need to set a standard for those who will follow. It may seem like there are no demands on you, but in reality, the expectations are immense. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The precocious Lin Fan naturally grasped the underlying meaning.</p><p></p><p>It may seem like there were no demands, and he would be provided with resources. As long as he cultivated diligently, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>But this was the greatest demand of all. As Sun Hui had said, he was the first of the first batch, and needed to set an example.</p><p></p><p>This meant he would need to strive to be the best, as the future standards for the Talent Cultivation Plan would be based on his performance.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions had all established their own talent cultivation plans, selecting the most gifted youths and providing them with the utmost support. </p><p></p><p>The sole purpose was diligent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was not just about comparing himself to others, but also to himself - how he viewed himself and how he would achieve his own goals.</p><p></p><p>If he performed poorly, it would bring shame to the Martial Arts Alliance, and he could even be recorded in history, forever tarnishing its reputation.</p><p></p><p>Future Martial Arts Alliance talents would be ashamed to be associated with him, and would say: "Look, that's Lin Fan, the first selected for the Martial Arts Alliance's Talent Cultivation Plan. He is the one who brought disgrace to our Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lin Fan felt immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>But this was just what others might say.</p><p></p><p>As for himself? He had struggled through life-threatening hardships to reach Qingyun Mountain, seeking to pursue the martial path he cherished in his heart. Wouldn't he be betraying himself and his past struggles if he did not strive his utmost?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Fan solemnly replied, "Grand Administrator, I will work hard."</p><p></p><p>Flowery words were unnecessary - what mattered was his future performance.</p><p></p><p>"You understand, but don't put too much pressure on yourself. You don't need to shoulder the entire burden yet. You have the mentor, and you have me. You young ones need time to grow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Grand Administrator." </p><p></p><p>Sun Hui waved his hand and said, "You may go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan left Sun Hui's office.</p><p></p><p>Returning to his home, which had been granted by the Martial Arts Hall, he found his sister Lin Cao waiting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her brother return, Lin Cao quickly ran into Lin Fan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're back! Do we have to move out of this beautiful home?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Cao had been told that this lovely home was given to them by the Martial Arts Hall, and that Lin Fan would need to work hard to be able to stay there long-term.</p><p></p><p>Having always followed Lin Fan in their wanderings, she had never lived in such a nice home before, and was afraid of being driven out.</p><p></p><p>"Little Cao, we won't be driven out. The people of the Martial Arts Hall value me, and as long as I work hard, we can stay in this beautiful home."</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan hugged his sister and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yay, that's wonderful!" Little Cao tightly embraced Lin Fan. "I know my big brother is a great hero, the Hall's elders will surely like him, because I love my brother so much!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Lin Fan smiled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was filled with boundless motivation.</p><p></p><p>It was not for the sake of others' opinions, but for this beautiful home, and for his sister.</p><p></p><p>His parents had named him Lin Fan, hoping he would live a happy, ordinary life. </p><p></p><p>His sister was not originally called Little Cao, but due to a strange revival, their parents had hoped she would grow strong like resilient wild grass, and so had renamed her.</p><p></p><p>With their parents gone, Lin Fan's dream of a simple, happy life had vanished. He could only struggle to survive, determined to live an extraordinary life, even if it could not be ordinary, carrying on with his sister as resilient as wild grass.</p><p></p><p>The determined young man had steeled his resolve.</p><p></p><p>Little Cao suddenly broke free from her brother's embrace, excitedly running to her room. "I'm going to tell Mom and Dad that my brother has given me a beautiful home!"</p><p></p><p>She took an old, worn box from her cabinet, opening it to reveal two crystal teardrops inside.</p><p></p><p>These were their parents' legacy - the only things left behind when their parents mysteriously disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Lin Fan had told his sister that their parents had not died, but had gone to a faraway place, and these crystal teardrops were a gift left for them.</p><p></p><p>Carrying these crystal teardrops, they would one day find their parents.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Fan felt a pang of heartache. As his sister grew up, she would eventually understand that he had lied to her. </p><p></p><p>But he did not want to shatter the illusion - the later she learned the truth, the better. At least for one more day, she could hold onto that hope.</p><p></p><p>Having hope was always better than being disheartened.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, quickly tell Mom and Dad that we have a home now, a beautiful one! Little Cao loves it so much!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little Grass carefully handed the crystal tear drops to her brother Lin Fan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan let out a bitter smile. This was meant to comfort his sister, but it had been reversed on him instead.</p><p></p><p>However, he could only do as instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, I..." </p><p>"Huh, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>"I won't be defeated, I still have my sister to take care of."</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, when he took the crystal tear drops, his heart was stirred, with a sense of indescribable bitterness, as if his heart was lamenting, expressing endless distress.</p><p></p><p>Life is bitter, existence is bitter, desire is bitter, spirit is bitter, in short, all kinds of distress, oppressive to the point of despair.</p><p></p><p>But as long as he endured these sufferings, after breaking through them, his spirit would suddenly become clear.</p><p></p><p>It was as if his heart had just undergone tempering, and after the tempering, his will became stronger, and the visualization in his spirit became more substantial.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Fan broke through these various sufferings, the visualization in his spirit had gained a third of its completion, and it had become even more substantial.</p><p></p><p>Sunhui had said that it was a sign of genius that Lin Fan had completed a third of the visualization on his first try.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Fan knew that although he had completed a third, it was because of the greatest progress made on his first try.</p><p></p><p>In the future he would be faster than others, but he wouldn't directly complete a third like this first time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his third was not yet solidified, and he needed to refine it further before he could continue to progress.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it had already solidified.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Lin Fan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The crystal tear drops had not reacted in any way when he had touched and picked them up before, but this time, because he had a visualization in his spirit, an inexplicable reaction had occurred.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what's wrong with you?" Little Grass was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, brother is talking to mom and dad, they are very happy that Little Grass has a beautiful home, and they tell Little Grass to listen to her brother." Lin Fan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Little Grass will be the most obedient." Little Grass jumped up happily.</p><p></p><p>After comforting Little Grass for a while, Lin Fan went to his own room.</p><p></p><p>He carefully examined the two crystal tear drops.</p><p></p><p>His memories began to rewind, it was five years ago, the mysterious revival had been going on for nearly two years, and Lin Fan's family, although going through many twists and turns, had managed to settle down.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that at some point, the parents who had always appeared strong in front of the children began to sigh and lament all day long.</p><p></p><p>They even couldn't control themselves and would tell Lin Fan about their distress.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the young Lin Fan didn't know what had changed his parents.</p><p></p><p>He only remembered that a thin ascetic monk had once come to their home to beg, and the kind-hearted parents, despite their own hardships, had made offerings to the ascetic monk.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be after that incident that the parents' previous strength and smiles disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Their bodies gradually wasted away, their smiles disappeared, the strength they had shown for their children was gone, and instead they had a look of distress.</p><p></p><p>The ignorant him had once heard his mother say: "The sea has already risen above her knees," and his father had said the same, that it had risen above his knees.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, he had secretly seen his mother lying in his father's arms, crying and saying that the sea had risen to her chest, and she was in so much pain, she couldn't bear it.</p><p></p><p>But under his father's comfort, and with two children to support, his mother had to persevere.</p><p></p><p>In any case, after that, his parents disappeared without a trace in an ordinary morning.</p><p></p><p>That morning, when he woke up, he found no trace of his parents, and after calling out a few times, there was no response.</p><p></p><p>He clearly remembered pushing open the door to his parents' room, and finding the bed in a mess, as if there had been a violent struggle.</p><p></p><p>On the bedside table, there was a sentence written in his father's blood:</p><p></p><p>"Lin Fan, you must be strong and live, take care of Little Grass..."</p><p></p><p>The handwriting was very scrawled and intermittent, as if it had been written in the midst of a violent struggle.</p><p></p><p>On the messy bed, there were only two crystal tear drops left, the only remnants after his parents' disappearance.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, his home was gone, and not long after, strange events had occurred around the home, and he and his sister Little Grass had been evacuated by government officials, and had since been living in the settlement area prepared by the government and the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Until today, Lin Fan did not want to recall that past.</p><p></p><p>His parents' disappearance had been defined as a mysterious incident, and they had never been found since.</p><p></p><p>Until today, when this sudden experience had opened the floodgates of his memories.</p><p></p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the only remnant left by my parents after their disappearance, but why can it promote the development of my visualization?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The moment he touched it, a heavy burden of suffering pressed down on his heart, like a thick mountain trying to destroy his psychological defenses.</p><p></p><p>There had been no such signs before, it was a change that occurred after he had gained a spirit visualization.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a change that occurs with the development of the spirit visualization?"</p><p></p><p>"But why is there such a change, is it like what they call the trial of the White Bone Pagoda, except that the White Bone Pagoda is aimed at the physical destruction to temper the will, while the crystal tear drops are testing the will through the spirit?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did my parents go, and why did they leave behind two crystal tear drops after disappearing?"</p><p></p><p>The various puzzles made Lin Fan frown.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was certain, the crystal tear drops were a treasure.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist priests could refine talismans to temper the physical body, and his own crystal tear drops could temper the spirit.</p><p></p><p>This meant that he had two treasures to temper his will.</p><p></p><p>As long as he applied for the White Bone Pagoda, the Martial Arts Alliance would give him points, and with his own crystal tear drops, he could make double the progress.</p><p></p><p>One physical tempering, one spiritual tempering, in this way, he would progress much faster.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that after fully comprehending the visualization, there are two ways to progress, refining and merging. Merging doesn't require too strong a will, just by engraving talismans you can rely on the Taoist priests' tools to enhance yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the elders of the Martial Arts Alliance and other forces are progressing in this way, first enhancing their strength, and then supplementing the will tempering through refining."</p><p></p><p>"Now that I have the crystal tear drops, I can progress through both refining and merging, I heard the Taoist priests say that to reach the higher realms, will is indispensable, in the early stage you can rely on the Taoist priests' tools, but at a certain point, you need your own strong will to continue."</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan recalled the words the martial arts hall coaches had conveyed to him, and he made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"I want to become a true powerful Taoist priest like them, I need to refine."</p><p></p><p>"And merging also requires a strong will, the same need for better control, with the crystal tear drops, my will will be stronger, and my control will also be stronger."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't go back to the past, the memories would only make him suffer.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, he would turn his parents' fate into motivation, and turn his parents' only remnant into fuel, to make himself stronger.</p><p></p><p>Just like the message his father had written in blood, he would live strongly, and take care of Little Grass.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, mom and dad, I will become the kind of person you hoped for, living freely and unrestrained."</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan decided that for now, he would keep the crystal tear drops a secret, and not reveal them until he had a certain level of strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

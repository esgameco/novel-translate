        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt a bit gloomy and a bit looked down upon.</p><p></p><p>To come to his own lair to discuss the matter of assassinating himself, what was he thinking?</p><p></p><p>And there was the figure of an old friend, the Puppet Palace Master Gou Jian.</p><p></p><p>The Three Rat Brothers did not need any research, their information was already in Qi Long's memory.</p><p></p><p>They were an existence that even the assassin Qi Long felt unworthy of associating with.</p><p></p><p>Because Qi Long still had some humanity, he only took on assassination missions and would not kill innocent civilians.</p><p></p><p>The Three Rat Brothers were different, these three had completely lost their conscience. In order to advance their bizarre rat abilities, they allowed the bizarre slaughter of several remote mountain villages.</p><p></p><p>They were an existence that had completely lost their humanity.</p><p></p><p>What makes humans human is that they have a moral bottom line, a sense of right and wrong, the ability to self-discipline, and a degree of freedom.</p><p></p><p>So-called absolute freedom and indulgence are actually the slaves of desire.</p><p></p><p>The self-discipline to control desire is true freedom. Boundless self and freedom, which is called the true self, is actually already a slave to desire.</p><p></p><p>The Three Rat Brothers are like this, they stop at nothing to achieve their goals, and have actually become bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Even if they lose complete control and are devoured by the bizarre, the bizarre still has its own bizarre rules, but the three brothers do not, and in order to become stronger, they slaughter villages, becoming even more bizarre than the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"In two days? It's better to eliminate this cancer of the Three Rat Brothers."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang made a decision in secret.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the square, after the rotation of several Taoist priests, finally, when the four had exhausted their spiritual energy, the bizarre intelligence of the chains in the Heavenly-Earth Crucible was completely eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"Come out!" The Ninth Patriarch shouted excitedly, his weary face unable to hide his excitement.</p><p></p><p>A black chain rose into the air, emitting a dark glow. It was still in the same shape as before, because they could not change its shape.</p><p></p><p>Like how Xuanhuang turned his leg bones into a White Bone Pagoda Tower, it was an extremely difficult operation to change its appearance. First, one must be able to quickly condense the will into form and endow the forged treasure with a shape, which was very difficult.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Patriarch and the others were able to erase the bizarre confusion of the mind with the help of the Heavenly-Earth Crucible, which was already quite an achievement.</p><p></p><p>"Retrieve!" Even the steady Ninth Patriarch could not help but get excited.</p><p></p><p>A treasure, this was a treasure. He might be the first person after the revival of the bizarre, except for Xuan Shi, to possess a treasure, and it was even forged from the bizarre, a groundbreaking feat.</p><p></p><p>The black chain in his hand, the Ninth Patriarch stared at it with the gaze of a lover.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly-Earth Crucible, having completed its task, flew away, needing to refine the true meaning of the chain.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully see off the Crucible."</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Patriarch finally felt that he had been impolite, and hurriedly bowed towards the direction the Crucible flew.</p><p></p><p>The newly forged treasure was a "newborn" without the slightest innate intelligence, and the one who consecrated it needed to constantly connect with it in mind, slowly endowing it with intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, fellow Daoist, congratulations to the Dao sect."</p><p>"Congratulations to the Ninth Patriarch, congratulations to the Dao sect."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yan Lai and Monk Ming Hui stepped forward to congratulate them.</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha..." The Ninth Patriarch wanted to hold back his laughter, but he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the congratulations of the two, he burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai and Monk Ming Hui smiled and laughed along, although their hearts were uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist has succeeded in forging the treasure, which is of great significance. Not only have we found a direction to explore, but it has also completely changed the future pattern, which can be said to be a groundbreaking significance. Congratulations, congratulations."</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai spoke eloquently with flowery words of congratulation.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Mr. Yan Lai is mistaken."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Ninth Patriarch's disciple, the Ninth Patriarch, spoke up: "This is not the merit of my elder brother, nor the merit of our Dao sect, but the merit of Xuan Shi. It is the grace of Xuan Shi that has led our Dao sect to this day's situation... So Mr. Yan Lai's praise is excessive. The groundbreaking is Xuan Shi's, the change in pattern is also Xuan Shi's, we are just the followers of Xuan Shi."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, my disciple is right, it is Xuan Shi's merit, what ability do I, Ninth Patriarch, have? Mr. Yan Lai, you were just joking."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly realizing, the Ninth Patriarch was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>There were so many people here, even about 80% of the people from Mount Qingyun were watching the Dao sect's forging of the treasure.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Yan Lai had dug a pit for him, and if he had acknowledged Yan Lai's words, where would it have placed Xuan Shi? Where would it have placed the Dao sect? Let those who didn't understand think that the groundbreaking and the change in pattern were the Dao sect's? Even if Xuan Shi didn't mind, he minded, and the others minded.</p><p></p><p>What a cunning old scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha, yes, it's all thanks to Xuan Shi's grace, the old man misspoke, don't mind, don't mind."</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai quickly laughed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Ninth Patriarch had been a bit too excited, thinking that he would dig a small pit for him to jump into, but he didn't expect his disciple to be so clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>The great monk Ming Hui saw the opportunity and wanted to chat with the Dao sect, while also scolding these scholars a bit.</p><p></p><p>They were too cunning, previously the rumor was that the Buddhist sect did not create trouble, and now they were digging pits for the Dao sect again.</p><p></p><p>The common topic with the Dao sect had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Patriarch, with the grace of Xuan Shi, the Dao sect has succeeded in forging the treasure today, which is joyous."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the great master is right." Ninth Patriarch, looking at Ming Hui's shiny bald head, found it quite nice-looking for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Ming Hui said, "I heard that the Confucian sect is going to forge talismans, why don't we go and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Although Ninth Patriarch was greatly depleted and slightly injured, as long as he took a few Spiritual Clarity Pills, he could still go and watch the Confucian sect forge talismans.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had just been dug a pit by Yan Lai, and if he didn't take revenge, his mood would not be at ease. Although he was called Ninth Patriarch, at the moment, he was not at all clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go." Ninth Patriarch said.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Yan Lai.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you are welcome." Yan Lai smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a temporary alliance between the two, but it was impossible. It was a matter of interests, how could they be so easily united?</p><p></p><p>It was just a temporary alliance, and it would disperse tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It really succeeded, it makes people so envious, when will I be able to have my own treasure?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd surrounding the square sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's easy, first you need to comprehend the Perfect Visualization Diagram, then your strength must be at least four times that of the Ninth Patriarch, and then you need a sealed bizarre, and the resources must be abundant, it's very easy."</p><p></p><p>The person was stunned and replied, "This is called easy? You're dreaming!"</p><p></p><p>"My friend, you are the one dreaming."</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here, you fish without dreams."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Look, the Confucian sect is also going to forge talismans, shall we go and take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, I'm very interested in talismans."</p><p></p><p>Many people followed, after all, it was the first time forging talismans, no matter what, it was still a rare sight.</p><p></p><p>A group, led by Confucian, Dao, and Buddhist, followed Sun Tong towards Xuanhuang's villa.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Daoist Master, the Dao sect's artifact forging has succeeded, it's wonderful and joyous." Sun Tong said to Jiu Tong.</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong hurriedly waved his hand to express his humility.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master, may I take a look? See how it differs from mine." Sun Tong asked casually.</p><p></p><p>"Mm. Okay... What?" Jiu Tong's words changed three times, perhaps because of his Sichuan-Chongqing background. "Sun Companion, you also have one?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sun, where did your spiritual artifact come from?" Sun Hui also hurriedly asked after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong casually said, "It's nothing special, the Mysterious Master forged it for me. He said it can be used for defense, can attack the divine soul, can detect, and can even teleport."</p><p></p><p>"Here, take a look." </p><p></p><p>Sun Tong took out her own "Raven of Death".</p><p></p><p>In fact, Jiu Tong's chain was fake, and Sun Tong revealed that she also had one, but it was a gift from the Mysterious Master, which was the real one.</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>This is something else, they had painstakingly collected materials and meticulously forged, yet someone else was directly given one by the Mysterious Master. </p><p></p><p>And hearing about those functions, being able to teleport, that's just too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Raven of Death?"</p><p></p><p>Several people were familiar with it, as they had followed Xuan Huang to deal with some strange occurrences a few days ago, and there was a Raven of Death.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's it. The Mysterious Master said it doesn't have much use, just a little bit of usefulness, and seeing my pitiful cultivation, he gave it to me for self-defense."</p><p></p><p>The Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist factions were perplexed, but they forced a smile to congratulate her.</p><p></p><p>Only Sun Hui couldn't help but grin, as his wish had come true. Hadn't he earlier sent his niece to follow the Mysterious Master, hoping for this day?</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong didn't want to show off, but she couldn't help it. She was only in her twenties, and this was already very good.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that her goal had been achieved, Sun Tong completely forgot about just wanting to take a look at Jiu Tong's artifact, it was all a lie.</p><p></p><p>The few of them quickly regained their composure, after all, they were experienced, and could see the girl's intentional show-off, so they didn't expose it.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Devotee Sun, it seems that the Devotee is intelligent, cute, and considerate, so the Mysterious Master likes you very much and has given you a spiritual artifact for protection. The Mysterious Master values you highly."</p><p></p><p>Ming Hui spoke up, and Sun Tong beamed with joy.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong then said, "Oh yes, you all don't need to give me anything in the future, and I don't want your family's contribution points either."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why?" Sun Hui was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong said, "The Mysterious Master said that accepting others' generosity makes one soft-mouthed, and he doesn't allow me to use your contribution points. In the future, I'll use his contribution points instead. So you don't need to give me yours, it's not easy for you to accumulate them."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui heard this and heaved a sigh of relief, so that's how it was.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no problem." The other three families were a bit reluctant, but they said, "Since the Mysterious Master has said so, we can only obey."</p><p></p><p>"Also, Companion Sun, rest assured, we absolutely will not use the contribution points to make you feel guilty, we won't, and we dare not, I hope you understand."</p><p></p><p>"I know, okay, I'll go report to the Mysterious Master now."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong naturally understood, and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>"You can stay outside, no need to come in. Aren't you all not cultivating? You need to have a certain foundation before gaining insights, without any foundation, what insights can you gain? Seeing too much insight will only make you lose your Dao heart."</p><p></p><p>A calm yet authoritative voice came from all directions.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew it was the Mysterious Master upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang was speaking to the crowd who were just there to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>Is this good? No, this is not good!</p><p></p><p>Disturbing his tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, most of the so-called "gaining insights" was just out of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Mysterious Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Is the Mysterious Master criticizing us?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, how honored to be criticized by the Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>Some people still hadn't caught on.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, the Mysterious Master is saying we're wasting time."</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist factions heard this and quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A thick tree root emerged from the ground in the distance, and then quickly twisted and formed a platform the size of a table.</p><p></p><p>"Just place it there to exchange, no need to come here, and no need for anyone to operate it, just put in as much as you want to exchange."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang's voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Yan Lai, as the exchanger this time, responded.</p><p></p><p>Then he came to the exchange platform formed by the tree roots. He waved his hand, and a middle-aged man carrying a box walked towards him.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai opened the box and took out what Xuan Huang was familiar with - divine blood.</p><p></p><p>This was a good thing, as Xuan Huang had previously said that the best things to exchange were fierce beasts, strange phenomena, and special extraordinary objects.</p><p></p><p>Medicinal pills lacked true essence, and were just simple energy for the Heavenly Tree, with almost no effect, unable to make the Heavenly Tree grow.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Confucian faction remembered it very clearly, and it was the precious divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai carefully opened the box, took out the bottle, and without pouring it out, he directly placed the bottle on the platform.</p><p></p><p>The center of the tree root platform quickly sank, and the bottle was instantly swallowed.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared intently.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a tree trunk rapidly grew on the edge of the platform, and then quickly grew full of leaves, looking to be about a hundred leaves, with the top ten leaves particularly prominent, emitting a white glow.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Tree was very honest, giving half of what was promised.</p><p></p><p>Due to the divine blood being so special and precious, it also grew ten leaves of the first level of the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Then, a hundred and ten leaves quickly fell, covering the platform.</p><p></p><p>"This? Are they all?" </p><p></p><p>"So many!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai and the middle-aged man holding the box exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>This was their first time, and they originally thought even ten leaves would be a lot, but unexpectedly there was a surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you see these ten leaves are different, they have more Dao essence."</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai nodded: "I know, I think these are the materials for the first-level extraordinary talisman mentioned in the Mysterious Master's 'Talisman Dao Scripture'."</p><p></p><p>"The hundred and twenty talismans in the middle?" The middle-aged man asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it should be right, the divine blood is truly precious, not only does it have a great effect on Spirit Masters, but the Heavenly Tree also loves it very much."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man smiled: "It seems we chose well."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly collect them, the Mysterious Master doesn't like bustling crowds or disturbing his tranquility, let's go to the plaza to refine them."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man nodded in understanding, without saying a word, and he and Yan Lai quickly collected the leaves.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the collection, the two of them bowed towards Xuan Huang's residence and said, "Thank you, Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>Then they also thanked the Heavenly Tree.</p><p></p><p>Carrying their harvest, they walked towards the plaza. Just now they had been criticized by Xuan Huang, so the area was very quiet, with no one making loud noises.</p><p></p><p>They all discreetly left the area in front of Xuan Huang's residence and went to the plaza.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A new month, seeking monthly votes, seeking subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

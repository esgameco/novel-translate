        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mighty Xuanhuang let out a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>The shimmering celestial forge trembled, and a celestial gate inscription was etched upon it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it was as if a vast, boundless expanse of the heavens and earth had been connected.</p><p></p><p>Threads of the energy of the heavens and earth surged, but they were not fully connected, and only a boundless sea of celestial power could be seen, unable to be harnessed.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>After seven days of etching, Xuanhuang finally carved the complete celestial gate inscription on the celestial forge.</p><p></p><p>This was the first step of the first-tier cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would need to condense the twelve celestial pillars that connect to the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Each direction has three pillars, but three is not just three, it represents the infinite.</p><p></p><p>It takes the meaning of "one begets two, two begets three, three begets all things."</p><p></p><p>The forge needs four celestial gates, one for each of the four cardinal directions, each representing one extreme of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, one could first etch the four celestial gates, and then condense the celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>However, that would be a thankless task.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, one does not need such vast celestial power, as an uncontrolled surge of powerful celestial energy could shatter the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It is better to take it one step at a time, slowly increasing one's strength, and then opening new celestial gates.</p><p></p><p>The "Tetrapartite Twelve Celestial Pillar Forge Technique" is not only a method to temper one's will, but also a martial dao technique.</p><p></p><p>After connecting to the heavens and earth, the cultivator can borrow the power of the heavens and earth to fight enemies and enhance their body.</p><p></p><p>This is far stronger than simply accumulating one's own vital energy, and the means to defeat opponents will also greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>Connecting to the four extremes of the heavens and earth almost represents limitless explosive power.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten or so days, Xuanhuang's physical cultivation had hardly improved.</p><p></p><p>Without first advancing his will, Xuanhuang had no intention of enhancing his body.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could reach the limit of the first tier, a ninety-zhang sea of vital energy, Xuanhuang would not do so.</p><p></p><p>The accumulation of vital energy has never been the primary goal; the will is.</p><p></p><p>"Next is to condense the celestial pillars."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang sensed that condensing the celestial pillars would not be easily accomplished.</p><p></p><p>It would take at least a week, almost the same time as etching the celestial gates.</p><p></p><p>The material for condensing the celestial pillars is golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Through the power of the will, the vital energy is condensed into celestial pillars, and each pillar requires the power of a thirty-zhang golden sea of vital energy.</p><p></p><p>This is the reason it will take at least a week.</p><p></p><p>Because replenishment of vital energy is needed, it will take three replenishments to fully etch one complete celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Once the celestial pillars are formed, it is equivalent to having a forty-zhang sea of vital energy. Each celestial pillar is not only a pillar connecting the energy of the heavens and earth, but also the foundation of the cultivator, able to unleash even stronger power, like a stacking of techniques.</p><p></p><p>The complete twelve celestial pillars represent a first-tier peak cultivation of three hundred and sixty zhang of accumulated vital energy.</p><p></p><p>And when the tetrapartite twelve pillars are perfected, the celestial gates can be opened at any time to connect to the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>It is equivalent to double the ability + unlimited endurance.</p><p></p><p>It is an extremely formidable power.</p><p></p><p>The "Transcending Self" technique has always been perfect and powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I will first condense one-third of a pillar."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to first condense one-third of a celestial pillar, and then go replenish his vital energy.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>Under the containment of his will, ten zhang of golden vital energy began to change shape.</p><p></p><p>From a gaseous state, it gradually condensed into a three-zhang tall cylinder.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will swept away the mist of the vital energy sea.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>A three-zhang tall golden celestial pillar stood tall in the endless mist of the vital energy sea.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Xuanhuang felt the power of the heavens and earth stirring once again.</p><p></p><p>But it stopped abruptly.</p><p></p><p>This was because the celestial pillar had not yet been fully condensed, and could not serve as a bridge of connection.</p><p></p><p>It still needed two more condensations to become a nine-zhang tall pillar, as nine represents the extremes of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>After completing these tasks, Xuanhuang let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A sense of emptiness descended.</p><p></p><p>The will was exhausted from the consolidation of the heavenly pillar, and the qi and blood were also in a state of double fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not dare to be careless and immediately disappeared from here, appearing in the small world.</p><p></p><p>The small world is the safest place, where he can slowly recover his blood.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the small world, Xuanhuang hastily swallowed a hundred large Dandan pills. The heavenly and earthly furnace quickly refined them, and then they were absorbed by his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until an hour had passed that Xuanhuang had recovered less than a fifth of his qi and blood power. His will had recovered about a third.</p><p></p><p>"Entering the first stage of the superhuman realm and eating the large Dandan pills, this thing's effect is getting smaller and smaller."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang couldn't help but sigh, the large Dandan pills were not very effective in replenishing his blood.</p><p></p><p>A hundred pills could only restore him less than a fifth.</p><p></p><p>If he were to eat them openly, he didn't know how many thousands of pills it would take to fully recover.</p><p></p><p>He had previously lamented that there were many martial arts pills and medicines in this world, but it was a pity that he couldn't use them.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems he was reckless.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a case of not being able to use them, but that they are completely insufficient."</p><p></p><p>In the future, if more martial artists enter the first stage, the demand for pills and medicines will be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang plans to first go to the martial arts hall to borrow some of the inventory, not go out hunting for now, and safely wait for seven days to refine a complete heavenly pillar.</p><p></p><p>By then, the transformation of Qingyun Mountain will be completed, whether it's the development of the Blood Moon World or the strange Blood Pool, they will all be sources of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"However, it is necessary to develop new pills and medicines suitable for first-stage martial artists."</p><p></p><p>As the founding patriarch, this is his shortcoming.</p><p></p><p>You need to open up a cycle for your future disciples.</p><p></p><p>Cai Li Fa Di, this thing is useful everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Cai includes money, pills, magical treasures, and so on. No wonder it comes first.</p><p></p><p>Li, it's not just a simple companion, but teachers, fellow cultivators, companions, and a system that supports the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fa, simply put, the Dao, cultivation methods, techniques, and skills.</p><p></p><p>This is the least important thing for Xuanhuang, as he can create them himself without relying on others.</p><p></p><p>Di, refers to auspicious locations, places with rich spiritual energy, including the Fotiandong cave, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Cai Li Fa Di, for now, is not needed.</p><p></p><p>As for Cai, although other martial artists can comprehend the complete visualization and refine and absorb it through the furnace method, it is ultimately just a means.</p><p></p><p>Now there are too many fierce and wild beasts, just kill them.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if there are more martial artists, it may not be easy to find them.</p><p></p><p>As the founding patriarch, he needs to find a way to solve this for his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, spiritual herbs in the superhuman realm become uncontrollable and turn into strange plants, the conditions do not allow it."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head at this thought.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to combine with the actual situation, not blindly."</p><p></p><p>"The actual situation is that this place does not produce spiritual herbs, but strange things, so I need to start from the strange things."</p><p></p><p>"Practice leads to true knowledge, grasp the direction, and find the right path..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, in short, it is to rely on the local characteristics, turn the strange things into treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, I previously thought about the strange dream brush and the strange love letter paper, using them to create talismans and puppets, isn't this the right direction? At least the talisman direction has been established."</p><p></p><p>"My Jianmu is also a representation of spiritual roots, so it's not impossible to cultivate uncontrollable spiritual herbs through it."</p><p></p><p>As his thoughts unfolded, many ideas came to him.</p><p></p><p>"Completely occupy the Blood Pool secret realm, develop and strengthen it, invest more wild beasts or artificially raised animals, and use the strange Blood Pool to catalyze fierce beasts... slaughter... process... refine the pure qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>A complete chain.</p><p></p><p>"The superhuman monsters in the Blood Moon World, research the rules of the Blood Moon, and cultivate monsters by myself, slaughter, process..."</p><p></p><p>"That's it, it should be enough for now."</p><p></p><p>"When I have time, I will look for spiritual herbs, or strange herbs, strange plants, and cultivate them through the Jianmu."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The patriarch who was deep in thought had planned everything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

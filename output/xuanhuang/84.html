        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dimly lit, tranquil and somber hall.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, this place is similar to a bar, just without the hustle and raucous music.</p><p></p><p>There are not too many people here, around two or three dozen.</p><p></p><p>Some are sitting alone at a table, some in groups of three or five, bustling about.</p><p></p><p>In the dark corner near the southwest, four people are seated.</p><p></p><p>They are Wei Zixuan, the deputy head of the Xie Department in South City Town, the tall and thin Lü Yuan, the deputy head Director Dong Xingbao, and a woman named Sun Xueli.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the One-Eyed coming?"</p><p></p><p>The tall and thin Lü Yuan shook his head and said, "He said he won't participate anymore. He plans to go to Qingyun Mountain in a few days to exchange points and sincerely apologize to Xuanhuang, and also ask Xuanhuang to alleviate the erosion."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that traitor. Xuanhuang is a petty person who holds grudges, and this fool actually wants to seek Xuanhuang's forgiveness. He's going to end up badly in Xuanhuang's hands."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan cursed hatefully.</p><p></p><p>He was angry at the One-Eyed's betrayal. After a period of time, he and these four are the only ones who have firmly divided the battle lines with Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Some were intimidated by Xuanhuang's powerful strength and chose to apologize and make amends, some are still observing. Some see that their companions have truly been relieved of the erosion by Xuanhuang, and have started preparing to contribute points.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were just following the commotion initially, and didn't even have any contact with Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>No, they did have contact, it was that day when they went to cause trouble, and then were controlled by Xuanhuang to stand up, with many bones broken, leaving a deep impression.</p><p></p><p>Originally, spiritual practitioners, especially those who have been controlling time for a long time, whose spiritual souls have been eroded, are particularly extreme and stubborn.</p><p></p><p>They instinctively do not trust that Xuanhuang will forgive them, even if they were just small participants in the ruckus, as bystanders.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, South City still has a deputy head, Gao Xiaolan.</p><p></p><p>This person actively resolves conflicts, actively persuades those who have not committed major offenses.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan curses on two fronts, one is unforgiving, the other is seducing and comforting people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Seven or eight people who previously followed Wei Zixuan and Dong Xingbao to cause trouble have been persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, at this gathering, many people did not come, and those who came are the ones Gao Xiaolan considers irredeemable.</p><p></p><p>Actually, there is someone very depressed on the scene.</p><p></p><p>That is the deputy head Dong Xingbao. His previous actions were purely due to the "essential characteristics of a spiritual practitioner" - his mind was not clear, and his thinking was easily confused.</p><p></p><p>After Jia Zhengyi's death, the remaining followers swarmed around him, and he didn't even know what his surname was.</p><p></p><p>Elderly spiritual practitioners, destined to be inauspicious.</p><p></p><p>He is just such an elderly spiritual practitioner.</p><p></p><p>He actually hoped very much that Gao Xiaolan would come and talk to him, so that he could take the initiative to apologize and obtain Xuanhuang's forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>But Gao Xiaolan didn't come?</p><p></p><p>This made him think too much, and when he thinks too much, he becomes extreme, despising him, alienating him, "I'll go my own way to the end."</p><p></p><p>Even if South City can't accommodate him, he can still join the heretical sect.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes spiritual practitioners are just so hard to understand, an extremist group.</p><p></p><p>"What can we few do? Don't forget, although Xuanhuang is cunning and villainous, his strength is still not bad," Sun Xueli said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, many have died miserably, but he Xuanhuang can be an exception?" </p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan said, "We are not fighting alone, don't forget the arrest warrants from the major organizations. I got some news..."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan smiled sinisterly, like a venomous snake hissing.</p><p></p><p>"What news?"</p><p></p><p>"The head, no, the Patriarch Gou of the Demon Believers has contacted me."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The three were startled.</p><p></p><p>They all knew that Jia Zhengyi was the Patriarch of the Demon Believers' Puppet Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Believers, this... this is not good, right?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wei Zixuan's words, Lü Yuan and Sun Xueli hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao slapped the table and said, "What time is it now and you're still concerned about this? I've realized that the Demon Believers are right, the bullshit about protecting the weak, the weak should be eliminated, we spiritual practitioners are the protagonists of the world. Why, when we have god-like strength, do we have to please ordinary people and care about their opinions, why?"</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Head is right, I've also seen the light. Before, I don't know if my brain was overheated, joining the bullshit Exorcism Department to protect ordinary people. Now thinking about it, I deeply regret it. We should have been living for ourselves from the beginning, not turning around to protect the weak, what kind of twisted logic is that?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan strongly supported Dong Xingbao.</p><p></p><p>He was very happy about Dong Xingbao's transformation.</p><p></p><p>It's not to be said, but the elderly spiritual practitioner Dong Xingbao is the strongest among them, at the peak of the first level.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he became the deputy head of South City.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his methods are a bit lacking, and he has been competing unsuccessfully with a second-level expert like Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>"I finally see clearly, these ordinary people are just opportunistic, they will praise and support you as long as you are useful to them, but the moment you become useless to them, they will abandon you like weeds. They are easily deceived and blindly act. Do I owe them anything?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao relieved his pent-up frustration.</p><p></p><p>Lamenting that it's hard to be a good person these days, the shortcomings of ordinary people are too difficult to correct.</p><p></p><p>Because their vision is not high and their thinking is not high, they are easily swayed by rumors, only see the immediate, and can be bought with small benefits.</p><p></p><p>It's arduous to be hailed as a hero by such a group.</p><p></p><p>A small mistake of yours can ruin everything you've done before.</p><p></p><p>"After all, they are the main body, representing the mainstream thinking, right? Deputy Head, from a higher position, we should use a higher perspective to examine ourselves, rather than lowering ourselves to use ordinary people's thinking to judge. If that's the case, we might as well just be ordinary people, why bother being heroes? Being a hero is tiring."</p><p></p><p>The tall and thin Lü Yuan reluctantly said a sentence.</p><p></p><p>He feels like they have deviated a bit, wasn't this a gathering? How did Director Dong and Wei Zixuan start praising the heretical sect, this doesn't look good.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't we be carefree heroes? Why do we have to be evaluated by ordinary people, why is this standard in their hands? Lü, you're wrong, we were wrong before, now we need to reclaim the definition of heroism, whoever dares to be dissatisfied, let them disappear."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan's eyes were bloodshot, filled with discontent and endless desire.</p><p></p><p>Dong, dong, dong - </p><p></p><p>At this time, the twelve o'clock bell rang.</p><p></p><p>People retreated, the strange things emerged.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It's hard to come by good things, but yesterday afternoon, Master Ma came to find Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Xuanhuang had reformed the Blood Pool Secret Realm, he came back and went into seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he did not see Xuanhuang, and was informed by Sun Tong to come tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, Master Ma was waiting outside Xuanhuang's door.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xuanhuang called Master Ma into the living room.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have something important to report."</p><p></p><p>"Speak!"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma knew Xuanhuang's time was precious, so he didn't beat around the bush and told Xuanhuang the news that his disciple Gao Jue had investigated the day before.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang already knew about it, the Demon Rat Trio Brothers, right?</p><p></p><p>According to the previous conversation he overheard from the spiritual practitioners, they should be arriving in South City today?</p><p></p><p>"This matter, I've heard about it before. However, your disciple Gao Jue has done well, please convey my gratitude to him on my behalf."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" </p><p></p><p>Master Ma was stunned, the Master already knew, and had even more timely information than him?</p><p></p><p>Does this still count as a contribution? Indeed, Master Ma's motives were not pure, but for the safety of his disciple, his original intention was good, so it was a good deed with impure motives.</p><p></p><p>"What? Can't I have some intelligence?" Xuanhuang smiled.</p><p></p><p>"No, no." Master Ma knew he had overreacted.</p><p></p><p>Willpower is equivalent to the mind, but stronger than mental perception.</p><p></p><p>With a glance, he could basically know a person's thoughts and behavior, so Xuanhuang directly saw through him.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what's the matter? I'll try my best to help with what I can do."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma bowed and said, "I knew I couldn't hide anything from the Master. It's like this..."</p><p></p><p>As Master Ma described, Xuanhuang nodded. So this is the matter.</p><p></p><p>He had speculated about it, had some clues, but didn't have a subject to experiment on, so he couldn't give a judgment.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma smiled bitterly, "My disciple has tried his best, but I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "Don't worry, I'll take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I was trying to collect intelligence in order to get a chance for the Venerable Master to guide me, but I didn't expect that you, Venerable Master, already knew about it."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. Striving for one's own future and exchanging achievements for rewards is the natural order of things. He did nothing wrong, and you should encourage this kind of behavior."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not mind the intentions of some people, as long as they upheld their moral bottom line and had self-discipline.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how difficult it is for a Spiritual Master to change their path?"</p><p></p><p>Madaozhang had already researched this, so he was naturally very clear about the difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"The old Taoist knows a little bit. Because of controlling powerful forces, maintaining a fragile balance can only be passively changed along with the bizarre changes. Strengthening oneself can only be done by fusing with the bizarre, relying on the bizarre as the main means of enhancement. If one does not strengthen the bizarre, the balance will be disrupted."</p><p></p><p>Controlling the bizarre while being weak, even if it is achieved with great difficulty, future progress requires the bizarre to be the main focus.</p><p></p><p>For example, the bizarre puzzle, fusing with more, and so on.</p><p></p><p>These are all ways to enhance one's bizarre abilities, while one's own strength can only follow along and still needs to be careful about the balance after the bizarre is enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"There are three methods. The first is to extract the bizarre, which is the simplest, and I can do it. ... The second is to seal the bizarre, but not eliminate it, and wait until one's own strength is strong enough to control the bizarre. This I can also do, it's very simple, but it requires growing stronger than the bizarre one is controlling, which will take a very long time, or even a lifetime to achieve."</p><p></p><p>"The third method is what I have previously deduced, which is a kind of forging technique. Note, it is a technique for forging tools, not for cultivating qi. ... But this method is just something I have deduced, as no one has experimented with it yet, so I don't know the specific details, and this method is also very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xuanhuang no longer spoke, waiting for Madaozhang to think it over.</p><p></p><p>When Madaozhang heard that Xuanhuang had three methods, he was delighted. There were actually so many options.</p><p></p><p>The first one he understood - the Venerable Master, with his great magical powers, could directly separate the bizarre from the person, and then seal or erase the bizarre, allowing it to completely subside, without having to worry about retaliation.</p><p></p><p>This is equivalent to depriving the Spiritual Master of their abilities, and they would have to start over as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The second method is the same - the Venerable Master would still use his great magical powers to seal the bizarre, and then the person wouldn't have to worry about their own enhancement causing an imbalance.</p><p></p><p>But as the Venerable Master said, this method still left a glimmer of hope - once the person's cultivation surpassed the bizarre they were controlling, they could directly enslave or refine the bizarre as a magical tool.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that it would take a very long time, and they might not even achieve it in this lifetime. Who can guarantee that their cultivation will progress smoothly and surpass the bizarre they are controlling?</p><p></p><p>This method has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that there is still hope, and one can strive to cultivate and wait for the cake. The disadvantage is that there may be little progress for a long time, which could directly shatter one's resolve.</p><p></p><p>As for the third method, Xuanhuang did not go into specifics, as Madaozhang did not understand it.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master, could you please explain the third method? The old Taoist is also unable to make a decision, so I plan to go back and convey it to my disciple, letting him decide for himself."</p><p></p><p>Madaozhang asked.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang actually hoped that Gaozhuo would choose the third method.</p><p></p><p>He lacked people to experiment with it, and if Gaozhuo agreed, Xuanhuang would definitely refine him for free, without needing any merit points as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang still enjoyed research.</p><p></p><p>"In simple terms, it is a kind of forging technique, also a kind of body refining technique. If successful, it will directly grant you the complete abilities of the bizarre. Your disciple can also directly achieve the first level of Mysterious Transformation."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang started with an enticing introduction.</p><p></p><p>A method to achieve a breakthrough in one step.</p><p></p><p>"It's a kind of body refining, but it's not self-cultivation. Instead, your disciple will enter my furnace, and I will refine him, allowing your disciple and the bizarre to be completely fused together. I guarantee that your disciple's divine soul will not be scattered..."</p><p></p><p>In communicating with Madaozhang, this person had profound wisdom and grasped the key points quickly.</p><p></p><p>So after Xuanhuang's simple description, Madaozhang had a general understanding of the process.</p><p></p><p>The process is extremely perilous, not self-cultivation, but being refined by the Venerable Master.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist school has the concept of "Dao Soldiers", and the idea of a "Dao Soldier Pool", this Madaozhang understood well.</p><p></p><p>There are also mythological legends, like the story of the Monkey King being refined by the Patriarch, which also has similar descriptions, so it was easy to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Master guaranteed that the disciple's divine soul would not be scattered. During the refining process, the distorted divine soul of the bizarre would be erased, reaching a state of purity and clarity, and then the disciple's divine soul would be allowed to reside in it, achieving complete control of the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>After all, the bizarre had already been completely fused with the disciple's body in the furnace, so it's hard to say who is the bizarre and who is the disciple. They have become one and the same.</p><p></p><p>But there is one thing Madaozhang did not understand - what about the will?</p><p></p><p>In this world, without the restraint of the will, nothing can be accomplished. Even if the Venerable Master erases the bizarre's divine soul and allows the disciple's divine soul to become the sole master, without the power of the will to suppress it, the disciple's divine soul will still be gradually eroded and turn into the previous bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Madaozhang thought: Does that mean the disciple can only stay on Qingyun Mountain, where the Jianmu can suppress the heavenly mechanisms and prevent erosion?</p><p></p><p>And then slowly strengthen the will, until the will can suppress the divine soul, before going down the mountain?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he asked, "Venerable Master, how to cultivate the will?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled and said, "Don't worry, it's not as you think. ... Do you think that before the disciple's will can suppress the divine soul, he cannot leave the mountain and can only stay on the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? The old Taoist's cultivation is too low, and his vision is too small. Please enlighten me, Venerable Master."</p><p></p><p>Madaozhang did not blush, as it was normal for his vision to be small compared to the Venerable Master's.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "Since I am opening the furnace to refine him, I will not leave such a shortcoming. I have a way to solve it."</p><p></p><p>"The first-level technique I am cultivating now is the 'Four Extremes Twelve Heavenly Pillar Smelting Furnace Technique', which is a first-level Mysterious Transformation cultivation of the will and body refining.</p><p></p><p>It is also the advanced technique that you all cultivate. Since it is a technique passed down in the same lineage, there are also differences between the fusion technique and the refining technique.</p><p></p><p>When your disciple is in my furnace, he will already have been reformed by me. ... This reformed him to have refined qi, spirit, and divine soul due to the fusion with the bizarre, so he has already reached at least the first level.</p><p></p><p>The second is the will. In the furnace, his entire physical body will be shattered and crushed, his qi, spirit, and divine soul will be torn apart and reorganized. While I will maintain the preservation of his divine soul, the pain he must experience himself. Through this experience, I am confident in forging his will to the fourth layer of Enlightened Wisdom, which is the same level as Jiutong Yanming and the others.</p><p></p><p>With the fourth layer of will, in terms of the fusion technique, achieving the first level of Mysterious Transformation will be very easy, and he may even be able to support the second level of Profound Enlightenment. This is the second breakthrough in one step.</p><p></p><p>The third, while refining his body, I will also reform his dantian. I will open his Gushing Spring, and based on your disciple's natural talents and insights, decide the size of his dantian. I feel that five or six zhang would be sufficient. If it's reformed too large, although he will be stronger, his future progress will also be more difficult. The dantian's limit should be ten zhang, with the complete three hundred and sixty zhang. Your disciple will start with a five zhang dantian, and can reach one hundred and eighty zhang when perfected.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he can also directly start with the ten zhang limit, and with one door three pillars or two doors six pillars, he can enter the second level. He doesn't have to go through the four doors twelve pillars to reach the complete level.</p><p></p><p>This is also a choice, let him decide for himself. If he agrees to enter my furnace for refinement, I will inform him in detail and let him choose for himself. This is the third breakthrough in one step.</p><p></p><p>After the furnace refinement is complete, I will return to you a disciple with the fourth layer of will, first-level Transcendent divine soul, and an opened Gushing Spring dantian. How's that? Not bad, right...?"</p><p></p><p>It was completely like a demonic temptation.</p><p></p><p>Madaozhang even wanted to swap places with his disciple and enter Xuanhuang's furnace for reformation.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Venerable Master said it was a body refining technique as well as a tool forging technique.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially treating the person as a tool to be forged, granting them the powerful foundation and physique of a magical tool, starting from the first level of Mysterious Transformation.</p><p></p><p>As for the "first-level technique" that Xuanhuang mentioned, the "Four Extremes Twelve Heavenly Pillar Technique", Madaozhang did not understand it. This was a technique that could only be cultivated after reaching the first level of Mysterious Transformation.</p><p></p><p>It was the advanced version of what they were currently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>And the "opening of the dantian, the appearance of the Gushing Spring", when he heard these terms, he had a slight realization.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chinese characters are very expressive, so just by seeing them, one can generally understand the meaning.</p><p></p><p>The only difficulty seems to be the shattering of the physical body and the tearing apart and reorganization of the qi, spirit, and divine soul, which must be extremely painful.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the gains, it is completely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know his disciple's thoughts, but if it were him, Madaozhang would definitely accept it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

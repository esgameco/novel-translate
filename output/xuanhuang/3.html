        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The yellowed fallen leaves, unable to withstand the mist and dew, became heavy with the weight of the droplets, as if burdened with a heavy pack, sliding off the branches and covering the ground in a thick layer.</p><p></p><p>The sinister invasion, the whole of society on the verge of collapse, the sanitation workers who should have been up early to clean were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>The world seems to follow a peculiar logic - the more sparsely populated an area, the more dangerous it is.</p><p></p><p>In areas with a concentration of human habitation, though the various murky desires lead to the proliferation of the sinister, there is a lack of the occasional appearance of secret realm mini-worlds.</p><p></p><p>In comparison to the sinister, the suddenly appearing secret realm mini-worlds are even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Not all mini-worlds are inhabited, and more of them are like phantoms.</p><p></p><p>The small-scale mini-worlds discovered make up the majority, nearly 80%.</p><p></p><p>These mini-worlds should be more accurately called spatial cracks or secret realms.</p><p></p><p>As for the expansive mini-worlds, the ones discovered so far number only about ten, with five of them found in the past two years.</p><p></p><p>The numerous tiny secret realms, some are not even as large as the space controlled by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Some are just an old house, some a dried-up well, some a white bone mound.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Waking up from the state of transcendence again, Xuanhuang looked a bit listless.</p><p></p><p>"Although my spiritual essence is high, the accumulated amount is not much, at most three times a day I can enter the state of transcendence."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's state of transcendence is like a future self, using the powerful future to push back the present path.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason is still based on that mutated 'god'.</p><p></p><p>This existence should not have appeared, it can only be said that everything is half fate and half beyond one's control.</p><p></p><p>Just by chance, he entered the not yet fully revived sinister grinding wheel space.</p><p></p><p>Just by chance, his spiritual essence is very high, and the grinding wheel space cannot be erased.</p><p></p><p>"However, this situation is very dangerous! Now the sinister grinding wheel has not yet fully revived, it only follows the rules in its operation. There is no guarantee that the sinister grinding wheel will not slowly revive, and then it will not be good for me to settle down in its home."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not forget his own predicament.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is in the grinding wheel space, although the sinister has no self-awareness, it only follows the rules in its operation.</p><p></p><p>But there is no guarantee that in the future, they will not give birth to self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>"It's best to completely make it my own and occupy this place, turn this space into my own."</p><p></p><p>Now he can only fuse within a ten-meter space, outside of which is dense fog, to completely control this place, he can only make his will stronger.</p><p></p><p>"My will is the will of heaven, my heart is the heart of heaven, only in this way can I completely make it my own."</p><p></p><p>Make his consciousness strong enough to cover the whole.</p><p></p><p>Replace the currently unknown existence of the grinding wheel's will, this is the way forward.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a narrow alley, there was no one in sight, the surrounding houses were empty, no one lived here, desolate and dilapidated.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly appeared here, this place was less than a hundred meters from his home.</p><p></p><p>He dared not appear randomly in front of the sinister grinding wheel, for now he should hide further away and wait for the next step.</p><p></p><p>"Squeak~"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, a nice fat rat."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang stepped on a rapidly running rat, pressing down hard a few times, and the rat suddenly disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~" Xuanhuang let out a breath, looking cautious.</p><p></p><p>In the grinding wheel space, a fat dead rat appeared here, the space trembled slightly and then stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Still too strenuous, ten meters is the limit of my will, but even the slightest bit of foreign matter will increase the burden, this is after I strengthened my body with the 'Smelting Method' last night. It seems that the results of one night can only increase one dead rat."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I continue to strengthen my body, I don't need to expand the control area for now, I need to increase its stability, this kind of limit control area is not suitable for the time being."</p><p></p><p>The limit of his will is ten meters, and even a dead rat is a heavy burden.</p><p></p><p>But enhancing the 'Smelting Method' is not an easy task either, the furnace of qi and blood, the qi is spiritual qi, and the blood itself is blood qi. To strengthen the body, spiritual qi is the catalyst for evolution and metamorphosis, and flesh and blood are the supplements.</p><p></p><p>So the growth of qi and blood requires abundant flesh and blood energy.</p><p></p><p>This rat is an experiment, grinding away the impurities and only leaving the essence of the rat's qi and blood to refine, this is a way to quickly strengthen the body.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Within Xuanhuang's ten-meter consciousness space, a illusory grinding wheel 'rumbled', the rat was like thrown into the grinding wheel, the gray light invisible to the naked eye but visible to the spirit was ground out, this is the rat's remaining soul.</p><p></p><p>Then a 'crack' was heard,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fur, bones, and skeleton of the rat began to transform. The roots and branches of the heavenly tree surged forth, as if everything came from the heavens and earth, and eventually only a blood-red mass of energy remained.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an illusory three-legged bronze cauldron emitted a bloody glow, and the last remaining blood energy of the rat was drawn into the melting furnace, causing the furnace to flash with light.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>The towering figure in the alley trembled slightly, and the invisible qi and blood within were strengthened.</p><p></p><p>"It really works."</p><p></p><p>This was Xuanhuang's achievement for the night.</p><p></p><p>In one night, he had visualized and manifested the outlines and illusory forms of three techniques: the "Smelting Furnace Method", the "Return to Ruins Method", and the "Heaven and Earth Method".</p><p></p><p>For him, the creator of these techniques, this was not difficult. His own consciousness was a spatial domain that he could control at will, allowing him to easily sketch out the visualized outlines and illusory forms within his mind.</p><p></p><p>"There is no such thing as a useless technique, only people who don't know how to use them. The 'Heaven and Earth Method' and the 'Smelting Furnace Method' cannot be cultivated for now, but their properties can be utilized."</p><p></p><p>The "Smelting Furnace Method" refines qi and blood, the "Heaven and Earth Method" refines the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, and the "Return to Ruins Method" causes all things to return to ruins, especially having a crushing effect on the metaphysical "spirit, soul, vitality, and heart", making it extremely powerful for refining the spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>Normally, if others obtained the techniques created by Xuanhuang, they would also be able to cultivate them, but not in the same monstrous way as him.</p><p></p><p>Others would find it extremely difficult to cultivate the "Smelting Furnace Method" from the start. First, they would need a powerful will to visualize the furnace, and this step alone has stumped many people. Secondly, they could never achieve the pure, refined blood energy that Xuanhuang did after three rounds of refinement.</p><p></p><p>Others can only increase their blood energy by eating. They can consume foods rich in powerful qi and blood, but may still not be able to absorb much. Xuanhuang's complete transformation is simply absurd.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xuanhuang's cultivation of the three techniques is synergistic. Although the "Heaven and Earth Method" and the "Return to Ruins Method" are supplementary, their roles are crucial.</p><p></p><p>"One thousand kilograms of force, the first refinement of the Smelting Furnace, is approximately at the Warrior realm... capable of defeating a hundred people."</p><p></p><p>After sensing the changes in his body, Xuanhuang realized that he had entered the Warrior realm.</p><p></p><p>His original body had some martial arts training, reaching the Martial Disciple level, somewhere in the middle to late stage. After refining the "Smelting Furnace Method" the previous night and today, he had reached the Warrior realm.</p><p></p><p>His strength has reached one thousand kilograms, and the "Smelting Furnace Method" has become more comprehensive, with balanced improvements in speed, agility, and reaction.</p><p></p><p>"I need more flesh and blood. I have no bottlenecks, I only need the energy of flesh and blood and a little time to temper myself. It seems I need to go to the martial arts hall to find some opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xuanhuang headed towards the martial arts hall in the city.</p><p></p><p>In this world, whether they are Martial Masters or Immortal Masters, they are all cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>They are just auxiliary personnel who assist the Illusionist in dealing with the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Despite their grand-sounding titles, Martial Masters and Immortal Masters don't play a significant role. They are outmatched by the anomalies, which have transcended the human realm.</p><p></p><p>To be fair, they are not entirely useless. Countless Martial Masters and Immortal Masters have sacrificed their lives on the front lines against the anomalies, and the Illusionist Spiritual Masters are using their own lives to wield their powers, which they treasure greatly.</p><p></p><p>The Illusionist and the anomalies engage in a strategic game, while the Martial Masters and Immortal Masters provide assistance or cleanup work.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the martial arts halls and Taoist temples of major cities, as long as one reaches the Warrior (Martial Disciple, Warrior, Martial Master) or Concentrated Spirit (Entering Meditation, Concentrated Spirit, Artifact Refiner) realm, they are required to participate in the fight against the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the cultivation of immortality has been completely transformed. The anomalies have caused the greatest destruction to the cultivation of immortality.</p><p></p><p>The previous cultivation realms are no longer useful, as the distorted and broken Heavenly Dao has been severed at the roots.</p><p></p><p>The current development of immortal cultivation first requires entering meditation, then condensing the spiritual soul, and finally refining artifacts.</p><p></p><p>They no longer condense their own spiritual souls, as that would lead to the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>They can only take a different path, not refining the spiritual soul, but refining artifacts to enchant them.</p><p></p><p>Artifact refinement and enchantment were originally metaphysical.</p><p></p><p>But the anomalies, damn it, cannot be killed unless one is strong enough to destroy the fragments of the rules.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivators were given an undistorted world to cultivate in, they would eventually be able to kill the anomalies born from the fragments of the rules.</p><p></p><p>But the current situation is that kindergarten-level cultivators have to rely on their knowledge to defeat professors, which is truly absurd.</p><p></p><p>Multiplication table versus advanced abstract geometry? ...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

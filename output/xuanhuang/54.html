        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nine gates of the Xuan-Huang furnace of heaven have opened, and the will has been forged nine times, finally reaching the second layer of the Xuan transformation.</p><p></p><p>Within the sea of qi and the dantian, a golden qi and blood of thirty zhang spread, the furnace of heaven and earth slowly revolving, the engraved heavenly gates becoming even more real.</p><p></p><p>If previously it was just a phantom, now it is at least thirty percent real.</p><p></p><p>And the heavenly pillar in the mist of the qi sea, after being washed by the power of heaven and earth, has shed its impurities, becoming even more extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Originally formed from the condensation of golden qi and blood, now the golden light flickers as it stands tall in the endless mist of the qi sea, becoming more stable and robust, firmly rooted in the qi sea mist, unaffected by the invasion of the mist.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuan-Huang can refine the second heavenly pillar, and because the qi sea has expanded, he can condense a complete heavenly pillar in one go.</p><p></p><p>But Xuan-Huang finds that he cannot do it.</p><p></p><p>The will of the second layer of Xuan transformation can only refine a six-zhang heavenly pillar at a time, unable to complete it in one go.</p><p></p><p>This small flaw does not bother Xuan-Huang.</p><p></p><p>It is not due to a defect in the cultivation method, but a deficiency in his own strength, unable to condense a nine-zhang heavenly pillar in one go.</p><p></p><p>When he reaches the third layer of Xuan transformation, he will be able to refine a complete heavenly pillar in one go.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that,</p><p></p><p>The previous golden qi and blood in the qi sea could not condense a nine-zhang heavenly pillar in one go.</p><p></p><p>But now, the thirty-zhang qi sea can condense a nine-zhang heavenly pillar in one go.</p><p></p><p>Without the need to condense it and recover for two days.</p><p></p><p>The connection between a heavenly pillar and the power of heaven and earth, as mentioned before, was just a narrow path.</p><p></p><p>Currently, with the will of the second layer of Xuan transformation, Xuan-Huang can fully open the heavenly gates without any sense of impact.</p><p></p><p>The will of the second layer of Xuan transformation, corresponding to the narrow path of the baptism of the power of heaven and earth, is as stable as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, after relocating to Qing Yun Mountain, I can condense the second heavenly pillar."</p><p></p><p>"Faster than I expected."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly smooth, without any obstacles.</p><p></p><p>Even the recovery of the qi and blood power has become rapid after being able to refine the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Previously relying on taking medicine and drinking blood, now it has been achieved through the enjoyment of the dew.</p><p></p><p>Transcending the initial stage of the Xuan transformation, Xuan-Huang has gradually freed himself from the daily distractions of eating.</p><p></p><p>By refining the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, he can replenish the body's needs.</p><p></p><p>The physical body is gradually becoming more energized.</p><p></p><p>However, it is not purely energized, but can undergo energy-matter conversion.</p><p></p><p>The blood and flesh of the human body contain endless treasures, and pure energization is not the best approach.</p><p></p><p>The best way is to upgrade and elevate the blood and flesh, maintaining the treasures within while not being burdened by the mundane blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>On the other side...</p><p></p><p>"I'm finally back, the world has changed so much."</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Xie Department in the Southern City Town, Xu Ru-yi felt a sense of spatial and temporal displacement.</p><p></p><p>He has experienced a lot on this journey.</p><p></p><p>First, various requests were not supported, and he was extremely disappointed when he learned about the changes in Southern City.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, many powerful figures called to inquire about the Xuan-Huang incident.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Xie Department in Southern City Town, Xu Ru-yi felt a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>It seems that everything has changed.</p><p></p><p>He heard that there are endless streams of martial artists arriving, as well as some cultivators seeking opportunities.</p><p></p><p>There are also some unknown reasons for the arrival of spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>The three extraordinary figures of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism will also come here, leaving him overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the kill orders from some evil organizations on the forums, he also feels a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>Southern City was already a gathering of storms, and now it has become even more chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious public transportation, mysterious gates, mysterious alleys, and the gathering of martial artists and cultivators... it's all too chaotic.</p><p></p><p>"How much do you understand?" Xu Ru-yi asked as High Xiao-lan and Dong Xing-bao approached.</p><p></p><p>"The evidence against the department head has been confirmed. It was Jia Zheng-yi who hired the assassin Qi Long, and then the two disappeared. Xuan-Huang Xuan-shi did not encounter any accidents, he just went out for a stroll that day."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand." Xu Ru-yi was a bit conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Jia Zheng-yi should have been killed by Xuan-Huang.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It still needs to be explained.</p><p></p><p>It was not Jia Zhengyi who did the wrongdoing first, and his death would not end it.</p><p></p><p>The one who killed him needs to give an explanation.</p><p></p><p>If not, that group of spiritualists with abnormal minds will cause conflicts.</p><p></p><p>They won't care whether it was Jia Zhengyi who hired the assassin first, they will only think that Xuanhuang killed our Director Jia, and you need to provide an explanation.</p><p></p><p>The spiritualists are arrogant, and Xu Ruyi is helpless.</p><p></p><p>But if this is not done, some spiritualists will be disappointed, and the separation of the Xie Department in Nanshi Town will not be far away.</p><p></p><p>"What are everyone's thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao smiled slightly and said, "Some colleagues have asked me to ask, was it Xuanhuang who plotted against Director Jia? Or did Director Jia disappear on his own?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao suddenly found that after the disappearance of Jia Zhengyi, those who were inclined towards Jia Zhengyi were now inclined towards him.</p><p></p><p>He had previously been unable to outmaneuver Xu Ruyi and Jia Zhengyi, but now that Jia Zhengyi was gone, it had turned out to be beneficial for him.</p><p></p><p>He had become the backbone of Jia Zhengyi's group of people.</p><p></p><p>"We can't confirm yet whether it was Xuanhuang who plotted against Director Jia, but we can confirm that Director Jia hired an assassin to harm Xuanhuang first, and previously also used the strange tree to suppress Xuanhuang, including the Xuanhuang martial arts extraordinary incident, which was not mentioned."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Director Gao, what you said is useless, it's not my own idea, I'm asking on behalf of my colleagues and brothers."</p><p></p><p>"Then what answer do you want to get?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi said, "Don't forget that Xuanhuang is called 'Master Xuan' by the Dragon Masters, and it is also recognized by the headquarters of the Xie Department."</p><p></p><p>"The decisions of the big shots are too far away from us, we ordinary people don't care about these, my brothers just want to know what happened to Director Jia? Was he murdered?"</p><p></p><p>"Director Dong, this matter is not that simple, we understand the thoughts of our colleagues, but whether Director Jia was killed has not been confirmed yet." Gao Xiaolan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Dong Xingbao stood up and said, "Then it's simple, let's go find that 'Master Xuan' together tomorrow, isn't it easy?"</p><p></p><p>Then he continued, "Of course, this is not my own idea, but the common idea of my brothers and sisters. Isn't the dojo moving tomorrow? We'll go to congratulate them on the move, and also ask 'Master Xuan' if he has seen our Director Jia. If it's a misunderstanding, that's the best, but if there's something suspicious, we can't just sit by and watch, can we?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao finally said, "After all, the spiritualists have shed blood and sweat for Nanshi, we can't let our brothers and sisters feel disheartened, right? Director Xu, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan: "You..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi waved his hand and said, "Okay, let's do as Director Dong said, we have to find out the truth, it's not good to drag it on. But I hope everyone will be calm tomorrow, can you guarantee that, Director Dong?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, with Director Xu's words, we will naturally listen. We will be calm, as long as the truth comes out, everyone will be calm."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao was just a fence-sitter, he had always lost in real struggles.</p><p></p><p>This time, a large group of people were inclined towards him, and his fence-sitting personality took over, feeling that the sun was shining and he could go.</p><p></p><p>He spoke on behalf of this and that.</p><p></p><p>"Director Xu, Director Gao, I'll take my leave first, to report the good news to my brothers and sisters."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi nodded expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Director?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan looked puzzled at Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>"It needs to be resolved, rather than delaying and letting people's hearts scatter, it's better to resolve it early and get it over with."</p><p></p><p>"But after all, it was Director Jia who harmed others first?"</p><p></p><p>"Does it matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't it matter, Director?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, especially to those who have already made up their minds."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan was stunned, and it took him a while to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"Then tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate Xuanhuang, he will resolve it." Xu Ruyi said.</p><p></p><p>"What if he can't resolve it?"</p><p></p><p>"If he can't resolve it... Then for the spiritualists in the department who feel 'wronged', let them make a choice too, whether to leave or stay, we need to change."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

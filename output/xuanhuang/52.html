        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The few ministers and deputy ministers, as well as the masters, were all present.</p><p></p><p>"Is the online news true?"</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia, the head of the Zhenxie Department, asked.</p><p></p><p>An old Taoist replied, "I inquired with my Taoist friend Ma, and this matter is true. Moreover, Ma said he has a surprise, but it's not convenient to say it now. He wants me to go there, and I'm still considering it."</p><p></p><p>The one who responded was the Taoist, Confucian, and Buddhist master, the Taoist Daoist Nine Tong.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't Xu Ruyi report this to us?"</p><p></p><p>The first deputy minister, Zhao Zhengdao, said.</p><p></p><p>The Zhenxie Department headquarters was filled with masters. The three deputy ministers and the minister were all third-stage masters, plus the Dragon Master, making five openly.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Ruyi said he didn't know either. If it hadn't been exposed online, he would still be in the dark."</p><p></p><p>The second deputy minister, Han Wu, said.</p><p></p><p>"How did Xu Ruyi manage this? His subordinates didn't even report such news to him. Is he too comfortable as the minister?"</p><p></p><p>The third deputy minister, Tang Zongshu, criticized.</p><p></p><p>Han Wu was silent for a while. "It was deliberately concealed by the South City deputy minister, Jia Zhengyi. Moreover, Jia Zhengyi has suppressed Xuanhuang, and there is evidence that he hired the Mysterious Shadow Qi Long to assassinate Xuanhuang, but both Qi Long and Jia Zhengyi have disappeared, which has now been exposed."</p><p></p><p>When Han Wu said this, the senior officials present did not speak lightly.</p><p></p><p>Although Han Wu's words seemed ordinary, everyone present understood the implication.</p><p></p><p>It was not only the South City that had a group of spiritual practitioners who were wary of the rise of immortal martial artists, threatening the status of spiritual practitioners, but the headquarters also had many.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are completely afraid of the rise of immortal martial artists.</p><p></p><p>What they care about is not these, but the difference in ideology.</p><p></p><p>One is the Protector faction, and the other is the Stronger faction.</p><p></p><p>The Protector faction, like Xu Ruyi and others, have boundless love, treat everyone equally, and do their utmost to protect the group, even without any return.</p><p></p><p>The Stronger faction follows the principle of survival of the fittest, and they will not sacrifice themselves for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>They don't care about losing a little benefit, but once it involves major interests, especially if it harms their own interests, they won't care about the life and death of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, even the Stronger faction, in the current environment, is not entirely unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>It's impossible for everyone to be selfless and devoted. Everyone has their own selfish desires.</p><p></p><p>If a little benefit can help many people, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>But if I have to sacrifice a lot to help others, it's impossible.</p><p></p><p>Those who are truly "inhuman" like Jia Zhengyi are actually a minority in the Zhenxie Department.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jia Zhengyi's dual identity as the leader of a heretical sect makes his actions understandable.</p><p></p><p>So, to put it bluntly, even the spiritual practitioners of the Stronger faction are not bad people.</p><p></p><p>The real bad people, the evil ones, have long since joined various cults or become scattered cultivators. Who would join the Zhenxie Department?</p><p></p><p>Those who join the Zhenxie Department, no matter how you look at it, have the idea of saving the world in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The two factions are not that different.</p><p></p><p>However, once the difference in ideology is involved, people suddenly become strange, as if the slightest difference is a life-and-death enemy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after Han Wu finished speaking, the people who understood the implication did not speak.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that their words would become the target of attack by the other faction.</p><p></p><p>"Minister, Dragon Master, Deputy Ministers, and all the esteemed ones. Humanity has opened up a new extraordinary path, which cannot be ignored. You, the ministers and esteemed ones, are all busy. How about this, I, along with Master Minghui and Mr. Yan Lai, will go to South City to take a look at this 'Xuanshi' who is being questioned and respected?"</p><p></p><p>The Taoist Daoist Nine Tong decided to go. Regardless of what his Taoist friend Ma said, or his own Tao path, since a direction has appeared, he must go and investigate it himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding one's own future, if one does not make an effort, even the heavens will not favor such a person.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, no matter what, in the end it is the new extraordinary path for us humans. This person can be called the 'Mysterious Cultivator'."</p><p></p><p>The silent Dragon Master said.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, no matter the ideology, we have gathered together with the heart to protect the common people of the world. Mysteries are increasing, the world is changing every day. Fellow Daoists, let's first put aside the debate of ideologies, look ahead, and don't look back."</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia stood up and cupped his hands to the Dragon Master, saying, "Everyone, the Dragon Master is right. Ideological differences are just ideologies. Does the heart and expectation of joining the Exorcism Department still remain? We can't forget that!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zheng replied, "The department head has spoken seriously. I, Zhao, joined the Exorcism Department for the sake of the Great Xia and this ethnic group. The ancients said 'loyal to the lord and patriotic', which I previously sneered at. But now I agree with it, it's just that this lord is not that lord, this lord is this nation, this country. I think I am 'loyal to the lord'."</p><p></p><p>Han Wu laughed, "Department Head Zhao is indeed eloquent. You are so 'loyal to the lord', how can you bear to exchange a few people for nearly ten thousand people? Aren't those ten thousand people also human?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Zong refuted, "Department Head Han, your words are mistaken. Department Head Zhao just doesn't want to make unnecessary sacrifices. Since it's impossible to do, preserving the strong is also to better protect the weak."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's impossible? It's clearly just a little effort that could save nearly ten thousand people. I'm not stubbornly undiscriminating, if there was a real crisis, I wouldn't say anything if you Spiritual Masters tactically retreated, but there's clearly an opportunity, it's just a little loss..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright everyone, stop. We're not discussing these things today."</p><p></p><p>Department Head Bi Xia interrupted Han Wu's words, although he felt Han Wu was right.</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia said, "Since Senior Cultivator Jiu, Great Master Ming Hui, and Mr. Yan are willing to go, then please trouble the three of you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, great sirs, the three of us will carefully investigate."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, dismissed."</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia stopped decisively.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would definitely deviate from the purpose of this meeting, and they would enter into a debate of the two theories again.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Master shook his head helplessly, not continuing to say anything.</p><p></p><p>He just acknowledged that Xuan Huang was respectfully called 'Mysterious Cultivator', which was a kind of acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a dark mountain cave, the interior was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>Prominently placed were three lifelike human dolls, and around the area were many severed limbs, dried blood, and ferocious expressions that looked particularly chilling.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the cave, a middle-aged man was sitting cross-legged, with several medicine bottles beside him.</p><p></p><p>Among them was the 'Divine Blood' that Xuan Huang recognized.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly shuddering, the middle-aged man opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, you will die a miserable death."</p><p></p><p>This person was 'Jia Zhengyi', or the Demonic Idol Sect's Idol Master Gou Jianren.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of method is this, actually restraining even my soul fragment, not leaving me a chance to escape."</p><p></p><p>Gou Jianren was now terrified when thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he hadn't encountered puppets being killed before, but only the puppets died, not harming him. So the loss was not great.</p><p></p><p>But this time, being besieged and killed by Xuan Huang, even his soul fragment was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>It had been almost half a month, and he had almost exhausted all his accumulated life-saving methods, just barely stabilizing his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the demonic puppets became so bizarre that they almost completely lost control, which was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>This caused him to go into hiding for half a month, and the news of Xuan Huang had already spread, but he had not yet reported the situation to the Demonic Idol Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, wanting to kill me, how unfortunate. I, Gou Jianren, believe in expediency, stability, and patience. Those who want to kill me haven't even been born yet."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I should even thank you. After this crisis, I will advance further. Xuan Huang, wait for your death."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gou Jianren quickly transformed, and only a doll remained sitting cross-legged in the cave, the real person having disappeared.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

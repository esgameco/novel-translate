        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, junior disciple, come quickly."</p><p></p><p>The senior monk on the other end of the phone was very confused.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Disciple Minghui, is the Mysterious Master real?"</p><p></p><p>Minghui said, "Not only is he real, but it is also an unprecedented great opportunity. The chance for our Buddhist sect has arrived. Quickly bring the other senior monks and come to Qingyun Mountain in the Southern City to meet up."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Disciple, can you explain in detail so I can tell the other senior monks?"</p><p></p><p>Minghui calmed himself, knowing he was anxious, and said calmly, "The Mysterious Master is truly extraordinary in the Dao, and he has indeed opened up a path of the Dao... In addition, just now, I, your elder disciple, was fortunate enough to become one of the ten people the Mysterious Master has taken notice of."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Mysterious Master has also bestowed upon us the methods of refining qi and refining the spirit, both of which are direct paths to the extraordinary and the Heavenly Dao, each one as vast as the sea and immeasurable... With these three methods, whether it is those in our Buddhist sect who cultivate the body, qi, or spirit, they can all find the corresponding methods. Do you know what this means, junior disciple?"</p><p></p><p>The junior disciple on the other end was dumbfounded, naturally knowing what it meant.</p><p></p><p>It meant the arrival of individual extraordinary abilities, the starting point for individuals to become immortal Buddhas.</p><p></p><p>"I, the old monk, strongly suspect that the Mysterious Master is the reincarnation of the Buddha, who has come to save all living beings, because he has the broad mind of the Buddha, transmitting the Dharma to the world, universally saving all beings, allowing everyone to become a Buddha."</p><p></p><p>He became excited again.</p><p></p><p>The Elder Master Minghui became excited and incoherent again.</p><p></p><p>The junior disciple on the other end thought his elder brother had gone mad. What kind of experience was this, that he changed so much in just a few days? Goodness, the reincarnation of the Buddha has even appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Junior disciple, I'm not sick. Everything I'm saying is true. Even the stubborn-nosed Jiutong and the bookworm Yan have been noticed by the Mysterious Master, and a Daoist priest with a stubborn nose from the Southern City has also been noticed. Our Buddhist sect has already fallen behind. Come quickly."</p><p></p><p>The junior disciple on the other end: ...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, Minghui said again, "Oh yes, our Buddhist sect has many talented people. The senior monks skilled in elixir-making, talisman-drawing, and formation techniques must also be notified to come... If you don't come, you will be a sinner of the Buddhist sect, destined to fall into the AvÄ«ci hell and unable to be reborn."</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, no matter if it's the mysterious points or the practical money, bring a lot. In the future, our Buddhist sect must occupy a place on Qingyun Mountain. If we can't do other things, at least we can contribute to the construction of Qingyun Mountain..."</p><p></p><p>-----</p><p></p><p>"Junior disciple? This is Jiutong. Come quickly."</p><p></p><p>Jiutong's junior disciple was also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, don't be in a hurry. Tell me carefully, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Jiutong calmed down and said, "Today... the Mysterious Master has taken notice of our Dao sect. Not only was I, your elder brother, personally instructed by him, but the Daoist priest Ma from the Southern City has also been noticed. Currently, our Dao sect occupies the second position, with the first position being held by the martial arts school in the Southern City; however, there is also a wandering cultivator named Peng Cheng Du Ming, who is likely a fellow Dao cultivator, and we need to win him over.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Mysterious Master has bestowed upon us three methods: the way of refining the body, refining the qi, and refining the spirit. Moreover, the Mysterious Master's methods are profound, and he has condensed spiritual vessels to hold them: the Heavenly Pillar and the Earthly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>Everyone can refine their willpower, the only difference being in the methods of refining and fusing.</p><p></p><p>I, your elder brother, was fortunate enough to have a good willpower, and my refinement of qi and spirit is also acceptable, which is why I have gained the Mysterious Master's attention.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the Mysterious Master's Spiritual Root Tree, the Heavenly Pillar, can cleanse the distorted Heavenly will and chaotic spiritual energy. Within the area covered by the Heavenly Pillar, one can perceive the stable Heavenly mechanisms and absorb and refine the pure spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This is the path to the Heavenly Dao for our Dao sect. Don't say anything else, quickly gather our Dao sect's elders and bring your belongings to come.</p><p></p><p>... That bald-headed Minghui, and the bookworm Yan have also been noticed. Currently, our Dao sect is in the lead. We must maintain this.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, this Qingyun Mountain will definitely be the ancestral land of all Dharmas. It cannot be lost. Whoever is not attentive to this, they will be a sinner of our Dao sect.</p><p></p><p>I must ensure that I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Make sure my words are conveyed properly, and tell the various Taoist masters that the Patriarch has been reincarnated in Qingyun. Our Taoist sect cannot miss this opportunity..."</p><p></p><p>Both the junior brother of Jiutong and the junior brother of Minghui were a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the way their elder brother had been behaving, they would have suspected he had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Wow, the reincarnation of the Taoist Patriarch has come to enlighten the masses.</p><p></p><p>Is this really the reincarnation of the Taoist Patriarch? Well, it makes sense, our Patriarch does reincarnate frequently. </p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p>With the fusion of the myriad realms and the invasion of the mysterious, it is quite reasonable that our Patriarch has reincarnated again to enlighten the masses.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, elder brother, don't worry, I will immediately summon the senior cultivators of our sect, and personally convey your words to everyone, to inform them of the importance of this matter."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the affirmative response from his junior brother, Jiutong heaved a sigh of relief, and then continued:</p><p></p><p>"Good, junior brother, you must hurry. Our Taoist sect has many talented people, masters in cultivating the body, energy, and spirit. You must notify all of them.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, I've noticed that the Mysterious Teacher places great importance on talents in the field of alchemy.</p><p></p><p>He has already begun planning for the creation of extraordinary elixirs. This is an area our Taoist sect excels in, so you must find some Taoist friends who have researched alchemy, and tell them that the Dao of Alchemy is in Qingyun, where they can explore the extraordinary Dao of Alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, speaking of which... Forging, talisman drawing, formation arrays, and all the other Immortal cultivation arts, our Taoist sect has delved into them all.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the celestial mechanisms were unstable and undesirable, but now Qingyun Mountain has a stable celestial mechanism realm, so these can all be researched and learned.</p><p></p><p>You must also personally contact the Taoists versed in these areas, and tell them of their importance.</p><p></p><p>As I said, whoever does not take this seriously is a sinner of our Taoist sect.</p><p>As the leader of our sect, this is what I say..."</p><p></p><p>---------</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Mr. Meng? This is Yan Lai, come quickly to Qingyun Mountain."</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the phone, Mr. Meng was similarly attentive.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai said, "The Sage has appeared, appeared in Qingyun Mountain. Today I received the Mysterious Teacher's guidance and was bestowed the three classic scriptures of essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>The path for humanity to rise up has appeared, and I have been fortunate enough to be noticed by the Mysterious Teacher, who has personally instructed me...</p><p></p><p>Although we Confucian disciples do not specialize in Buddhism and Taoism, we have people everywhere. Although we no longer occupy the dominant position officially, we were once the upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>Utilize all means to support Qingyun Mountain, support the Mysterious Teacher, to create an atmosphere for the Mysterious Teacher, but not through widespread propaganda, as the Mysterious Teacher has just reincarnated and has not yet fully established a foothold. We need to secretly prepare everything for the Mysterious Teacher.</p><p></p><p>Await the moment when the Mysterious Teacher calls out from on high, so you must...</p><p></p><p>The masters of the Confucian school in cultivating the body, energy, and spirit, as long as it is not a major matter, must hurry to come to Qingyun Mountain, for it is a holy land for cultivation and learning.</p><p></p><p>This place has a stable celestial mechanism and pure spiritual energy...</p><p></p><p>I have not yet established the Wooden Pillar Heaven Observatory diagram, but I can use it as a foundation to research another manifestation of vital energy - the Vast and Righteous Energy Method.</p><p></p><p>This requires more of us working together, as well as seeking guidance from the Mysterious Teacher... With the Mysterious Teacher's guidance, I believe the most suitable fundamental method for our Confucian school will be born."</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the phone, Mr. Meng listened very carefully.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai then said, "The bald-headed Minghui and the ox-nosed Jiutong have also been noticed by the Mysterious Teacher. No matter, for thousands of years we Confucians have been able to maintain the dominant position, and now we can do the same...</p><p></p><p>In any case, come quickly. Whoever does not take this seriously will be recorded in history as an eternal sinner of our Confucian school."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Mr. Meng sensed the importance of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Mr. Yan, I will convey this personally, and be sure to seize the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

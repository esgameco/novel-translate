        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The phone rang, and the tranquil Xuanhuang was a bit dazed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After traversing over ten days, this seemed to be the first call from his ancestral relative?</p><p></p><p>In the past ten days or so, aside from the telecom company that never forgot him and kept sending him messages every day, he seemed to have no one else who cared about him.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious invasion had its benefits too - at least the scam calls had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was said that there were also some strange telecom scams, and that incident had resulted in heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>But ever since then, the telecom scams had vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, cousin." </p><p></p><p>The call was from his aunt's son, Liu Wenhao.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, have you become a martial arts master?"</p><p></p><p>A shocked question came through the phone.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was a bit puzzled: "How did you know?"</p><p></p><p>"Our teacher took us to the martial arts hall to learn, and I saw your photo and introduction. Brother, is it true?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood now - it must have been the school organizing the martial arts students to go learn at their dojo.</p><p></p><p>After becoming one of the few dozen martial arts masters at the dojo, his introduction and photo had been hung on the publicity board to showcase the dojo's heritage.</p><p></p><p>"If you've seen it, how can it not be true?" Xuanhuang replied.</p><p></p><p>"No, I... I just... I just..." </p><p></p><p>The little cousin was stammering, obviously still not having recovered from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, even the people at the dojo were bewildered - becoming a martial artist and then a master in less than a week, it was like cheating, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, you'll get used to it."</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Brother, do you have time? I want to learn martial arts from you," the little cousin finally managed to say.</p><p></p><p>"Not for now, I'm out on a mission."</p><p></p><p>"What, dealing with the mysterious?" the cousin asked, both excited and worried.</p><p></p><p>"You could say that."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, be careful. My mom said to come have dinner with us when you're back."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll contact you when I'm back."</p><p></p><p>"Uh... brother, I..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Xuanhuang was about to hang up, the little cousin suddenly started stammering again, his words unclear.</p><p></p><p>"What is it? Spit it out."</p><p></p><p>"It's just... the past two nights I've been having the same dream, where a woman's voice keeps calling me 'unfaithful scoundrel, beast, give me back my child'."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the details..."</p><p></p><p>The little cousin seemed to have gathered his courage, and began recounting the story.</p><p></p><p>It started with him in the school library, reading a book called "Analysis of Martial Arts Fundamentals". It was a normal book.</p><p></p><p>But as he was flipping through it, he found an old, yellowed piece of paper tucked between the pages. It was a passionate love letter.</p><p></p><p>The handwriting, which was neither too white nor too black, was obviously from a man to a woman.</p><p></p><p>The little cousin didn't pay much attention at the time, just finding the sappy words "disgusting". </p><p></p><p>Without caring whether it belonged to someone who had forgotten it there, and which clearly dampened his interest in reading, he tore it up a few times and crumpled it into a ball, tossing it into the trash.</p><p></p><p>And then the trouble began...</p><p></p><p>Starting the day before yesterday, he started dreaming that he was in an ancient-style courtyard, and he had become a wealthy young master from the Republican era, a dissolute scion.</p><p></p><p>He kept hearing a woman's malicious cursing and damning voice.</p><p></p><p>At first it was vague and distant, but yesterday the dream was the same, and this time the woman's cursing voice was closer.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that the closer the voice's owner got to him, the more danger he would be in.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the school's education on the supernatural, he immediately felt that this must be a supernatural incident.</p><p></p><p>That love letter must be the medium, the prerequisite for triggering the supernatural.</p><p></p><p>Unavoidable! Just because he accidentally saw the disgusting love letter and tore it up, what's the big deal?</p><p></p><p>"Have you told anyone else about this?"</p><p></p><p>After hearing the cousin's description, Xuanhuang had made a judgment - this was definitely a supernatural incident.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, the first time I had the dream the day before yesterday, I didn't pay much attention. But when I had the same dream again last night, I immediately felt something was wrong, and I haven't told the teacher yet."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing this. At least it was still in the early stages.</p><p></p><p>The little cousin's vigilance was very strong - after just two consecutive identical dreams, he had already noticed something was amiss. </p><p></p><p>It seemed that today he would tell the teacher, but upon seeing that Xuanhuang had become a martial arts master, he had asked him about it first.</p><p></p><p>"It's not too dangerous yet," Xuanhuang could only 'comfort' him this way.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "By the way, what happened to that love letter you tore up?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, sobs came through the phone - the little cousin was crying.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, after I realized something was wrong today..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I immediately checked my backpack for the book, and that love letter - it was still tucked safely inside the book."</p><p></p><p>"When did you discover it?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was a bit shocked. "Just now, during our phone call, I remembered it and casually looked for it, and then, then I found it, waaah..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood now. No wonder his younger cousin suddenly started crying - during their phone conversation, he had remembered something and started searching, and then found it...</p><p></p><p>One could imagine how frightened the younger cousin on the other end of the phone must have been at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down!" </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang scolded from the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>The younger cousin Liu Wenhao then snapped out of his panic.</p><p></p><p>"So what are you planning to do now?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked after Liu Wenhao had calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The confused Liu Wenhao said, "Brother, I'm planning to tell the teacher."</p><p></p><p>"And then what?"</p><p></p><p>"And then, then the teacher..." Liu Wenhao fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"That won't work. Not to mention your teachers don't have any spiritual practitioners, even if they did, the most they could do is just take away the love letter medium, and then wait and see what happens next."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang knew more than his younger cousin. There was no good solution to this kind of situation. </p><p></p><p>Without one-on-one support, spiritual practitioners were scarce and all extremely busy. Each one faced more dangerous situations than what Liu Wenhao was facing.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for a spiritual practitioner to just stand guard over Liu Wenhao.</p><p></p><p>The only option was to just take away the love letter medium and see if that would cause the ominous force to shift its attention. Liu Wenhao would just have to wait and see.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, Xuanhuang thought it would be better if he just took care of it himself. </p><p></p><p>He planned to take the love letter medium, and see if the ominous force would continue to target Liu Wenhao or come after him instead, since he now had the medium. </p><p></p><p>If it came after him first, at least that would mean Liu Wenhao would be safe for now. According to the patterns of these ominous forces, they wouldn't go after Liu Wenhao if Xuanhuang was still alive.</p><p></p><p>As for wanting Xuanhuang to die? There was no hope for that.</p><p></p><p>If all else failed, he could always retreat into his spiritual space, and he even had the big millstone in his own courtyard. He could just throw the love letter into the millstone and let the two ominous forces fight it out. </p><p></p><p>The ominous force represented by the love letter wouldn't be able to defeat the millstone.</p><p></p><p>He could even throw it into the blood pool domain that he guarded - let the love letter ominous force contend with the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what should I do?" </p><p></p><p>Liu Wenhao was panicked and didn't know what to do.</p><p></p><p>"You just wait there, I'll go over and hand the medium over to the senior members of the martial arts hall, and then..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang outlined his plan, but told a little white lie. </p><p></p><p>He said he would hand over the ominous love letter to the martial arts hall, but in reality he would handle it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, brother. I won't go to school, I'll wait for you."</p><p></p><p>Grasping at this lifeline, the frantic Liu Wenhao couldn't imagine how much trouble handing it over would cause for others in his panic.</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Xuanhuang calmly sat in meditation without any outward action.</p><p></p><p>Until about ten minutes later, he disappeared from that place.</p><p></p><p>Through the millstone spiritual space, as his control and will over the space grew stronger, Xuanhuang could freely teleport within a certain range.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the panicked and helpless younger cousin received the call, Xuanhuang was already waiting at the agreed upon place.</p><p></p><p>"Huff, huff" </p><p></p><p>Seeing Xuanhuang waving, Liu Wenhao hurried over to him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I just remembered you had a task to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I only have half an hour of free time, I need to hurry back."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Liu Wenhao didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me." </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked at the book tightly clutched in Liu Wenhao's hand, where the love letter medium was hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Liu Wenhao solemnly handed it over to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"You go back, stay in touch, see if you'll have the dream again tonight."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took the medium, without time to examine it now, and said to Liu Wenhao.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, brother."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go back, I'll have the martial arts hall take care of it." Xuanhuang added, "Don't be nervous, the calmer you are, the better the chance. Remember that."</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember." </p><p></p><p>The teary-eyed Liu Wenhao gritted his teeth and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xuanhuang disappear around the corner.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thank you Zero Summer and Fei Ke friends for the rewards.

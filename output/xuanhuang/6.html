        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For six years, the mysterious invasion has been accompanied by the revival of the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth. Without human gathering and management, even barren hills would be covered in dense forests.</p><p></p><p>An SUV stopped at the foot of a hill.</p><p></p><p>Three people got out of it - Xuanhuang, the deputy director Wu Gang, and an accompanying person named Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>"The entrance to the secret realm is just ahead. We have made defensive arrangements in the shortest possible time - there is a sturdy prefabricated house, and a protective line has been set up around the cave entrance."</p><p></p><p>"According to the rule that the mysterious does not approach, as long as the blood pool secret realm exists, you don't need to worry about other mysterious attacks in the short term. The main threat is from animals lured by the blood pool."</p><p></p><p>The bearded Wu Gang said to Xuanhuang while pointing at the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It sounded like he was trying to encourage Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing that Xuanhuang showed no nervousness at all, but was instead admiring the red autumn leaves, Wu Gang didn't know how to evaluate him.</p><p></p><p>Is this young man extremely brave or just foolish? You are a warrior, not a master of the mysterious, yet you are so confident.</p><p></p><p>"Director Wu, I understand. I will come here at 9 o'clock every morning to collect the supplies," Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go up together."</p><p></p><p>The three then each picked up some large and small packages.</p><p></p><p>For the three warriors just starting out, several hundred jin (about 400 pounds) of weight was nothing to them.</p><p></p><p>Most of it was hot weapons and ammunition.</p><p></p><p>In about ten minutes, the three arrived at the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>This was a cave about 4-5 meters high and 4-5 meters wide.</p><p></p><p>Although it was daytime, Xuanhuang's spiritual senses were particularly sensitive.</p><p></p><p>The cave entrance was like a deep abyss, emanating a dense bloody and cold aura.</p><p></p><p>A concrete prefabricated barrier was set up in front of the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>There was also a 2.5-meter-high modular house, which was Xuanhuang's observation post, with walls half a meter thick, looking very sturdy.</p><p></p><p>The three spent half an hour arranging everything.</p><p></p><p>"In the next few days, Little Jin will deliver the supplies to you on time."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the accompanying Little Jin.</p><p></p><p>Little Jin nodded, his expression serious and taciturn. A prominent scar on his forehead gave him an unapproachable air.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang patted Xuanhuang on the shoulder: "From now on, it's up to you. After I go back, I'll urge the director. Also... safety first. You are not the primary responsible person, not even the main responsible person, you are just a guard. If you encounter factors that cannot be overcome, remember safety first. As long as you are alive, there is hope, although this damn world doesn't value human life, but I still hope to bring you back safely."</p><p></p><p>"I will, director."</p><p></p><p>The bearded man was cold-faced but warm-hearted, especially caring for his own people. Even the entire martial arts hall, perhaps due to the practice of martial arts, had an upright character. Or maybe facing such an environment, they had no time for scheming and tricks.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and left with Little Jin.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until they reached the foot of the mountain that the bearded man looked back at the slope.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jin, what do you think of Xuanhuang?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was silent for a while before saying, "Warrior style."</p><p></p><p>"Warrior style?" Wu Gang smiled: "I remember this kid started learning martial arts a few years ago. I always thought he was just average, but I didn't expect him to change so much recently, becoming a warrior, which I didn't even expect."</p><p></p><p>"Director, although we have been promoting the martial arts for five years, no matter how you look at it, we are all late starters. The hope lies not in us, but in those teenagers who start the foundation from the age of 16."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, 15 or 16 is the golden age to start martial arts. I'm almost 40 before I started learning, and becoming a martial arts master in five years, if I had started at 16, I would have been a genius."</p><p></p><p>"Next year will be better. Next year our martial arts hall will be able to allocate 50 graduate warrior students, and the personnel shortage problem will be temporarily relieved," Jin Ning said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Gang smiled slightly, but then sighed helplessly: "There is hope, but where is the real hope?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Jin Ning also fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial arts and immortal ways in this world are all late starters, the times create heroes, and there are many heroes who have risen against the odds.</p><p></p><p>But now they are facing a huge problem - the martial arts have just begun and reached their limit.</p><p></p><p>They cannot achieve the extraordinary, for the extraordinary will spiral out of control.</p><p></p><p>"Director, you don't need to be discouraged. There is always a way. I've heard that some secret research institutes have made progress, and by combining the powerful self-control of martial artists, they are experimentally trying to tame the mysterious."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, on the immortal side, aren't they also trying to refine mysterious objects with spiritual cultivation? Maybe there will be a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>As the deputy director, he should not be so depressed and vent his frustrations.</p><p></p><p>He could only do so occasionally when no one was around.</p><p></p><p>"I hope so."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang reaffirmed his determination.</p><p></p><p>The current human population on the Blue Star is less than 5 billion.</p><p></p><p>Adding the discovered small world humans, there are at least 100 billion.</p><p></p><p>This is the most conservative estimate, as the exact investigation has not been done.</p><p></p><p>100 billion people facing the same cruel environment. </p><p></p><p>There must be countless geniuses among them, and definitely not a few.</p><p></p><p>Although they don't have Xuanhuang's extraordinary experience, they can still find the root of the problem.</p><p></p><p>The problem lies in the distortion of the Heavenly Will, coupled with the collision and fusion of myriad realms, the Tao is incomplete.</p><p></p><p>It is also understood that to achieve the extraordinary without losing control, one must replace the Heavenly Will with one's own will.</p><p></p><p>Of course... replacing the Heavenly Will is a bit exaggerated, that is the ultimate level.</p><p></p><p>For now, it is to make one's own will the true will.</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of evolution or cultivation, it all starts from weakness.</p><p></p><p>To become strong from weakness, one must learn from heaven and earth, for humans are also products of this heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Learn from heaven and earth, study it, and finally surpass it.</p><p></p><p>This is an unavoidable path.</p><p></p><p>The current problem is that the Heavenly Will is distorted and incomplete. How to learn from it...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The more you seek externally, the more mistakes you will make.</p><p></p><p>In a complete world, mastering magical arts and divine abilities is like solving an equation, and then you can use a fulcrum to leverage great power. But in an incomplete world, even if you unlock a secret code, it's useless - if you use it, it will explode.</p><p></p><p>The problem is very clear - seeking externally is not the way, you can only seek internally.</p><p></p><p>It sounds simple, after all, many cultivation methods are about seeking internally, with Xianwu being the representative of this.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, only the strong can seek internally. Is it possible for you to start with internal seeking when you have no accumulation, no experience, no practice, no learning... nothing? You can't just start with internal seeking.</p><p></p><p>All cultivation, at its essence, begins with seeking externally.</p><p></p><p>Learn the laws of heaven and earth, absorb the spiritual opportunities of heaven and earth, and utilize the spiritual treasures created by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Accumulate, accumulate, and accumulate further, until you reach a certain level and comprehend the true meaning, the true self, the true spirit - this is the path of cultivating the truth, seeking the truth, and finding the truth.</p><p></p><p>The cruelty of this world is that you must understand the 'truth' from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Use your own true will to control your qi, spiritual opportunities, and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xuanhuang's will condensed from the void into reality.</p><p></p><p>First step, condense the will into a gaseous state, second step, condense it into a liquid state...</p><p></p><p>But this is just Xuanhuang, no one starts with a fourth-stage divine soul.</p><p></p><p>And they have mastered a small ten-meter world.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's small, it's still a world, still the will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>A self-centered will of heaven means no mistakes, even the wrong is right, this is my world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>But wait, let's get back on track!</p><p></p><p>"In the coming period, I need to quickly strengthen myself."</p><p></p><p>Standing in the empty mountain cave, Xuanhuang made arrangements for the next period.</p><p></p><p>He is probably taking a path of creating his own law, breaking through mountains, and building bridges across rivers.</p><p></p><p>With these conditions, combined with his outstanding mentality, the wisdom of two lifetimes, Xuanhuang is very confident.</p><p></p><p>"Condense the will."</p><p></p><p>The decision is unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Since he has made sufficient preparations, there is no need to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang swallowed two large Danxuan pills, which are resources provided by warriors, containing powerful blood qi energy.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's consciousness, a vague three-legged furnace began to tremble, and then it emanated a scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul is the furnace, the spiritual opportunities are the ignition, and the blood qi is the fuel, condensing the will integrated by the three.</p><p></p><p>"Sss~"</p><p></p><p>Even with sufficient preparation, Xuanhuang's body still trembled violently, and he couldn't help but let out a groan.</p><p></p><p>It was too painful, like boiling himself in an iron pot.</p><p></p><p>Until an hour later.</p><p></p><p>When the blood qi fuel was exhausted, Xuanhuang finally emerged from the meditative state.</p><p></p><p>"I... civilized, civilized."</p><p></p><p>His whole body was aching, the price of burning his own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang immediately swallowed another large Danxuan pill to recover.</p><p></p><p>It took more than ten minutes before he could take a long sigh, and the aching weakness throughout his body disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He then became aware that his senses were clear, and his self-control had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of his consciousness, in the grinding mill space, Xuanhuang felt that if his will expanded to the limit, he could control an area of eighteen or nineteen meters.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't do so, as the space would be too unstable. Currently, ten meters is enough.</p><p></p><p>Previously, even a mouse would make the space tremble. Now, even a tiger could be stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"The Furnace Nine Refinements, now I'm only one step away from the second refinement."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at this, I can now control a ten-meter grinding mill space with my will, and the second refinement will be twenty meters. Currently, at eighteen or nineteen meters, one more time and my will can increase to the next level."</p><p></p><p>The will in the formless stage is very difficult to measure strictly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xuanhuang has this grinding mill space as a reference.</p><p></p><p>"As for physical strength, it's still at the warrior level, the first layer of the Nine Refinements, which is not important."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang divided the Furnace Nine Refinements into nine steps.</p><p></p><p>Based on the comparison with the grinding mill space, when the will reaches the ninth layer of perfection, he will be able to control an area of a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>And the physical strength is 1,000 kilograms for the first layer, and 10,000 kilograms when the nine layers are complete.</p><p></p><p>The first refinement of the body corresponds to the warriors in this world, and the fourth refinement corresponds to the master warriors.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang doesn't pay much attention to the accumulation of physical strength.</p><p></p><p>For him, improving the physical strength is simple, just quickly refine the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>As someone who possesses the Guiyu Law, the Heaven and Earth Law, and the Furnace Law, he can just consume them.</p><p></p><p>The will is the key.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's goal is to keep his will always one layer ahead of his body, the more the better.</p><p></p><p>As long as the will doesn't cross a significant level, it won't go out of control.</p><p></p><p>And he's not afraid of losing control, as even if the will is too strong and puts pressure on the essence, spirit, and soul, he can expand the grinding mill space to store it.</p><p></p><p>The essence of Xuanhuang's powerful divine soul is also stored there, and he can store some will there as well, as the grinding mill remains silent.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul Xuanhuang uses externally is actually only a part of it, using only half of the white divine soul, while the golden divine soul strand has always been stored in the grinding mill space.</p><p></p><p>If he were to bring out the divine soul in its entirety, the corresponding space would disappear, and he wouldn't be able to enter it at will.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the essence of the divine soul is so high that if it's fully used in the real world, he doesn't know what would happen, at least the will couldn't control it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it will go out of control? Probably not, as there is a strand of immortal golden divine soul.</p><p></p><p>But it might not be Xuanhuang anymore.</p><p></p><p>It could become a new, powerful divine soul, and an immortal existence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoists, do you have any votes?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group from the Dao Mansion, their minds heavy with thoughts, returned to the Dao Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Tonight they had their eyes opened wide, and although the time was short, it surpassed the experiences of the past few years.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was naturally the words spoken by Xuan Huang before he left.</p><p></p><p>Those words that sounded so incredible.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma, Mansion Master, what should we do?" </p><p></p><p>Xia Qing was still very anxious, as it concerned their future path, how could they not take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Is what Lord Xuan Huang said true?"</p><p></p><p>"Can he really create cultivation methods for refining the spirit and refining the qi in just a few days?"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma and Li Tong remained silent, while Xia Qing kept talking, the situation now reversed from earlier.</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, Lord Xuan Huang would not casually make promises, since he said so, he must be confident. I heard that the Martial Arts Mansion is preparing to modify Qing Yun Mountain, it must be Lord Xuan Huang's intention. Mansion Master, what do you think..."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I only learned of this matter today. If Lord Xuan Huang has indeed decided to stay long-term at Qing Yun Mountain, we cannot fall behind either, being close by will give us more opportunities."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he said to Xia Qing: "In that case, Deputy Mansion Master Xia, you should send someone to scout the surrounding area tomorrow to see if there are any suitable places for us to station."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing nodded, since Master Ma and the Mansion Master both said so, it meant they believed Xuan Huang's words.</p><p></p><p>On the other side...</p><p></p><p>In the Exorcism Department, Jia Zhengyi was waiting for news.</p><p></p><p>When Wei Zixuan and the others returned in a panic, Jia Zhengyi felt that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>"How's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>"Department Head, the situation is not too good, this Xuan Huang person may not be as simple as we thought."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi asked, "Explain in detail."</p><p></p><p>Through the descriptions of the few people, Jia Zhengyi said, "So you don't understand the specific situation either, but the mysterious corpse tree has indeed been sealed?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's right, Department Head. The one-eyed person was mysteriously injured, suddenly disrupting our plan."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi nodded and said, "I see, you all go and rest first, let me think it through."</p><p></p><p>After the few people left, Jia Zhengyi fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had made many mistakes.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xuan Huang returned, as long as he investigated a little, he would understand Jia Zhengyi's actions.</p><p></p><p>Such an enemy was not too good.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he needed to use some methods.</p><p></p><p>He then dialed a phone number.</p><p></p><p>"Old friend, I need you to do something, and after the task is accomplished, the puzzle you've been longing for can be taken."</p><p></p><p>There was a moment of silence on the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi said, "I need you to kill a person, a person who has opened up a superhuman martial arts path."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>This news obviously startled the person on the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Mysterious Shadow Qi Long to also have moments of surprise. That's right, it's a person who has opened up a superhuman martial arts path. As long as you kill him, the Mysterious Shadow Cloak will be yours, and with the Mysterious Shadow Cloak, your advancement to the second stage will be smooth sailing."</p><p></p><p>The other end pondered for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll hurry to South City."</p><p></p><p>Then he added, "You'd better keep your word, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't cheat an old friend."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, forget it, a 'friend' like you, I, Qi Long, can't bear."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi didn't get angry, but instead said, "Your words are too hurtful."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if there's nothing else, hang up, don't disgust me."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi's face darkened as he said, "Okay, see you later, at the old place in South City."</p><p></p><p>Click, the phone call was hung up.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Arts Mansion, it was very lively.</p><p></p><p>The returning personnel, embellishing the details, described the successful operation this time.</p><p></p><p>This made the Martial Arts Mansion completely boil over.</p><p></p><p>With such a figure stationed at the Martial Arts Mansion, the development and growth of the Martial Arts Mansion was just around the corner.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>These were all brought by Xuanhuang, but Xuanhuang was not concerned with these things at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The fusion and transformation of the Building Wood had entered a digestion period.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang simply began to perfect the "Building Wood Returning to the True Method" and the "Returning to the Void Nine Seal Method".</p><p></p><p>In fact, they are the same in essence as the "Furnace Nine Refinements".</p><p></p><p>The difference is just a matter of which aspect is the main focus.</p><p></p><p>The "Furnace Nine Refinements" focuses on essence, the "Building Wood Returning to the True Method" focuses on qi, and the "Returning to the Void Nine Seal Method" focuses on spirit.</p><p></p><p>The visualization diagrams are respectively the Heavenly-Earth Furnace, the Penetrating Heaven Building Wood, and the Returning to the Void Great Grindstone.</p><p></p><p>"Returning the Building Wood to the True", here the "true" refers to the primordial.</p><p></p><p>The path to refining the "Building Wood Returning to the True Method" is to let oneself return to the original and restore the primordial constitution, so as to achieve the best way to absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>It is also the path of the joint growth of essence, qi, and spirit. The strength of the primordial constitution is not only better in "spiritual root", but an all-round amplification.</p><p></p><p>The "Returning to the Void Nine Seal Method" is a method of refining the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>In addition to being an enhancement method, it is also a defensive and offensive method.</p><p></p><p>A three-in-one method.</p><p></p><p>Each time a seal is refined, it will increase by one level, and each time the spirit is enhanced, the spirit will nourish the body and enhance the body's transformation.</p><p></p><p>When the nine seals are gathered and combined into one spirit seal, the spirit seal engraved with the Returning to the Void Great Grindstone diagram is an unparalleled means, whether for fighting enemies or tempering oneself.</p><p></p><p>After all, attacks belonging to the spirit are rare at the lower levels.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's "Returning to the Void Nine Seal Method" integrates offense and defense, allowing cultivators of the spirit to contend with martial dao and qi cultivation practitioners in the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>Since he was creating the method, Xuanhuang would not settle for less, and through self-transcendence deduction, he achieved the limit.</p><p></p><p>Especially after entering the first stage of transcendence, his self-transcendence ability was greatly enhanced. Previously it was three times a day, now he can maintain the self-transcendence state for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Self-transcendence is equivalent to sudden enlightenment, but it is stronger than the state of sudden enlightenment. Sudden enlightenment is still based on the small to comprehend the large, while self-transcendence is the future me nourishing the present me.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after entering the transcendent realm, the self-transcendence state not only lasts longer, but the ability has also been enhanced. If the previous limit was the early-to-mid fourth stage, now it is the late fourth stage.</p><p></p><p>This kind of improvement is difficult, after all, self-transcendence is very rare. The "self-transcendence" that can be further improved already has the characteristics of the "Great Luo" realm.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang speculated that this is related to his spiritual soul, especially that strand of immortal spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation of willpower is so simple, also related to his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>The integration of willpower, essence, qi, and spirit, but if you want to progress quickly, you need to have at least one aspect that is special.</p><p></p><p>You can be powerful in essence, and then quickly catch up the other aspects based on this.</p><p></p><p>In short, you need to have one aspect that exceeds the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's willpower cultivation is so simple, because a powerful spirit has raised the starting point.</p><p></p><p>Just walk in the direction of the spirit, there is no need to find a direction and feel confused.</p><p></p><p>This is very important.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuanhuang attaches great importance to the improvement of his self-transcendence ability. This means that he will not reach the fourth stage and then have no direction.</p><p></p><p>As long as the self-transcendence keeps improving, his future path will be easier.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the limit of his self-transcendence is the level of that strand of immortal spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>That level, Xuanhuang cannot imagine for now, but it must be very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Collecting his mind.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang began to write the "Building Wood Returning to the True Method" and the "Returning to the Void Nine Seal Method", fulfilling his promise.</p><p></p><p>As for the visualization diagrams, this is simple. Just engrave them, engrave them well in the small world, the Heavenly will bestows the spiritual charm, and his own will protects the spiritual charm from distortion.</p><p></p><p>This requires the Building Wood to complete its transformation, now is not the right time to engrave the visualization diagrams.</p><p></p><p>In this way, an extraordinary night passed.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, the rising sun was exceptionally dazzling.</p><p></p><p>At least that's how the people in the martial arts hall saw it, the most beautiful sunrise they had seen in six or seven years.</p>

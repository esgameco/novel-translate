        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How does the Dao companion feel?" </p><p></p><p>In front of the White Bone Pagoda, the crowd was gathered, watching a young cultivator stagger out of the pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The young man's face was pale, drenched in sweat, and even his clothes on the autumn mountain were soaked through.</p><p></p><p>He walked unsteadily, and after exiting the White Bone Pagoda, he looked back at it with lingering fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he was startled by the inquiry of the people guarding the entrance.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly still not fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's fine, it's quite fine!" the young man said, trying to suppress his fear. "Truly worthy of a trial that requires ten points to experience. It was very good inside, and had a great effect on tempering the will. I gained a lot."</p><p></p><p>His words were incoherent, unable to organize his thoughts properly, only saying that the effect was great.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid of being laughed at, not knowing what he had truly experienced. </p><p></p><p>It was a bizarre descent, where his entire body's bones were uncontrollably compressed and ground down.</p><p></p><p>Temper the will? What will? Due to his lack of experience, this time he only suffered and gained nothing. There was no will tempering at all.</p><p></p><p>Once the trial began, he immediately lost control of his own will, how could he possibly temper it?</p><p></p><p>To temper the will, one needs a certain level of willpower to begin with. You must first remain calm and steady your mind. </p><p></p><p>If you panic the moment you enter, you can't accomplish anything, only suffering and gaining nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what a loss!" the young man lamented inwardly.</p><p></p><p>But was it truly a loss?</p><p></p><p>Not entirely, at least he now knows what kind of "being" he is - too inexperienced, his will too weak. </p><p></p><p>Directly uncontrollable, how could he cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>It seems the direction is clear now, he needs to forge his will, at least take the first step, to avoid losing control the moment he enters.</p><p></p><p>"Dao companion, please elaborate..." the crowd asked.</p><p></p><p>"It can only be experienced, not described. Everyone needs to enter the trial themselves. I can only say, those who understand will understand, those who don't, no explanation is needed. I was just in the tower, and just now..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his tone became more aggressive, with a pungent smell, strangely familiar.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't gain anything after entering, you can only say that your efforts over the years were in vain. Why didn't your will grow? Have you ever reflected on your own problems? Complaining that the points are expensive? They are already very cheap! After all these years your will didn't grow, and you can't even exchange for points, it's your own problem, you need to reflect on yourself..."</p><p></p><p>He became even more aggressive, making the crowd feel like hitting him.</p><p></p><p>A burly man asked, "May I ask this Dao companion's honorable name?"</p><p></p><p>The young man said, "I'm afraid to say, in case I'm..."</p><p></p><p>"Hateful, this person, with no experience at all, just rambling nonsense, making me feel like I'm back in the days before the Anomaly's revival, listening to those experts' dogma." the burly man said frustratedly.</p><p></p><p>The others agreed with his words.</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't know? His words are too aggressive. Doesn't he know whether he worked hard or not? I almost died to achieve today's accomplishments, yet he says I didn't work hard. Is it really my problem? I've surpassed so many Dao companions, and this is how it is?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, nothing has changed. We wandering cultivators are still just cannon fodder, even with the Anomaly's revival, we're just the ones enjoying the good life for the big powers. Our individual efforts are too insignificant."</p><p></p><p>"That's why the appearance of Qingyun Mountain is a miracle. I must continue to work hard, I must take on missions, I must earn points, I will definitely rise up."</p><p></p><p>The burly man vowed, then left without looking back, heading to the mission assignment area to see if there were any points he could exchange or suitable missions for himself.</p><p></p><p>"...What's going on over there? This pagoda, how strange, Anomalous forces? But without the sense of chaos?"</p><p></p><p>The newly arrived Xu Ru'one asked the deputy curator High Jian.</p><p></p><p>"Director Xu, this is a trial tower just refined by Master Xuan, entering it can temper the will, it requires points to enter... Possibly someone has entered the trial, and the others are inquiring about the experience."</p><p></p><p>High Jian guessed in his response.</p><p></p><p>"A tower that can temper the will? Master Xuan is truly a scholar of heaven and earth, in such a short time he has created a treasure that can harness the Anomaly's power. If the Anomaly can all be refined into treasures that benefit human progress, that would be a game changer."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ru'one was very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Xuan is indeed a scholar of heaven and earth, it seems there is nothing he cannot do. We who are lucky to follow Master Xuan can only say we are fortunate."</p><p></p><p>High Jian agreed.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the four hall masters of the Pavilion, and the three deputy hall masters under each master, are all exceptional talents personally selected by Master Xuan as one of the ten to be summoned.</p><p></p><p>Only himself, no, and Li Tongni'an as well, feel like they are falling behind.</p><p></p><p>He can only give full play to his other advantages, such as his management skills.</p><p></p><p>Develop his strengths to make up for his lack of cultivation talent.</p><p></p><p>After Xun Hui and the others are summoned, cultivation will be their top priority.</p><p></p><p>The management of Qingyun Mountain will rely on Li Tongni'an, High Jian, Xia Qing and others.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ru'one and High Xiaolan agreed with High Jian's words.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the changes in Qingyun Mountain, they felt curious everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like the Anomaly I control has become dormant after entering Qingyun Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan voiced the doubts of the group.</p><p></p><p>"Did you all see that giant tree?" High Jian pointed to the Tong Tian Building Wood in the Xuanhuang Villa in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I see it. Ah, it looks familiar, isn't this the previous Anomalous corpse tree? I heard it was sealed and taken away by Master Xuan, and its appearance has changed."</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan continued, "Indeed, the previous gloomy and terrifying appearance is gone, replaced by lush greenery. Hmm... and a sense of the cycle of life and death that's hard to describe? Am I seeing things?"</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>"Director High's keen observation is correct! It has indeed been suppressed and transformed by Master Xuan, I heard it has been re-cultivated, becoming something akin to a heavenly spiritual root. This tree is called the Tong Tian Building Wood, named after the mythical Building Wood. This tree can regulate the chaotic spiritual mechanism and remove toxic spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>High Jian explained to the group, "The area within a ten-li radius of Qingyun Mountain is stable and undistorted spiritual energy. This may be the reason why the Anomaly in your bodies has become dormant. The chaos that gives birth to the Anomaly is naturally suppressed here."</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Hearing High Jian's words, the cultivators were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that to be able to act in Qingyun Mountain, one must at least surpass the level of the Building Wood?</p><p></p><p>Those below the Building Wood's level will be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Even if they forcefully erupt their power, they still won't be able to reach their true strength.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan's methods are truly extraordinary, I look forward to the upcoming exchange even more."</p><p></p><p>As a conclusion, Xu Ru'one spoke.</p><p></p><p>His Anomalous heart within him did not become dormant, but rather became particularly active, seemingly disliking this place very much.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Ru'one, with his Anomalous heart, is a Second-Tier Great Expert.</p><p></p><p>The First-Tier peak Building Wood, even with the support of the small world's will, would not be able to suppress the dormant Anomalous heart.</p><p></p><p>The difference between each Tier is heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Master Xuan has been awaiting your arrival, Director Xu."</p><p></p><p>High Jian immediately said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ru'one, full of anticipation, headed towards Xuanhuang's villa.</p><p></p><p>There, Xuanhuang was already waiting at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Director Xu, Dao companions."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd addressed him as Master Xuan, acknowledging his status.</p><p></p><p>"Please come in, everyone."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang turned and gestured, guiding the cultivators into the villa.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were the Lingshi (Spirit Masters), but there were only five of them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi was the director, Gao Xiaolan was the deputy director, and the other three were one-level Lingshi, two men and one woman.</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao did not come, perhaps because he did not dare to. It was said that after returning home yesterday, he was distracted, sighing that he was getting old and planned to step down from the deputy director position.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Starting from yesterday, I have been amazed by the Xuanshi's (Mysterious Master's) true cultivation. I didn't expect to have new gains in just one day. The Xuanshi seems to have endless Dao techniques, which is really dazzling."</p><p></p><p>"You're too kind, you're too kind. Director Xu has steadfastly upheld benevolence and diligently worked for the Southern City..."</p><p></p><p>It started with mutual flattery.</p><p></p><p>After the mutual flattery, the main part began.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi then asked, "I wonder how the Xuanshi views the anomalies?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang replied, "Crises and opportunities coexist. They are both great dangers and rare opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Could the Xuanshi elaborate a bit more? Director Xu has never heard that anomalies are opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded and said, "Why are there crises? I don't need to say much, as everyone knows, just like our current situation."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "As for how the anomalies are formed, I'm sure Director Xu is well aware, so let me talk about the opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"I'm all ears!" Xu Ruyi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Since they were being open, Xuanhuang also did not hold back: "The so-called opportunities are what I discovered after transcending the mundane. For example, the Heavenly Tree that Director Xu saw, and the White Bone Pagoda, these are what I call opportunities. If you can truly suppress the anomalies and turn them into treasures, the anomalies will become rare treasures."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Ruyi looked at the Heavenly Tree in the courtyard and nodded in agreement. However, he said, "The Xuanshi's methods are profound and can turn waste into treasure, but for the common people, it is a disaster. I wonder if the Xuanshi has any advice?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't dare to give advice, but let me share some experiences..." Xuanhuang said, "There may be some unpleasant words, I'm not sure if I should say them or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead and say them!" Xu Ruyi replied.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded and said, "Controlling the Lingshi (Spirit Masters) is an unavoidable method, but it is a very unsatisfactory way of dealing with it. This is not to criticize, nor to forget the previous protection of the Lingshi, but to state the facts objectively."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi did not get angry and said, "This can be said, I know the Xuanshi does not mean it that way. Please continue."</p><p></p><p>"Good." Xuanhuang continued, "Controlling the anomalies is a means, but it cannot become the mainstream approach, as the pros and cons are too obvious. In the past, there was no other choice but to use this last-resort strategy for self-preservation, but now there is a new situation. I dare not say that the method I created can save the world, but it is a new attempt... including the Lingshi."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi seemed to have grasped the key point.</p><p></p><p>He tentatively asked, "Xuanshi, what did you mean by the last sentence, 'including us'?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled and said, "It's a matter of luck. Yesterday, when I was refining the artifact, I fortunately made some gains. Director Xu, take a look at this bead."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took out a bumpy glass bead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi solemnly took it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As he touched and tested it, he suddenly discovered the wondrous power.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual soul... no, the spiritual soul that was invaded by the anomaly has actually been absorbed by it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xu Ruyi's words, the other four members of the Exorcism Department, who had been silent listeners, suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Director Xu is right. This bead does have that ability."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang affirmed. He then said, "Coincidentally, the treasure used to refine the bead was found by Jia Zhengyi's assassin Qi Long. After I refined it, it gained this new ability."</p><p></p><p>This statement made the members of the Exorcism Department a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, after returning, they had carried out a rectification campaign and severely struck at the remnants left by Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>Many of the former high-level members of Jia Zhengyi's faction had been greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, please try it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not dwell on it and quickly changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi also passed the glass bead to the other four.</p><p></p><p>The four of them tried it one by one, and the anomalies suppressed by the Heavenly Tree were almost unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>So the spiritual souls invaded by the anomalies were easily absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The four of them suddenly felt a sense of lightness.</p><p></p><p>Their distorted spiritual souls, which had been invaded by the anomalies, could not be eliminated before, and could only watch as the distorted spiritual souls grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Now the hidden ailment was gone, and they felt refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since they had felt this relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Ever since they had merged with the anomalies, they had been constantly on guard, fearing that they would be invaded by the anomalies and lose control, or even directly turn into anomalies.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi, I have discovered a new way of cooperation for us."</p><p></p><p>The excited Xu Ruyi said to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"If I can help adjust the spiritual souls of the Lingshi that have been invaded by the anomalies, I promise that any Lingshi who feels pressured can come here to cleanse their distorted spiritual souls."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang naturally agreed, as this was his plan from yesterday.</p><p></p><p>After everyone took turns experimenting, the bumpy bead had already restored its original appearance.</p><p></p><p>The Returning Void Great Grindstone could continue to be used.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really true?" </p><p></p><p>The members of the Exorcism Department exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. You all can see the bead." Xuanhuang smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"How did it become as smooth as jade? It was bumpy just now."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "It's also beneficial to me. This bead can be restored by relying on the distorted spiritual souls, so we are both winners."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was open and straightforward, and he did not hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi smiled, also feeling that Xuanhuang was a straightforward and upright man worthy of deep friendship.</p><p></p><p>"Since you are all satisfied, let me tell you something else that will make you happy." Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi had not been this happy for a long time, as if Xuanhuang's presence could dispel his worries.</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, Xuanshi."</p><p></p><p>The remaining four also changed their attitude, becoming more respectful.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "As I mentioned earlier, there is actually a chance for the Lingshi to be saved, but I can't guarantee it."</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The group had just sat down, but upon hearing this, they quickly stood up again.</p><p></p><p>This was at least the nth time they had been excited.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Xuanhuang's demonstrations had shocked the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio, making their heads ache.</p><p></p><p>It seemed history was repeating itself, and today the shocked Lingshi couldn't even sit still.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to stand and listen, so they wouldn't have to keep standing up in excitement.</p><p></p><p>"If there were Lingshi who regretted it and wanted to abandon the anomalies, what would happen if they did so?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Xu Ruyi thought for a while and said, "They would die."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded and asked again, "What if the abandoned anomalies were immediately sealed?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi said again, "They would still die without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Xuanhuang asked, "Is it because after merging with the anomalies, they formed a 'summoning anomaly constitution', so any anomalies that appear will be drawn to them?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

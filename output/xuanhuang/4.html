        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhang, immediately contact the Dao Cultivators and Immortal Cultivators, we need them to stabilize the spiritual minds."</p><p></p><p>"Old Sun, contact the hospital, quickly."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xuanhuang arrived at the martial arts hall, he noticed the busy and noisy scene.</p><p></p><p>He saw two bloodied martial artists being carried out of an armored business vehicle, their agonizing cries and broken bodies.</p><p></p><p>The one who summoned them was the deputy hall master, a high-level martial arts master, with a full beard on his face.</p><p></p><p>Then, a middle-aged and a young man got out of another vehicle. </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang could sense a dangerous aura from them even from afar.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's gaze flickered as he perceived that these two were Illusionist Spiritual Masters.</p><p></p><p>They were like walking black holes, not as powerful as the millstone in the small courtyard, but with a similar quality.</p><p></p><p>The two were pale-faced, wearing long robes, and the young man was holding a black leather suitcase.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Liu, what happened?" Xuanhuang asked the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Xuanhuang, you're all better now?" Liu Jinquan saw it was Xuanhuang, then suddenly said, "No, wait, you've broken through to the Martial Artist realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"Well done, well done." </p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan looked Xuanhuang over and said, "I heard a few days ago that you had to leave the martial arts hall for health reasons, and I was going to come check on you, but I've been so busy lately that I didn't get the chance. Unexpectedly, you've had a reversal of fortune and broken through."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Liu was a man of the occasion, speaking warmly.</p><p></p><p>"Two days ago, a fierce beast rushed into the city and injured people. We mobilized Martial Artists to deal with it, but unexpectedly, a spatial rift appeared in the beast's lair. Inside, there was a mysterious Earthbound Spiritual Existence, so the martial arts hall contacted Spiritual Masters, thinking they could resolve it, but... as you can see, one died and two were seriously injured, and the mystery remains unsolved."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of mystery?" </p><p></p><p>After hearing Liu Jinquan's words, Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"According to the two Spiritual Masters, it's a Blood Pool. A group of wild boars accidentally entered and drank the blood, and strangely, not only did they not die from the Blood Pool's mystery, but they actually evolved into fierce beasts, like puppets constantly seeking living beings for the Blood Pool, very ominous."</p><p></p><p>"What level of mystery is it?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan frowned and said, "They say it's a D-Rank Township-level mystery. The two Spiritual Masters are also D-Rank, so they should have been able to seal it, but it seems there's a secret realm space enhancement."</p><p></p><p>(Mysteries are ranked from D to A, with D-Rank being township-level disasters, C-Rank being county-level, B-Rank being city-level, and A-Rank being provincial-level disasters. The person who divided them up must know a lot, similar to Xuanhuang's Transcendent, Second, Third, and Fourth Realms.)</p><p></p><p>"A Blood Pool mystery, or an Earthbound Spiritual mystery, it's not too bad." Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Earthbound Spiritual one is manageable, it's the ones that roam between cities that are worrying." Liu Jinquan agreed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the terrifying ones are the ones that can kill you while you're listening to the radio, replying to a text message, putting on shoes, washing your hair, or even just walking and suddenly turning around.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xuan?" Liu Jinquan suddenly stepped closer and lowered his voice, "You've become a Martial Artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Liu, could you give me some advice?"</p><p></p><p>"As a Martial Artist, you'll need to go to the frontlines against the mysteries. Normally you wouldn't need to right after your breakthrough, so the losses are a bit heavy. Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang let out a sigh of relief, thinking there was a big problem, but Liu Jinquan just said, "But it's no trouble. For now, we still have a certain level of safety, thanks to the sacrifices of the Spiritual Masters, Martial Masters, and Immortal Masters. My personal resolve is quite high."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's good to hear. Every time is a fight for survival." Liu Jinquan suddenly became melancholic, "I've heard the news that the connections between our province's cities may not last much longer, a great disaster is coming."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Liu, are you trying to scare me?" Xuanhuang expressed shock.</p><p></p><p>"Six years, and it's been difficult to maintain. But for now, the lockdown only applies to ordinary people leaving the cities, Martial Masters and Immortal Masters can still travel for disaster relief."</p><p></p><p>"It has indeed been difficult, Uncle Liu..." Xuanhuang said, "You go ahead and take care of your business, I'll go register my Martial Artist identity and collect my resources."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go on. I should say - the resources given to Martial Artist breakthroughs are quite good. You poor thing, without family or wealth, at least the money won't be a problem. Also, hurry up and move from your little courtyard house to the inner city, the outskirts are unsafe with sparse population."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Uncle Liu, I'll look into it these next few days."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xuanhuang and Liu Jinquan waved goodbye, and Xuanhuang headed towards the martial arts hall entrance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So, this is the Martial Artist realm?"</p><p></p><p>Through his conversation with Liu Jinquan, Xuanhuang not only gathered information, but also sensed Liu Jinquan's will.</p><p></p><p>He found it to be like a hazy mist, without any signs of cohesion.</p><p></p><p>What is will? It's actually quite difficult to describe directly. It is the integration of vital energy and spirit, and the term "information flow" seems to fit it well.</p><p></p><p>"Refine, refine, first forge, then condense. No other method, only the crucible to refine the golden body, and hardship to temper the will."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's breakthrough should have been a cause for celebration by the martial arts hall members, a display of the hall's growth and development.</p><p></p><p>But today was not quite appropriate. When the hall master, Sun Hui, learned of it, he first smiled warmly and congratulated Xuanhuang, then his expression became serious as he urged Xuanhuang to continue striving, for the young man had great potential.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Sun Hui summoned the manager and led Xuanhuang to receive the Martial Artist's resources.</p><p></p><p>A bottle of high-grade Revitalizing Elixir, a great aid for the martial path, an ancient product of the small world, but scientifically mass-produced, its effects even more enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"What weapon do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>The manager Huang brought Xuanhuang to the weapon distribution center, where there were all kinds of weapons on display.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, a two-meter long saber?" Xuanhuang had already decided what he wanted before coming.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose today was not the resources after a cultivator's breakthrough, but to observe the differences between cultivators, in order to correspond to his own deduced cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, do you have one that's 1.9 meters? That should suit you well, after all, an inch longer is an inch stronger."</p><p></p><p>"No, only 1.88 meters."</p><p></p><p>"Close enough." Manager Huang smiled: "I'll also get you some firearms later. Leave your bank card here, you'll get a 30,000 monthly subsidy, and you can download the APP to exchange task points... and then this and that..."</p><p></p><p>In half an hour, under Manager Huang's guidance, Xuanhuang officially became a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In short, it was about responsibilities and benefits.</p><p></p><p>He would start by participating in handling beast incidents for a month, and then based on his performance, he might be able to participate in mysterious events and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>After registering and verifying on the "Daxia Town Anomaly APP", Xuanhuang thought: This thing is an APP software, but why does it feel so mysterious?</p><p></p><p>"Wow, your eyes have been opened. Suspected A-rank disaster 'Nightmare World', suspected A-rank disaster 'Sea of Suffering', suspected A-rank disaster 'Abyss of Desire', suspected A-rank disaster 'Sea of Blood', suspected A-rank disaster 'Realm of Nether Flames', suspected A-rank disaster 'Underworld'."</p><p></p><p>"How is it, quite shocking, right? Six suspected A-rank disasters."</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang asked after seeing Xuanhuang open the Daxia Town Anomaly app.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed shocking, I didn't expect there to be so many A-rank ones."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Xuanhuang was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>This A-rank was the highest point he had deduced for himself.</p><p></p><p>At the Fourth Realm, no matter what, he already possessed spirituality.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's soul had traversed the chaos, possessing two major characteristics: a white spiritual nature and a trace of golden immortal nature.</p><p></p><p>The white spiritual nature was the highest he could currently deduce for himself.</p><p></p><p>The golden immortal nature should be even higher, but he currently lacked the ability to deduce it.</p><p></p><p>"You see the 'suspected', right? It's 'suspected'..."</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"What does that mean, higher or lower?"</p><p></p><p>"Conservatively estimated to be at least A-rank, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't it be specified?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang shook his head: "This is still calculated by the high-level experts who have combined the Martial Dao small world and the Immortal Dao small world. In their worlds, there were A-rank existences before the anomalies invaded, their understanding of A-rank is at the limit, so they don't dare to confirm how much higher it is."</p><p></p><p>"The small worlds have such high-level experts?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang found that his previous self was ultimately too low-level and knew too little.</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang said, "You are now a cultivator, there are many things I don't say, but you can also find out. The Immortal Dao and Martial Dao small worlds are currently larger in area than our Blue Star. Calling them 'small worlds' is in comparison to the entire universe, and they are only a broken corner of their former worlds."</p><p></p><p>"So you mean... the Immortal Dao small world and the Martial Dao small world were once parts of their broken worlds, and we have discovered and established communication with them?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, they say the Martial Dao small world was once called the Qingzhou Wudomain, and the Immortal Dao small world was the Dawind Country Immortal Sect, and they say there are still many other realms around them, and the broken world they have now is only half the area of their Wind Country."</p><p></p><p>"They won't be backward regions, will they?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had a bad feeling about this.</p><p></p><p>These two places, they won't be the newbie villages of their worlds, will they?</p><p></p><p>"Not to that extent, I heard the Martial Dao small world is a relatively prosperous region. But the Immortal Dao small world is not the case, their Wind Country Immortal Sect is considered a top-tier sect there."</p><p></p><p>"That's not simple either, a middle-level region has records of A-rank existences?"</p><p></p><p>"We call them A-rank, they call them Martial Saints or Immortal Dao Transcendents. But for now, it's just records and legends, we don't know what happened after the world broke apart."</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang finished speaking.</p><p></p><p>He then said regretfully, "Now, not to mention A-rank, their D-rank, C-rank, and B-rank have all gone out of control, the dead are dead, and the fortunate ones with strong foundations have been sealed up, equivalent to being crippled. It's better than us who have control over powerful firearms."</p><p></p><p>"It's just so absurd!" Xuanhuang exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>If these powerful experts were still intact, although they were not from the same world as us, but facing the common enemy of the anomalies, the Blue Star would not have been so miserable.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Huang, did we discover them, or did they discover us?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Manager Huang smiled: "I understand your meaning. It was us who discovered them and opened the rift entrance. Our Blue Star is small, but in terms of the fusion of the myriad realms, it is other worlds that are merging into our universe, not us relying on them."</p><p></p><p>He also said, "Or perhaps it was originally the same universe, but with different dimensions. But no matter what, we are currently the main universe."</p><p></p><p>"Danger and opportunity?" Xuanhuang thought.</p><p></p><p>"The 'danger' is that we are the main force, so the collision and invasion of the myriad realms into the main universe... The 'opportunity' is how to rise against the tide, facing this era of destruction and rebirth."</p><p></p><p>"Little Xuan... you're thinking... well, too far ahead."</p><p></p><p>Manager Huang expressed that he didn't quite understand, but was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Wow, this young man is already calculating how to rise against the tide, too optimistic.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

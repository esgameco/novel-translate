        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The identity of a martial artist is just different. While he was communicating with Manager Huang, he was notified that a meeting was being called.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang and Manager Huang Daye came to the spacious training hall.</p><p></p><p>Many people had already arrived by the time they got there.</p><p></p><p>Around 40-50 people, mostly martial artists and management personnel.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists start their cultivation by refining their bodies, so at a glance, anyone above the martial artist level was at least 1.8 meters tall, all big people.</p><p></p><p>Their auras were surging, and as soon as Xuanhuang entered, the hot air hit him in the face.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was very solemn.</p><p></p><p>No one was chatting, those who recognized each other just nodded. Xuanhuang had been studying at the martial arts hall for over 3 years and was familiar with most of the faces.</p><p></p><p>"Let me briefly explain, first of all..." </p><p></p><p>After everyone was seated, the hall master Sun Hui said: "Congratulations to Xuanhuang for becoming a martial artist, we have successors, humanity will surely endure, and the martial dao will surely flourish."</p><p></p><p>"Applause..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd applauded in congratulations. Xuanhuang didn't expect it to be about him, so he stood up and expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, upon achieving the martial artist realm, there would be a celebration ceremony in the hall, but the situation has become very serious lately, I'm sorry little Xuan, the hall will compensate you in other ways."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xuanhuang shook his head, indicating that he didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>"The second point, I'm sure everyone knows, last night in the operation we lost another comrade-in-arms..."</p><p></p><p>"In the past six years, I'm sure everyone has gotten used to it... we can't be defeated by sorrow, we still face a cruel environment and need to go to the front lines..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of grief for the fallen comrade, there was a rallying cry. Everyone was already used to it, what month didn't they lose a comrade? "The Blood Pool anomaly incident has temporarily resolved the wild boar horde, but the Blood Pool secret realm has not been resolved. It is known that this place can catalyze fierce beasts and has a fatal attraction to wild beasts. Before we can completely seal the Blood Pool secret realm, we need manpower to guard it."</p><p></p><p>"Take a look at the video."</p><p></p><p>The big screen then began to play a video.</p><p></p><p>What came into view was a bloody battle, led by the deputy hall master Wu Gang with heavy weapons and cold weapons, quickly eliminating the wild boar horde.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, something happened.</p><p></p><p>Those battered wild boar horde seemed to be like zombies, they should have been dead but suddenly launched an attack, resulting in casualties among the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Then on the big screen, two spirit masters tried to seal the Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged spirit master vomited ink-like smoke, controlling the ominous black smoke.</p><p></p><p>The young spirit master had a blood-red maw appear in his palm, and with the devouring sound of the blood maw, the enclosed Blood Pool seemed to have its space frozen.</p><p></p><p>At first, a thread of blood was powerfully sucked into the blood maw.</p><p></p><p>Then the Blood Pool began to become agitated.</p><p></p><p>With a 'boom', the Blood Pool's bloody aura permeated.</p><p></p><p>'Crack', the space frozen by the blood maw shattered.</p><p></p><p>In the video, the young spirit master retreated a few steps, almost unable to stand, then broke out in a cold sweat, breathing heavily, and his body trembling.</p><p></p><p>Due to the loud noise, the crowd only saw the young spirit master shouting, while the middle-aged spirit master's ominous black smoke began to assimilate the Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>The video shook and abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom!" </p><p></p><p>The hall master knocked on the table to get everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Even with the two spirit masters working together, they couldn't seal the Blood Pool. That secret realm must be integrated with the Blood Pool, it's a very difficult secret realm to deal with. In short, to suppress the Blood Pool, we need to suppress the entire secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"This would require at least a second-rank spirit master to go all out, which is not advisable. We can't sacrifice a second-rank spirit master to seal the Blood Pool, especially in this terrible situation. We can only temporarily guard it, and the two spirit masters have also contacted the higher-ups to see if the Daiyue headquarters can provide some support."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui shook his head again: "But it's difficult, the headquarters won't pay the price of a second-rank spirit master's injury and death to seal the Blood Pool anomaly. For now, we can only guard it and not let it continue to grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's knowledge, the strongest spirit masters in the Great Xia Empire right now are only third-rank.</p><p></p><p>Daiyue is a major province, and the provincial headquarters has a third-rank spirit master, who is one of the five known in the entire Great Xia Empire.</p><p></p><p>Spirit masters controlling spirits is extremely dangerous, they are a walking disaster.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Through powerful spiritual force, we maintain a fragile balance.</p><p></p><p>The human body itself is a small magnetic field, and each person's magnetic field is different due to differences in height, weight, thoughts, behaviors, and the strength of their spirit and soul. </p><p></p><p>It's similar to the concept of spiritual roots in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Just because he's a little chubby, his magnetic field can better absorb spiritual energy. Just because your thoughts are a bit gloomy, your magnetic field cannot resonate with spiritual energy, so you are a useless person without spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>The spirit-controlling cultivators are the same - some people's magnetic fields can resonate with the anomalies, so they can control the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>But to say "control" is not quite accurate - the key is the ability to resonate.</p><p></p><p>It's through this weak balance that they control the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>But the anomalies are constantly changing a spirit-controlling cultivator's body and spirit, and this is the key to breaking the balance.</p><p></p><p>Unless you don't control the anomalies, but enslave them.</p><p></p><p>This is also the cultivation method proposed by the Xuanhuang sect - use a powerful will to enslave the anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Make the anomalies adapt to your changes, rather than forcibly adapting to the anomalies, which will cause a collapse if you're not careful.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of spirit-controlling cultivators is even more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>There are two methods:</p><p>1. Devour anomalies of the same source to strengthen the rule fragments.</p><p>2. Control two different anomalies that repel each other, creating a synergistic effect, just like two magnets are different when brought close together.</p><p></p><p>However, the second method is more dangerous. Controlling one anomaly requires an extremely delicate balance, let alone two - the difficulty increases exponentially.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, it's difficult to spare manpower now. The brothers who have reached the Warrior realm already have several tasks on hand," said the Vice Pavilion Master responsible for task assignment, after hearing the Pavilion Master's request to guard the Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>At this time...</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, how about this - I just advanced to the Warrior realm, and this task doesn't involve going into the Blood Pool Forbidden Land, so it's not too dangerous, just guarding against wild beasts wandering in. I can take on this task," Xuanhuang suddenly stood up and said to the group.</p><p></p><p>"This...?" </p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master and Vice Pavilion Masters hesitated, scrutinizing Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang currently needs a lot of blood and essence, and the Blood Pool Forbidden Land is very suitable for him.</p><p>It can even attract and transform wild beasts into treasures.</p><p></p><p>Not only are the beasts valuable, but the Blood Pool itself is no simple matter.</p><p>The Blood Pool is filled with chaotic spiritual energy and tainted, violent desires.</p><p></p><p>Going through the "Return to Void Technique", then the "Heaven and Earth Technique" to refine the chaotic spiritual energy, and finally the "Smelting Technique" to purify the blood qi - a complete process.</p><p></p><p>And if he encounters danger, can't he just retreat to the Grinding Wheel space?</p><p>Compared to the Grinding Wheel's anomalies, the Blood Pool is far less threatening.</p><p></p><p>The burly Warrior Vice Pavilion Master said, "Are you sure about this? You just entered the Warrior realm, and there's a period of adaptation needed. You don't have to guard the Blood Pool."</p><p></p><p>"I've considered it carefully," Xuanhuang replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui looked at Xuanhuang gravely: "At most 10 days, I'll contact the headquarters as soon as possible to resolve this. Even if I can't, I'll arrange a replacement for you within 10 days."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui had decided - there was simply no one else available.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded in acknowledgement. </p><p>It was clear they were really short-handed. Although there were still the Dao Pavilion and the army, this task was clearly assigned to the Martial Pavilion.</p><p>Moreover, the army and Dao Pavilion were just as understaffed.</p><p></p><p>It had been six years since the anomaly invasion first resurfaced. In these six years, too many soldiers, martial artists, and immortal cultivators had perished, and the anomalies had proliferated.</p><p>Each city was basically self-reliant for defense.</p><p>Requesting reinforcements from the provincial headquarters? </p><p>That was basically impossible, unless it was a city-destroying crisis - the provincial headquarters faced even greater challenges.</p><p></p><p>In short, the current situation was that each city's people were responsible for defending their own city, like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as Daoist Priest Ma was about to leave with his abundant harvest, Xuanhuang stopped him.</p><p></p><p>As a reward for the information, Xuanhuang gave Daoist Priest Ma two one-meter-square storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to sell the one-meter-square storage bags for 100 points, the five-meter-square bracers and belts for 500 points, and the ten-meter-square storage rings for 1000 points.</p><p></p><p>Selling these as auxiliary tools would also provide some motivation for the cultivators on Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>By diligently earning points, they could exchange them for storage bags. Xuanhuang would also sell some talismans and even self-refined magical artifacts in the future.</p><p></p><p>The prices for the storage spaces were not too high and would be gradually adjusted according to the market.</p><p></p><p>But starting at 100 points, almost no one could afford it currently.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who had points would first exchange them for the Contemplation Diagram, which required constant contemplation and long-term points.</p><p></p><p>The second choice would definitely be the Trial Tower, where cultivation level was the key.</p><p></p><p>Without cultivation, other things would be useless, including the storage bags.</p><p></p><p>So the one-meter-square storage bag priced at 100 points was considered quite high.</p><p></p><p>Only the truly wealthy would choose to purchase it.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Priest Ma took the bags in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"These are the storage bags I refined, with an internal space of one meter square. As a reward for the information, take them and go."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, gesturing for him to leave.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Priest Ma left joyfully with the two storage bags, one for himself and one to give to his disciple Gao Jue.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then summoned Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>"This is for you, a storage bag with an area of one meter square. Use it for now... When you have fully comprehended the Contemplation Diagram, you'll be able to easily use this ring, which is ten meters square. The price for this is... You can pay it at the Virtue Hall. The specific usage method is to imprint it with your blood, and then..."</p><p></p><p>As an assistant, Xuanhuang was not stingy, giving Sun Tong two bags - a temporary one-meter-square bag and a future ten-meter-square bag that she could use after fully comprehending the Contemplation Diagram.</p><p></p><p>Currently, she couldn't use the good one even if given, as her cultivation was too low.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Xuan," Sun Tong said happily as she received them.</p><p></p><p>It was actually storage space, and he had given her two, one she could use now and one for the future.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuan was so good to her. Should she express her gratitude somehow?</p><p></p><p>Her eyes flashed with emotion...</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there, no need for that now. Go back to work," Xuanhuang said, his senses too keen to miss her subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was 21 years old, tall and graceful, with elegant and refined manners. Her black hair and jade-like skin, along with her beautiful eyes and charming demeanor, made her resemble a blooming rose - passionate yet not wanton, alluring yet not vulgar, with a full and slender figure.</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang first saw her, he was at a loss for words, overwhelmed by her beauty. After more interaction, he formed a vivid mental image of her.</p><p></p><p>"Tch!" Sun Tong let out a coy hum, perhaps displeased with her own sudden emotions or Xuanhuang's tone.</p><p></p><p>Her face flushed red as she took the items and left.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shook his head and disappeared from Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we should take action, but it can't be unorganized. If it's unorganized, we might suffer significant losses," said the Taoist-looking man.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Daoist, why don't you join a Daoist sect? Aren't you a Daoist?" someone asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist replied, "My cultivation is not high, and my aptitude is not exceptional, so I didn't join a Daoist sect. Being an unaffiliated cultivator is fine too. We all seek the Dao, and there's no need to join a powerful faction. The complexities of a large sect don't suit my temperament."</p><p></p><p>Likely, he had some hidden troubles or was dissatisfied with the current state of Daoist sects.</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Large factions have both advantages and disadvantages, and they are not the only choice. Master Xuan has personally allocated two-tenths of the enlightenment quotas to us unaffiliated cultivators, dividing them equally with the other four factions. Master Xuan's actions have always been far-sighted."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, indeed, this is the aspect I'm most grateful to Master Xuan for - achieving relative fairness."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The young man was puzzled. "Isn't it absolute fairness? One-fifth is very fair, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"This young man?" The elder Daoist rubbed his forehead and frowned. "If you don't understand, don't speak. Just listen carefully. No one is treating you as a mute."</p><p></p><p>The youth felt hurt. "Didn't I say it correctly?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Everyone burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, absolute fairness is actually the most unfair. There's no such thing as absolute fairness. Relative fairness is the greatest fairness. If it's already absolute, where's the fairness in that? Haha..."</p><p></p><p>The youth: ...</p><p></p><p>Without further addressing the youth's dissatisfaction, everyone remained calm. After all, they had all been young once and would gradually understand.</p><p></p><p>They then discussed and organized themselves, finding like-minded companions to follow Master Xuan's aspirations and venture into the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>At the Merits Hall (previously called the Exchange Hall, but recently renamed), the enthusiastic Sun Hui brought two large carts full of beast corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Convert all of this into points."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The receptionist was a woman.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the entire Merits Hall was controlled by a dozen or so women.</p><p></p><p>They were all people under Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>The points exchange system had just been established and was not yet fully formed, but its direction was certain - all the points would go to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was the source of all exchanges, while the remaining four factions each had their own internal points exchange centers.</p><p></p><p>The four factions and the unaffiliated cultivators would contribute and exchange for the qualifications to obtain enlightenment visualization diagrams, trial tower access, talisman materials, and the right to borrow the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the points could only be managed by Xuanhuang. Since Xuanhuang was too busy, they had entrusted it to Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong had gathered a group of sisters, making the Qingyun Mountain the wealthiest place. Privately, some had already started calling them "rich ladies" or, more elegantly, "Merits Goddesses."</p><p></p><p>They were all wealthy ladies in charge of merits and wealth.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Sun Tong had also been organizing and formulating regulations, gradually streamlining the procedures, drafting various mandatory rules, and many other documents.</p><p></p><p>Still in the establishment stage, it was a bit rough, but the overall direction was correct.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Sun, do you want to take a look at the new treasures?" Summer Qing asked after the points were exchanged.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the former deputy director of the Southern City Daoist Hall, Summer Qing, had been recruited by Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>The Southern City Daoist Hall was delighted to see Summer Qing leave. It was like Goldman Sachs happily sending off their president to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve.</p><p></p><p>Officially, she no longer belonged to the Daoist Hall, but the friendship remained, right? Of course, the Merits Hall's staff salaries would now be managed by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>According to the ladies here, they were eating Master Xuan's food.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Manager Qing, please go on." Sun Hui was puzzled. "Little Li, bring out the storage talismans for Manager Sun to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Little Li, also known as Li Li, was the previously bizarre protagonist.</p><p></p><p>She had been too afraid to go home, staying at the martial arts hall for a few days, and then became familiar with Sun Tong, eventually joining the hall.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Li's martial arts aptitude was not high, her spiritual cultivation aptitude was decent.</p><p></p><p>She was now a novice spiritual cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she didn't quite fit in with the martial arts hall, but after Sun Tong called her to the Merits Hall, everything fell into place, and she could cultivate anything.</p><p></p><p>In short, the Merits Hall was full of familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong and her ladies were really taking advantage of their power!</p><p></p><p>Technically speaking, the sealed rooms for hanging enlightenment visualization diagrams and the guardianship of the White Bone Treasure Pagoda should also be managed by the Merits Hall.</p><p></p><p>To maintain separation from the four factions, those factions would need to use points to enter the meditation or trial areas.</p><p></p><p>But currently, the Merits Hall was just established and understaffed, so they had temporarily allowed the four factions to jointly manage those areas.</p><p></p><p>They would gradually take them back over time.</p><p></p><p>The four factions also agreed that it would be better to have clear regulations, as they feared chaos.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that Qingyun Mountain was changing too quickly. Previously, the Martial Arts Hall had controlled everything, but with the gathering of the other three factions and the unaffiliated cultivators, it was no longer appropriate for the Martial Arts Hall to have sole control.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention they had even changed their name to the Martial Dao Alliance, becoming a new power.</p><p></p><p>Some fundamental aspects needed to be personally controlled by Xuanhuang, so that the four factions and the unaffiliated cultivators would be willing to accept it.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, Sun Tong had not yet reached the maximum expansion of her power and still needed to recruit more people to become Xuanhuang's grand manager.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Storage talismans?" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this term, Sun Hui and the others were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>As Li Li brought out the storage bags, belts, bracers, and rings, they understood.</p><p></p><p>"This one has an internal space of ten meters by ten meters, this one is five meters by five meters, and this one is one meter... Master Xuan has bestowed them, and the prices are not set too high - 1,000 points, 500 points, 100 points... Manager Sun, the mighty Martial Dao Alliance needs these treasures, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>These were indeed storage talismans, personally forged by Master Xuan.</p><p></p><p>But they were a bit expensive.</p><p></p><p>Although, compared to the entire Martial Dao Alliance, they weren't that expensive. But the Martial Dao Alliance earned a lot and also spent a lot, so those who weren't in charge didn't know how precious the points were.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Qing, we need to discuss this back at the hall. Could you please reserve them for us for a while? We'll decide quickly," Sun Hui said, looking troubled.</p><p></p><p>Summer Qing had a somewhat helpless expression. "Manager Sun, I must be honest with you. I can't easily reserve these treasures for the Martial Dao Alliance, who knows if they'll be sold out quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Summer Qing said, "But since we're all familiar, I trust the Martial Dao Alliance and I trust you, Manager Sun. I can reserve them for you temporarily, but don't take too long."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, thank you, Manager Qing. We'll decide quickly."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui then quickly led the group away.</p><p></p><p>As they left, the news spread instantly, alarming the Daoist, Confucian, and Buddhist sects, as well as the wealthy unaffiliated cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Merits Hall was suddenly bustling with people. Storage treasures were something they had only seen in books, and now they were seeing the real ones forged by Master Xuan for the first time. They were incredibly rare.</p><p></p><p>Whether they had the points or not, they just wanted to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the major factions had already ventured into the wilderness, or else there would have been even more people.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

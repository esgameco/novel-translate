        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Xuanhuang's group, the arrival became even more mysterious outside the strange Fulin community.</p><p></p><p>However, it was the deception of the human heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was not the time to reminisce and greet each other, even if Daoist priest Li Tongnian and Master Ma wanted to talk to Xuanhuang, it would be a matter for later.</p><p></p><p>The few people just nodded to each other in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang intentionally probed a bit, Li Tongnian... passed, Master Ma was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>This person is undoubtedly one of the two greatest oddities in the southern city. Although he has not broken through to the extraordinary, his will is not weak, and he has reached the level of three layers of refined will.</p><p></p><p>Does he not have the will to refine the law, but relies solely on the grinding of time and spirit?</p><p></p><p>This person is simply lacking an opportunity. As long as he has the right method, he will be able to impact the extraordinary level in no time.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang secretly affirmed this person.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma only felt a powerful aura sweep over him, as if he had been seen through?</p><p></p><p>Why is it "as if"?</p><p></p><p>It's because he's not sure about the effect of this aura, whether it's just a leakage of aura or something else?</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to stop it, he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, not simple." Master Ma thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"You all wait here." Xuanhuang said to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Everyone else couldn't be of any help. The mysterious tree's indiscriminate attacks would absorb the vitality of anyone who entered the range of the mysterious rules. Entering without protection would only be suicide. It would also increase its strength, so it was not an option.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The people from the martial arts hall nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Watching Xuanhuang slowly enter the warning line.</p><p></p><p>Once inside the warning line, Xuanhuang suddenly felt a suction force coming, but under the protection of his will, this suction force failed to take effect. Then Xuanhuang disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was in front of a giant tree about 50 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>This place was like hell, dark and deathly silent, with dense bloodstains covering the surrounding floors, which had been eroded like ghosts.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicable and tragic howls occasionally came.</p><p></p><p>Countless corpses were hanging on the tree, half human and half animal. There were nearly a hundred human corpses alone, and it was unknown how the tree could support such a weight.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>With Xuanhuang's appearance, the hanging corpses on the tree became restless. They fell to the ground, some crawling, some walking, surging towards Xuanhuang like a sea of blood and corpses.</p><p></p><p>In the area closer to the corpse tree, the suction force became even greater, already reaching the limit of what Xuanhuang could bear. This undoubtedly meant that the corpse tree was at the first-level limit.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, these little tricks won't work."</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-Earth Crucible and the Returning Abyss Grinder appeared.</p><p></p><p>One rumbled and rotated, absorbing and sweeping away the countless remnant souls, evil thoughts, and desires around it.</p><p></p><p>The puppet corpses that were invincible and fearless of life and death in the eyes of normal humans were of no use against the Heavenly-Earth Crucible.</p><p></p><p>The lid of the Heavenly-Earth Crucible flew up, and the furnace mouth devoured everything, whether human puppet corpses or animal puppet corpses, swallowing them up quickly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll cut you!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was not idle either.</p><p></p><p>The first appearance of the first-level Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Xuanhuang's 100,000 kilograms of mighty force, it struck the mysterious corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>In the battle with the corpse tree, Xuanhuang faced no perilous situation.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mysterious corpse tree's death-dealing ability could not affect him, then the mysterious corpse tree was just a lamb awaiting slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious corpse tree was at the first-level limit, while Xuanhuang was unrivaled at the first level, the difference was huge.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The huge corpse tree trembled violently, with the 100,000 kilograms of mighty force, the dissolution of the Void Saber, the enhancement of will, and the aura of the Saber Intent all overlapping.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Department wanted to test him, did they?</p><p></p><p>Then let them see what true strength is.</p><p></p><p>What is called unrivaled at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't fear trouble, but he disliked trouble. Being led by the nose was not his style.</p><p></p><p>Pushing forward and asking if you submit or not, that was his style.</p><p></p><p>So preserving strength was out of the question, he directly resolved the mysterious corpse tree, shocking the petty thieves!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The souls of the mysterious corpse tree were shaken out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only to see that after being attacked by Xuanhuang, the entire tree body emanated a thick aura of death.</p><p></p><p>This death aura erodes vitality, corrodes all things, and is bitterly cold! "Go back!"</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The space trembled.</p><p></p><p>The ominous corpse tree that was about to spread the death aura was stopped by a transformative energy.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the death aura congealed, but even time and space were congealed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang activated the domain of the will of the small world: - the domain! Everything enveloped by the domain, as long as they cannot break free, then it is up to Xuanhuang to decide.</p><p></p><p>"Jianmu, don't say I didn't give you a chance, go."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's domain was fully opened, and the illusory image of Jianmu was also condensed, he had also reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The towering Jianmu, as if it had a spirit, as soon as it was called out, instinctively quickly approached the ominous corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>Quickly grew to the same size as the ominous corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>With the support of father... no, with the will of Xuanhuang, it covered the ominous corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>The ominous corpse tree was trapped in the domain, the ominous rules and Xuanhuang's will were in conflict, and the energy of resistance had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After being completely enveloped by the illusory image of Jianmu, the corpse tree had an instinctive sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Although it was condensed by the ominous rules, it was also nurtured by the Tao.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is nurtured by the Tao, it will have the will to survive.</p><p></p><p>It also wants to survive.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang only felt that his will was strongly impacted.</p><p></p><p>But everything was already destined, the will of the heavens and the earth within a thousand-meter radius of the small world, even if Xuanhuang only introduced a very small part, it is something that the first-order ominous rules cannot break free from.</p><p></p><p>Visible to the naked eye, the withered and yellow leaves of the ominous corpse tree began to change, and a faint green began to emerge.</p><p></p><p>If compared, the soul of Jianmu is greater than the ominous corpse tree, but the body of the ominous corpse tree is stronger than Jianmu.</p><p></p><p>But now the body is trapped, and Jianmu, whose soul is in the ascendant, is like entering uncharted territory.</p><p></p><p>The speed is extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Until Xuanhuang received a reminder to release the restraint.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang knew it was done.</p><p></p><p>Jianmu has completely taken the dominant position, and the rest is just a gradual fusion and transformation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had also reached his limit, and this kind of time-space confinement was very consuming.</p><p></p><p>Since Jianmu has succeeded, Xuanhuang immediately withdrew the domain, and then withdrew the Guihu Grinder and the Heavenly Furnace that had already completed their work.</p><p></p><p>Everything is done.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>As if the illusory space was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The death aura permeating the surroundings was quickly absorbed by Jianmu, this is its own energy.</p><p></p><p>...Of course, it previously belonged to the ominous corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>Outside...</p><p></p><p>There were those who were anxiously waiting, and those who were waiting to see the joke and gloat.</p><p></p><p>They had all heard the sound of Xuanhuang's attack just now, knowing that a fierce battle was taking place.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed to have stopped suddenly, which made the people in the martial arts hall very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft--"</p><p></p><p>"I'm dying of laughter, this Xuanhuang guy, can't he attack more than once?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, why is it so quiet now?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed dragon illusionist took off his eye patch.</p><p></p><p>A scarlet, devouring illusory eye ball was exposed.</p><p></p><p>The illusory eye ball emitted a red light, penetrating the thick mist formed by the corpse tree's death aura.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before his eyes was a scorching white light.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, it was the moment when Xuanhuang activated the domain to restrain the corpse tree with the will of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what is this thing, my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Agonizing cries came from the one-eyed dragon, and the illusory eye ball was bleeding profusely.</p><p></p><p>A few illusionist disciples were waiting for his news.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, they heard the screams.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the few people around him quickly scattered, afraid that the one-eyed dragon would lose control and attack them.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! It hurts, it hurts! It's not good, I've been seriously injured, there's danger, run quickly."</p><p></p><p>The few illusionist disciples: ???... (This chapter ends)</p>

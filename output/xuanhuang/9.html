        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every person who mistakenly enters the alley will be uncontrollably smashed against the wall and turned into a brick of blood.</p><p></p><p>The alley, which was less than 20 meters three years ago, has now become nearly 50 meters long. It's easy to imagine that each brick's growth represents a lost life.</p><p></p><p>This has caused the deaths of nearly two thousand people in the Wu district, a painful lesson.</p><p></p><p>Back in the safe house, Xuanhuang fell silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the knife, which had become a bit damaged after two battles.</p><p></p><p>His strong willpower gave him excellent self-control, and the wisdom of his two lifetimes taught him to remain calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the news about the treacherous alley made him gloomy, but he knew that gloominess wouldn't solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I'm still too weak."</p><p></p><p>"Just like this knife, a mere two battles have caused it to become damaged. I see you need more tempering!"</p><p></p><p>"Clang—"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang struck the blade, as if his words had a double meaning.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the long knife in his hand disappeared, reappearing in his spiritual realm, and Xuanhuang followed it in.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the edge of his willpower, he was greeted by the dense, ink-black darkness.</p><p></p><p>"In my name, I bestow upon you the ability to withstand all laws and defy the passage of time."</p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang spoke, the 10-meter space was filled with a flowing light, and a tiny but profound will from the heavens and earth infused the long knife.</p><p></p><p>"Hum—"</p><p></p><p>The long knife let out a sibilant cry, as if it had gained sentience, and its surface shimmered with light.</p><p></p><p>"Without tempering, a tool cannot be forged. You and I are the same."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xuanhuang plunged the long knife into the thick, black mist.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle—"</p><p></p><p>Like the sound of red-hot steel being quenched in icy water, the knife seemed to be corroded as it entered the black mist.</p><p></p><p>If not for the enhancement of Xuanhuang's willpower and spiritual essence, the knife might have been immediately worn down.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh~"</p><p></p><p>After about 10 seconds, Xuanhuang quickly withdrew the long knife.</p><p></p><p>Now, the knife had shrunk from 2 meters to less than 1.7 meters, its surface pitted and scarred, the once-silver blade turned black.</p><p></p><p>To the naked eye, it looked like a nearly rotted knife, but Xuanhuang could clearly sense that this blade was different.</p><p></p><p>The "intent" bestowed by the will of heaven and earth was faintly perceptible, and the characteristics of the immortal golden spiritual essence had been imprinted as an inscription.</p><p></p><p>The Great Abyss Grindstone, the Heavenly-Earth Furnace, and the Tong Tian Tree were first imbued with spiritual essence, which was then gradually refined.</p><p></p><p>The long knife had first taken on physical form, and then was imbued with willpower.</p><p></p><p>The difference lay in the innate and the acquired.</p><p></p><p>To transform the acquired into the innate requires tempering, a return to the source.</p><p></p><p>Nothing could better temper the knife than the black mist of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as it could withstand the power of the Great Abyss, it would become an existence impervious to all laws and the ravages of time.</p><p></p><p>In just 10 seconds, the immortal inscription and the celestial will had been so eroded, it was clear that with each round of tempering, the knife would grow to the point where the black mist could no longer corrode it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xuanhuang added another layer of willpower tempering.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xuanhuang had a weapon capable of contending with the treacherous.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was naturally patient and not in a hurry. He planned to take it slow, and at the latest, in a month, he would reach the first level of the Transcendent realm. </p><p></p><p>At that point, he would be able to deal with the treacherous, but the news brought by Jin Ning made him feel that time was of the essence.</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to utilize the method he had previously deduced through super-me projection.</p><p></p><p>This was the easiest way to achieve it based on his current projections.</p><p></p><p>He relied on the enchantment techniques of the Immortal Master Forgers.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang went even further, using the will of the small world to empower it, leaving the immortal spiritual essence's inscription, and tempering it with the power of the Great Abyss Grindstone.</p><p></p><p>The knife looked pitted and scarred, as if it would break with a forceful strike.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it was truly a blade capable of slaying the treacherous.</p><p></p><p>The knife could also be seen as a newborn treacherous being, with the bestowed will, the immortal spiritual essence's inscription, and the power of the Great Abyss - none of which were simple matters.</p><p></p><p>Just as the treacherous devour and fuse with each other, this knife could also consume the treacherous and strengthen itself.</p><p></p><p>The only requirement was to maintain control within the limits of Xuanhuang's spatial power, lest there be a backlash.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that in the future, you will be impervious to all laws and the ravages of time, able to cleave through all laws and sever the passage of time."</p><p></p><p>"But for now, you are too hollow, needing to drink deep of the treacherous' blood. I shall call you the Void Blade."</p><p></p><p>This blade was destined to become a great tool, with great... but for now, it was rusted and hollow.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the name Void Blade.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Heavenly-Earth Furnace, the Void Blade was specifically forged to contend with the treacherous, and it required consecration.</p><p></p><p>The method of consecration was the constant refinement of willpower that Xuanhuang often practiced. </p><p></p><p>This was also a way to temper his willpower, something he had considered before but never focused on. Now, to deal with the treacherous, Xuanhuang decided to adjust his plans.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After creating the Void Blade, it was already afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to the consecration of the Void Blade, or perhaps because of the strength of his physical body, the fatigue from the previous night's willpower advancement had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to raise his willpower to the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>The shattered bat he had collected yesterday was still in his spiritual realm, not yet refined.</p><p></p><p>Now, he intended to use the mutated bat as kindling, to see what differences the mutation had brought.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—" "Crack—" Today, the illusion of the Great Abyss Grindstone seemed particularly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The residual souls that were previously easily extinguished by a casual turn or two now proved to be a bit stubborn.</p><p></p><p>The black mist permeated the area, and the remnants extracted from the mutated bat's soul were exceptionally numerous. The mutated bat's soul was like a combination of countless residual souls, different from the previous wild boar and rat.</p><p></p><p>"So it is a puppet? The intelligence has been devoured, and the turbid pool of residual souls serves as its core."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang roughly understood the peculiar way the blood pool controlled the animals.</p><p></p><p>When the animals drank the blood from the blood pool, it was the moment when the residual souls in the blood shattered the animals' spirituality and occupied their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The harvest was also substantial, as dozens of true essences were absorbed by the Great Grinder of the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there many, but the quality was also quite good, about ten times thicker than the residual souls of the wild boar.</p><p></p><p>The same would apply to the Dao Transformation of the Tong Tian Building Wood and the Smelting of the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace - a single mutated bat was worth several hundred wild boars.</p><p></p><p>"Hum—"</p><p></p><p>The mighty essence of blood and qi transformed into a raging fire. The spiritual body was the furnace, the spiritual mechanism was the igniter, the blood and qi were the fuel, and the will within the furnace was being forged.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble, rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The consciousness space echoed with continuous sounds, the essence of blood and qi of the mutated bat was like high-energy fuel.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang, who had already refined the third layer of will, endured an even more painful tempering than the first time he refined the will.</p><p></p><p>The effect was astonishing. It was originally estimated that it would take at least three to four hours of forging to refine the fourth layer of will.</p><p></p><p>But in less than half an hour...</p><p></p><p>With a "boom," Xuanhuang completed the refinement of the fourth layer of will.</p><p></p><p>And there was still a considerable amount of fuel left. Gritting his teeth, Xuanhuang continued to forge the fourth layer of will, and it was only after another dozen or so minutes that the fuel was finally exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Whew~"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was drenched in sweat, his breathing a bit rapid. It took a while for the fatigue that had consumed him body and soul to gradually subside.</p><p></p><p>The result was very satisfactory, the fourth layer of will in the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>After regaining full control of his body, the muddy sensation of the fourth layer of physical refinement completely disappeared, with the fourth layer of will corresponding to the fourth layer of flesh, everything was calm and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>"Such a pure essence of blood and qi."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the residual souls and chaotic spiritual mechanisms within, both the Great Grinder of the Returning Void and the Tong Tian Building Wood have had a hearty meal."</p><p></p><p>Fierce beasts were the best fuel.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang looked at the already usable Void Knife in his hand and quickly tidied up, heading towards the valley from yesterday.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>A crow was perched on a tree branch, resting peacefully.</p><p></p><p>A flash of black light passed, severing the branch it was perched on, and the aura carried by the black light instantly caused the crow's body to lose control, plummeting from the high sky.</p><p></p><p>"Two snakes, three rats, and one crow should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang carried several bags, all containing stunned animals.</p><p></p><p>The Void Knife currently had three abilities: Dissolution, Soul Suppression, and Blade Will.</p><p></p><p>Dissolution was the ability to grind the black qi in the Grinding Space, and as long as it was slashed, the dissolving force would follow like a shadow.</p><p></p><p>Soul Suppression was the engraved text of the Immortal Divine Soul, which had a powerful shock and destruction effect on spiritual souls and intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Blade Will was the manifestation of the consciousness of the small world, and swinging the knife was the possession of Xuanhuang's will.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xuanhuang could sense the existence of the animals, no matter if they were deeply buried underground or perched in the trees, as long as they were within the attack range, they would all be stunned after the Blade Will passed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't intend to kill them, he just used the extended effect of the Blade Will and the Soul Suppression, if he had used the Dissolution ability, these small animals would have been gone long ago.</p><p></p><p>Carrying three fish-scale bags, Xuanhuang returned to the cave, the round trip taking less than an hour.</p><p></p><p>With the benefits of the mutated bat and the powerful assistance of the Void Knife, Xuanhuang planned to touch upon the blood pool's peculiarity.</p><p></p><p>This thing would have to be encountered sooner or later, and a land-bound peculiarity was much safer.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang entered the cave, which was not deep, only about ten meters away.</p><p></p><p>The deeper into the cave, the larger it became, and when he saw the fissure, this place had already reached a height of nearly ten meters.</p><p></p><p>The fissure was two meters wide and five meters high.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light flickered, and the devouring aura permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, the area connected to the cave had already been dyed red by the blood color, which was a manifestation of the peculiarity's invasion of the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't feel any attraction, as the blood pool peculiarity seemed to only target animals.</p><p></p><p>He threw out a grass snake, and Xuanhuang used the Blade Will to wake up the unconscious snake. The awakened grass snake shuddered and swam towards the fissure as Xuanhuang had predicted.</p><p></p><p>Now it was just a matter of waiting.</p><p></p><p>Although the peculiarity was terrifying, it lacked intelligence and only had patterns, and Xuanhuang was not afraid of the blood pool peculiarity realizing that someone was fishing.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour passed.</p><p></p><p>A hissing sound came from the fissure, as if the snake was undergoing a violent transformation.</p><p></p><p>Another cigarette's worth of time passed, and a mutated grass snake nearly seven meters long swam out of the fissure.</p><p></p><p>Its body was covered in thick scales, its eyes had turned a crimson red, and it exuded a savage aura.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>With a "crack," the once majestic grass snake was now separated from its head.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even have a chance to perform? Xuanhuang quickly collected the still-twisting snake body and snake head, glancing at the time and feeling he could try one more time.</p><p></p><p>He then released two rats, using the same method, and the awakened rats scurried into the blood pool's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>One was no problem, but now two shouldn't be an issue.</p><p></p><p>...Until forty minutes later, "Sizzle, sizzle—" two flashes of the knife, and two mutated rats as large as small pigs lay dead.</p><p></p><p>"Work's done!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

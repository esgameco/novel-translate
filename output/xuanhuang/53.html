        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three days have passed.</p><p></p><p>The discussion online has fully fermented and erupted into a new round.</p><p></p><p>When the official Weibo account of the Exorcism Department Headquarters announced that this matter is true, congratulating humanity for pioneering the extraordinary martial arts, and congratulating the Mysterious Yellow of South City.</p><p></p><p>This is an authoritative information release.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Am I not fully awake? Or has the Exorcism Department Headquarters been mysteriously attacked?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, is it really true? If this can be promoted, then other martial artists can also become extraordinary. Wouldn't that mean that us Spiritual Masters are on par with the martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>"The person above is a small-minded person, are you concerned about the plight of humanity or your own status?"</p><p></p><p>"Despicable martial artist, don't think I don't know you are a martial artist. Mind your own business, you martial artists and us noble Spiritual Masters are equal, I'm just not happy about it, don't let me find you, hmph."</p><p></p><p>"Stop arguing, everyone go see what the Dragon Master has said, the Dragon Master has acknowledged Mysterious Yellow, saying he can be called 'Mysterious Master'."</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>On the Dragon Master's account, the Dragon Master congratulates the martial arts, congratulates Mysterious Yellow.</p><p></p><p>Saying that Mysterious Yellow has pioneered the extraordinary path of martial arts, if it can be widely promoted, it will be a great merit, and he can be honored as the 'Mysterious Master'.</p><p></p><p>Even in the comments below the Dragon Master, Dreamland Spiritual Master Mark also expressed that he doesn't mind, as long as it's true, they can be called the Three Masters together.</p><p></p><p>Mili Trump also expressed that he can accept it, and even hopes that Mysterious Yellow will come to Mili to spread the extraordinary path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Saying that although their martial artists are mostly Qi fighters, knights, and dark energy martial artists, they are all the same path, all developing the body.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Dreamland, Mili, and others haven't learned the cultivation methods of the small martial arts world and the small immortal cultivation world, but they have also discovered equivalent small worlds in their own country.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their small worlds and their cultures are similar.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the fantasy mythologies in different places are different, and the linked small worlds are also different.</p><p></p><p>Just like Dreamland leans towards Greek mythology, knights, and Christianity small worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Middle East, India, and South America have discovered small worlds that fit their cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>The myriad worlds are the fantasies of the Blue Planet, or we can say that the myriad worlds are the reflections of the Blue Planet, the Blue Planet has imagined such worlds.</p><p></p><p>Are the small worlds created by the thinking of the Blue Planet?</p><p></p><p>Or do the small worlds already exist and are reflected on the Blue Planet?</p><p></p><p>It is temporarily unknown.</p><p></p><p>Possibly both.</p><p></p><p>But they all lead to the same path, the three elements of essence, energy, and spirit all exist, the only difference is the way of absorbing and transforming spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts are the same, the starting point is all about developing the physical body.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"Is the Dragon Master confused? How can martial arts be on par with us, and even call him the Mysterious Master, it's impossible, I absolutely don't recognize it."</p><p></p><p>"What does it matter if you recognize it or not, this is the difference between you and the Dragon Master, the Dragon Master's thinking has achieved a powerful and respected Dragon Master, your despicable and dark thinking has achieved a despicable and dark you, haha..."</p><p></p><p>"It's you again, that despicable martial artist, do you want to die?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've already gone to South City, come and try to kill me if you can?"</p><p></p><p>Keyboard in hand, not a blade of grass will grow!</p><p></p><p>The online situation has become even more chaotic, with almost 80% of the Immortal and Martial Dao recognizing Mysterious Yellow.</p><p></p><p>30% of the Spiritual Masters recognize him, 40% do not recognize Mysterious Yellow, and 30% remain silent.</p><p></p><p>Numerically, the supporters of Mysterious Yellow occupy the dominant position.</p><p></p><p>But until a few organizations posted such a message.</p><p></p><p>【Mysterious Yellow of the Summer Country, acting against the laws of heaven and earth, our Demon Believer Church will kill Mysterious Yellow.】</p><p></p><p>--Demon Believer Church</p><p></p><p>【Although Mysterious Yellow is one of our tribe, he should not exist, our Divine Alliance will kill this person.】</p><p></p><p>--Divine Alliance</p><p></p><p>【Our Salvation Society is paying attention and watching for now.】</p><p></p><p>--Salvation Society</p><p></p><p>【That insignificant insect, always buzzing around when humans are gathering, extremely annoying, our Gold Medal Envoy firmly supports humanity's exploration of the martial arts path, Mysterious Master is the one we protect, whoever dares to have other ideas, I will not say anything, I will not predict.】</p><p></p><p>--Gold Medal Envoy</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【The Mysterious Association says that all guests are welcome, no matter who they are. May the harmony bring you wealth, may the harmony bring you wealth.】</p><p></p><p>—— The Mysterious Association【...】</p><p></p><p>Several major organizations, whether they are from the evil camp or the righteous camp, have expressed their own views.</p><p></p><p>A few who have issued blatant threats are notorious organizations.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, within the Summer Country, they have been severely suppressed, and the Exorcism Department is known as the number one spiritual practitioner organization in the world.</p><p></p><p>After these news were released, it triggered intense discussions.</p><p></p><p>Some strongly supported it, while others remained silent, afraid of getting into trouble.</p><p></p><p>Many people were watching the news.</p><p></p><p>Including a very quiet "hikikomori".</p><p></p><p>The hikikomori Xuanhuang looked at the messages on the forum, especially the two organizations that had blatantly threatened him - the Demon Worshippers and the Divine Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly found it interesting.</p><p></p><p>"The local gangs are so impolite?"</p><p></p><p>"Threatening me out of the blue, they are really arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"Since you want to kill me, then I can only find an opportunity to eliminate you."</p><p></p><p>He turned off his phone and chose to ignore it.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he indeed cannot defeat these third-stage spiritual practitioners.</p><p></p><p>But they cannot possibly kill him either, as he has no confidence in saving his own life, so they would not do it so openly.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he confirmed that the small world is the Ruins, the starting point of the fourth stage, currently no one can enter and survive.</p><p></p><p>If they provoke him, he can take the risk to bring them into it, and see who dies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is the last resort, he still needs to become stronger himself.</p><p></p><p>When he reaches the second stage of Penetrating the Mystery, combined with other means.</p><p></p><p>Those spiritual practitioners who have become third-stage through mysterious means, it will be difficult for them to kill him, very difficult.</p><p></p><p>And when he becomes a third-stage Profound Enlightened, it will be the day when this group of evil organizations is destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, these organizations are just threats, the Summer Country is not somewhere they can come and go as they please. Even if they come, they can only hide like rats. As long as we are careful, there won't be any major problems in the short term."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xuanhuang's expression had not changed, but rather showed a slight interest.</p><p></p><p>The ones who came to report, Sunhui and the others, said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, don't pay attention to these. How is the Qingyun Mountain going?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, the renovation has been completed, we can move to Qingyun Mountain tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Good, you've done well." He then said: "How is the visualization chart going?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, Jinning has completed 90%, only lacking one key moment, the other four have reached 80%, and seven have reached 70%."</p><p></p><p>Sunhui only mentioned those who reached 70%, the others were not mentioned.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, to reach this level in less than a month, it seems the perfection is not far away. After the relocation to Qingyun Mountain, I will personally teach and lecture those who have reached 70% and above, I hope you all work hard."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we are grateful to the Master."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked again: "I heard that many martial artists are coming from other cities, how have you arranged for them?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian said: "Master, we plan to screen and absorb them into the Southern City Martial Arts Hall, after examination, we will teach them the visualization chart and the 'Furnace Nine Refinements', and I wanted to ask for your opinion?"</p><p></p><p>"Just do it that way, if they pass the examination, don't need to hold back, the more the better. Don't have the idea of not teaching widely. We are not establishing a sect or a force, but the impartial teaching of the Sage, the transmission of the Tao by the Ancestor, and the universal salvation of the Buddha. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd suddenly had a sense of enlightenment, their horizons broadened.</p><p></p><p>Aren't they the three thousand guests of the Ancestor's hall, the three thousand disciples of the Sage, the enlightened ones of the Buddha's Lingshan? The Master is great, the Master is truly great.</p><p></p><p>Not a sect's ancestor, but the Ancestor of the Tao, the Sage, the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>There are many sect ancestors, but there is only one Ancestor of the Tao, the Sage, the Buddha.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

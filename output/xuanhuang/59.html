        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The perseverance over the years is something everyone can see.</p><p></p><p>But when Xuanhuang mentioned that Gou Jianren, one of the Twelve Demonic Sect Elders and the Demonic Puppet Elder, was a disciple of the Demon Cult, even he was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi, is this truly the case?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>It was hard for him to believe that the deputy director of his Exorcism Department was the elder of an evil cult.</p><p></p><p>"Every word I've said is the truth. Director Xu, take a look at what this is."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then produced a puppet that emanated a strong aura of eeriness.</p><p></p><p>Controlling it with his mental powers, Xuanhuang slowly brought the puppet over to Xu Ruyi's hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi solemnly accepted it and examined it closely, especially after the eerie contact...</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the notorious Gou Jianren, one of the Twelve Demonic Sect Elders and the Demonic Puppet Elder.</p><p></p><p>The eeriness could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "This person is so deranged, and he is closely tied to the Demon Cult's Elders. The assassin he hired, Qi Long the Ominous Shadow, has also been eliminated by me. I believe Director Xu can make a fair judgment."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi was burning with anger. The facts were undeniable, now crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Xuanshi, for informing me. My Exorcism Department will handle this matter." </p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi then said, "Our purpose in coming here today was twofold - first, to congratulate you on the Wudao Hall; second, we also came for Jia Zhengyi. Now that this is clear, we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>As for the shaman who had followed Director Dong Xingbao to cause a ruckus? After witnessing the unbelievable scene just now, he had completely forgotten about it.</p><p></p><p>Who was Jia Zhengyi? Ah, he was an Elder of the Demon Cult, good riddance to him.</p><p></p><p>No wonder I, such a good person, was incited by him. It turns out the problem was not with me, but entirely with Gou Jianren.</p><p></p><p>Striking at Xuanhuang?</p><p></p><p>Don't be ridiculous, didn't you see my arm was broken, only sustained by my eerie abilities.</p><p></p><p>Thus, they had come with a thunderous arrival, and left in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>Not until Xuanhuang saw Xu Ruyi off at the hall's entrance did Xu Ruyi say to Xuanhuang, "I wonder if Xuanshi has time tomorrow? I'd like to discuss something with you."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Xuanhuang was puzzled, "What does Director Xu wish to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>"Eeriness!" </p><p></p><p>"Eeriness?" Hearing this, Xuanhuang became interested: "I will sweep the hall clean to welcome you tomorrow, Director Xu."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. Lately, a storm is brewing over South City, not to mention your appearance; in terms of eeriness, it is also forming an encirclement over South City. The Exorcism Department alone cannot protect the citizens of South City. Your appearance has given me renewed hope."</p><p></p><p>"It's that serious?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Even more serious than you imagine. There are quite a few renowned Second-Order Eerie beings, and there are even suspected Third-Order existences."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll be awaiting your arrival tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>With that, the two parted ways.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi left with a group of shamans, some of whom were walking in a peculiar, twisted manner.</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang returned to the separate courtyard, </p><p></p><p>Gold Ning, Wu Gang, Sun Hui, Song Hongliang, as well as the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio - Master Ma, Zhao Long, and Du Ming - were already waiting there.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat, everyone."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, closely examining the group.</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with the ones from the Wudao Hall, mainly Master Ma, Master Jiu Tong, Venerable Ming Hui, Mr. Yan Lai, and Du Ming and Zhao Long.</p><p></p><p>A will enveloped the six of them, and they remained motionless and silent. Xuanhuang had a general understanding.</p><p></p><p>"How much of the Contemplation Diagram have you all comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gold Ning, being the youngest, was the first to speak up: "Thanks to Xuanshi's generous teachings, I've been learning for over ten days, and just now with Xuanshi's enlightenment, I've achieved complete mastery of the Diagram."</p><p></p><p>"Well done, well done. Your natural talent is quite good, and your karmic conditions are also profound." </p><p></p><p>Was Xuanhuang praising Gold Ning, or was he praising himself?</p><p></p><p>Natural talent and profound karmic conditions, this was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is this not a fortuitous opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"It is all thanks to the Venerable Master's deep kindness."</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Jin Ning's cold face.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master, we three are ashamed that we have lived to such an age yet have been fortunate enough to be noticed by the Venerable Master, and have managed to comprehend about 70% of the Visualization Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Speaking on behalf of the group, Yan Lai said.</p><p></p><p>"You three need not be ashamed, for you are the most outstanding talents I have discovered so far. I'm quite curious, how is it that you have the willpower of the fourth layer of Refinement?" </p><p></p><p>Receiving the praise of the Venerable Huang, Jiu Tong said: "We three have merely read more classics and experienced more of the vicissitudes of life, and have developed a will as unyielding as withered wood in our old age, which is merely a stroke of luck."</p><p></p><p>"Very good, there's no need to be overly humble. You three also have the cultivation of the seventh layer of Qi Refinement and Spirit Refinement, and your Body Refinement is also quite impressive, which is even more praiseworthy."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Huang continued: "As I've said many times before, the coordination of essence, energy, and spirit is the key to a powerful will. Currently, your comprehension of the Visualization Diagram may not be as good as that of Jin Ning and the others, but once you fully comprehend it, it will be a period of rapid progress for you. Your powerful essence, energy, and spirit will bring you a bright future."</p><p></p><p>"We three will forge ahead diligently and not disappoint the Venerable Master's deep kindness."</p><p></p><p>Receiving such high praise from Venerable Huang, the unruffled hearts of the three stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You two are also not bad, one at the fifth layer of Body Refinement, the other at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, with a willpower of the third layer, the future is promising for you."</p><p></p><p>Venerable Huang then spoke to Zhao Long and Du Ming.</p><p></p><p>This was an unexpected delight for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>He believed that the world was not lacking in talents, but for them to have rushed to Nanshi in such a short time and encountered Venerable Huang's teachings, this was truly a stroke of great fortune.</p><p></p><p>"With the Venerable Master's bestowed teachings, we two are deeply grateful and willing to serve as loyal followers."</p><p></p><p>The two solemnly swore.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they both wished to become disciples, but they couldn't bring themselves to ask, feeling unworthy.</p><p></p><p>"No need for that loyal follower nonsense. Just focus on your cultivation. In the future, when you have achieved attainments, you can also spread it like I do. With the invasion of the Anomalies and the fusion of the Myriad Realms, it is difficult for us humans to stand firm. Let's get through the crisis first before talking about other things."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The two were a bit disappointed at not being accepted as disciples.</p><p></p><p>But they also felt the greatness of Venerable Huang, with such an attitude, truly a "Venerable Master".</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Master Ma, you're not bad either, fifth layer of Qi Refinement, third layer of willpower, how much of the Visualization Diagram have you comprehended this time?"</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Ma hurriedly replied, "Reporting to the Venerable, this old Daoist is ashamed, I have only comprehended 60%."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, that's also acceptable."</p><p></p><p>After simply inquiring, Venerable Huang continued, "Previously, due to the stagnation of the disciples of the Dao Pavilion, I promised to bestow the techniques of Qi Refinement and Spirit Refinement. Today, those with outstanding talents in Body Refinement, Qi Refinement, and Spirit Refinement are all here, so I will grant you the Qi Refinement and Spirit Refinement techniques."</p><p></p><p>"However, due to the distortion of the Heavenly Mandate, my Visualization Diagram can only maintain its spiritual essence for one year before being distorted. You may need to stay at Qingyun Mountain for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Visualization Diagram is not considered precious, if it falls into the hands of evildoers, even if they don't learn it, it will still be wasted."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, you can only learn it at Qingyun Mountain, and can only leave after you have fully comprehended the Visualization Diagram."</p><p></p><p>"But even after fully comprehending the Visualization Diagram and being able to cultivate or merge techniques, continuing to comprehend the Visualization Diagram will still be of great importance."</p><p></p><p>"This is also related to the subsequent cultivation, the Primal Chaos Cultivation, which still starts from the Visualization Diagram, as it is an inherited technique."</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific cultivation methods, you can consider them yourselves."</p><p></p><p>After Venerable Huang finished speaking, the disciples of the Martial Arts Hall had no objections, as they were already at Qingyun Mountain, and wouldn't be driven away even if asked to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist trio were in a dilemma, as they not only represented themselves, but also the forces behind them.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Long, the martial artist, was also in a dilemma, as he was a lone cultivator, but still had his own concerns.</p><p></p><p>It was Dou Ming who was the most carefree, readily accepting the plan to stay at Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Ma also had the same idea, planning to stay at Qingyun Mountain from now on.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoists, if you have votes, please support them, and also seek more reading and collection, thank you.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

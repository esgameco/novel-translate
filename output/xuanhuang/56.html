        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Noon.</p><p></p><p>The slightly worried Sunhui came to the square.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really someone from the Exorcism Department causing trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma said, "My disciple Gaojue told me that Deputy Director Dongxingbao is leading a group of people who previously belonged to Jia Zhengyi."</p><p></p><p>"Do they still have the face to cause trouble? Wasn't Jia Zhengyi the one who acted unrighteously first?"</p><p></p><p>"Talking about this is useless, since they've come, they have no intention of being reasonable, they will just cause trouble and act arrogantly," Sunhui said, looking at the angry Wugang.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, the three Confucian, Taoist and Buddhist directors of the Exorcism Department headquarters have also come, they came quietly. I previously discovered the leader of the Nine Passages, he told me not to make a fuss, and plans to visit the Master personally after the matter is resolved," the well-informed Master Ma said again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are also nearly a hundred cultivators and immortal masters from the nearby cities and provinces who have come, but they are all very obedient to the arrangements, saying they have come to seek the Dao," the manager said.</p><p></p><p>Sunhui nodded and said, "Since it has come to this, there's no use talking about other things, continue."</p><p></p><p>"The Master will be here soon."</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Under the arrangement of the martial arts hall, the staff of the martial arts hall, the people of the South City Taoist Hall, the other city cultivators and immortal masters who rushed over, as well as the Exorcism Department's spirit masters, all took their seats below.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"How come these cultivators and martial artists are seated on the same level as us? Is this a mistake, how did the martial arts hall arrange this?"</p><p></p><p>As they took their seats, a group of trouble-makers, the spirit masters, began to vent their dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Normally, in such a scene, the spirit masters would be seated in front, and the others behind them, this had already become a habit.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the martial arts hall did not follow the previous custom, and the spirit masters, martial artists, and immortal masters were seated equally.</p><p></p><p>Especially the several top experts of the martial arts hall, who were placed in the front.</p><p></p><p>This made many spirit masters dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, if you're not satisfied, you can leave first, no one invited you here?" The sharp-eared Gaojue was unhappy with this person.</p><p></p><p>"Gaojue, don't forget that you are a spirit master, don't forget that we are a group." The person angrily said.</p><p></p><p>Gaojue smiled: "Who's in the same group as you? I'm here to congratulate, to congratulate the Master for developing the martial arts, making a great contribution to humanity, what about you?"</p><p></p><p>"Gaojue, has your master brainwashed you? They are still mortals, you must remember that."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, mortals? What a high and mighty attitude, it seems we are indeed not in the same group. As for my master? It's not your turn to talk about him, who do you think you are? Are you being manipulated by the strange and eaten your brain?"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone be quiet. Look at how you're behaving, if you're not satisfied, you can leave by yourself, don't talk now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Being with a group of spirit masters is really troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The spirit master group, there are not many normal people, but there are a lot of lunatics, it's exhausting.</p><p></p><p>Their conversation, of course, was heard by the people around them.</p><p></p><p>But how could they dare to get angry after hearing it? They were the mighty spirit master lords, they couldn't even express their dissatisfaction, this was the gap in power.</p><p></p><p>However, their actions and words had united the people present, they all fervently hoped that the Master's preaching could point them the way forward.</p><p></p><p>This inequality of power, the daily life of being unable to hold their heads up, was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome the Master."</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>The loud voice of the host Gaoji√†n rang out.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell.</p><p></p><p>All those present stood up.</p><p></p><p>Only the group of dissatisfied spirit masters remained unmoved, sneering at the scene.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The spirit masters who were sitting coldly and indifferently suddenly exploded, as if they had felt a strong and targeted will coming towards them, immediately causing the strange instincts in their bodies to awaken.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if they had encountered a natural enemy. The price of not resisting was that the mysterious rules were sealed, and the instincts formed by resentment were erased.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Danger!"</p><p></p><p>A group of spirit masters were subjected to an indiscriminate, all-encompassing attack.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly found that their bodies were being forcibly stood up by invisible air pressure. If they resisted even slightly, their legs or arms would break, and if they struggled further, their spines would break.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi was surprised to find that a pressure not weaker than his own had covered his fellow spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>"Please, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Ruyi made a move, a gentle voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit masters who had been forcibly stood up "sat down" in a very exaggerated manner.</p><p></p><p>This intimidation had completely shattered their defenses.</p><p></p><p>Even Dong Xingbao was momentarily dazed, as if waking from a dream. How powerful was this?</p><p></p><p>His group of over ten spirit masters had been forcibly stood up without any resistance. Was this the opponent he was looking for?</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi's mood was complex. Fortunately, Xuanhuang's actions were fleeting and not excessive, and Xu Ruyi temporarily controlled his dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"The self-propagating 'Crucible of Heaven and Earth Visualization' has been going on for more than twenty days, and even earlier, it has been close to a month. Among those with outstanding natural talents, more than seventy percent have already gained insights. Today, taking the opportunity of staying at Qingyun Mountain, I will explain the essence of the Visualization to everyone."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Except for the spirit masters with ulterior motives, the others shouted excitedly, "It's here, it's here!"</p><p></p><p>"I see that there are also Immortal Cultivation friends here, so I'll just briefly explain. Initially, I created three methods: the first is the 'Crucible of Heaven and Earth Visualization' as the main one, which then evolved into the 'Nine Refinements of the Crucible'; at the time, there were also the Qi Cultivation method and the Spirit Cultivation method, which respectively cultivated the 'Penetrating Heaven and Establishing Wood Visualization' and the 'Great Grinding of the Returning to the Abyss Visualization'."</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, these three methods are not sequential, but rather, when I had a small foundation in the Martial Dao, I passed on the Crucible of Heaven and Earth Visualization, which focuses on body cultivation, to everyone."</p><p></p><p>"Later, due to special circumstances, I saw that people were struggling hard on the path of cultivation, especially my fellow Dao companions, and I couldn't bear it."</p><p></p><p>"Then, based on the Penetrating Heaven and Establishing Wood Visualization and the Great Grinding of the Returning to the Abyss Visualization, I created the 'Establishing Wood Returning to the True Method' and the 'Nine Seals of the Returning to the Abyss Method'."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the people in the Dao Hall were very excited.</p><p></p><p>This "special circumstance" was referring to them.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Master felt their wholehearted support, so he created new Qi Cultivation and Spirit Cultivation methods based on them.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when writing books and establishing a reputation, they would be recorded as: "Some people in the world struggled hard on the path of cultivation, and the Dao Master, unable to bear it, created methods to pave the way."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that us?" This was a way to be remembered in history!</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang continued, "The three methods are different paths but the same origin, all starting from visualizing the visualization diagrams."</p><p></p><p>"After completing the full visualization diagram, I have the vessels I have cultivated as the carriers. I have derived an easy-to-progress fusion method, as well as a relatively harsh cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"I will demonstrate for you the key steps in condensing the Crucible of Heaven and Earth Visualization. The visualization diagram can only be understood in the heart and is difficult to express in words."</p><p></p><p>"My methods, my Dao, are all within the visualization diagram."</p><p></p><p>"Please, take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>A wave of fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>A blue light appeared, centered on Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The light began to slowly circulate, like the most beautiful rhythm in the world.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the crowd entered the "near-Dao" state, while Xuanhuang entered the state of transmitting the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Including the so-called spirit masters, as long as they were still human-dominated, and the mysterious had not completely occupied their body and mind, they would also attain sudden enlightenment due to the near-Dao state.</p><p></p><p>"There is a Dao in the world, and the Dao is in Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>This was the only thought of the cultivators before they entered the state of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

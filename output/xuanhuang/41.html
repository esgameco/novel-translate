        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Does our martial arts school have any industries?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian replied, "Yes, quite a few. We directly control over a dozen, and indirectly have stakes in even more, covering various areas."</p><p></p><p>"That many?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the mysterious invasion has made our martial arts school a major force in dealing with the mysterious threats, so for security reasons, we've been allowed to invest and gain control over many businesses."</p><p></p><p>"Is martial prowess the same as power?"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang nodded, it seems that Sun Hui and the others have been managing things well.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the benefits are so good - martial disciples have subsidies, with martial artists starting at 30,000 and martial masters starting at 100,000.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the previous division.</p><p></p><p>"What are the industries we directly control?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the ones we directly control are steel, chemicals, grains, schools, weapons, and alchemical medicines - both basic and cutting-edge ones."</p><p></p><p>"Does the 'weapons' include firearms?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian nodded to indicate yes.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. You should pay more attention to the alchemical medicines and weapons. After reaching the extraordinary realm, our current weapons and medicines are too outdated to be of much help to martial artists. Have you considered this?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian said, "We've only just started considering this recently. Before, we didn't really need to. But we haven't figured out a solution yet."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Whether it's our alchemists or weapon forgers, they are all ordinary people, with not many martial artists among them. Asking them to use ordinary thinking to come up with extraordinary weapons and medicines is beyond their capabilities."</p><p></p><p>He was right. Without reaching the extraordinary realm, they cannot forge extraordinary medicines and weapons.</p><p></p><p>The most skilled alchemists and weapon forgers must be true experts.</p><p></p><p>"Have the spiritual herbs in the small worlds also been damaged by the mysterious invasion?" Xuan Huang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan. The spiritual herbs in the small worlds have been disrupted by the resurgence of the mysterious forces, with some even turning into mysterious plants."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang nodded, this was about what he had expected.</p><p></p><p>"How many secret realms do our martial arts school control?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gao Jian looked ashamed. "Master Xuan, since our martial arts school didn't play a big role against the mysterious forces before, the secret realms in the southern region and surrounding areas have all been controlled by the Exorcism Department. We currently only have five. And those were only given to us to observe after the Exorcism Department sealed the mysterious forces within."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian continued, "In recent years, two of them have already collapsed and completely merged with the Blue Star, becoming areas permeated by mysterious forces. The remaining three aren't doing too well either, and will likely collapse within a few years."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang understood now.</p><p></p><p>They were just the dregs that the Exorcism Department didn't care about - the small secret realms that would merge with reality the fastest during this inter-world fusion.</p><p></p><p>These numerous small secret realms, even if they had mysterious forces, were better off that way, as they would merge with reality slowly if the mysterious forces were sealed.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they would become new regions of the real world.</p><p></p><p>This means the changes to the Blue Star must be enormous, with its area likely expanded many times over.</p><p></p><p>Comparatively speaking, this inter-world fusion is relatively gentle, not the kind of world-destroying fusion.</p><p></p><p>It's just a collision and fusion of rules, with some mysterious fragments forming.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang sometimes wondered, how far will this fusion develop? Why has the Blue Star become a key point?</p><p></p><p>In the vast universe, are there other key points like the Blue Star? If so, what kind of extraordinary powers will they develop? Or will they become realms of mysterious forces instead.</p><p></p><p>And what are the mysterious forces on other planets like? Xuan Huang understood that mysterious forces are the inevitable result of the collision of worlds, so they must exist on other planets as well, even if to a lesser degree.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the broad sense, the universe itself is a living being, as are the planets. As long as there are beings with desires on other planets, mysterious forces will inevitably arise.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking a bit too far ahead. Reaching the second realm can allow one to fly out of the Blue Star, but to truly traverse the universe requires the third realm transformation, with the true self condensing spatial teleportation.</p><p></p><p>For now, Xuan Huang's teleportation relies on the power of the Abyss, which doesn't really count.</p><p></p><p>After this simple understanding, Gao Jian...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He left.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Xuanhuang asked how many Grand Elixirs were left, and Gao Jian said there were still over 3,000.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang told him to take 2,000 pieces to first condense the first Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian didn't ask why? The Sect Master needs it, so he should provide it fully without asking anything.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xuanhuang had fully recovered, consuming 1,000 Grand Elixirs, about as expected.</p><p></p><p>He had planned to continue condensing the Celestial Pillar, but the consciousness of the Small World transmitted a message, indicating that the Heavenly Towering Wood had completed its transformation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang came to the Small World, and the Heavenly Towering Wood had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>It was in sync with Xuanhuang's intentions, and the Heavenly Towering Wood's abilities were as Xuanhuang had expected.</p><p></p><p>The yin and yang circulated, the cycle of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Its abilities in all aspects had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>It had reached the peak of the First Realm, but its life and death abilities were too strong, so it was invincible in the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>It had been lagging behind, but now it had surpassed several of its companions.</p><p></p><p>And because it was a tree, it naturally had more spirituality.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Grinder, the Furnace, and the Knife, it seemed much more spiritual.</p><p></p><p>It emanated a sense of admiration towards Xuanhuang, which Xuanhuang was very pleased about.</p><p></p><p>The past two days had been full of joyous events.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gate had been completely engraved, the Celestial Pillar's progress was smooth, and the Heavenly Towering Wood had also completed its transformation.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Xuanhuang's strength had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>Originally invincible in the First Realm, now that the Heavenly Towering Wood had inherited the ability to absorb life force from the Corpse Tree, if it activated its domain, no one in the Second Realm could escape it, they would only slowly wait for death.</p><p></p><p>The safety factor had increased a little.</p><p></p><p>However, unbeknownst to him, in a secret clubhouse in the South City, this was where the Illusory Experts gathered.</p><p></p><p>Its main function was to facilitate the exchange of information.</p><p></p><p>Not all Illusory Experts had joined the Exorcism Department, besides those who formed cults, there were many scattered ones, like the Immortal Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A place where they could communicate and exchange information had become a necessity.</p><p></p><p>Here, they could also trade various bizarre items, information, and paid tasks.</p><p></p><p>Room No. 3.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Xuanhuang?" </p><p></p><p>Qi Long, who was summoned by Jia Zhengyi, looked at Xuanhuang's profile.</p><p></p><p>The beginning was skipped, about his parents disappearing, and his sudden rise not long ago.</p><p></p><p>He had resolved a seemingly First Realm peak Corpse Tree.</p><p></p><p>His strength was temporarily difficult to estimate.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Tree was indeed powerful, but its inability to move was a flaw, and if there was a way to deal with it, it could be solved.</p><p></p><p>And the Illusory Shadow Qi Long didn't take it seriously either, his illusory and bizarre shadow could turn into a shadow and kill people invisibly.</p><p></p><p>After a simple understanding of Xuanhuang, his vigilance was very small.</p><p></p><p>"Suspected to have spatial abilities. But it may be relying on bizarre items, there are many bizarre ones that can teleport, he shouldn't be able to trouble you?" Jia Zhengyi said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, by the time he discovers I want to teleport, he will already be dead." </p><p></p><p>Qi Long was very confident.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have confidence, as long as you kill him, you can get the Illusory Shadow Cloak, I have already deposited it in the task storage of the clubhouse, you can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Qi Long nodded, the task storage of the clubhouse was quite safe.</p><p></p><p>After all, this bizarre clubhouse was not something ordinary people could open.</p><p></p><p>It existed with branches in every city, spanning across worlds.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity to kill such a person, who can actually open up an extraordinary path? No matter how he did it, it's simply unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi smiled and said, "Indeed, it's a pity, but the news hasn't been spread yet, if it spreads, it won't be easy to handle."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you don't need to say more about your methods, I don't mind that. Killing such a person, I imagine it will be quite exciting."</p><p></p><p>Illusory Experts cannot be understood with common people's thinking, living with the bizarre every day, they don't know what kind of mentality they have become.</p><p></p><p>As Jia Zhengyi said, if the news of Xuanhuang's extraordinary martial dao was spread, it would definitely cause a huge uproar.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he has been temporarily suppressed, but it won't last long.</p><p></p><p>If Department Head Xu Ruyi returns, it won't be good.</p><p></p><p>Now is the best time to kill Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

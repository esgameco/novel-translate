        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sixth refinement of the two pillars of the family, the Xuanhuang consciousness flew out from the furnace, instantly covering the entire sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>The 60-zhang sea of qi was surging with golden qi, like the turbulent waves of the great sea.</p><p></p><p>At the center was a surging spring, constantly spewing forth golden qi flow, and the Heavenly-Earth Furnace was situated right above it.</p><p></p><p>The diffused will that flew into the higher realm had become much stronger compared to when it first entered the Xuan phase.</p><p></p><p>As the will grew stronger, so did Xuanhuang's abilities, borrowing the Heavenly Will of the small world to expand. Now, with just a gaze, Xuanhuang could instantly disperse the divine soul of an ordinary person if the will was lent to it.</p><p></p><p>Just a lethal gaze would suffice.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the consciousness, Xuanhuang instantly returned to the small world.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the massive Spirit-Locking Stele at the center, Xuanhuang pondered deeply. Ever since the Spirit-Locking Stele appeared, its golden divine soul had been continuously growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>The strengthening of the previously unimaginable golden divine soul was achieved through a single fortuitous encounter.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was already very pleased when the white divine soul could be strengthened, but now the golden divine soul was growing stronger without any effort, and even boosting the white divine soul - it was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that divine souls are scattered throughout the boundless space-time?" Xuanhuang couldn't understand where the strengthening divine souls were coming from.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Xuanhuang had planned to use spirit stones to absorb the corrupted divine souls of Cultivators to strengthen them. But the Great Grinder seemed to need it more, absorbing the Returning-to-Void force to strengthen itself.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang temporarily abandoned the idea of using spirit stones to strengthen the white divine soul, letting the Great Grinder strengthen first.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, without the need for spirit stones, the Spirit-Locking Stele made the spirit stones' transformed divine souls almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder was busily refining the Returning-to-Void force condensed from the spirit stones, and each time it did so, it grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was almost catching up to the Wooden Sage.</p><p></p><p>They all had a promising future, and Xuanhuang was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took out a damaged Pig-Slaughtering Knife, which was obtained from a previous targeted cleansing of anomalies.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Xuanhuang had a confrontation in the Anomaly Alley and sustained some injuries, so these past two days, Xuanhuang had not continued the targeted cleansing, only dealing with six anomalies.</p><p></p><p>The Anomaly Bell was temporarily left alone, as if it was refined, the world there would be destroyed, which would be a great loss.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was still thinking about the Great Bell on South Mountain and the one on the mountain, as well as the Time Bubble River - such opportunities would not be easily encountered, so a backup plan had to be kept.</p><p></p><p>As for the Pig-Slaughtering Knife, it was bloodthirsty and had divine soul impact, able to drive people into a bloodthirsty frenzy and also absorb fear to grow stronger, with the ability to lock onto a target with certainty.</p><p></p><p>It was considered special, but its effect on Xuanhuang was not significant, as Xuanhuang's will already covered everything.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to let the Void Sword devour it, as the Void Sword was currently in the mid-Xuan phase and was the slowest in progress among the three.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the Pig-Slaughtering Knife, due to their similar nature, perhaps the Void Sword could reach the late-Xuan phase and catch up to its three "elder brothers".</p><p></p><p>Summoning the Void Sword, Xuanhuang let it handle the matter.</p><p></p><p>The Void Sword quickly wrapped around the sealed Pig-Slaughtering Knife anomaly. Even though it was sealed, when the crisis of complete annihilation arrived, the Pig-Slaughtering Knife still resisted.</p><p></p><p>But the outcome was predetermined - in the small world, the Void Sword was the child of the Heavenly Will.</p><p></p><p>Its spiritual intelligence was bestowed by the Heavenly Will of the small world. What's wrong with the parent's child eating something? Instantly, the Heavenly Will lent its power, and the Void Sword's devouring and fusion ability invaded, causing the struggling Pig-Slaughtering Knife anomaly to instantly lose its ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuanhuang no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>They had all grown up and needed to eat for themselves, just like the White Bone Pagoda, which was diligently refining a section of white bone, and after two days, it still hadn't been completely refined.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang looked at it and saw that it was almost done. At the latest by tomorrow, the White Bone Pagoda would be able to completely refine a section of white bone, officially reaching the peak of the mid-Xuan phase.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the personnel trials on Qingyan Mountain would become even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, a raven appeared in Xuanhuang's hand, which was the Death Raven, one of the six anomalies previously dealt with.</p><p></p><p>This thing could peck at people's divine souls, and once hit by it, their divine souls would shatter, causing them to die from divine soul collapse.</p><p></p><p>In addition, this raven had the ability to seek out death, and could also bestow death upon people, like a weakened version of the Grim Reaper.</p><p></p><p>Once it had you in its sights, you could only pray for the best.</p><p></p><p>Its anomalous abilities were not yet at the level of instantly causing death, but it could achieve complete soul dissipation within three days.</p><p></p><p>Due to its ability to seek out death, this raven also had some spatial abilities, like spatial teleportation.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang found it rather useless for itself.</p><p></p><p>Who couldn't do spatial teleportation? Xuanhuang could even rely on the small world as the center to instantly teleport between the two worlds, far surpassing the raven's ability to only teleport within a ten-li radius.</p><p></p><p>As for the death-dealing ability, the Wooden Sage had something to say about that.</p><p></p><p>And as for the divine soul pecking ability, the Great Grinder found it too weak.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just refine it again, I can't use it, so I can give it to someone else."</p><p></p><p>The same old saying, anomalies are definitely treasures, because the refined artifacts all have growth potential.</p><p></p><p>This was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Open the furnace!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang summoned the Heavenly-Earth Furnace circling around the Spirit-Locking Stele.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The stubborn furnace landed with a loud sound.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't mind, letting out a loud shout: "Open!"</p><p></p><p>The furnace lid flew up, and Xuanhuang tossed the Death Raven into the Heavenly-Earth Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The golden flames began to burn, and the Heavenly Will-forged hammer started swinging.</p><p></p><p>"Clang, clang!"</p><p></p><p>It was a gruesome scene, a seemingly innocent little raven being surrounded by golden flames and pounded by the massive hammer.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit 'cruel', but the raven had brought it upon itself.</p><p></p><p>The furnace had grown much stronger, and Xuanhuang had also grown stronger recently, with greatly enhanced artifact refining experience.</p><p></p><p>So compared to the first time refining an artifact, this time it was much simpler and more composed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a freshly forged raven emerged from the furnace.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't make any major changes, only shattering the corrupted divine will of the Death Raven, restoring it to factory settings.</p><p></p><p>Carefully examining the newly forged Death Raven, Xuanhuang was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang disappeared in a flash from the small world.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Tong, come here."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the side hall, Xuanhuang called out to Sun Tong in the room.</p><p></p><p>The hazy Sun Tong quickly came over.</p><p></p><p>"You've been with me for a long time, and they say 'the nearest water gets the moon first', but it seems like you haven't really benefited from following me, and you've been kept busy, which has hindered your cultivation. Hmm, your body refinement is barely at the third layer, how about your will refinement?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Tong became very excited, finally Xuanhuang was thinking of him?</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, my natural talent is too poor, I've brought you shame. A few families have been providing me with resources, and my body refinement is at the third layer, my perception and visualization are at 90% completion, but the last 10% just won't budge."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was taken aback. "What do you mean by 'a few families providing'?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, I was initially reluctant, but Sect Leader Jiu, Master Ming Hui, and Master Yan Lai were all very enthusiastic, saying that I've been working hard for you and have fallen behind in my cultivation. So the three of them, along with the Martial Dao Alliance, have been jointly providing me with resources."</p><p></p><p>I see, so that's how it is.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't use theirs or the Martial Dao Alliance's resources, use mine instead. My people don't need them to provide, after all, it's not good to take from others and eat from their mouths." Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xuanhuang asked, "By the way, do I have any resources?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong paused for a moment, a bit short-circuited, and quickly replied, "You have unlimited resources, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Good, then just use mine from now on."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan." Sun Tong hurriedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>From now on, I'll be eating and drinking what the Master provides.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it feels like I'm being kept.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feelings?</p><p></p><p>Previously, there was still the assistant Jinning, but recently Jinning has appeared less, always in the Martial Dao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Plus, Xuanhuang is indeed a recluse, and generally doesn't need people, so Suntong has been doing the assistant work by himself. Seeing the very happy Suntong, Xuanhuang didn't pay attention, and said, "You've comprehended nine-tenths, which is still acceptable. Your body refinement has also reached the third layer. Later, go to my place and get a new visualization diagram. From now on, you can just cultivate it by yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Feeling struck by happiness, Suntong thought he had his own exclusive visualization diagram now.</p><p></p><p>Previously, those four families were still guessing whether the Master Xuan could still refine a visualization diagram?</p><p></p><p>But no one dared to ask. Now it seems it's true.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang can indeed refine many visualization diagrams, but he didn't do so, because progress through competition is the best progress.</p><p></p><p>Progress in laziness is not good.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look at this, do you like it?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xuanhuang had a black crow in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "This is a gift for you, a little trinket to protect your life."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, is this the Corpse Crow you previously cleared away?" Suntong immediately thought of it.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "Yes, it's the Corpse Crow. I've refined it again. You can consecrate it from time to time in the future, until it becomes spiritually attuned to you and develops intelligence. Then it will be yours, a not bad spiritual tool."</p><p></p><p>"This spiritual tool has growth potential, but I don't recommend letting it grow for now. You're still too weak. Wait until it's spiritually attuned to you before considering its growth. In addition, this Corpse Crow has the ability to attack people's divine souls, the ability to patrol, and the ability to teleport short distances. It also has the ability to guard the divine soul, which should be enough for you."</p><p></p><p>Suntong was completely overwhelmed with happiness.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, is this really a gift for me?" He asked unbelievingly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's for you. So that others won't think I'm mistreating the people around me."</p><p></p><p>"No, Master Xuan, no one would dare say that. Being by your side, I'm already very satisfied." Suntong hurriedly denied.</p><p></p><p>It was a genuine feeling, not a false denial.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I was just joking. Take it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang placed the Corpse Crow in Suntong's arms.</p><p></p><p>Suntong's eyes were flushed with excitement, about to cry tears of joy, deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>But then!</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, Jiutong requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>Just as Suntong was about to cry tears of joy, a voice came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Suntong immediately snapped out of his emotional state and said to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Suntong then turned and left, feeling a bit gloomy. Damn that Niubizi, coming at this time.</p><p></p><p>The emotional atmosphere was just right, he was about to cry and get Master Xuan's comfort, and deepen their special bond, but that Niubizi is so annoying.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>With a slight hint of anger, Suntong abruptly opened the door, startling Jiutong greatly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Suntong had used this tone, and Jiutong, well-versed in human relations, felt it wasn't good.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Suntong's reddened eyes, he immediately felt it was over, that this young lady would hold a grudge against him.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what Suntong and the Master were doing, he was certain this was not the right time to come.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Fellow Daoist Suntong, we don't have any major matters. The Dao Sect just wants to start forging tools, and wishes to borrow Master Xuan's Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace."</p><p></p><p>Facing the situation, he could only say this. He'll try to make amends later.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Suntong was also taken aback. Of course, he wouldn't let personal emotions interfere with other matters. He still had that sense of propriety.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the old Dao's words, he was shocked. The Dao Sect has already started forging tools?</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Senior Jiutong, please wait a moment. I'll go report to Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I heard it. Jiutong, come in."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xuanhuang's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them responded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Entering the side hall, Xuanhuang glanced at Jiutong, whose Fusion of Fa and Intent had reached the third layer.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Sect wants to forge tools? Are you all prepared?"</p><p></p><p>Jiutong hurriedly bowed and said, "Master, we're all prepared. We've prepared the mysterious sealing, as well as the firewood, beast corpses, and some elixirs needed for forging. I'm not sure if it's enough. We need Master's guidance."</p><p></p><p>He then handed Xuanhuang a list.</p><p></p><p>There were many beast corpses that the Dao Sect had hunted themselves, as well as many elixirs, mostly blood-replenishing ones. As the one operating the furnace, Jiutong also needed some cultivating elixirs like the Clearing Elixir.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysterious sealing, it was an offensive locking chain, which could restrain people, binding their bodies and souls.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had thought the Dao Sect would forge supportive tools, like the White Bone Pagoda for trials, or tools to assist cultivation. He didn't expect them to forge offensive weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want to forge offensive tools?"</p><p></p><p>Jiutong replied, "Master, with your grace, Qingyun Mountain is already very well-equipped. We have treasures for trials, and stable Heavenly Mechanism Spiritual Qi. Adding more supportive tools won't significantly increase our cultivation speed. What we lack is our own spiritual insight and talent. Therefore, the Dao Sect has decided to first forge offensive tools. This way, we can better assist you and lighten your burden, even if it's a small matter. Although it may be insignificant to you, we have received your boundless grace, so we also want to make our own efforts, no matter how small."</p><p></p><p>Jiutong's strong cultivation alone couldn't make him the Dao Sect leader. His interpersonal skills and eloquence were also essential.</p><p></p><p>Although his words were a bit "sappy", Xuanhuang was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Being polite to those with smiling faces, his attitude was appropriate.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you have the heart for it." Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he continued, "Your preparations are sufficient. The only uncertain factor is you. Can you withstand the consumption of forging the tools? You may need to find more people to take turns operating the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." Jiutong was greatly reassured.</p><p></p><p>The Master had provided guidance, and the problems were not major. There were also solutions. If he couldn't handle it, they could take turns.</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace under control, they could switch operators anytime to maintain the firepower.</p><p></p><p>"Go then."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang finally said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Jiutong left.</p><p></p><p>Suntong watched the departing Senior Jiutong and asked, "Master, aren't you going to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'm everywhere in Qingyun Mountain. Checking on them is very simple."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Suntong understood.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood what she wanted to express: "If you're curious, you can go take a look. It's the first time someone is forging tools, a valuable experience that can also benefit your consecration of the Corpse Crow. I don't need you here for now, so you can go."</p><p></p><p>Suntong hesitated and asked, "Is that okay?"</p><p></p><p>"It's really fine, go."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Suntong happily left.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he came back again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems to be a good day today. Senior Yan from the Confucian Sect came to report that he wants to exchange for Jianmu tree leaves to forge talismans."</p><p></p><p>The returning Suntong reported.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Xuanhuang smiled slightly, thinking: These two sects are competing, huh? What about the Buddhist Sect? Why haven't they made a move, these inactive monks.</p><p></p><p>"Let Yan come in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yan came in and reported to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>He was even more eloquent than Jiutong, making people feel happy with his words.</p><p></p><p>He had many plans, a bright future, the Confucian Sect working hard under Xuanhuang's leadership, and so on.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

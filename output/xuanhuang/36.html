            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The one-eyed dragon didn't care about these things. In the moment he was injured, the mysterious eye crisis warning alerted him, and he didn't care about the bleeding eye as he quickly fled.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>The remaining three from the Exorcism Department were very perplexed.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>"You all, look at what's happening with the Exorcism Department people?"</p><p></p><p>Noticing the situation, the deputy director of the Dao Pavilion, Xia Qing, said to Sun Hui, Li Tongnian, Ma Dazhang and others.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts pavilion members were all focused on the mist inside, and didn't pay much attention to the others.</p><p></p><p>"I also heard a cry." Li Tongnian said.</p><p></p><p>"Did they also take action?" Wu Gang angrily asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui shook his head: "It's unlikely, with so many people here, even if they acted, they wouldn't do it at this moment, they still need to maintain a public face."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui also said: "Don't pay attention to them, I wonder how the Master is doing?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone had heard the intense fighting sounds earlier, but there was no follow-up.</p><p></p><p>At the moment when everyone was waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Master, look, the mist has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang was staring intently, and the moment the thick fog began to dissipate, he immediately noticed it.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but the hesitant three from the Exorcism Department also noticed it.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, the mist has cleared, let's see what's going on." Wei Zixuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, Daoist Master Wei, I feel the eerie aura of the corpse tree has disappeared?" </p><p></p><p>Said a tall thin man.</p><p></p><p>He then produced a glass ball in his hand, which was his strange ability, possessing the power of hallucination and death, at the cost of consuming his own body fat.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the glass ball also had the ability to sense risks.</p><p></p><p>"Disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"Can the corpse tree's strange power still be active?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it have been sealed?" </p><p></p><p>The last person said uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>After he spoke, Wei Zixuan and the tall thin man looked at him puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"I know it's outrageous, I'm just guessing... Look, the mist has dissipated?"</p><p></p><p>The tall thin man and Wei Zixuan followed his gaze towards the mist.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the mist was slowly dissipating, and the dark aura had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Until!</p><p></p><p>Until everyone saw a figure standing in front of a giant tree that had turned green.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Gang from the martial arts pavilion shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, come over, it's safe now." </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't even turn his head as he called out to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>On Wei Zixuan's side.</p><p></p><p>"This?"</p><p></p><p>They were first confused, then shocked.</p><p></p><p>The strange corpse tree had changed, the previous deathly aura had become half-dead, but there was also a lush vitality.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? </p><p></p><p>And Xuanhuang didn't die?</p><p></p><p>Prejudice is like a towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>Although from the memories of the martial arts pavilion members, they knew "Xuanhuang is unbeatable at the same level".</p><p></p><p>But he didn't believe it, how could there be an unbeatable one, it was just a vulgar braggart.</p><p></p><p>But now, faced with this situation, how could it be explained?</p><p></p><p>It's impossible for the strange corpse tree to have turned into a good tree, not fighting with Xuanhuang, but coexisting peacefully with him.</p><p></p><p>So the only answer left is that Xuanhuang had sealed the strange corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>Because the strangeness was sealed, the corpse tree had undergone such a great change, the deathly aura gradually dissipating, and vitality burgeoning.</p><p></p><p>This was the only thing he could think of.</p><p></p><p>As for Xuanhuang's miraculous fusion with the tree, no one would have thought of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go first!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the martial arts and Dao practitioners slowly approaching the giant tree under Xuanhuang's summons, he planned to retreat first.</p><p></p><p>Go back and calm down, and discuss with Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>The excited martial arts and Dao practitioners, after hearing Xuanhuang's call, entered the previously sealed area.</p><p></p><p>Slowly approaching the transformed giant tree.</p><p></p><p>The environment that was once like hell had changed.</p><p></p><p>The endless corpse puppet constructs had disappeared, and the howling remnant souls in the air were gone.</p><p></p><p>Even though it still looked dilapidated, at least it didn't feel like a strange domain anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Master?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Hui asked confusedly.</p><p></p><p>"The strangeness has been eliminated, Sun Hui, arrange for people to check the surroundings for any overlooked things."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"These people? Hmm, you all are not bad, especially this old Taoist priest, you all carefully observe the metamorphosis of this giant tree, see if there are any harvests."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Taoist priest Dao Guan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He was praised, and at such a young age...</p><p></p><p>Why was he so happy to be praised by someone so young?</p><p></p><p>Ah, I understand now, this person is extraordinary, just having sealed the bizarre Corpse Tree at the peak of the first level.</p><p></p><p>Relieved.</p><p></p><p>"The old Taoist is ashamed."</p><p></p><p>Dao Guan Priest replied.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, seeing that Xuan Huang did not have any other expressions, he also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He began to observe the metamorphosing giant tree according to Xuan Huang's guidance.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the towering figure of the giant tree, everyone still couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>Such a huge bizarre thing was actually sealed.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't understand the changes, why the Corpse Tree Bizarre didn't die, but turned green instead.</p><p></p><p>But it did not diminish their shock.</p><p></p><p>Those with high cultivation in the Refining Spirit realm, especially Dao Guan Priest Li Tong and the others, only felt a sense of the giant tree's cycle of life and death, the transformation of yin and yang, a vague and boundless feeling.</p><p></p><p>Close to the Dao!</p><p></p><p>It is a feeling of getting closer to the Dao, so their souls feel a sense of sublimation.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Dao Guan, strictly speaking, are cultivating both Qi and Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The reason is that the spiritual energy is toxic, and the extraordinary is out of control.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, when starting to refine Qi, one does not need to refine Spirit before establishing the foundation.</p><p></p><p>But alas, losing control upon establishing the foundation, they can only take a different path of cultivating Qi and Spirit together, to achieve an auxiliary role.</p><p></p><p>However, this kind of behavior belongs to geniuses, and 90% of the people in the Dao Guan either cultivate Spirit alone, or Qi alone.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating Qi and Spirit together, it's just Dao Guan Priest Li Tong and the like.</p><p></p><p>They are a kind of alternative that opens up after reaching the limit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is said that Dao Guan Priest also has profound martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This old Taoist was already an enlightened person even before the changes in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuan Huang felt that the old Taoist could quickly break through to the extraordinary realm, it's the way of fusing the "Crucible Nine Refinements", if it was just cultivation, it would be much slower.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang saw that 90% of the people had already come out of the feeling of getting close to the Dao, with little harvest.</p><p></p><p>But a few experts had a pensive look.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang asked, "How does it feel?"</p><p></p><p>This was asked to the few experts, Dao Guan Priest, Li Tong, as well as two Refining Artifact realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"This giant tree is like a natural visualization diagram, but we cannot see the whole picture, so there is a bit of direction, but it requires long-term observation."</p><p></p><p>Li Tong finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>He realized that if he didn't speak up, he would have no chance to wait for Xuan Huang to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad, it is indeed a natural visualization diagram, and it is indeed impossible to see the whole picture, causing the spiritual charm not to be prominent, and it is in an unstable metamorphosis period."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang felt so-so about Li Tong's response.</p><p></p><p>"The old Taoist feels that this tree's yin and yang flow, the cycle of life and death, is a rare treasure, and what is more precious is that it has been subdued by the great person, without the sense of bizarre distortion and violence."</p><p></p><p>"If we can reproduce the whole picture, turn it into a visualization diagram, it will definitely be another existence like the 'Crucible Heaven and Earth Visualization Diagram' created by the great person. If it is combined with the great person's will to refine the technique, a new path will appear in my Immortal Dao."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang listened and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Old Taoist Guan is right. However..."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang said, "However, there is something you said that is not quite right, the Crucible Nine Refinements is more suitable for the martial dao, it is to refine the essence as fuel. You cultivators of Qi and Spirit, are naturally inferior to the martial dao in this regard. If you cultivate according to this method, it will only be twice the effort for half the result, or even completely unworkable."</p><p></p><p>"You are more suited to using Qi as fuel, or Spirit as fuel, with the essence as the ignition. Only in this way can you give full play to your greatest role. Those who have surplus can be the new fuel, and those who are lacking can follow and be refined, achieving synergistic prosperity, this is the great Dao."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the people of the Dao Guan were immediately excited.</p><p></p><p>Li Tong inexplicably felt his breathing quicken, "..."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the way of heaven, to make up for the deficiency by taking from the surplus?"</p><p></p><p>As a result, Dao Guan Priest was the first to blurt out.</p><p></p><p>Li Tong looked at him with extreme resentment.</p><p></p><p>As if to say: Dao Guan Priest, can't you just shut up? How could you steal my chance to shine?...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master, how great is the difference between them?" asked Monk Minghui.</p><p></p><p>"The difference is not small. With the same talent, the gap between regularly contemplating the visualization diagram and self-cultivation is at least three times. After all, the visualization diagram is an inanimate object, but it has my will and spiritual resonance covering it, and this is the biggest difference," Xuanhuang explained truthfully.</p><p></p><p>If one does not regularly contemplate the visualization diagram, even if the sea of consciousness has condensed the complete Heavenly-Earth Crucible, the progress would still be much slower. The main reason is what he said - the will and spiritual resonance.</p><p></p><p>The three people, including Zhao Long, heard this and became anxious. Even half the speed would be unbearable, let alone three times. How could it be that while others take one year, they would need three years? This is unacceptable. It seems they must make a choice and study the Dao at Mount Qingyu.</p><p></p><p>"This is not all. Secondly, in order to bear the Way of All Beings, I have refined the spiritual treasure Heavenly-Earth Crucible, which is now in the mid-stage of the first phase of Profound Transformation and is comparable to a tangible existence," Xuanhuang continued.</p><p></p><p>"This crucible can refine the blood qi of fierce beasts and the strange powers. One can frequently observe and learn from it, which is nearly three times the speed. If not in this place, even if the sea of consciousness has comprehended the complete visualization diagram, the refinement of fierce beasts and strange powers would only be one percent of what this crucible can do."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xuanhuang summoned a bronze three-legged Heavenly-Earth Crucible. The awe-inspiring divine might swept across the area, seemingly illusory yet exceptionally powerful. As Xuanhuang said, although it was illusory, it was indistinguishable from a tangible crucible.</p><p></p><p>These words, Xuanhuang had not told the people of the Martial Arts Hall before, and they did not know that his Heavenly-Earth Crucible could also be used to refine fierce beasts and strange powers.</p><p></p><p>They had only thought that after comprehending the complete visualization diagram and condensing it in the sea of consciousness, they could refine it. But now, in comparison, they were still far behind.</p><p></p><p>Using the Venerable Master's spiritual treasure was the right way. Moreover, it was inherently compatible with the visualization diagram in their sea of consciousness, or one could even say it was a projection of the Heavenly-Earth Crucible.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there would be no compatibility issues. Using Xuanhuang's spiritual treasure for refinement could also enhance the visualization diagram in their sea of consciousness, and even faster.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me," Xuanhuang said, waving his hand. The ten people's scorching gazes reluctantly moved away from the Heavenly-Earth Crucible.</p><p></p><p>They went to the courtyard, which was a large one with a huge flower bed made of stacked stones in the center, but no plants were cultivated there.</p><p></p><p>"Come!" Xuanhuang waved his hand, and a towering ancient tree appeared, perfectly fitting into the prepared hole in the center of the flower bed.</p><p></p><p>This giant tree was very eye-catching. Its yin and yang flowed, the trunk was full of vitality, but the roots exuded a dense aura of death, as if one would shorten their lifespan by looking at it for too long.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heavenly-Earth Spiritual Root of the 'Visualizing the Ascending Tree' cultivation method. I have painstakingly cultivated and nurtured it. By a fortuitous encounter, it has devoured a strange corpse tree, so the Ascending Tree has solidified its form. It is both a spiritual root and a spiritual treasure," Xuanhuang explained.</p><p></p><p>"This tree of yin and yang, life and death, is a rare spiritual root for cultivators of the Qi Refinement Dao. The place it resides in is the Blessed Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>True enough, the Ascending Tree that had settled in the center emitted an aura of yin and yang, life and death, drawing endless spiritual qi from the surroundings. Even the chaotic and toxic spiritual qi of the Heavenly Extremes was guided and purified by its yin-yang and life-death transformations, with the celestial patterns straightened out.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the spiritual qi absorbed here was all pure, and the celestial patterns comprehended were the undistorted ones, thanks to the tree's refinement.</p><p></p><p>Its function was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Rumbleâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky thundered without a sound, and the Ascending Tree's spiritual mechanism swept across the area within a five-li radius of Mount Qingyu.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi became pure, and the celestial patterns became complete. The cultivators working at the Martial Arts Hall on the mountain all felt the change in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"What a comfortable feeling. What's going on?" they exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I feel the spiritual qi has changed, the impurities have been removed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"All the resentment and evil desires have been erased."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, I feel that the heavenly mechanisms are now normal, without any distortion."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at that big tree in the Xuanshi Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, isn't this the same eerie corpse tree from before? How did the Xuanshi Master transform it into a precious tree?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be the Xuanshi Master's methods. As long as we are within the coverage of this great tree, won't we be able to cultivate without any hindrances?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so optimistic. You may be able to cultivate within the precious tree's coverage, but can you go outside of it without losing control?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Xuanshi Master did this to provide us with a better environment, so that we don't lose control. But it doesn't mean we can't go anywhere else. What's the use of cultivating if we can't go anywhere?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Towering Celestial Tree sparked a discussion among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's courtyard, especially among the qi-refining disciples, they were completely awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Without saying anything else, they decided to settle down on Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>If it's really necessary, they can go out to handle some matters, but they'll immediately come back.</p><p></p><p>With this precious Towering Tree here, the qi-refining cultivation is like sitting on an airplane.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Xuanhuang asked with rare pride.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi Master's methods are unfathomable, almost reaching the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, still far from it."</p><p></p><p>"But with this Towering Tree here, Qingyun Mountain will constantly change and evolve. I've previously considered how to provide the necessary medicinal pills for the extraordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"After research, and by utilizing certain methods (the method being the extension of the small world's heavenly will, with the Towering Tree as the fulcrum), the Towering Tree can refine the chaotic spiritual energy of the heavens. This way, within the Towering Tree's coverage, we can cultivate spiritual herbs without worrying about losing control."</p><p></p><p>This was Xuanhuang's recent plan for providing medicinal pill supplies.</p><p></p><p>As for weapons, there was also a solution.</p><p></p><p>The method is consistent - if the Heavenly Forge can refine intent, it can naturally also forge weapons, as they are all about refining.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Sun, in the future, you can set up a dedicated spiritual herb field within Qingyun Mountain's sphere of influence to cultivate the spiritual herbs we find."</p><p></p><p>"Once the spiritual herbs mature, we can then research extraordinary medicinal pills."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Sun Hui hurriedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Martial Hall will be exponentially strengthened by the Towering Celestial Tree.</p><p></p><p>This area of five li will become a place of immense value.</p><p></p><p>It seems they need to plan this out carefully.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then said, "Of course, it won't be useful in the short term, as the spiritual herbs also need time to grow. For now, the main source will still be the strange beasts."</p><p></p><p>He then went back into the room and casually waved his hand, causing two books and two diagrams to appear.</p><p></p><p>"These are the 'Visualization Diagram of the Towering Celestial Tree' and the cultivation method 'True Technique of the Towering Tree', as well as the 'Visualization Diagram of the Great Abyss' and the cultivation method 'Nine Seal Technique of the Great Abyss'."</p><p></p><p>He then handed them to Song Hongliang.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma and the disciples of the Dao Hall, including you, can study these two visualization diagrams and learn the cultivation techniques. Your comprehension this time will quickly transform into the corresponding visualization diagrams."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Xuanshi Master, for imparting the techniques." </p><p></p><p>The crowd expressed their deep gratitude. Imparting the Dao and resolving doubts - this is what a true teacher would do.</p><p></p><p>By handing these over to them, how generous of heart is he?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, do you have any other questions? While I'm here, let me answer them for you."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt much more relaxed now that the necessary arrangements were made. The rest was up to their individual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang deeply hoped that they would grow stronger quickly, so that the Three Artifacts could make rapid progress with more people.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi Master, I..." </p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Jin Ning, who was stammering a bit, finding it difficult to speak.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled and said, "Speak without hesitation."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

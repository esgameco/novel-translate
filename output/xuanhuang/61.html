        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes... what kind of genius is in the heart of Master Xuan?" </p><p></p><p>Jin Ning asked with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang was taken aback, "Why do you ask this?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, it was the elders and the pavilion master who asked me to ask this. They want to know what a genius is, should one focus on refining the Fa or merging the Fa?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning finished speaking, looking depressed at the group.</p><p></p><p>He always felt too immature, being fooled by these old fellows.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xuan Huang smiled: "There's nothing I can't say about this. In my opinion, a genius, at least before the sudden enlightenment, can comprehend the complete visualization diagram in one instance of enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you all are still quite good, but lacking."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang looked at the expectant crowd.</p><p></p><p>With these words, the crowd felt embarrassed, finally understanding what kind of genius Master Xuan considered.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>Alas, they were not that.</p><p></p><p>It hurt so much.</p><p></p><p>"A person of extraordinary talent, under my will's guidance, comprehending the complete visualization diagram in one instance - this is the standard."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded, is the standard this high? "Alright, although you are not the ultimate geniuses, you are still talents of extraordinary quality. Moreover, you all have a very strong accumulation, surpassing the ordinary for you ten is just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>"After surpassing the ordinary, because the Fa I created is extremely special, the essence, energy, and spirit need to be coordinated and refined. Therefore, the first stage of the Mysterious Transformation requires at least 200 years of lifespan, giving you enough time to climb..."</p><p></p><p>"Determination and diligence themselves are a talent, the best supplement to absolute talent."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dazed crowd, Xuan Huang continued: "I know you are asking about refining the Fa or merging the Fa?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me use you three as examples."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang pointed at the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist.</p><p></p><p>"In your case, since you have cultivated the seven layers of refining qi and refining spirit, it means at least one of the three - essence, energy, and spirit - has reached the seventh layer."</p><p></p><p>"With this premise, it means your will has no obstacles in reaching the seventh layer, the time you need to spend is to make up for the deficiency in essence, to also reach the seventh layer."</p><p></p><p>"That is to say, to make your will progress faster... you need at least one aspect of the three - essence, energy, and spirit - to be strong, to lead the other two to progress, is this clear?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone understood, the will integrates essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>To make the will progress faster, at least one of the three must be outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuan Huang said again: "Refining the Fa, merging the Fa, is at least a ratio of 10 to 1. Merging the Fa can be perfected in one year, but refining the Fa would require ten years... I suggest you cultivate both, first merge the Fa to improve your abilities, then refine the Fa to strengthen your foundation."</p><p></p><p>"At the higher levels, you need your own foundation to support it. My merging of the Fa can let you start, but to achieve the ultimate powerful ones, you still need a strong will of your own."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd all made their decision in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Then go."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang waved his hand, letting the ten people leave.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The ten people bid farewell to Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So this is the genius that Master Xuan spoke of? No wonder we were overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I knew it. I just said that the genius Master Xuan spoke of was measured by Master Xuan himself. Even if we can't match Master Xuan in the slightest, it's not something we can covet. You all insisted that I ask."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning still felt resentful, he really couldn't outmaneuver these old fellows.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Jin Ning, your words are mistaken. You are now ahead of us, the first to comprehend the complete visualization diagram. By ancient standards, you would be our senior disciple. A senior disciple should take on the responsibility."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the Daoist Master is right. Jin Ning, you are the senior disciple," Wu Gang patted Jin Ning's shoulder and encouraged him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior disciple?" Jin Ning was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Is this true? It does seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>"Senior disciple, can you share your feelings after comprehending the complete visualization diagram?"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma took the opportunity to ask.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Jin Ning expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning told himself to stay calm.</p><p></p><p>But they were all the hall master and senior predecessors, asking him like this...</p><p></p><p>He was not a true Xuan master, he could not remain unfazed, nor could he be as calm as water in the face of such treatment.</p><p></p><p>It seems he still needs to 'cultivate' more.</p><p></p><p>"It feels very strange, as if I have connected to the Xuan master's spiritual treasure furnace. I can faintly draw upon the power of the spiritual treasure furnace... I have chosen the path of fusion. In the future, with each refined talisman, I can deepen my connection to the spiritual treasure furnace and borrow more power."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, after the complete visualization diagram is formed, it will replace my will to suppress the divine soul, which means I can continue to refine my body without worrying about losing control."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Of course, it's not an unlimited enhancement of body refinement. I need to continuously engrave talismans and deepen my connection to the spiritual treasure furnace, so that I can borrow more power... The more I can borrow, the more I can enhance my body refinement level."</p><p></p><p>"...As for the other aspects, I haven't utilized them yet, but I feel I now have the means to deal with the strange phenomena."</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, the others seemed to have a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai said, "Can you gently activate the spiritual treasure furnace in your sea of consciousness to resist the strange phenomena?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Mr. Yan Lai is right, that's exactly it. I can lightly borrow the power of the spiritual treasure furnace to resist, but the strength is not great. I need to continue refining the talismans... The more talismans I engrave and the deeper my connection to the spiritual treasure, the stronger the power I can borrow."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang said, "So it's just as the Xuan master said? Then how many talismans do you think you can refine at the moment?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning pondered for a moment, "This... My will is barely at the peak of the first layer, not yet reaching the second layer. That means I can easily refine one talisman, but the second one would be a bit difficult."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist masters, "You senior predecessors, the Xuan master previously said that after you comprehend the complete visualization diagram, you will progress very quickly... It should be that your will is very strong, at the level of the fourth layer of will cultivation. With no obstacles at the fourth layer of will, you can easily engrave four talismans. And you are also at the seventh layer of qi and spirit refinement, which means there are no barriers before the seventh layer of will cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The three of them nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were old fellows with accumulated strength over the years.</p><p></p><p>The three of them also chose to temporarily focus on the path of fusion, and would catch up on the path of refinement after becoming more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, they were reminded of the two books and two diagrams in Sun Hui's possession.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Ming Hui felt his spiritual cultivation talent was better, so he planned to study the Guiqu Great Grindstone visualization diagram and the Guiqu Nine Seal Technique.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai and Jiu Tong Daoist, however, were determined to study the Tong Tian Tree visualization diagram and the Tong Tian True Technique.</p><p></p><p>The others, Master Ma was the Tong Tian Tree visualization diagram.</p><p>Zhao Long the warrior was naturally the Spiritual Treasure Furnace visualization diagram.</p><p>Du Ming was also the Tong Tian Tree visualization diagram and the Tong Tian True Technique.</p><p></p><p>Only Venerable Ming Hui was focused on spirit refinement, the others were all on the paths of body and qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>But some of them wanted to try dual or even triple cultivation, to personally experience it. If the progress was good, then a more comprehensive approach would be better.</p><p></p><p>If it greatly hindered their progress, they could only focus on one path.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Jiu Tong Daoist, Venerable Ming Hui, and Yan Lai.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

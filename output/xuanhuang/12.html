        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not pay much attention to the strange love letter for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"The sun is shining, it's a good day, a good day to achieve the eighth layer of refinement."</p><p></p><p>After a night of settling and resting, the seventh layer of refinement was already stable, and according to the plan, he began to assault the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>He now had a strange medium, and if the situation developed, perhaps the strange love letter would come to his dream through the medium tonight.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the stronger he became, the better. If he could resolve it himself, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was actually confident.</p><p></p><p>First, this strange love letter was not too strong.</p><p></p><p>It should have just appeared not long ago, and his younger cousin might be its first target, even if there were more, it wouldn't exceed ten people.</p><p></p><p>Newly born anomalies are much weaker than those that have grown up.</p><p></p><p>The more living beings an anomaly kills, the more the seven emotions and six desires absorbed after their deaths, the more terrifying it becomes.</p><p></p><p>The best ideal way is to discover and seal it immediately.</p><p></p><p>But this is just a beautiful wish.</p><p></p><p>Some unreasonable anomalies, their killing patterns are unsolvable, and they cannot be controlled as soon as they appear.</p><p></p><p>There are records abroad of the "Mist Anomaly".</p><p></p><p>As soon as it appeared, 90% of the people in a town died.</p><p></p><p>It immediately became a disaster.</p><p></p><p>The other day, I saw a description on the Zhenxie APP, and it said that even if the place was quickly isolated, the Mist Anomaly now covered an area the size of half a county.</p><p></p><p>And the strange alley that appeared in South City a few days ago was the same.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang deduced that the strange love letter was still in its early stage.</p><p></p><p>His younger cousin had been dreaming for two days, and the cursed voice was still a bit distant, which means it would take at least five to seven days to get close to his younger cousin.</p><p></p><p>An anomaly's killing pattern takes seven days to form, which means it is still very weak.</p><p></p><p>The pattern is still in the process of coalescing, and the killing pattern is not yet stable.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of "new anomaly", Xuanhuang has a great grasp.</p><p></p><p>The Void Saber was created for this purpose.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Putting away the scattered thoughts, Xuanhuang calmed down and entered a meditative state.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, five large Elixir Pellets entered his stomach, turning into firewood, burning his blood and refining the will in the furnace.</p><p></p><p>As time goes on, the energy required to temper the will becomes greater, and Xuanhuang's blood and qi at the seventh layer of refinement can't help but burn.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the will, the greater the firepower required.</p><p></p><p>It's not the same force as the first and eighth layers.</p><p></p><p>With the blood and qi power of the seventh layer of refinement, Xuanhuang also swallowed five large Elixir Pellets, and the combined firepower was fierce.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>He still underestimated the difficulty of reaching the eighth layer of refinement.</p><p></p><p>Until noon, the energy of the five large Elixir Pellets was exhausted, and Xuanhuang's own seventh layer of refinement blood and qi was about to run out.</p><p></p><p>He still hadn't broken through to the eighth layer of refinement, but he had reached the peak of the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>To continue, his essence, qi, and spirit wouldn't hold up, so Xuanhuang chose to stop here for today.</p><p></p><p>This was actually within Xuanhuang's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the eighth layer of refinement is the late stage of refinement, and it's impossible to advance one layer per day like in the early stage.</p><p></p><p>When refining from the fourth to seventh layers, Xuanhuang was already very satisfied to maintain one layer per day.</p><p></p><p>For the eighth, ninth layers, to perfection, and then to the transcendent realm, even Xuanhuang would need some time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's refine the eighth layer of the body first."</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, Xuanhuang swallowed another handful of large Elixir Pellets.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't reach the eighth layer of refinement for now, he would first raise the refinement of his body.</p><p></p><p>The will is the integration of essence, qi, and spirit. With the seventh layer of will, the body reaching the ninth layer of refinement is just a matter of filling.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough...</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, the large Elixir Pellets that had been refined began to permeate Xuanhuang's blood and qi, and his body was also gradually becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>Both in hardness and flexibility.</p><p></p><p>In addition, his originally thin blood and qi had become more dense due to the eighth layer of refinement, and there was a feeling of wanting to break out.</p><p></p><p>Continue to control it at will.</p><p></p><p>After gaining control at will, Xuanhuang began his third task of the day, refining the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>The night fell.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang opened the book that hid the strange love letter and carefully examined the anomaly's medium.</p><p></p><p>A yellowed old paper, with a slightly sentimental half-white text.</p><p></p><p>Emitting a gray light that Xuanhuang's will could observe.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not store the love letter in his consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>This thing may look thin, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The responsibility is not light.</p><p></p><p>It will pose risks to your own consciousness space, so be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, even if the consciousness space can be easily detained, the Xuanhuang will not be placed in the consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>What if the consciousness space can isolate the strange rules of the love letter?</p><p></p><p>Then it would be bad for the younger brother, as his work would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>After looking for a while...</p><p></p><p>"Does this thing require me to sleep in order to work?"</p><p></p><p>"If I don't sleep, will it not be able to enter my dream?"</p><p></p><p>Fell into deep thought! Had to follow the routine, sitting cross-legged, with the void knife resting on the folded legs.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Xuanhuang relaxed his consciousness and entered a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>In the vast and obscure realm.</p><p></p><p>How far is a person from the dream? Very far, as you cannot find it.</p><p></p><p>Very close, as you can enter it as soon as you fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>In the obscurity...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly felt a series of impact sounds, accompanied by a slight pain.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that something was striking his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of insight.</p><p></p><p>"Am I dreaming?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang discovered the mystery, realizing that he was currently in a dream.</p><p></p><p>As for the impact sounds? "Although my will is not extraordinary, it has reached the peak of an ordinary person, belonging to the beginning of the transformation, so it is somewhat supernatural."</p><p></p><p>"The impact sounds are the strange love letter trying to enter my dream, but being blocked by the protective shell formed by my will?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it that it hasn't dragged me into the dream yet, and has already been blocked by the door formed by my will?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang discovered another ability of his will.</p><p></p><p>The integration of essence, energy, spirit, and will.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that dreams are also managed by the will.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, it doesn't seem unreasonable, as a powerful will managing dreams is quite logical.</p><p></p><p>"If I want to wake up, I just need to leave with a thought, doesn't this mean that the currently weak strange love letter is powerless against me?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, it cannot pull me into the dream under the strength of my will."</p><p></p><p>This is quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>With such a long buffer time, it will be difficult for the strange love letter to deal with Xuanhuang, whose will is so firm.</p><p></p><p>"However, since I'm here."</p><p></p><p>Looked at the dream realm belonging to himself, under the protection of his will.</p><p></p><p>Hallucinatory, splendid, and difficult to describe in words.</p><p></p><p>A layer of transparent protective shell, this is the manifestation of his will.</p><p></p><p>Outside is the boundless and dazzling brilliance, which may be the dream world of all beings.</p><p></p><p>Remember that the 'Nightmare World' is one of the six A-level disasters, and this may be it.</p><p></p><p>Called the Nightmare World, perhaps because those who enter encounter strange events.</p><p></p><p>With strange invasions, how can there be good dreams, so it is called the Nightmare World.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, it is not the case.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering, you will find that the dream realm is the dream world of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>It is colorful and diverse.</p><p></p><p>It's just that after the strange invasion, panic, gloom, and hatred have replaced the previous beauty, happiness, and hope.</p><p></p><p>After appreciating it a little...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not forget that he still had work to do.</p><p></p><p>The strange love letter is still wandering and striking, and although his will is strong, it is not yet at the highest level.</p><p></p><p>Giving the strange love letter time, it will eventually break through, and then he won't be comfortable either.</p><p></p><p>It's better to let it in.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuanhuang retracted his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The previous dream space disappeared, and an ancient-style mansion appeared.</p><p></p><p>Just like the younger brother's description.</p><p></p><p>Then, a secret aura wrapped around, trying to turn Xuanhuang into a "dissolute young master".</p><p></p><p>But it failed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will shattered that aura.</p><p></p><p>He didn't let himself become a dissolute young master like the younger brother, and the void knife in his hand didn't disappear.</p><p></p><p>Although this void knife is the condensation of the void knife's will in the dream realm, not a physical object.</p><p></p><p>But it has two edges, with the same effect.</p><p></p><p>"Heartless man... beast... woo woo..."</p><p></p><p>"Dog man, give me back my child's life..."</p><p></p><p>Whimpering and cursing.</p><p></p><p>Like a deep curse, the voices entered Xuanhuang's mind, assaulting his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

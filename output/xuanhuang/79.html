        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purpose is to gain fame, and on Qingyun Mountain, there are constantly arriving martial artists and cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Some join the Taoist sect, some join the martial alliance, some join the Confucian sect, some are from the Buddhist sect, and some are independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So it is said that Qingyun Mountain is constantly expanding, the area covered by the buildings has already been planned, but there is no dense gathering, as too dense would not be good.</p><p></p><p>In the central square, the senior members of the Taoist sect stood together solemnly, as if holding a grand ritual.</p><p></p><p>As the time came, the Sect Leader Jiu Tong, with a majestic bearing, stepped onto the platform.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Taoists, our Taoist sect has been granted the cultivation methods by the Venerable Master, the Taoist sect..."</p><p></p><p>He spoke grandly.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he stepped back, and three more Taoist priests stepped forward to stand beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Summon the Furnace of Heaven and Earth!"</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong shouted.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, and the Furnace of Heaven and Earth in the small world rumbled.</p><p></p><p>"Today is the beginning of your business, don't mess it up. As long as you do well this time, there will be opportunities for you to sneak a bite in the future, go."</p><p></p><p>With a hum, the Furnace of Heaven and Earth transformed into a blue rainbow light and headed towards the square.</p><p></p><p>"Look, it's here, this is the precious Furnace of Heaven and Earth refined by the Venerable Master."</p><p></p><p>It should be called a Fa Qi (Dharma Implement), but the martial artists prefer to call Xuanhuang's Furnace of Heaven and Earth, the Penetrating Heavenly Tree, and the Great Millstone the "precious treasures".</p><p></p><p>After all, the archetypes they comprehend are these three implements, which also suppress their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>Calling them Fa Qi is too undignified, it's better to call them precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the implements forged by others are called Fa Qi.</p><p></p><p>This group of people has a typical double standard, treating them differently.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Furnace of Heaven and Earth? I've never seen the actual object before, only the comprehension diagram. Indeed, the Tao flows, it is not an ordinary object, just seeing it makes one feel close to the Tao."</p><p></p><p>"This precious treasure is refined by the Venerable Master, it is the source that suppresses our spiritual souls, not something ordinary Fa Qi can compare to. And this treasure is adept at forging and elixir refining, it is a blessing for us."</p><p></p><p>"I've seen the Penetrating Heavenly Tree, the visualization object of the 'Heavenly Earth Law', it is truly extraordinary. I haven't seen the Venerable Master's third precious treasure, the Great Millstone, I can only imagine it must be an extraordinary object as well."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, someone reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you're mistaken, the Venerable Master has a fourth precious treasure, an apparently dilapidated longsword, according to my investigation, it was the Venerable Master's first weapon, taken from the previous Southern City Martial Arts Hall, and has been constantly refined by the Venerable Master, so it has undergone changes."</p><p></p><p>His words aroused the curiosity of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Does this fellow Daoist know the name of the Venerable Master's fourth precious treasure?"</p><p></p><p>But he shook his head, "Not many know, the name of the sword has not been passed down, but it must be extraordinary without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>This statement was met with disdain from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Someone laughed, "Of course the treasure refined by the Venerable Master would not be ordinary."</p><p></p><p>The crowd chuckled in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Someone suddenly said, "Oh yes, a few days ago, the Venerable Master defeated the Mysterious Alley, do you all know about that?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded, and one person replied, "Of course we know, the Exorcism Department in Southern City has been publicizing it these past two days, even hinting that the previous records about the Mysterious Alley were inaccurate."</p><p></p><p>"Haha," someone laughed, "So the Venerable Master has 'slapped their face', I heard the information the Exorcism Department gave the Venerable Master had a huge discrepancy with how the Venerable Master dealt with the Mysterious Alley. The Exorcism Department's Spiritual Masters' writing was so outrageous that the Venerable Master wanted to exchange ideas with Spiritual Masters who had previous experience dealing with the Mysterious Alley... only to find that the 'Spiritual Master' was just handling the aftermath, haha."</p><p></p><p>"How do you know all this?"</p><p></p><p>The person smiled, "I have a fellow Daoist named Gao Jue, his information is quite reliable."</p><p></p><p>The crowd didn't delve deeper, and someone said, "Previously, the Spiritual Masters' records were the final say, they could write whatever they wanted. Now it's all exposed as full of mistakes, haha."</p><p></p><p>The person didn't completely reveal it, but those who understood got the gist.</p><p></p><p>"Look, the Confucian and Buddhist factions have arrived, and the Grand Marshal of the Martial Alliance, Sun Hui, has also come."</p><p></p><p>"Do you see that woman?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the stunningly beautiful one, she's the Venerable Master's assistant."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the Taoist sect is really going all out. This is the first time they're attempting to forge, it's a pioneering move. I was just thinking of joining the Taoist sect, it seems I've made the right decision."</p><p></p><p>A companion said, "Aren't you a martial artist? Why not join the Martial Alliance, isn't that the highest aspiration of martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>He replied, "You don't understand. The Martial Alliance has been doing a Genius Plan recently, with my age and cultivation, there's no way I can be selected. Plus, those with martial talent usually choose the Martial Alliance first, the competition will be fierce. The Taoist sect also has a Cultivation Body division, and it's a centuries-old power, joining the Taoist sect is more reliable."</p><p></p><p>His companion scoffed, "So you're just afraid you can't compete with the geniuses in the Martial Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, my old friend, it's hard to get by, you know." He smiled bitterly, "What can I do? Qingyun Mountain is changing too fast, the situation is different from a few days ago. The Martial Alliance used to welcome people like me warmly, but now they're being very selective."</p><p></p><p>His companion understood his old friend's thoughts, Qingyun Mountain was indeed evolving too rapidly, changing every moment.</p><p></p><p>Every day, talented cultivators from all over were gathering here. </p><p></p><p>At this stage, those who could cross the wilderness to reach Qingyun Mountain were not only powerful, but also steadfast in their Dao. They were not just strong, but had wisdom and experience to match.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the Martial Alliance has selected their first genius talent?"</p><p></p><p>He replied, "Yes, a young man named Lin Fan, 15 years old. Not only did he comprehend the visualization diagram on his first try, he comprehended three-tenths of it, a true young prodigy."</p><p></p><p>His companion sighed, "People are just better than others, I struggled for a long time to comprehend the Penetrating Heavenly Tree visualization, but I couldn't even reach the entry level, let alone three-tenths."</p><p></p><p>He said, "That's why it's wise to know oneself. I've recognized my own limitations, joining the Martial Alliance's fierce competition is not for me. It's better to join the Taoist sect, where there are many options, I can find a place that suits me in the cultivation of immortality and various arts."</p><p></p><p>His companion accepted his decision, just as he was about to speak...</p><p></p><p>They saw the Buddhist, Confucian, and Martial factions finish their congratulations, and the Taoist sect began the forging.</p><p></p><p>"Begin!"</p><p></p><p>A loud shout brought the whispering crowd back to attention, all eyes fixed on the Taoist sect's first forging attempt.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong chanted the incantation, and the furnace lid of the Furnace of Heaven and Earth flew up.</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong gathered all his spiritual power to activate the Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Enter!"</p><p></p><p>A black chain was thrown into the Furnace of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it entered, the black chain instinctively struggled and raged, causing the Furnace to tremble, and the controlling Jiu Tong to suffer a huge impact, his spiritual energy thrown into chaos, and a mouthful of fresh blood nearly spurted out.</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong dared not be careless, quickly regulating the disrupted spiritual energy, gritting his teeth to prevent the blood from spraying out, only allowing a red line to trickle from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>The observing Taoist disciples were alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm alright, don't panic."</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong spoke.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre struggle and distortion of the spiritual consciousness, this was the most violent impact, the first difficult hurdle of forging.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xuanhuang was unaffected was that the impact did not affect him.</p><p></p><p>If the Furnace of Heaven and Earth could speak, it would scold Jiu Tong as an amateur. When the Master controlled it, it was as steady as an old...hand.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This old Taoist is not up to par, his self-control is too lacking, and he even got himself injured, which is really not good. If it weren't for the purpose of earning the price difference, I wouldn't have let them get their hands on him.</p><p></p><p>But Jiu Tong heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The suppressed riot of the mysterious consciousness has been quelled, and the next step will be smooth sailing, merely consuming spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>My two shidi (younger martial brothers) and one dao companion have already prepared to take turns with me.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of time now.</p><p></p><p>"Half the success is achieved."</p><p></p><p>The group of Confucian scholars gathered around Yan Lai, and an elder said.</p><p></p><p>"Forging artifacts is more difficult than drawing talismans, the Taoists truly have great ambition. We in the Confucian faction also need to start preparing for artifact forging."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, but if we were to forge magical artifacts, what would be our first choice?"</p><p></p><p>Someone asked.</p><p></p><p>"I observe that the Taoists' choice is weapons of slaughter, it seems they want to earn more using these weapons of slaughter. I heard the Blood Moon World is about to be opened up, the full-scale development is imminent, and there are many extraordinary and fierce beasts in the Blood Moon World, the Taoists' purpose of forging chain artifacts is self-evident."</p><p></p><p>"And the Blood Pool Secret Realm is also about to be officially developed, just releasing ordinary animals can catalyze the emergence of fierce beasts, the essence blood, spiritual energy, and spiritual wisdom of these fierce beasts can all be used as resources for advancement. Chain artifacts can not only kill the enemy, but also restrain them, the Taoists have thought it through very thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yan Lai asked, "How's the investigation on the Mysterious Fire going?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it has been confirmed. That mystery is a Mysterious Fire approaching the second level, born from a supermarket fire disaster. The Heavenly Market has already sealed off that supermarket, the Mysterious Fire and Mysterious Anomaly are still in the supermarket, we have, at great cost, persuaded the Exorcism Department of the Heavenly Market to let us manage and suppress it."</p><p></p><p>The person finished and asked, "What are your thoughts, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai said, "Correct, Xuanshi previously mentioned that if there is any Mysterious Fire type of Mysterious Anomaly, we can inform him, or exchange it. We won't exchange with Xuanshi, our first artifact will be targeted at the Mysterious Fire Mysterious Anomaly, and then we will personally seal the Mysterious Fire Mysterious Anomaly, and then give it to Xuanshi."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you referring to the Jade Box Mysterious Anomaly?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai nodded and said, "Yes, the Jade Box Mysterious Anomaly, this Mysterious Anomaly is extremely rare, as everyone knows, jade has the ability to seal Mysterious Anomalies, and since a Mysterious Anomaly was born from jade, its sealing ability will be greatly enhanced. When the time comes, we will seal or restrain the Mysterious Fire in the Jade Box."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, sir, you are truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I admit the Taoists are very strong, but when it comes to understanding human nature and grasping the thoughts of superiors, we Confucians are the best... Cough, cough, I mean in the aspect of insight into human hearts, not flattering, don't misunderstand."</p><p></p><p>"No need to explain, we all understand, but be careful of those bald-headed monks, they are also adept in this area."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the monks are also skilled in this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing their conversation, Yan Lai felt a bit ashamed, but the fact is just as they said. Even he himself is like this.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that it is the way of the world, learning a bit is always useful.</p><p></p><p>Besides, there are also many upright and righteous people in our Confucian faction, there is always a duality, nothing is absolute, being too absolute is not good.</p><p></p><p>Wisdom, this is wisdom.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai changed the topic, "Is everyone ready for the talisman forging later?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, everything is ready, you just need to focus on engraving the talismanic scripts, we have taken care of the rest."</p><p></p><p>"That's good." Yan Lai smiled, his group of colleagues are still reliable in handling matters and managing things.</p><p></p><p>In fact, while they may not surpass others in cultivation talent, in handling affairs, dealing with miscellaneous tasks, and management, they are absolutely top-notch.</p><p></p><p>It's time to bring out their strengths and gradually take control of some power.</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation on the Buddhist side?" Yan Lai asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the Buddhists are currently not making any moves, they are busy reorganizing the Buddhist faction, it must be said that Master Minghui has great ambition."</p><p></p><p>Even if they call the monks "bald-headed", they still respect Minghui and the others.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai said frustratedly, "Not to mention them, we also need to reorganize ourselves a bit, our reputation is not much better than the Buddhists. Although we Confucians often take the blame, we still need to revive our reputation. The most valuable thing about us Confucians is that we are pragmatic and understand how to change and adapt to the trend, this is not something to be ashamed of, we need to continue maintaining this, only those who survive to the end have the right to comment, do you all have this awareness?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>While they were discussing and planning, a few unconventional individuals with cold and gloomy gazes were looking at the Taoists forging artifacts, looking at Qingyun Mountain, and the lively and vigorous atmosphere of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"This Xuanhuang has already become a force to be reckoned with."</p><p></p><p>A cold-faced middle-aged man, who was a disciple of the Demon Cult, said, sensing their auras.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers?"</p><p></p><p>The man asked a young woman beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers have gone to Mount Tai, but the specific city is still uncertain, but they said they will definitely arrive in two days."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man heard this and became very angry, "They are dragging their feet like this, do the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers think they can talk back to us, the Demon Cult disciples?"</p><p></p><p>The woman heard this and said frustratedly, "Master, you don't know, currently there are not many available Spiritual Assassins that can be hired. Many people are still wary of the previous overwhelming forum discussions, the Exorcism Department, Golden Token Envoys, and the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions, they all praise Xuanhuang highly, and even the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists have allied themselves with him. With so many forces supporting him, many assassins are also cautious."</p><p></p><p>She continued, "It's just the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers on the verge of losing control, almost to the point of madness, they don't care. It's not easy to force them, if we push them too hard... their instability, who knows, they may retaliate. In our communication with the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers, we have to coax them."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man did not continue to ask.</p><p></p><p>As the woman said, those who dare to accept the task of killing Xuanhuang are not many.</p><p></p><p>The death of Xie Longji has already been exposed, and the incident of Demon Puppet Pavilion Master Gou Jianren has also been exposed.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Department of the Summer Capital was furious and issued a kill order on Demon Puppet Pavilion Master Gou Jianren.</p><p></p><p>Daring to harm a deputy director of the Exorcism Department and harboring a spy, this is a provocation to the Exorcism Department headquarters.</p><p></p><p>So, even though the major evil organizations have issued kill orders on Xuanhuang, those who dare to accept the task are few.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Gou Jianren's strenuous efforts that they found the Three Mysterious Rats Brothers.</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother is a second-level Spiritual Master, and the two younger brothers are at the peak of the first level, they are an extremely formidable trio. The Mysterious Rats can hide in the void and conceal themselves, and with the three of them working together, the threat is enormous.</p><p></p><p>However, the three brothers are all on the verge of losing control, the Demon Cult has promised a huge amount of divine blood as the cost, which is why they were able to mobilize the three.</p><p></p><p>It's still a half-payment transaction mode.</p><p></p><p>"The three brothers should be using the divine blood we provided to suppress the Mysterious Anomaly invasion, so they are coming slowly, which is better, it will increase our chances of success," the woman said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I hope so," the man said.</p><p></p><p>"I have the Demon Puppet Pavilion Master's instructions, Xuanhuang must die, if he doesn't die, how can the two of us face the Pavilion Master?" the man said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we will definitely work hard, we won't disappoint the Pavilion Master," the woman said.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, the Pavilion Master said that as long as everyone works hard, there is a chance to get a replacement opportunity, you must take it seriously," the man said, painting a grand picture. Of course, it might also be the grand picture that Gou Jianren painted for him.</p><p></p><p>Even knowing it's a grand picture, their eyes still burned with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, this Qingyun Mountain is really depressing, it's hard to bear staying here. Xuanhuang must die, the place where he is is so hateful."</p><p></p><p>The man, seeing that the Taoists' artifact was about to succeed, did not want to face this situation.</p><p></p><p>Plus, it was indeed hard to bear staying in Qingyun Mountain, after all, the Mysterious Anomalies were suppressed by the Demon-Subduing Wood.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he chose to leave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, I humbly request your subscriptions.

        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These three people were Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist - Yan Lai, Daoist Master Jiu Tong, and Monk Ming Hui.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine that a single moment of enlightenment from the Xuanhuang could have led these three to directly comprehend 50% of the Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>And it seems they still have room for further progress.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had never seen such innate talent before, they were only slightly inferior to himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the willpower of these three was extremely formidable. One could imagine that without the cultivation of willpower techniques, their willpower had already reached the fourth layer, which was the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, these three were all at the seventh layer of qi cultivation, with the monk and Daoist master at the fourth layer of physical cultivation, and Yan Lai at the third layer. Not only that, their spiritual attainment was also exceptional, reaching the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>This was simply miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Without any willpower cultivation techniques, their qi and spiritual cultivation had reached the limits of willpower.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these three were at the fourth layer of willpower, otherwise their seventh layer of qi and spirit would have been out of control.</p><p></p><p>From Qilong's memories, Xuanhuang roughly determined the identities of these three.</p><p></p><p>They should be the three directors of the Zhenxie Headquarters, the three legendary figures of the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist sects of the Xia Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the strongest Xuanhuang had seen was Daoist Master Ma, whose qi cultivation was approaching the sixth layer, and the unseen Mr. Liu, who was at the sixth layer of physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Ma's willpower was only just reaching the third layer.</p><p></p><p>This time, the three with sufficient accumulation had already grasped 50% of the Visualization Diagram of the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace. Xuanhuang felt that for them to reach the seventh layer by the end would be simple.</p><p></p><p>As long as he gave them a little time, at most a week, they would definitely be able to fully comprehend the Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>A love for talent suddenly arose.</p><p></p><p>With such three geniuses, it would be interesting to provide them with guidance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang's will became more inclined towards the three, and the speed of the spiritual resonance flow increased.</p><p></p><p>The three suddenly felt a tremor in their bodies, and discovered that the speed of the coagulation of the azure qi into the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace was accelerating.</p><p></p><p>The three's mental state was also continuing to be consumed.</p><p></p><p>The three understood that they were receiving special care.</p><p></p><p>The three were both grateful and wholeheartedly admiring, wondering if they could truly achieve this level of ability. They dared not be certain.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang definitely could, because it would be best for this kind of genius to condense the complete Visualization Diagram as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>In this way, their own insights and accumulations would also be greater.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes the insights of geniuses could be equivalent to those of tens of thousands of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>In this way...</p><p></p><p>As time slowly passed, more and more people could no longer persist.</p><p></p><p>The remaining ones were all masters above the fourth layer of physical, spiritual, and qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also spirit cultivators, who had all been kicked out just now.</p><p></p><p>They unconsciously let out a sigh of relief, feeling frustrated that they could see but not learn.</p><p></p><p>Rather than this, it would be better to be kicked out.</p><p></p><p>But the seeds had been sown, and this excitement would linger with them for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>Unable to resist the urge to cultivate, they would need to change their paths and seek guidance from Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang was happy to see this, because if the spirit cultivators could cultivate, then that would be a great boon.</p><p></p><p>Not only would they contribute their insights, but also various strange rules, as well as the media that Xuanhuang could seal them with at any time.</p><p></p><p>About five minutes later, only ten people remained persisting.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Master Ma, the three Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist figures, as well as Sun Hui, Wu Gang, Jin Ning, Song Hongliang, and two previous arrivals - one martial artist and one cultivator.</p><p></p><p>These two were also fortunate, and their own cultivation was strong, with the qi cultivator at the fifth layer and the martial artist at the fifth layer of physical cultivation. Their willpower was also about the same, approaching the third layer of willpower.</p><p></p><p>Until another three minutes had passed, they had all withdrawn, leaving only the perfected Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang immediately ceased the performance, and everyone fell silent to adjust their state.</p><p></p><p>After a while, everyone stood up and respectfully cupped their hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>"We thank the Venerable Master for bestowing the Dao upon us!"</p><p></p><p>The harvest was too great, a single transmission that changed their destinies.</p><p></p><p>Although there was no formal master-disciple relationship, the reality of it had already been established.</p><p></p><p>"Well done, you all have the strength and the opportunities, you are all rare talents. I hope you will not squander your own potential."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Emotion... Take it as a new starting point, continue to move forward, maintain awe, firm will, and I hope we can meet again on the great path and high mountains."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master Xuan, I will not let down your deep love."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuan made an appointment with himself, to meet on the high mountains of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>This is the most beautiful expectation, hoping that the people here can keep up with his pace and advance together into the depths of the great Dao. This is the dream of those who seek the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't want to climb the high mountain of the great Dao? Who doesn't want to exchange and discuss the Dao in the depths of the great Dao?</p><p></p><p>"The last ten people, Master Ma, Wu Gang, Jin Ning, Sun Hui, Song Hongliang, and..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked at the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio and said, "You three should be the Ninth Dao Master, Venerable Master Ming Hui, and Mr. Yan Lai, right?"</p><p></p><p>The three immediately stood up straight.</p><p></p><p>"I dare not receive the title of Master from the Venerable Master, I am the humble Venerable Master Ming Hui."</p><p></p><p>"I am the old Taoist, the Ninth Dao."</p><p></p><p>"I am Yan Lai."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you three, and these two Immortal Martial..."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a burly figure said, "Venerable Master, I am Zhao Long from Changshan, a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>A tall and thin man said, "Venerable Master, I am Du Ming from Pengcheng, a humble cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, Zhao Long, Du Ming, you two come find me after the others are done."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>The ten people named were excited, they had entered the Venerable Master's sight.</p><p></p><p>As long as they seize the opportunity, soaring high is just ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, whether it's Du Ming, Zhao Long, the Ninth Dao Master, Venerable Master Ming Hui, or Mr. Yan Lai, they all have sufficient social tempering and know to stay calm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the ten people were very excited, but suppressed it, only their smiles on their faces could not be hidden, appearing particularly dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Venerable Master."</p><p></p><p>The ten people nodded in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>There is no arrogance or unwillingness to bow their heads, they are all sensible people, and with such a gap from Xuanhuang, what is there to not bow their heads to.</p><p></p><p>Even the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio with the highest status could not hide their joy.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, thank you to the Xie Department of South City Town for coming, I know you all have other reasons for coming here."</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Xuanhuang suddenly changed the topic and looked at the slightly confused Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>It seems that his own actions had a great impact on Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>He was the only one on the scene who was clear-headed and watched the entire process.</p><p></p><p>The most intuitive feeling is: Xuanhuang is not human.</p><p></p><p>How can a person do this? How to refine such an extraordinary will? This should not exist! Xuanhuang must have a secret, but does it matter? </p><p></p><p>Without a secret, it's impossible to have such an achievement.</p><p></p><p>But there's no need, can't force Xuanhuang to reveal the secret, right?</p><p></p><p>Judging from Xuanhuang's performance, no one can coerce him, this person's momentum has already formed.</p><p></p><p>"Zhai Zhengyi of the Xie Department, I did indeed kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The simple and straightforward words immediately stunned the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"However!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's tone suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to explain, after all, this person had the wolf-like ambition to plot against me."</p><p></p><p>"But I personally respect the Spiritual Masters led by Director Xu Ruyi, you are the guardians of the common people, making immeasurably great sacrifices, so I give an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is not a show-off, nor is he the kind who doesn't care what others think because he's so powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Masters led by Xu Ruyi, no matter from which aspect, are worthy of Xuanhuang's respect.</p><p></p><p>They are the true protectors of the common people.</p><p></p><p>The scoundrel and these people cannot be lumped together.</p><p></p><p>"Zhai Zhengyi, or rather, he should be called Gou Jianren! He is one of the Twelve Demon Princes, the Demon Puppet Pavilion Master, a follower of the Demon Cult."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Another wave of commotion immediately arose.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>...

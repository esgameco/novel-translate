        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a long silence.</p><p></p><p>"Well, Tong Tong, you organize things first, we'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui had already understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma, Deputy Director Xia, shall we go to my office and chat?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go chat."  Master Ma also realized.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had rushed in hurriedly, and then left just as mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was very puzzled, were these three people sick?</p><p></p><p>They arrived at Sun Hui's office.</p><p></p><p>After the three of them were seated, no one spoke.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Sun Hui said, "Deputy Director Xia, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Director Sun, this matter must have some irregularities?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Of course there were irregularities, and quite big ones at that. The prominent Jia Zhengyi's collection, how could there be no irregularities?</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing said, "From the moment Master Ma informed us of this matter, we've entered into a misconception?"</p><p></p><p>"What misconception?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing said, "It's that we were worried about the Mystic Master's safety, but forgot about the Mystic Master's strength."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing's words were very clear - we were only thinking about the Mystic Master's safety, forgetting that the Mystic Master is also very powerful. You arrange an assassin, I'll take him down.</p><p></p><p>We could even follow the clues to find the mastermind, and then go eliminate the mastermind.</p><p></p><p>A very simple and clear progression, obvious at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"So you also think that the Ominous Shadow Qi Long didn't succeed, but was instead stopped by the Mystic Master, and then you followed Qi Long's trail to find Jia Zhengyi?" Sun Hui asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I feel it must be so. It's just that the Mystic Master's strength has once again exceeded our expectations."</p><p></p><p>"The Taoist priest didn't expect it either."</p><p></p><p>The three of them were stunned, but their mood was quite good.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful Xuanhuang is, the more benefits they can reap by following him.</p><p></p><p>Since this topic was finished, Xia Qing asked, "Director Sun, when will you go to Qingyun Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui also relaxed his brow and said, "It will take about three or four more days to complete the renovations. At that time, half of the martial arts hall's personnel, especially the experts, will go to Qingyun Mountain. This place, the martial arts hall, will still be an important stronghold for us."</p><p></p><p>"Three or four days? That's quite fast. When the time comes, Director Sun, you must take care of us as neighbors."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui waved his hand, "Deputy Director, you jest. The Taoist hall has abundant talents, and with Master Ma here, it is you who will be taking care of us. We are not that accomplished, we are just following the Mystic Master and arduously cultivating the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xia Qing felt quite annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Why does this existence of the Mystic Master not originate from our Taoist hall? "Oh yes, Director Sun, have you contacted Mr. Liu?"  Master Ma asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui shook his head, "We can't get in touch with him. We only know from his family that Mr. Liu went to Xiang Province, but the Blue Star is growing larger, and the routes have become untraceable, so we still haven't found any clues about Mr. Liu's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. If Mr. Liu were here, with the Mystic Master's guidance, even if Liu doesn't achieve extraordinary accomplishments, the crisis of losing control could still be easily resolved."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Liu's natural talent is amazing. According to what he said himself, after reaching the fifth layer of Body Refinement, he no longer dares to cultivate casually, yet his body is constantly growing stronger of its own accord."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Sun Hui felt frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Liu and he had risen at the same time.</p><p></p><p>But Mr. Liu was being fed by the heavens, seemingly having some unknown physical constitution.</p><p></p><p>Without even needing to cultivate diligently, he could progress every day.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the fifth layer of Body Refinement, Liu didn't dare cultivate anymore, yet he had already become a sixth layer Body Refinement existence within a year.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Liu hadn't left, by the time Xuanhuang rose to cultivate the "Furnace Nine Refinements", perhaps it wouldn't take long for him to make a breakthrough to the Transcendent realm.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of the layered divisions of Body Refinement, your martial arts hall has some capable people. I heard they even made our Sect Master quite upset."  Master Ma seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui gave an embarrassed smile, not saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Due to the previous divisions being quite vague, they had even received criticism from Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the martial arts hall collaborated with the Taoist hall, and after receiving guidance from Xuanhuang, they redefined the divisions.</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao disciples were called Body Refinement First Layer to Ninth Layer, Qi Refinement disciples were called Qi Refinement First Layer to Ninth Layer, and Spirit Refinement disciples were called Spirit Refinement First Layer to Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>Taking the meaning of transcending the mundane and entering the sacred, the martial arts hall had these divisions, such as Transcendent First Stage called Mystic Transformation, Second Stage called Penetrating the Mysteries, Third Stage called Fathoming the Mysteries, Fourth Stage called True Mystic Martial Saint.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In any case, it's all about the profound, the profound, the profound.</p><p></p><p>With the martial arts school's such a claim, the Taoist temple feels a toothache.</p><p></p><p>These martial artists are really despicable. The Xuan master's surname is Xuan, and you shamelessly add to this extent, do you have no shame?</p><p></p><p>However, the martial arts school does not admit it.</p><p></p><p>There is a saying that goes: There will be great Confucians to defend me.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, after Xuan Huang's success, the martial arts school's news and cultural promotion specialty students began to write books and establish theories.</p><p></p><p>They asked the Taoist temple: Isn't the superhuman state the beginning of the transformation from superhuman to saint, called the Xuan change? What's wrong with calling it Tong Xuan? Isn't the penetration of the profound mysteries of heaven and earth just a rough understanding, what's wrong with calling it Tong Xuan? Isn't the insight into the profound mysteries of heaven and earth called Dong Xuan? I call it Zhen Xuan, what's wrong with that? True Xuan is the transformation of the self into a part of the profound mysteries of heaven and earth. When the true self is just born, I ask you, what's wrong with calling me the True Xuan Wusheng?</p><p></p><p>This level can be called the Wusheng.</p><p></p><p>With this rebuttal, the Taoist temple was speechless.</p><p></p><p>It is said that after Li Tong returned, he roared: "Whoever dares to say that martial artists are vulgar and coarse, just get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Martial artists have culture, and they are not afraid of anyone.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Taoist temple went to explore, is it that we also divide out the levels called 'Xuan' or 'Huang'?</p><p></p><p>But everyone opposed it.</p><p></p><p>Saying that this is too deliberate is not good, the first Xuan master of the martial arts school may be happy.</p><p></p><p>We also think that this Xuan master will feel deliberate, and it may be a good intention but a bad result.</p><p></p><p>Instead, combine the terminology of the small world, the first level is called Zhuji, the second level is called Zifu, the third level is called Jindan, and the fourth level is called Yuanshen Zhenren (also called Shentong Zhenren).</p><p></p><p>In any case, the fourth level is the beginning of the transformation from superhuman to saint.</p><p></p><p>What is a saint? The one who realizes the true self is a saint.</p><p></p><p>Until here.</p><p></p><p>This realm finally has its own cultivation division, which can be said to be of epochal significance.</p><p></p><p>However, because Jia Zhengyi suppressed the Xuan Huang incident, many messages could not be spread, and now it is a world of isolated information and paralyzed urban connections.</p><p></p><p>As long as the information cannot be spread on the Internet, only the South City knows about it.</p><p></p><p>The current Internet is not the same as the previous one.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, it is difficult to connect to the world, and they can only be connected within the city.</p><p></p><p>The good places can even cross cities, but crossing provinces is impossible. For the past six or seven years, the cross-provincial network has long been paralyzed.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial artists and spiritual masters, the reason why they still have network connections and various forum apps is because of the existence of the one honored as the Dragon Master.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Master, the honorary director of the Xiejie Headquarters of the Summer Country, controls the third-level strange and bizarre network.</p><p></p><p>The strange and bizarre characteristics make the Blue Star not disconnected from the network and able to connect to the world.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Blue Star, there are three beings called 'Master'.</p><p></p><p>The unobstructed calling of Xuan Huang Xuan Masters by the martial arts school and the Taoist temple is not only the ability of Xuan Huang, but also the effect of convention.</p><p></p><p>The Summer Country's Dragon Master has made contributions to the connectivity of the Blue Star, and has personally sealed the third-level strange and bizarre Hui, so he is honored as the Dragon Master.</p><p></p><p>The Rice Grain Country's 'Money Master', controls the strange and bizarre bank, the strange money can be used to command, have money can use the strange to grind, strange money can be used to command, hire, and store strange things, and so on. In short, the ability is very strong, so he is called the 'Money Master'.</p><p></p><p>However, this spiritual master named Tela'ang does not like to be called the Money Master, and prefers to be called the Master of Capital.</p><p></p><p>The third is the 'Love Master Mark' of Europe.</p><p></p><p>A Gaul, he controls the third-level strange and bizarre lust, with strong abilities, can resist the distortion of lust for many people, and can alleviate the loss of control of the strange and bizarre, and so on.</p><p></p><p>He is called the Love Master, and Mark is very satisfied with his title.</p><p></p><p>In short, the three masters are almost irreplaceable.</p><p></p><p>And they are powerful individuals, and more importantly, the three have noble character.</p><p></p><p>They are the steadfast guardians of humanity.</p><p></p><p>The reason why those powerful evil alliances dared not to show off recklessly is that the suppression of these strong people has played a role.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are always people who can persist in righteousness and uphold justice.</p><p></p><p>Just as there are always people who wantonly violate the law and are cruel and merciless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The heating problem has not been solved yet, and it is still being coordinated at the letters and visits bureau, it has been three days, and there is no time to write, one time is too damn hard. Thanks to the readers who have followed, collected and voted.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

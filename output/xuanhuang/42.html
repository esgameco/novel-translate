        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the replenishment of the great elixir, Xuanhuang completed the second refinement of the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>In the mist of the sea of qi, a Heavenly Pillar of eighteen feet slowly took shape, and its connection to the forces of heaven and earth became even tighter.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was one more refinement, to condense the complete nine-foot Heavenly Pillar, it would be able to link to the forces of heaven and earth, and then draw those forces into the furnace.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he had once again exhausted all of his vital energy and willpower.</p><p></p><p>In his weakest moment, a vague sense of crisis emerged.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang dared not take this lightly, for a powerful will naturally has the ability to sense impending crises.</p><p></p><p>This was the manifestation of the integrated field of his own being, where another field was posing a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang immediately entered his inner world, no longer caring about the consumption of the great elixir.</p><p></p><p>Until the afternoon, when half of his vital energy had been restored, but his willpower was completely recovered.</p><p></p><p>That vague sense of crisis had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"It must not have happened for no reason, there must be something unusual about this."</p><p></p><p>"Was it the Righteous Sect of the Exorcism Division? Or something else?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang seemed to have a clue.</p><p></p><p>Waiting passively was not the best solution, it was not in line with his character.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take the initiative."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he saw that it was already four o'clock in the afternoon, and the deep autumn night was coming quickly, it would be dark in less than an hour.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang decided to resolve the issue under the cover of the night.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, are you going out?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you don't need to follow, I'm going out for a walk, I have some confusion about my cultivation, I'm going out to clear my mind and see if I can gain anything."</p><p></p><p>He preemptively stopped Sun Tong from following, saying, "You don't need to follow me, having more people will actually ruin the mood, I'll go out alone."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Sun Tong nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Since Xuanhuang said so, she didn't insist.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xuanhuang openly walked out of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the prepared Qi Long noticed him.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long had been waiting nearby since noon.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang didn't come out in a short time, he was planning to sneak into the courtyard of the martial arts hall at night.</p><p></p><p>After all, the defense of this martial arts hall was virtually non-existent to him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Xuanhuang came out, which made him very happy.</p><p></p><p>It would be better not to kill Xuanhuang inside the martial arts hall, so as not to cause a blow to the people of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to come by such a remarkable person, to die like this? Qi Long felt that he was not an absolute villain, to strike the martial way in such an inhumane manner.</p><p></p><p>He was quite a good person.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a desolate and remote small street, the fallen leaves covered the ground.</p><p></p><p>Not far away was a barren small hill, with scattered tombstones on it.</p><p></p><p>There was also a dried-up small river, the river water had already dried up, with some not-so-large puddles bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely remote area near the suburbs, with sparse human habitation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang, who seemed to be wandering aimlessly, inexplicably had a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>He found that his shadow was struggling a bit.</p><p></p><p>"The integration of essence, qi, and spirit into the extraordinary, to be precise, is to allow one's own energy to be transformed."</p><p></p><p>Inexplicably, Xuanhuang began to talk to himself.</p><p></p><p>From afar, those who didn't know him would think he was a fool.</p><p></p><p>"Especially after the integration of willpower, one can temporarily achieve the legendary 'standing without a shadow', the state of transparent energy. Although the time is short, the more important purpose is inner vision."</p><p></p><p>"Like this."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a wave of fluctuation swept through Xuanhuang's body.</p><p></p><p>The person was still the same, but his body was instantly energized, becoming transparent like glass.</p><p></p><p>"So, Mr. Shadow, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's shadow disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight penetrated him as if it was passing through the air, and there was no shadow visible.</p><p></p><p>And his shadow had turned into a deft mimic of Xuanhuang's movements, a black mass.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The shadow was suddenly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, it was still trying to feel out what Xuanhuang was babbling about. But in a flash, it discovered that Xuanhuang had no shadow, and it was completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long was suddenly terrified, this was the first time he had encountered such a person who could temporarily energize his entire body and make his own shadow disappear. Am I the illusionist, or are you? What's more frightening to him was that he wanted to transform from a shadow state back into a person to counterattack Xuanhuang, but he couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was as if time and space had frozen around him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuanhuang extended his hand, and vine-like tree roots began to spread out from his palm.</p><p></p><p>The tree roots were permeated with a deathly aura, quickly enveloping the still-struggling shadow.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long deeply regretted this moment, regretting when he had started to master the strange and become a wandering cultivator, due to the unique abilities of his shadow.</p><p></p><p>He had been virtually unstoppable, able to turn any crisis into an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Later, in order to obtain resources and special suppressants for his mind, he began to work as an assassin, while also collecting the pieces of his own strange puzzle.</p><p></p><p>For years, everything had gone smoothly.</p><p></p><p>This time, in order to advance himself, he wanted to obtain the Cloak of Strangeness, so he took on this task.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that just like before, even if you were stronger than me, you wouldn't be able to catch me - how could I have ended up trapped like this, without even knowing how.</p><p></p><p>It was far beyond his predictions.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, there was someone who could detect the invasion of his shadow, something he had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang knew his thoughts, he could only express how ignorant he was.</p><p></p><p>With a transcendent will, easily controlling the mind and dreams, do you think your shadow is special? Do you understand the concept of all-knowing?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the shadow, even if you wanted to sneak attack me, I would have sensed it on the level of spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>"What is the name of this shadow gentleman?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Long, wrapped in the deathly tree roots, realized that his life force was rapidly draining away.</p><p></p><p>His shadow state was also not working, being quickly absorbed as well.</p><p></p><p>This filled him with immense fear.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Xuanhuang loosened the restraint a bit, and Qi Long found that he could now speak.</p><p></p><p>"Please, great lord, have mercy on me. I was just doing a job for money, I'm not your enemy."</p><p></p><p>After being able to speak, Qi Long immediately begged for mercy. Feeling his life force slowly disappearing, this state was too terrible.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Qi Long, I have a nickname, everyone calls me the Strange Shadow Qi Long. Great lord, I did not recognize your greatness and offended you. I will make amends, please take back your divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Were you hired by Jia Zhengyi?"</p><p></p><p>Through his words, Xuanhuang understood the situation.</p><p>Although he didn't know how the enmity had started, the one with the ability to hire this person seemed to be Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, it is indeed this person. He has a hold over an important piece of my puzzle. I wanted to advance, so I had to find him. His requirement was to kill you."</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, I have my difficulties, please don't absorb me, have mercy on me."</p><p></p><p>Qi Long was on the verge of collapse. What kind of thing was this tree root? Wasn't he a cultivator? How could he be even stranger than himself?</p><p>Continuously absorbing his life force, this was going to drain him dry.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing your turbid soul, there is no way I can spare you. You need to go through the Great Grinder."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I have a secret, I have a great discovery, spare me..."</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst Qi Long's pleas for mercy, the wooden roots doubled their absorption power.</p><p>In an instant, Qi Long's life force was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>The detached strange shadow rapidly expanded, twisting and distorting like a demonic entity, baring its fangs and claws.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you won't be able to escape either."</p><p></p><p>"My will is the will of heaven!"</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the domain of the Small World's Heavenly Will was activated.</p><p></p><p>A will belonging to Xuanhuang instantly broke through the various twisted desires that made up the strange shadow's spiritual intelligence.</p><p>Xuanhuang had succeeded in replacing it.</p><p></p><p>And those chaotic desire-spirits were not wasted either. Within the domain, where Xuanhuang was the heaven and earth, how could they escape?</p><p>They were quickly absorbed and refined by the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>A peak first-stage cultivator's worth of provisions, the Great Grinder eagerly rotated, quickly digesting and enhancing itself.</p><p></p><p>The strange shadow was a unique strangeness, without substance, just a black shadow.</p><p>From the first time Xuanhuang controlled it... no, it would be more accurate to say he subjugated the strangeness... no, even more precisely, he replaced the strangeness's spiritual essence with his own.</p><p></p><p>This could not be considered subjugation, it was directly erasing and then using it as his own.</p><p></p><p>This was the only strangeness he had obtained so far that he was interested in personally controlling and experimenting with.</p><p>He wanted to personally practice and research it, to see if he could develop something good from it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

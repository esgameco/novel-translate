        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the moment when the leg bone was branded by the Great Grinder of Returning Void, about to give birth to its true essence.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang once again threw the leg bone into the Heavenly-Earthly Smelter, entering the final stage of shaping and refining.</p><p></p><p>Under the blessing of the Heavenly Will, the leg bone that was re-thrown into the Heavenly-Earthly Smelter, after being imbued with the true spiritual consciousness by the Great Grinder of Returning Void, began to transform.</p><p></p><p>The leg bone started to expand, gradually shortening, until a nine-layer bone pagoda of 1392.7 centimeters appeared.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the bizarre refining of the leg bone was officially completed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang not only changed the strange and chaotic spiritual consciousness, but also changed its appearance.</p><p></p><p>From a blood-soaked leg bone, it transformed into a dazzling white nine-layer bone pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Refining a blood-soaked leg bone artifact does not conform to the behavior of a "Profound Master" like Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to refine it into a pagoda-shaped treasure - the White Bone Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang put away the Great Grinder of Returning Void and the Heavenly-Earthly Smelter, but kept the White Bone Pagoda in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a mysterious extension of will, the "body" of the White Bone Pagoda was forged by the Heavenly-Earthly Smelter, and its "spiritual consciousness" was bestowed by the Great Grinder of Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>It is as if Xuanhuang had directly granted it, so the newborn pagoda is connected to Xuanhuang's will.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, the White Bone Pagoda has a rough feel. Although the surface is as smooth as jade, it cannot conceal the fact that it is only an embryonic artifact.</p><p></p><p>There are no carvings or pendants on the pagoda body, only clear edges, having form but no spirit.</p><p></p><p>The "spirit" here refers to many things - such as the precipitation of time, the cultivation of the cultivator, the experiences of the pagoda, and so on.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it is like a newborn.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, let's call you the White Bone Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang gave it a very ordinary name.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is just for experimental use, and he may not even use it himself.</p><p></p><p>So the biggest harvest this time is not the pagoda, but that Xuanhuang has truly realized the refining method in his super-self projection.</p><p></p><p>Through the Heavenly-Earthly Smelter to refine the form of the artifact, and through the Great Grinder of Returning Void to bestow the spiritual consciousness. The bizarre material itself is a treasure, with inherent spiritual mechanism, no need for the Heavenly Dao to grant the spiritual mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, as long as it is not beyond my ability, I can refine artifacts that are controlled by the Great Grinder of Returning Void?"</p><p></p><p>"And these artifacts will have the ability to self-evolve. It is truly unique, and the bizarre things are indeed treasures, each one a condensation of rules."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang sighed again at the special nature of the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>It is only in this world where realms collide that such treasures condensed from rules can be obtained at the dawn of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Not to say that this realm has no treasures, it's just that we don't know how to use them."</p><p></p><p>As long as one has the ability to refine and control these bizarre things, it is a path to the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>For example, the White Bone Pagoda, although Xuanhuang does not value it, if he bestows it upon others, and they control this White Bone Pagoda, it is equivalent to grasping the starting point of the white bone rule.</p><p></p><p>If used well, by evolving with the pagoda, at least they can reach a very high level.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what abilities the pagoda has?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, the leg bone had the ability to devour bones to strengthen itself. Now the pagoda has retained this ability.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang does not know about its other abilities, and the people in the Martial Arts Hall do not know either.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang examined it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It can cover living beings with a rule that causes their bones to shatter like sand if their spiritual consciousness collapses... Are the bones of the covered people really crushed to sand?"</p><p></p><p>"Just this ability? It's very weak, no wonder the people of the Exorcism Department didn't want it before."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He thought there would be other abilities, but apart from the ability to devour bones and grow, it only has the ability to cause the covered people to have the pain of their bones shattering.</p><p></p><p>"Waste utilization, it can devour bones to grow, and the pain of bone shattering can be used to temper the will of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"Especially the will of low-level cultivators, refining the Fa... is nothing but suffering."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang felt that this White Bone Pagoda could be used as a trial pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Entry requires points, and the points are white bones.</p><p></p><p>As long as one can collect bones or exchange points, they can enter.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...can enter the White Bone Treasure Pagoda... and go in to suffer.</p><p></p><p>To suffer, must one also pay a price? It seems rather absurd no matter how one looks at it.</p><p></p><p>But it is indeed feasible.</p><p></p><p>Other people cultivate their will, but not as swiftly as Xuanhuang. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Even if one learns the cultivation method taught by Xuanhuang, it is still very difficult to forge one's will.</p><p></p><p>Not only must one's essence, qi, and spirit be coordinated and harmonized, the key is mastery.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has three tools for self-mastery, completely without the need for him to put in much effort, and he also has the cosmic will of the small world to assist him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he only needs the fuel of his heart and spirit, no need to worry about anything else.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators do not have so many conditions.</p><p></p><p>To forge one's will is very difficult.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, one needs precise control over one's own essence, qi, and spirit, requiring the expenditure of mental energy.</p><p></p><p>Whether using one's essence as fuel, or one's divine nature as fuel, or one's qi as fuel, mastery is required.</p><p></p><p>And where does mastery come from? It naturally requires training. While one's mastery may be strong normally, when forging one's will, it requires even greater mastery, without the slightest negligence.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the ultimate operation within one's own essence, qi, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>So, go feel the suffering beyond human, go to the White Bone Treasure Pagoda to forge your will and mastery.</p><p></p><p>Being able to maintain one's will and have one's mastery and will coalesce amidst the excruciating pain of one's bones shattering will naturally strengthen them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have some effect."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has made a decision, planning to use this to test the disciples on Mount Qingyun.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, since it is controlled by the Great Calamity, it can be adjusted, with the nine layers perfectly suitable to be the nine stages of the Forging of the Will."</p><p></p><p>The methods Xuanhuang taught have two parts, one for cultivation and one for fusion.</p><p></p><p>The fusion method everyone knows, but it should more accurately be called "borrowing the method."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang divided the inscriptions for "borrowing the method" into twelve parts.</p><p></p><p>Each time a cultivator engraves one of the inscriptions, it represents deepening their fusion with the heavenly and earthly crucible.</p><p></p><p>The deeper the fusion, the stronger the abilities they can borrow.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation method is different, it is Xuanhuang's true method for forging the will, directly derived from his own will-forging.</p><p></p><p>This is the grand Dao, and Xuanhuang has not hidden anything here.</p><p></p><p>This has destined it to be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>As a result, currently all cultivators focus mainly on the fusion method, with the cultivation method as a supplement, intending to make up for it after reaching a certain level.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't want to take the shortcut? And the cultivation method, unlike the fusion method with its twelve elaborate layers, has only nine layers. As long as one perfects those nine layers, one can assault the realm of extraordinary will.</p><p></p><p>Often, the great Dao is simple and plain, while the deviant paths are elaborate.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation method is too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Strength of will, mastery ability, coordination of essence, qi, and spirit - these are just the basics.</p><p></p><p>To make progress, one must be forged, forged by time, and forged by oneself.</p><p></p><p>If the accumulation of time is insufficient, it won't work. If one's essence, qi, and spirit are not coordinated and unified, it won't work. Without a firm belief, it still won't work.</p><p></p><p>Especially in terms of self-forging... for cultivators of the fusion method, as long as they identify which aspect of their essence, qi, and spirit is lacking, they can just supplement it. After all, they won't become unbalanced, with the will borrowed from Xuanhuang suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>But for cultivators of the cultivation method, they need to use their own will to suppress it, which requires constantly maintaining balance.</p><p></p><p>Even taking medicine requires caution.</p><p></p><p>What if taking a qi-replenishing medicine causes the qi to become too strong, while the spirit and essence become weak? What if taking an essence-replenishing medicine causes the essence to become too strong, while the spirit and qi become weak and unbalanced?</p><p></p><p>And so on...</p><p></p><p>All require step-by-step cyclical progress.</p><p></p><p>The above is just about physical balance.</p><p></p><p>What about forging the will? Even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the appearance of the White Bone Treasure Pagoda is not without hope, a way to forge the will and train mastery.</p><p></p><p>If everyone just takes the fusion path, and the cultivation path is rarely traveled due to its difficulty, Xuanhuang would not be pleased.</p><p></p><p>What he wants are not puppets under his control.</p><p></p><p>He wants companions who can reach the heights, even if they are just followers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

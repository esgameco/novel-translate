        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even if it was the first time witnessing the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible of the cultivators and martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, time seemed to have stopped, and the crowd involuntarily began to refine and visualize the image in their sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Crucible demonstrated by Xuanhuang had a spiritual charm, and was even stronger than the actual visualized image.</p><p></p><p>This was a transmission of the Dao, more direct than observing the visualized image.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts hall, all the martial artists who had comprehended over 70% started to enter a period of rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>And Jin Ning, who had already comprehended 90% and was just one step away from perfection, was no exception.</p><p></p><p>In his sea of consciousness, the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible that he could never complete before had made a huge breakthrough this time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, once his visualized image in the sea of consciousness reached 90%, any attempt to fill the last 10% would immediately cause it to collapse.</p><p></p><p>It was as if something was wrong, crossing the 90% mark would shatter it.</p><p></p><p>This time, following Xuanhuang's transmission of the Dao, Jin Ning's sea of consciousness consolidated involuntarily, crossing the 90% threshold.</p><p></p><p>It did not collapse again, but gradually became complete.</p><p></p><p>Until a "hum" sound, the visualization of the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible was completely perfected in his sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>And once perfected, it would be difficult to shatter it, because it was a flawless spiritual construction.</p><p></p><p>It was not a condensation of mental imagination, but the true birth of the sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>And the transmitting Xuanhuang suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>He discovered a weak but tenacious "thread" coming from the unknown, connecting his Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of comprehension was transmitted along this thread to the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>"Has Jin Ning completely consolidated the visualization?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly realized that someone had formed a connection with him through cultivating his method, and this person's comprehension would be transmitted along the thread to the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible, while the Crucible would also convey its true meaning to this person.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual consciousness of this person would be guarded by the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>As long as this person continues to learn the fusion of the Fa, constantly engraving the inscriptions, this thread will grow stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's initial conception had finally been realized.</p><p></p><p>He was the source of all Fa, and as long as the complete visualization was consolidated, he would be connected to it.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators' comprehension and experience would be transformed into his own experience along the thread.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators' refinement of the visualization would become the collective refinement of the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Crucible would become something he controlled, but forged by all sentient beings as a "spiritual treasure".</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Crucible would replace the distorted will of Heaven, guarding the spiritual sea of the cultivators. As long as the cultivators engrave enough inscriptions, and the thread grows stronger, their sea of consciousness crucible will become stronger, allowing their physical bodies to be enhanced without losing control.</p><p></p><p>After the cultivators completely consolidated the visualization, if they choose to cultivate the Fa instead of fusing it, the connecting thread will not grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>It can transmit the cultivators' comprehension and experience, and guard their spiritual consciousness, but the cultivators cannot borrow the power of the Crucible.</p><p></p><p>Fusion of the Fa, the so-called fusion of the Fa, is to constantly deepen the intimate relationship with the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>The more inscriptions engraved, the greater the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible that can be borrowed.</p><p></p><p>It's like inviting the gods to possess one's body.</p><p></p><p>The more intimate, the greater the power that can be borrowed.</p><p></p><p>It may seem like an extremely evil method, after all, the source is controlled by someone else.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang suddenly severed the connection of a cultivator, then...</p><p></p><p>Without the Crucible to guard the spiritual consciousness, and the will not strong enough, it would mean that this person would inevitably lose control.</p><p></p><p>But the knife itself is not guilty, it depends on how it is used.</p><p></p><p>Some use it to cook and cut vegetables, others use it to kill people.</p><p></p><p>The knife is not wrong, the mistake is in the way it is used.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's transmission of the Fa is not for the purpose of controlling all beings, that would be meaningless. He firmly believes that he will become incredibly powerful, and even those beings that he cannot solve, he will not be able to either.</p><p></p><p>And what he can solve, the beings will find useless.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is because the world is distorted by the fusion of the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>If the world was perfect, there would be no need to rely on his will to cultivate, the will of Heaven and Earth would naturally suppress.</p><p></p><p>This is just a method of last resort.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not stop, but continued the transmission of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the transmission had gone beyond a simple one-way communication.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings have entered the field of condensed Xuan Huang (Mysterious Yellow), and the sentient beings have become a member of the field, and then they comprehend according to the rules of the field's operation. This is a metaphysical way of comprehension, a sudden enlightenment with the whole body and mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there is a price to pay, the price is the support of the Xuan Huang will, and the consumption of the sentient beings' mental energy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore!</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>It can be seen that those with low cultivation, in the comprehension with the whole body and mind, their body and mind are exhausted, and they are pushed out.</p><p></p><p>But they immediately become clear-headed, and they immediately close their eyes and adjust their breathing, and remember the comprehension just now.</p><p></p><p>Even for the warriors who participate in the comprehension for the first time, this time they have also completely entered the Tao, and the doubts and speculations before have now turned into endless motivation.</p><p></p><p>As for those with deep cultivation, they all know in the dark that they have been led by the Xuan Master into the sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>This kind of heaven-sent opportunity, how can it be missed.</p><p></p><p>Even if it consumes a lot of mental energy, they are still strongly supporting it.</p><p></p><p>If you miss this opportunity, there may not be such an opportunity in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Xuan Master leads them into the sudden enlightenment, which is a direct opportunity to enter the Tao, and after this, they all visualize the diagram to enter the door.</p><p></p><p>Even if they are not warriors, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Refining qi and refining spirit also starts from visualizing the diagram, as long as they have the entry of this sudden enlightenment, then they can directly convert to refining qi.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time they have comprehended 30% of the Heaven and Earth Furnace Visualization Diagram, but the cultivator doesn't want the Furnace Law, and feels that the Towering Tree Visualization Diagram is more suitable.</p><p></p><p>No problem, just directly transform the 30% Heaven and Earth Furnace Visualization Diagram into the Towering Tree Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>The same applies to the Returning to the Void Great Grindstone Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>This is the powerful effect of being controlled by the Xuan Huang will, the heavenly will is my will, and my will is bestowed upon you with sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this seemingly cheating method is not without prerequisites.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is a very clich√©d setting, you must have a certain accumulation.</p><p></p><p>If you have no accumulation, even if you are led in, it's just like seeing flowers in the fog and the moon in the water, your brain has no accumulation at all, how can you have sudden enlightenment?</p><p></p><p>At least you can write that 333+333 equals how much? Now you suddenly realize it equals 666.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, those with low cultivation are the first to wake up, and then they close their eyes and adjust their breathing to sort out the harvest.</p><p></p><p>As for those with high cultivation, they grit their teeth and persist, wanting to gain more insight.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Masters are also led into the sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>But they are very depressed.</p><p></p><p>Now that they have been suppressed by the Xuan Huang will and led into the sudden enlightenment, it's fine. But once they are out of this state, should they learn or not learn?</p><p></p><p>Learning the cultivation method of the will, is equivalent to breaking the balance themselves.</p><p></p><p>Not learning, it's a pity, this kind of law they have already comprehended but dare not use?</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Xuan Huang has not targeted them, but they feel targeted? Should I learn or not learn?</p><p></p><p>Learning will cause their will or body to be strengthened, thereby breaking the balance and the symbiotic relationship.</p><p></p><p>Not learning, although there is no problem, but... it's tempting.</p><p></p><p>What to do? But there are also people who have not been led in, such as the Second-rank Spirit Master Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>His Second-rank Anomaly ability can shield the control of the Xuan Huang will, so he sees the people who are like intoxicated, feeling both relieved and heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>He used to be a martial arts genius, but martial arts was useless, so he decisively merged with the Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he is also a genius in controlling the Anomaly, the Anomaly-minded Second-rank Spirit Master Xu Ruyi, is also famous in the entire Spirit Master world.</p><p></p><p>So his feelings are very unique.</p><p></p><p>He sighs that his luck is not good, and the Xuan Huang did not appear earlier.</p><p></p><p>And because of his Anomaly nature, he sighs at the power of the Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>His Anomaly ability is very strong and unique, and so far he has not found anything that can suppress his special ability.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Xuan Huang's will represents the heavenly will, he feels it.</p><p></p><p>The Anomaly and the Anomaly are facing a great enemy.</p><p></p><p>"My will is the heavenly will, my heart is the heavenly heart. The Xuan Huang has already achieved the beginning of my will being the heavenly will, but my Anomaly is still just human heart, and has not reached the level of the heavenly heart."</p><p></p><p>"So the Anomaly is facing a great enemy, facing a heavenly enemy!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The distrust of Xia Qing from the Hedao Hall was different.</p><p></p><p>The memory devouring under the mysterious ability is something that cannot be faked.</p><p></p><p>"How could he break through?"</p><p></p><p>This was something Jia Zhengyi was very puzzled about.</p><p></p><p>"In the memories of that martial artist, his willpower broke through first. Not to mention you, the director, even I cannot figure out clearly how he exhibited so much, but he did not say how his willpower was able to break through."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan looked at Jia Zhengyi and the two almost simultaneously said, "This person has a secret."</p><p></p><p>But then they both shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>No one understands the difficulty of willpower more than the spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>How could it be possible?</p><p></p><p>They are constantly surrounded by the mysterious, and their willpower is constantly being tested by the mysterious.</p><p></p><p>They themselves have not broken through their willpower, let alone an ordinary martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"But it shouldn't be, is it that this person has mastered the mysterious and is deceiving people?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan voiced his speculation.</p><p></p><p>"If it's true, then the rude martial artist would be on par with us, how could that be possible."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi stood up and paced back and forth, thinking for a while and said, "Even if it's true, we can't just go out and try to probe, since the director cares deeply about ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>He also said, "Moreover, the probability of it being false is extremely high, you and I are both spirit masters, we know how difficult it is to break through willpower, how could an ordinary martial artist possibly do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Director, then shall we just leave it alone?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi shook his head and said, "How can we not take care of it, it concerns the status of us spirit masters, we cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you suggest we do?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi said, "Isn't the martial arts hall currently assisting us in sealing off Fulin Community? Since there is talent in the martial arts, let's say we have more dangerous matters to attend to, and hand over the Fulin Community incident to the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan heard this and smiled, "Director, you want to borrow their strength... no, you want to test the ability of the martial arts hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi said, "Even if it's true, the corpse tree mystery has reached the peak of the first level, even I don't have full confidence, if that person is truly capable, he will likely die a miserable death."</p><p></p><p>"Director, what if that person is a coward?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi smiled, "Then we'll just promote him, the martial arts hall has produced such a talent, truly the future of humanity, we'll just hype him up."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan also smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant, Director, brilliant."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, just an ordinary rude martial artist. Even if he can succeed, it doesn't mean others can too, willpower is not so easily broken through."</p><p></p><p>This view was agreed upon by the entire group of spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>"Director, I have one more question."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan continued, "If it's true, and this person is truly remarkable, even solving the corpse tree mystery, then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Wei Zixuan's words, Jia Zhengyi gave a sinister smile, "There are so many spirit masters on the verge of losing control, accidentally killing a martial artist, what's the big deal?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, don't we have the heretical alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Crazy people are always around."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wei Zixuan felt it was too perfect, seamless.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jia Zhengyi with a bit of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi had an elegant and refined demeanor.</p><p></p><p>The two then exchanged a look of mutual understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>A cheerful burst of laughter came from Jia Zhengyi's office.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another day.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Xuanhuang was studying the mysterious objects sent by the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Since the martial arts hall has been doing the cleanup work, there have only been three sealed mysterious objects for the past six or seven years.</p><p></p><p>Even these three are the ones the Exorcism Department doesn't want, with very little use.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall also wants to study them, see if they can also tame one of them.</p><p></p><p>The three sealed mysterious objects are: a piece of blood cloth, a gas lamp bulb, and a piece of leg bone.</p><p></p><p>All of them are very trash-like.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious blood cloth can suck blood, the gas lamp bulb can burn souls, and the leg bone can eat bones.</p><p></p><p>They are all extremely dangerous and difficult to fuse with.</p><p></p><p>To tame and fuse the blood-sucking blood cloth, one must first endure it sucking your blood, and you may be drained dry before even taming it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light bulb will burn the soul as long as it is lit, although its power is great. As long as you can endure and control it, this light bulb, once ignited, will burn the souls of all living beings within its illumination range.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite is that you must first master it. Souls are extremely difficult to handle. Using them to light a lamp? That's just courting death.</p><p></p><p>The leg bone is the same way. It will devour human bones, and it is just as difficult to fuse with.</p><p></p><p>Once the bones are all consumed, you as a person will be gone.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that each time you use its power in actual combat, you need to use your own bones as the medium to control it.</p><p></p><p>It's an extreme form of "bungee jumping".</p><p></p><p>You kill the enemy, but you die as well.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Exorcism Department didn't pay much attention to it, and only the Martial Arts Hall kept it as a treasure.</p><p></p><p>This bizarre situation where whoever fuses with it will die, the Martial Arts Hall fortunately didn't have any fools who tried to experiment with it.</p><p></p><p>They just indulged their collecting addiction.</p><p></p><p>It proves that our martial arts can also seal away the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>However, for Xuanhuang, it still has some use.</p><p></p><p>As long as it is bizarre, Xuanhuang believes he can squeeze out its essence.</p><p></p><p>What doesn't exist is something he can't extract the essence from.</p><p></p><p>Since the Blood-Sucking Cloth can suck blood, let it suck until it's full, and keep it as his own "blood bank".</p><p></p><p>His own vital energy won't reject it, and later he can extract the blood from the Blood-Sucking Cloth to increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the gas lamp bulb?</p><p></p><p>He has plenty of residual souls from the Great Grinder of the Abyss, which can be used as the "brushes" to paint the dream residual souls.</p><p></p><p>There's no reason this lamp bulb can't be used.</p><p></p><p>If it can't be used, he can just have the Great Grinder of the Abyss swallow it, and then the Great Grinder can glow itself, providing another means to fight the enemy.</p><p></p><p>As long as the lamp is lit, although he will also lose blood, the others will lose blood too.</p><p></p><p>It's just a battle of blood thickness. The Great Grinder has residual souls, what do you have?</p><p></p><p>As for the leg bone...</p><p></p><p>It is said to have been sealed right after its birth, and only its bone-devouring ability is known, the rest is unknown.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang can completely revive it and see what capabilities it has.</p><p></p><p>If it has no special abilities, he can just dismantle it and give it to the Void Saber, as the Void Saber wants everything.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Void Saber...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang came to the consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>He saw that the puppet bizarre he had yesterday had already been half-devoured by the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>As long as one more day passes, it will be completely absorbed.</p><p></p><p>He just doesn't know if the Void Saber can preserve one of the puppet bizarre's two abilities, the puppet and the suture.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang doesn't mind, even if they are all gone, it's just firewood.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the puppet bizarre, the Void Saber will be able to advance to the Transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>It will be his own power that is Transcendent, not the previous will overlay and small world's divine will blessing.</p><p></p><p>At that time, except for the Tong Tian Building Wood, his four treasures will all be at the Transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>As for the opportunity for the Tong Tian Building Wood, Xuanhuang has found it.</p><p></p><p>The corpse tree in the Fulin Community is a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After researching it these two days, the corpse tree is completely a death forbidden zone, able to absorb the vitality of all living beings to grow.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the Tong Tian Building Wood is its opposite, it is almost the synonym of vitality and vigorous growth.</p><p></p><p>If the Tong Tian Building Wood devours the corpse tree, it would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It may step into the peak of the First Realm in one step.</p><p></p><p>And by devouring the real living tree, the Tong Tian Building Wood can also take root in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>It's time to move to Qingyun Mountain, and there needs to be a guard at the gate.</p><p></p><p>The Tong Tian Building Wood that grows in the real world can not only observe the visualization map, but also act as a guardian.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has already found an opportunity for the Building Wood.</p><p></p><p>If the two fuse perfectly, one living and one dead?</p><p></p><p>The Tong Tian Building Wood will truly achieve the Yin-Yang, becoming the bridge connecting heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>Without Xuanhuang's knowledge,</p><p>the "darkness" in the Exorcism Department has already prepared a very reasonable future for him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Taishan Mountain is not too far from the Qingyun Mountain in the South City, so Minister Han may consider Xuanhuang and see what he has discovered. Perhaps the martial arts beyond the ordinary and our control of the strange are different, and what the cultivators can do is what we cannot detect."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Master spoke again.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it's still Xuanhuang, everything is Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Master has been very interested in Xuanhuang lately, and he can even relate other topics to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Although Han Wu did not believe that Xuanhuang was stronger than himself, since Dragon Master said so, there was no harm in trying.</p><p></p><p>After all, he himself did not always guard the Taishan Mountain, and he had been stationed at the headquarters for the past one or two months.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in just over a month, Xuanhuang had risen up from the South City.</p><p></p><p>Among the many experts at the headquarters, if anyone could be the first to see Xuanhuang, it would definitely be himself, because the Underworld Secret Land he guarded, the Taishan Mountain, was very close to the South City.</p><p></p><p>"Director Bi, the same situation is happening in the Yehuo Domain I guard."</p><p></p><p>Reported Tangzong.</p><p></p><p>The strange that Tangzong controlled... was not the Empress Dowager Long Sunshi, nor the Great General Li Jing, Qin Qiong, and Yuchi Gong.</p><p></p><p>Tangzong was a filial son. Before the strange was revived, his old father had raised him.</p><p></p><p>He lost his mother at an early age, and his father did not remarry, afraid that a stepmother would not treat Tangzong well.</p><p></p><p>Tangzong's father was a peasant construction worker, relying on sweat and hard work to support Tangzong's university education.</p><p></p><p>Tangzong also worked hard and got into a famous university. Although he did not start a business and get rich after graduation, his annual salary of tens of millions made him a successful person.</p><p></p><p>Alas, when the strange was revived, his father died in a strange incident.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he could not forget his son, or perhaps by chance, when Tangzong was guarding his father's remains, the deceased father was revived strangely.</p><p></p><p>The house in their hometown was built by Tangzong's father himself.</p><p></p><p>After the strange revival of the father, who was a mason by trade, the entire Tangzong's home became part of the strange, and it was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was like having two strange beings, one was the strange father, and the other was the strange house.</p><p></p><p>The two were very harmonious, even to the point of being one.</p><p></p><p>As long as the strange father kept building the strange house, he could keep getting stronger.</p><p></p><p>With the strange house, Tangzong had a strange domain, a rare phenomenon even for third-tier spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>In actual combat, it was equivalent to a realm controlled by the strange, similar to Xuanhuang's domain. Only third-tier strange beings or powerful spirit masters could possess it.</p><p></p><p>Tangzong had it from the beginning of controlling the strange father.</p><p></p><p>This not only gave him the conditions for rapid growth, but the strange father might also have a father-son rule, which was very strict on him but would not completely devour him.</p><p></p><p>Tangzong was constantly being attacked by the strange father, but he was never completely devoured. When he could not bear it anymore, the connection would be cut off.</p><p></p><p>It was the kind of "love" from the "old father" that made him have to work hard.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his enemies or those who disliked him called his strange father "Li Yuan" and called Tangzong the "Great Filial Son".</p><p></p><p>Tangzong was very dissatisfied with this title. He was a true filial son, not Li Shimin.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the three directors of the Exorcism Department were all very special, not knowing whether it was the decision of fate or for other reasons.</p><p></p><p>As for Director Bi Xia, no one knew how powerful he was, but he was recognized as the number one spirit master. </p><p></p><p>He was known as "Bi Xia, the Dream of the Nation".</p><p></p><p>His strange was a dream-type strange, and it was a third-tier strange formed by the fusion of three puzzles, unlike the other three, who were so lucky to grow on their own.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he was the strongest: Bi Xia, the Dream of the Nation.</p><p></p><p>There were occasional rumors that his dream-type strange was the dream of all beings, gathering the dreams of all beings to achieve unparalleled power.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia frowned deeply and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Other strange beings were easy to deal with, and so far no single fourth-tier strange being had been discovered.</p><p></p><p>The strongest were the third-tier ones, and the Exorcism Department had many experts to support them.</p><p></p><p>Only the six major secret lands of "Blood Sea", "Bitter Sea", "Yehuo Domain of the Nine Underworlds", "Abyss", "Underworld", and "Nightmare World" were difficult to delve into.</p><p></p><p>These six major secret lands were also connected to the myriad realms. Wherever there was a world that could not be easily shattered in a short time, there were traces of them.</p><p></p><p>Either an extension (such as the Blood Pool Secret Realm), or the main body appeared, the size unknown, the reason for its existence unknown.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, no strange beings had appeared yet, as if there were no living beings.</p><p></p><p>But in the past more than a month, these six major secret lands had received bad news, all with mysterious changes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were nurturing something.</p><p></p><p>As the head of the department, he knew more.</p><p></p><p>For these six major secret lands to survive, they needed a fourth-tier existence to start with.</p><p></p><p>And a fourth-tier existence was an entity formed by the true self, that is, a normal thinking living being.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence with human-like intelligence and spirituality, no matter how one looked at it, was not to be provoked.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the fourth tier was too difficult. </p><p></p><p>He himself was at the late third tier, and he knew the difficulty of achieving the fourth tier.</p><p></p><p>This was a leap from the ground to the sky.</p><p></p><p>If he did not fall and succeeded in reaching the fourth tier, the strange beings would completely become his power, and there would no longer be the crisis of being invaded and devoured, becoming a true self-existing entity that the strange beings could not distort.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, if he could not hold on and fell, the strange beings would give birth to intelligence and become a new living being.</p><p></p><p>It would be like the birth of a primordial living being, a perfect existence from the beginning at the fourth tier.</p><p></p><p>This was the difference between the two species. Bi Xia did not believe that the strange beings would give birth to true self-intelligence and would think of themselves as human.</p><p></p><p>In reality, no such strange beings had been found, but there were signs of it in the six major secret lands.</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia only hoped that the nurturing would be delayed as long as possible, and that humanity would have the corresponding means before it appeared.</p><p></p><p>A meeting ended without any clue.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that joy and sorrow are not the same.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of a primitive forest.</p><p></p><p>The specific location was difficult to compare, as the Blue Star was changing every moment, and it was already difficult to compare the location, but it could be said that it was roughly in the previous North American region.</p><p></p><p>The headquarters of the Demon Cult.</p><p></p><p>"Believers, the Demon God is gestating, and the mission of our cult to conquer the Blue Star will be realized."</p><p></p><p>"Cheer!"</p><p></p><p>Alexis, the cult leader of the Demon Cult, spread his arms and shouted.</p><p></p><p>This was also an extension of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Cult followers had also discovered the changes in the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>But they were already abnormal. In the eyes of the Exorcism Department, the changes they considered dangerous, they believed were the arrival of the Demon God.</p><p></p><p>And they were the believers of the Demon God, the Demon God would bless them.</p><p></p><p>When the Demon God was born, it would be the moment of glory for their Demon Cult, and no one could stop it.</p><p></p><p>The First Vice Cult Leader Aisha, the Second Vice Cult Leader Matthew-Li, and the twelve Hall Masters were all present.</p><p></p><p>However, one of the Hall Masters was special, a puppet.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it was Gou Jianren, who self-proclaimed to be cautious, prudent, and patient.</p><p></p><p>He could not reveal his true self in the Demon Cult that devoured people without shedding blood. His true self was always a puppet appearing in the Demon Cult.</p><p></p><p>Where was his true self?</p><p></p><p>No one knew.</p><p></p><p>Although Gou Jianren felt that the changes in the Abyss were not right, after self-brainwashing, he felt that Cult Leader Alexis was right.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God would bless them, and when the Demon God was born, he and the other believers would welcome the light.</p><p></p><p>"Gou, I heard you hired an assassin to kill Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>Alexis asked the puppet at the round table after the celebration ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dao.</p><p></p><p>Alexis always felt uncomfortable, a human puppet...</p><p></p><p>Gou Jianren also felt uncomfortable, didn't he? The worst part of joining the Cult of the Demon is this.</p><p></p><p>These foreigners call themselves Gou, although it's not that dog.</p><p></p><p>But the English 'dog' is even more uncomfortable. No, it's not just uncomfortable, it's practically an insult.</p><p></p><p>Every time they call me Gou, Gou, Gou, I almost can't help but go 'woof, woof, woof'.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Eminence, this person poses a great threat to us. The human world does not allow other extraordinary paths, and after the Deity descends, He will absolutely not be pleased to see supernatural beings that are not bestowed by His grace, so he must be eliminated." Gou Jianren said.</p><p></p><p>Alexis heard this with great satisfaction. Gou's behavior may be awkward, but his loyalty is commendable.</p><p></p><p>He is more devoted to the Demon God than this group of people, and deeply hates his own backward country.</p><p></p><p>He fully agrees with the doctrine and the actions of the church, he is a loyal believer.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Gou, you're absolutely right. The Demon God will sense your loyalty, Gou..."</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, you can call me by my name, Gou is my surname."</p><p></p><p>Calling him Gou over and over again made Gou Jianren uncomfortable. Luckily he's not a real person, but a puppet, if he were a real person he might lose control.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Gou. I know your surname has other meanings, your characters are too cumbersome. When the Demon God conquers your country, I'll make them all say 'English'. You... Okay, I remember now, your name is 'Lowly', right? From now on I'll try to call you Lowly."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Your Eminence, it's Jianren, not Lowly?"</p><p></p><p>Alexis and the others present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Well, what's the difference? Lowly!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, please just call me Gou."</p><p></p><p>Even as a puppet, Gou Jianren had a sense of giving up the struggle.</p><p></p><p>Elsa said, "Gou, or Lowly, you should take an English name, that would be easier to address."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes." The puppet immediately jumped up excitedly, "Your Eminence, everyone, from now on please call me Jack. That's my English name."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Jack-Gou."</p><p></p><p>Gou Jianren: "..."</p><p></p><p>The meeting dispersed, and Gou Jianren was still dazed, wondering why. But his plan to assassinate Xuanhuang was recognized by the entire senior leadership of the congregation.</p><p></p><p>Including Alexis and the two deputy leaders, they all agreed with his actions, and even increased the stakes. They said that if one attempt didn't work, they would continue, and anyone who opposed the Deity must be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Before the Deity has descended and bestowed His grace upon the world, no extraordinary paths can appear, this is blasphemy, it is sacrilege.</p><p></p><p>These blasphemers must be eliminated by the loyal believers.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is doomed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black building that emanates a strange power.</p><p></p><p>The building is surrounded by a layer of mist, with a radius of about 100 meters.</p><p></p><p>The building is a blend of modern and traditional Chinese architecture.</p><p></p><p>The entrance is engraved with the four characters "Bizarre Society Headquarters".</p><p></p><p>This is the headquarters of the Bizarre Society, and also the main body of the Bizarre Society's chairman, Qiao Liangyu.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Liangyu, a third-level Spiritual Master, controls the Bizarre Society.</p><p></p><p>Similar to the Exorcism Department's Tangsong building, this is a bizarre building.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bizarreness often comes with a bizarre domain, which is very rare and powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Bizarre Society has three floors, the first floor has twelve room doors, and each door can connect to an attached building.</p><p></p><p>It's like a spatial teleportation.</p><p></p><p>As long as a medium is planted in a building and it is invaded by the Bizarre Society, no matter how far the distance, as long as you open a door on the first floor, the other side will be the attached building.</p><p></p><p>But the main body of the Bizarre Society, no one knows its exact location.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang were to discover this, it would be very similar to the inner world of the Bizarre Clock. </p><p></p><p>It should also be a spatial fragment world, or a time fragment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the doors on the first floor opened, and a middle-aged woman walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman, your subordinate has an important report."</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>A staircase appeared on the second floor of the Bizarre Society.</p><p></p><p>"Come up."</p><p></p><p>A majestic voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The woman walked up the stairs towards the second floor.</p><p></p><p>The second floor also has twelve room doors, but currently only two are visible, the other ten are in a illusory state. And only one can be opened, this one, is the source of the Bizarre Society's divine blood.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The voice came from all directions, as if it was separated by time and space.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Liangyu's true face is not seen by many, this person is very cautious, and only his most trusted followers have seen him.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman, a underground society in the South City suffered a huge loss, the room space seemed to have disappeared into thin air, and the members of the Cult of the Demon, the members of the Exorcism Department, as well as the Three Brothers of the Bizarre Rats all disappeared. Our service girls there are also missing."</p><p></p><p>"Investigation?" Qiao Liangyu's voice was very calm.</p><p></p><p>"The subordinate has not found any clues, it seems they just disappeared into thin air. But there is a lead."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me."</p><p></p><p>The woman said, "These people gathered to target Xuanhuang, the Three Brothers of the Bizarre Rats were hired killers by the Cult of the Demon, and the members of the Exorcism Department in the South City must have betrayed us. All of this may be related to Xuanhuang."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang?" </p><p></p><p>A fluctuation, and Qiao Liangyu seemed to walk out of the space.</p><p></p><p>"Although Xuanhuang's rise is short-lived, I do recognize him." Qiao Liangyu was dressed in a long robe, his hair tied up, with a simple hairpin.</p><p></p><p>He had a very transcendent appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It can be said that Xia Country also has many talents, but I don't recognize many of them. The Exorcism Department's Zhao Zheng, Han Wu, and Tang Song were just lucky, not worth mentioning; the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio are already dead bones in the grave, unlikely to achieve great success; the Divine Alliance's Divine Lord is a petty person who has gained some power, the Exorcism Sect's Sect Master is not worth mentioning... Dragon Teacher and Bi Xia are not bad, worthy of my respect, and the third person is this short-lived rising Xuanhuang. I have some recognition for this person, how did he come into conflict with the Society?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Liangyu had the air of a connoisseur of heroes.</p><p></p><p>Wow, those who are not worth mentioning are just dead bones in the grave. He barely recognizes Xuanhuang, Dragon Yue, and Bi Xia.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman, it's confirmed."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Liangyu pondered for a while: "Then follow the rules. If it's true? It's Xuanhuang who has violated our rules, attacked our guests, and caused us losses, then let's set a price. "</p><p></p><p>"This? Chairman, do you need to set a bounty? This person... You?"</p><p></p><p>"Recognition is recognition, but he can't violate the rules of our Society. Setting a bounty is following the rules, if it doesn't work, we'll take care of it ourselves. The rules I set are the heavenly rules, although I recognize him, he is too reckless, how can he provoke our Society? Sigh, such a promising talent, I was hoping to befriend him when he achieves greater success, but now he's just a shooting star."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he didn't wait for the woman to reply, and continued, "Okay, go do it. The divine blood has a huge demand recently, I need to go collect it... Really, I'm breaking my heart for those Spiritual Masters."</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>He then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The woman could only go back and carry out the order. When she saw the clues, she felt it was a pity, a pity for such a talented person. If it was Xuanhuang, in her eyes, he was doomed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just to say, those who have read this should have seen it, right? This book has bizarre as the skin, and agricultural construction as the bones. Some readers have reflected that there is no atmosphere of bizarre flow, and several classic bizarre flow books have already been very good, so it's better to have some small innovations in the writing style.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

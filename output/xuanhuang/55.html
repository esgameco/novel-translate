        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not only was the heart very warm, the emotions were also very warm.</p><p></p><p>Fully equipped and ready to go, about 80% of the items that needed to be transferred had been sent to Qingyun Mountain in the previous few days.</p><p></p><p>Today was the formal relocation, a big day.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts schools in the city still existed, but they were divided into two parts.</p><p></p><p>There would still be some skilled masters and personnel stationed there, while the majority of the skilled masters went to Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Mountain was not too far from the city, just a little over half an hour's drive.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan is ready, we can set off now."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui came to the separate courtyard and saw Sun Tong helping Xuan Huang tidy up his clothes.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't really necessary, but Sun Tong insisted on doing it, and Xuan Huang didn't stop her.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xuan Huang took the first step.</p><p></p><p>The group followed him and arrived at the entrance of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>All around, there were crowds of people, mostly the school's staff, as well as the school's clients and the employees of the companies under the school's protection.</p><p></p><p>What Xuan Huang was most excited about was the martial arts school, and the second was the companies that the school had shares in or directly controlled.</p><p></p><p>They were also happy that the martial arts school was growing stronger and bigger.</p><p></p><p>In this chaotic world, one needed to find a protective umbrella, and the Zhenjie Department was high and mighty, requiring careful selection.</p><p></p><p>The Dao School and the martial arts school may have looked ordinary, but to the Zhenjie Department, they were formidable existences that ordinary people could not resist.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Master Xuan Huang?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he indeed has an extraordinary aura. With Master Xuan as our pillar, our future will be much easier."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, ever since the school has had shares in our companies, doors that were previously closed to us have now opened wide."</p><p></p><p>"Business has indeed become much easier."</p><p></p><p>The managers of various companies exchanged views.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Master Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is Master Xuan, the one recognized by the Dragon Master, the one who has transcended the martial arts. Since Master Xuan has arrived, the number of casualties in the martial arts school has dropped sharply. Previously, there were several a week, but now there hasn't been a single one in half a month."</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to Master Xuan. May the gods and Buddhas bless Master Xuan with good health."</p><p></p><p>This was the conversation of the families of the martial arts school members.</p><p></p><p>They felt the impact the most directly.</p><p></p><p>Because of Xuan Huang's presence, their husbands, wives, children, and parents were all alive, and this was the greatest premise of their respect for Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts school is moving to Qingyun Mountain, what will we do if we need help in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Not everything is moving there, only the majority of the skilled masters. My husband said it was Master Xuan's decision, that martial artists would not progress well in the city, and the wilderness was the greatest catalyst for their advancement."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that even more dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's a trade-off. Anything has its pros and cons. Going to Qingyun Mountain with Master Xuan is certainly more dangerous, but also allows for faster progress."</p><p></p><p>"This is the choice of the martial artists themselves, there is no compulsion. If you want to progress, go to Qingyun Mountain; if you want safety, stay in the city. There are no hard rules, it's up to the individual."</p><p></p><p>"What about your husband?"</p><p></p><p>"My husband is only 36, he was once a martial artist, and now he's at the Refine Body Third Layer. He says he still wants to progress, to see higher realms of the martial arts. I can't really stop him. On one hand, it's his dream, on the other hand, I'm worried about his safety. Ah, now I understand the ancient saying 'Regret making your husband seek a marquis title'."</p><p></p><p>"My wife is the same, she's at the Refine Body Second Layer and also plans to go to Qingyun Mountain, coming back once a week. My son will be 16 next year, and my wife plans to take him to Qingyun Mountain as well."</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll be left all alone at home, haha..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my wife is so strong-willed, what can I do? I can only stay and guard the home. With her taking our son away, being left alone at home doesn't matter to me anymore. In these chaotic times, just being alive is good enough."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's true."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the expectations and concerns of countless people, the convoy slowly set off, heading towards Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>On the outermost edge of the crowd,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group from the Dao Mansion was just as focused as the group from the Martial Arts Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Because today was also their big day - the Dao Mansion's small relocation, which was also the day for the Mysterious Master to transmit the Dao, cultivate qi, and cultivate the spirit.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Martial Arts Mansion set out, they quietly followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Behind them was also a convoy, led by Xu Ruyi and the members of the Exorcism Department. Some were there to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Some were there to congratulate the Martial Arts Mansion.</p><p></p><p>But whether the ones demanding an explanation were there to congratulate or to pick a fight, they kept a low profile and stayed at the back.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they didn't know that there were people behind them as well.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>It was the hurriedly arrived Confucian, Daoist, and Buddhist trio.</p><p></p><p>Daoist Elder Jiu Tong said, "From afar, he doesn't seem like an ordinary person. His aura is outstanding and ethereal, with the bearing of a Daoist immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, Jiu Tong, is he a martial artist?" said Yan Lai.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, you two have clung to appearances. Originally, there is nothing, so what can stir up dust? The Mysterious Master is just the Mysterious Master, just as my Buddha is my Buddha. Don't be misled by the surface," said the Buddhist.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely not misled, the Mysterious Master won't be your Buddha, he'll be himself," said the Confucian.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the three of them were still the leaders of the three teachings. Their cultivation might be at the mortal limit, but they were still far behind the Spiritual Masters.</p><p></p><p>But why were their positions so high?</p><p></p><p>The key was that their sects were powerful.</p><p></p><p>Among the Spiritual Masters, there were many who belonged to Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism. Among the martial artists, there were even more. And among the cultivators, they occupied the vast majority.</p><p></p><p>No one could deny that among the Spiritual Masters who could manipulate the occult, those who belonged to these three schools were almost all better able to control themselves and less likely to lose control.</p><p></p><p>Their doctrinal classics played an immensely important role in this.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the heart, cultivating the mind, cultivating the intent, they were the experts.</p><p></p><p>They had come not only as representatives of the Exorcism Department headquarters, but also as representatives of the three schools, hoping to find a way forward for the three schools from Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Daoism covered a wide range, and they could cultivate essence, qi, and spirit, and were especially skilled in formations, elixirs, and more.</p><p></p><p>Buddhism was the same, they could cultivate essence, qi, and spirit, and were also adept at cultivating the mind.</p><p></p><p>Confucianism was also the same, they did not reject essence, qi, and spirit, and were most proficient in the qi of righteousness.</p><p></p><p>The three schools, strictly speaking, only lacked cultivable techniques.</p><p></p><p>As long as this was supplemented, given some time, they could take flight.</p><p></p><p>Over the thousands of years, these people had accumulated too much.</p><p></p><p>And they were not the last batch.</p><p></p><p>The last batch was a bit mixed, including investigators from the Occult Association, idle Spiritual Masters, as well as martial artists and cultivators from near the Southern City, hurrying to catch up.</p><p></p><p>In short, those who should come and those who shouldn't have all come.</p><p></p><p>They were all waiting to set out for Qingyun Mountain, to witness the new era of the Martial Arts Mansion.</p><p></p><p>After half an hour's journey, the convoy of nearly three hundred people from the Martial Arts Mansion arrived at Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newly renovated tourist resort, the name "Qingyun Mountain" was now carved on the stone gate.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not a famous mountain, it would change.</p><p></p><p>A mountain need not be high to have immortals, as long as one is there, then Qingyun Mountain will become a famous mountain, and become the ancestral land of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Let's begin," said Xuanhuang as he got off the car.</p><p></p><p>The sound of ceremonial cannons rang out, as the formalities were necessary.</p><p></p><p>After the cannon fire ended, the group walked to the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Entering the main hall, it was simple, without any sacrificial activities.</p><p></p><p>After the formalities were completed, the group from the Martial Arts Mansion began to bustle about.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xuanhuang would give a sermon to the martial artists who had attained a 70% understanding of the Contemplation Diagram, for this was the most important part.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists who had attained a 70% understanding of the Contemplation Diagram were already eagerly awaiting.</p><p></p><p>And Xuanhuang followed Sun Hui to his new home, a courtyard that combined modern and classical styles.</p><p></p><p>...

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the will reached the profound transformation and refined the third layer of the will, the Xuanhuang began to condense the third heavenly pillar.</p><p></p><p>The ninety-zhang sea of qi, the three-layer will, Xuanhuang could achieve one-time formation, refining one complete heavenly pillar at a time.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>The golden sea of qi surged, generating waves of qi.</p><p></p><p>The will transformed into a giant hand to absorb the power of the thirty-zhang sea of qi, and under the refinement of the will, a nine-zhang golden heavenly pillar was condensed.</p><p></p><p>The giant hand transformed from the will was seen embracing the nine-zhang golden heavenly pillar, jumping onto the first heavenly pillar.</p><p></p><p>It then leaped onto the second heavenly pillar, which was already far away from the golden sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang let out a loud roar, and the giant hand of the will threw the golden heavenly pillar into the distance.</p><p></p><p>One heavenly pillar was deeper in the mist of the sea of qi than the other.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>A loud sound came from afar, and the golden heavenly pillar stood in the mist of the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang quickly opened the celestial gate on the furnace, and the celestial gate was immediately connected to the third heavenly pillar with the other two pillars.</p><p></p><p>The previously shaking third heavenly pillar became stable the moment the celestial gate opened and closed, standing firm against the surging mist of the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>The three heavenly pillars and the celestial gate formed a formation-like connection.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang let out a sigh of relief, although he had a strong grasp, every time he erected the heavenly pillars in the mist of the sea of qi, it always made him invest his body and mind.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>Continuing the effort, since the third heavenly pillar had already been erected, the refinement of the will at the profound transformation level should also begin.</p><p></p><p>There were still people waiting for him in the inner world.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the connection of the three pillars was like entering the high-speed lane, with the surging and mixed spiritual forces of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Close!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt that the influx of the forces of heaven and earth was about enough, so he closed the celestial gate.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The forces of heaven and earth forged his will like a hammer.</p><p></p><p>Each layer was more difficult to refine than the previous one, until the next morning, when Xuanhuang finally completed the first round of refinement of the profound transformation level.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing a slight increase in strength and will, Xuanhuang thought of the Mysterious Rat Trio in the inner world again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be impatient, it's almost time."</p><p></p><p>As long as he could condense the second celestial gate and the fourth heavenly pillar, Xuanhuang would be confident in defeating the Mysterious Rat Trio.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Sect will also be driven out of the South City soon."</p><p></p><p>Without investigation, one would not know; a thorough investigation would be startling.</p><p></p><p>That night, Xuanhuang did not leave immediately, thinking about the dozens of young girls in the private room, and decided to take them away as well.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't take them away, one could imagine what awaited them.</p><p></p><p>So, Xuanhuang investigated that underground sect.</p><p></p><p>The result... Human organs of all kinds were available, not knowing whether they were for consumption by some perverts, or for replacement by the Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After all, not many Spiritual Cultivators who control the Mysterious Ones have intact bodies, even if the Spiritual Cultivators don't have organs, it doesn't prevent those with a compulsive disorder from needing a nominal organ.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Sect provides such commodities.</p><p></p><p>There were also countless victims of abuse and murder, it was truly heartbreaking.</p><p></p><p>Through spatial transfer, Xuanhuang rescued them and handed them over to the South City Martial Arts Hall, instructing them to take good care of them, provide psychological counseling, and help them start anew.</p><p></p><p>For these people, Xuanhuang could only do so much, whether they could stand up again depended on their own fate.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were too many pitiful people, and he couldn't save them all.</p><p></p><p>The only way to truly save these people was to eradicate the existence of the Mysterious Sect, only by removing the malignant tumor could it be resolved once and for all.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the endless rescue would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang, who was deep in thought, was pulled back by a sound from the Heavenly-Earth Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"It's 7:30, I know."</p><p></p><p>"Go."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-Earth Furnace had been very busy lately, training with Xuanhuang at night and going to the Meritorious Hall to refine fierce beasts during the day.</p><p></p><p>The busiest one on the entire Qingcloud Mountain was this furnace.</p><p></p><p>As expected, in the Meritorious Hall, the Dao Sect members were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>"Here they are, here they are, line up, line up, the Dao Sect is first today."</p><p></p><p>The hosting woman said.</p><p></p><p>After that, she took the "Dao Sect First" plaque.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sect representative this time was Master Ma, a powerful expert, but he didn't really need to come, but these past few days he couldn't find Xuanhuang and was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>So he took the opportunity to come and inquire.</p><p></p><p>He threw the fierce beasts from his spatial ring into the furnace, not even caring about the Heavenly-Earth Furnace.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were already familiar with it, just throw them in and wait for the essence blood to be received.</p><p></p><p>"Little Wang, is Master Xuan still very busy?"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma asked the hosting woman, whose surname was Wang.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma, I'm not too sure either, but Sister Tong said not to bother Master Xuan recently, Master Xuan has been going out early and coming back late, so he must have something important to do."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Master Ma said.</p><p></p><p>He was looking for Xuanhuang because of his disciple Gao Jue, who had agreed to be refined in the furnace once.</p><p></p><p>Whether he would become a monkey or a human, it all depended on this time.</p><p></p><p>"Little Wang, please help me inquire, if Master Xuan is not too busy, be sure to let the old Dao know."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master Ma, I won't forget."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Sect doesn't taboo this, in fact, they now encourage getting married and starting a family, after all, the population is dwindling.</p><p></p><p>It's a change with the times, in this era they encourage getting married and starting a family, if the cultivators are ruined by marriage and family, then their Dao heart is not that great.</p><p></p><p>Maybe they will work even harder because of love and family.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma left with the refined essence blood, the storage ring and other storage techniques were very convenient.</p><p></p><p>On Xuanhuang's side.</p><p></p><p>After the Heavenly-Earth Furnace left.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang summoned Sun Tong, ever since that day when this girl had a true emotional outpouring towards him, she had always been blushing.</p><p></p><p>It had been a few days before she recovered, not knowing if she had come to terms with it or just thrown caution to the wind.</p><p></p><p>"How's the statistics from the major schools in South City?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the thirty-three high schools and twelve universities have all agreed, they are fully cooperating."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. The younger ones have unstable thoughts, meditation and cultivation are difficult, the primary and secondary schools should maintain the current status, focus on studying and cultivating the basics. After completing the nine-year system, they can reach the first layer of body refining and qi condensation in high school, then they can start to comprehend the Observation Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to promote this in the major universities.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the schools mostly teach students based on the cultivation methods in the small worlds, which have seriously deviated from the current situation.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, his younger cousin Liu Wen'guo had mustered up the courage to give him a call again.</p><p></p><p>Asking if the students could learn his techniques.</p><p></p><p>Since Xuanhuang came to Qingcloud Mountain, the Martial Arts Hall had also brought in Xuanhuang's relatives.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang's relatives were all very sensible, knowing that Xuanhuang was no longer the Xuanhuang of the past. As the revered Master Xuan, they would not blatantly take advantage of him, they were not fools, to blatantly take advantage would be to sever the relationship.</p><p></p><p>Being brought to the precious Qingcloud Mountain, they were already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>The capable children in the family had all been recruited by the major forces, and the incapable ones just lived a good life, finding a job to make a living in Qingcloud Mountain was not difficult.</p><p></p><p>In short, Xuanhuang did not experience any disastrous events.</p><p></p><p>When his cousin Liu Wen'guo called him, he spoke with the tone of facing a deity.</p><p></p><p>Stammering, he said that his...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The students know that Master Xuan is spreading the Tao, and they ask if it can be popularized starting from the schools? This matter reminded Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>The current school system has also undergone a complete transformation. Previously, the government supported it, but now the government is just a nominal existence.</p><p></p><p>Now it is the Exorcism Departments, Taoist Temples, and Martial Arts Halls in various provinces and cities that are supporting the establishment.</p><p></p><p>After all, the reason why the Summer Nation emphasizes education is that even after the strange revival, the world pattern and the power holders have undergone huge changes, but they still attach importance to children and education.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Xuan Huang called Sun Tong, Sun Hui, Li Tong, and others to contact the major universities.</p><p></p><p>The schools were naturally delighted, as they had long been looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>The Exorcism Department, such as Xu Ruyi, also gave strong support.</p><p></p><p>Thus, it was decided that starting from high schools, those with the talent for cultivation who have reached the levels of Refining the Spirit, Refining the Body, and Refining the Qi, and can enter the Spirit Sea through mental cultivation, can participate in the study of the Visualization Diagrams in a systematic manner.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, if it's like this, the secret rooms may not be enough, and the Visualization Diagrams may not be enough either. There are also many cultivators coming from afar?"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang had already thought of this.</p><p></p><p>After pulling the Three Rat Brothers into the Inner World without any major problems, Xuan Huang felt that the Inner World had great potential.</p><p></p><p>He can completely refine some mediums that exist, and through the mediums, enter the Inner World.</p><p></p><p>Place the Visualization Diagrams in the Inner World, and the major schools don't need to come to Qingyun Mountain, they can enter the Inner World through the mediums to study and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Even in the future, Qingyun Mountain will have to be restricted, as too many people coming would be a burden.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who have achieved success need to return to the places they came from, and other places also need to be guarded.</p><p></p><p>For now, there is no way to just start, so the cultivators can come to Qingyun Mountain, but it can't be a permanent solution.</p><p></p><p>The Inner World is a good place, no matter where they are, as long as there is a medium, they can enter.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang also needs the cultivators to branch out from Qingyun Mountain and leave the Southern City.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that, I've already thought of a solution, and it will be resolved within half a month at the latest. You just need to compile the statistics. Meanwhile, also organize and compile the introductory cultivation methods and materials from the Martial Dao Alliance, Taoist Sect, Buddhist Sect, and Confucian School, print them into books, and distribute them to the schools, so that the schools can systematically learn, and achieve a seamless connection in the future."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xuan Huang already had a solution, Sun Tong did not ask further.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan, I will go to the four major factions and have them provide the basic skills and integrated experiences of the introductory cultivation stage."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>There are no more suitable textbooks than these.</p><p></p><p>Although the four factions have followed Xuan Huang's Tao for a short time, they have already integrated the necessary experiences.</p><p></p><p>As for the basic skills in the introductory stage, they have systematic methods such as static cultivation, stake cultivation, fist techniques, and entering the meditative state.</p><p></p><p>Learning the basic skills of the four factions in the introductory stage is the right choice.</p><p></p><p>They cannot create extraordinary methods or willpower methods, but their basic skills are no different.</p><p></p><p>As he was leaving...</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Master Xuan, Grandmaster Ma has requested an audience several times in the past few days... You previously said not to disturb you without important matters, so I turned him down. Will you see him?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xuan Huang immediately thought of Gao Jue.</p><p></p><p>It must be about the matter they discussed before, and it seems that his disciple Gao Jue has agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Just tell him that I know, don't be in a hurry, and let Gao Jue think it over. I'll find him after I'm done with my other matters."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong conveyed the message, as it was related to the romantic entanglement of his subordinate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Haggard in appearance, with an expression of panic and even a hint of madness and regret.</p><p></p><p>This is the description of the faces of the Three Rat Brothers, Dong Xingbao, Sun Xuejian, and Lü Yuan, as well as the other three people.</p><p></p><p>The Three Rat Brothers are still doing relatively well, but the other three are on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>In the gloomy world, the unattainable mountains, the illusory maze, the void - this is the desperate environment they find themselves in.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the extraordinary physiques of the Spiritual Masters, they would also have to endure the torment of hunger and thirst.</p><p></p><p>"Can't get out, can't get out," the tall and thin Lü Yuan muttered soullessly.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, if you keep muttering, I'll kill you. Scram!" the irritable Wu Delei roared.</p><p></p><p>The three brothers were once the masters of the rivers and lakes, but they never imagined they would end up in this place.</p><p></p><p>For a day and a night, the eldest brother, a Second-Stage cultivator, had been searching for an exit, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>The illusory mountains could not be approached, and another passage with a sense of spiritual energy was suppressed by a pressure like that of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Whether to forcefully break through or not, it was hard to say, but it was certain that they could not break through the oppressive force of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Lü Yuan was startled awake by the threatening Wu Delei.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, please... save me..."</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was begging for mercy, a huge tree root suddenly pulled him into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, don't you dare run!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Delei shouted in alarm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately noticing, the furious Wu Deran unleashed an attack, but the tree root had already disappeared underground.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, damn it, Xuan Huang, come out, we can negotiate."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, I know you're there, come out."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, Master Xuan, I, Dong Xingbao, submit, please let me out."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Huang, come out..."</p><p></p><p>The five of them either pleaded, or were angry, or had complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>But there was not a single response from Xuan Huang, who remained silent.</p><p></p><p>If Xuan Huang would just communicate with them, their inner pressure would be halved.</p><p></p><p>But Xuan Huang would not communicate with them, letting them descend into despair and collapse, which is their destiny.</p><p></p><p>Attacking them once a day, using the opportunity when they have a chance and waiting when they don't, they will eventually suffer a mental breakdown.</p><p></p><p>The fewer of them there are, the more desperate they will become.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang found that the opportunity was gone, and continuing to act would not be ideal, so he continued to hide, waiting for tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, what are we going to do?"</p><p></p><p>What to do? Wu Deran didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>But he occasionally let out a cold glance at his two brothers.</p><p></p><p>Since there is no other way, he can only make that decision and fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Ruthless and unscrupulous as he is, he can sacrifice anyone when necessary.</p><p></p><p>His meticulous care for the two brothers is for a purpose.</p><p></p><p>The three brothers control the same Bizarre abilities of the Rat, with the elder brother having fused two parts, the second brother's Rat Body, and the third brother's Rat Tail.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the four parts would make them a Fourth-Stage existence, which has always been the deepest plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Hoping to one day devour the second and third brothers, and achieve the Fourth-Stage.</p><p></p><p>It's a good plan, but extremely difficult to implement.</p><p></p><p>He hopes that through the fusion of the two brothers, he can erode the Bizarre properties of the Rat Body and Rat Tail, and by being together often, he can make himself and the Rat Body and Rat Tail more compatible, while also familiarizing himself with their abilities.</p><p></p><p>"If there is no other way, we can only try to fight to the death," Wu Deran thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But he said aloud, "Don't panic, does panicking solve any problems? At least Xuan Huang can't do anything to us, as long as he can't do anything to us, we'll have a chance to escape with our lives. We three brothers have overcome so many dangers, I believe we can turn this crisis into an opportunity this time as well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the elder brother's words, the other two brothers found some comfort.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother has always been like this, and he has always kept his word. </p><p></p><p>Since the elder brother says so, they believe the elder brother can still lead them to escape this predicament.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The last chapter yesterday was not edited, and there were typos and sentences that were not smooth. I fixed them today. Sorry about that.</p><p></p><p>I've been feeling unwell lately, maybe it's mycoplasma pneumonia that's causing it, feeling weak all over, mind foggy, and also have a splitting headache, toothache, and mouth sores. It's really uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Finally, please subscribe, collect, and vote. Thank you all.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

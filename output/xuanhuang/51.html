        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Minister, it's a long story," said Gao Xiaolan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi said, "Then just give me the short version."</p><p></p><p>"It's like this..." </p><p></p><p>As Gao Xiaolan described the situation, Xu Ryi was first shocked, then angry, and then continued to be shocked.</p><p></p><p>During this period, seeking help everywhere didn't lead to this kind of understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Is what you're saying true?" Xu Ryi asked.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan replied, "Minister, just take a look at the Mysterious Forum and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>Reminded of this, Xu Ryi, who had been seeking help for some time, hadn't checked the forum for a while. </p><p></p><p>He opened it, and sure enough.</p><p></p><p>Half of the hot events were reporting on Nanshi Xuanhuang's extraordinary martial arts achievements.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't the department report this to me?" </p><p></p><p>Regardless of whether it was true or not, Xu Ryi was a bit angry that such a figure had emerged in the city, and he didn't even know about it.</p><p></p><p>"Minister, I only just received a call from the department to learn about this."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Minister, it's because Vice Minister Jia Zhengyi felt that Xuanhuang posed a threat to the Spiritualists, so he started to suppress Xuanhuang. Xuanhuang first sealed the Mysterious Corpse Tree, demonstrating his abilities, and afterwards... Vice Minister Jia disappeared. Then Deputy Minister Dong didn't continue to follow up on the news, so it was leaked out."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi roughly understood the situation - it was an issue of communication.</p><p></p><p>Not only on the internet, even communication itself was obstructed.</p><p></p><p>Now communication within the city was still fine, with intra-city communication.</p><p></p><p>But cross-province, they could only rely on the Mysterious Network. Since Jia Zhengyi had been suppressing the information from reaching Xu Ryi, the news naturally couldn't be transmitted.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Jia Zhengyi disappeared that the news was reported up.</p><p></p><p>"Jia Zhengyi, that old fellow, look at the good deeds he's done. Hmph, I won't let him off the hook."</p><p></p><p>"Minister, after he disappeared, the lower levels suspect Xuanhuang did it. Furthermore, there's news that Jia Zhengyi hired the assassin Mysterious Shadow Qi Long, and Mysterious Shadow Qi Long has also been seen appearing at the Mysterious Association in Nanshi, but he has also disappeared like Jia Zhengyi."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There's this as well? Suspect Xuanhuang, do they have any concrete evidence?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan replied, "No, but apart from him, no one else could have done it, at least on the surface."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi didn't dwell on it. "Forget it, regardless of these matters, let's go back first, and when we see Xuanhuang, the truth will be revealed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi then asked, "By the way, how is the public opinion online?"</p><p></p><p>"Minister, the majority don't believe it, mainly the Spiritualist group. But half of the Cultivation and Martial Arts practitioners choose to believe it, and many have already taken action, planning to go to Nanshi."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan continued, "The main reason is that the Nanshi Exorcism Department hasn't given a clear explanation, they just released the news and then there was no further movement."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi frowned. "How are the lower levels handling this? Where's Dong Xingbao, that opportunist, how is he handling this?"</p><p></p><p>"Minister, with you not there and Vice Minister Jia disappearing, the lower levels may have lost their backbone and are a bit chaotic."</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to flatter me, I, Xu Ryi, know myself well enough, I'm not that charismatic."</p><p></p><p>He said, "Jia Zhengyi's disdainful attitude towards martial artists and cultivators has been prevalent in the department. To maintain stability, I didn't suppress it too much before, plus that old fellow was quite cunning, and many Spiritualists in the department shared his views. This was my mistake."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi continued, "It's already good that the news was released. Expecting that group of old fellows to put in the effort to explain things clearly to everyone, that's impossible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ryi seemed to have seen through the thoughts of some Spiritualists in the department.</p><p></p><p>Truthfully, if it wasn't for Dong Xingbao and the investigation team's people spreading the news, it really wouldn't have been pushed forward.</p><p></p><p>Whether Xuanhuang is truly extraordinary or not, they know best.</p><p></p><p>It's precisely because it's true that they suppress it, if it were false, they wouldn't suppress it.</p><p></p><p>It's related to their own interests. If martial artists become prominent, the status of Spiritualists in Nanshi would decline.</p><p></p><p>As for the benefits of the rise of martial artists, the Spiritualist bigwigs don't care.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The matter.</p><p></p><p>You, the martial arts master, protect ordinary people, but I, the spiritual master, do not need your protection.</p><p></p><p>And on the other side...</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, the forum is in an uproar, look, look." The ignition of this news was the happiest thing for the South City Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang excitedly looked at the hot forum, and whenever he saw something he didn't like, he would personally go online to refute it.</p><p></p><p>While typing on his phone, he walked towards Sun Hui's office.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he accidentally bumped into three people.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he was too immersed in the passionate keyboard rhetoric and didn't see anyone.</p><p></p><p>And among the two people he bumped into, they were both looking down and typing on their keyboards, both passionately expressing their views.</p><p></p><p>They were all trying their best to show that the spiritual master is real, and you must believe them, because they are practitioners of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>They were happy to get recognition, and they would argue when they encountered doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wu Gang rushing in, Sun Hui immediately hid his phone.</p><p></p><p>[Damn, slandering the spiritual master, you better not...]</p><p></p><p>The sentence was not even finished.</p><p></p><p>Who isn't a keyboard warrior these days?</p><p></p><p>"Be more composed, look at yourself, the deputy hall master using a phone to argue with people, pay attention to your image."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui said sternly to educate Wu Gang.</p><p></p><p>"It's mainly because too many people are being stubborn and don't believe it's real. Especially those spiritual masters with their arrogant attitude, I can't stand them like that."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang admitted he was wrong, but didn't change.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the personnel manager deputy hall master Gao Jian also came to report good news.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the South City Martial Arts Hall is the happiest.</p><p></p><p>This "happiness" is not about completely relaxing and lying down.</p><p></p><p>But rather, with the support of the towering tree, the "youthful spirit" inherent in human nature has been released.</p><p></p><p>Previously, there were always casualties, all kinds of accidents, and they were always helpless in the face of crises.</p><p></p><p>Only sighs, regrets, and sorrows were left behind.</p><p></p><p>In the past half month, things have changed.</p><p></p><p>It has become almost without any sacrifices, everyone is smiling, and everyone is full of ambition for the future.</p><p></p><p>The upright Wu Gang, the serious Sun Hui, the diligent Gao Jian, the taciturn Song Hongliang, the three deputy hall masters and the hall master, as if they have put down a heavy burden.</p><p></p><p>Because they have something to rely on.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the serious-faced Sun Hui speaking, the smiling Wu Gang, Gao Jian felt that this feeling was really good, this is how people should live.</p><p></p><p>"In the coming period, there will be martial artists coming from all directions to seek the way, we must be prepared to receive them. Later, I'll ask the spiritual master how to arrange it, this is a good thing for our martial arts hall. If some of the experts who come decide to stay, that will be a huge supplement."</p><p></p><p>"We must become a holy land of the martial way, a place that all martial artists long for in their hearts. Therefore, my colleagues, our mission is arduous, I hope everyone is prepared."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, the spiritual master will certainly become a thorn in the eyes of some evil people, just like what Jia Zhengyi did. This requires us to be even more vigilant, to maximize our abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian nodded: "Don't worry, Master, we will put in our maximum effort. In addition, the renovation of Qingyun Mountain will be completed the day after tomorrow, and after the martial arts hall is moved there, although it is remote and sparsely populated, the advantage is that it will be more difficult for suspicious people to approach."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that's good then."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After the discussion, everyone dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui picked up his phone, saw the unfinished reply? He suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you believe it or not doesn't matter, I don't need to refute you, because I am the one who is right."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui turned off his phone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

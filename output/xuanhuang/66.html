        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Pagoda has another ability.</p><p></p><p>This ability is the reason for the forging of Xuan Huang's magical artifacts.</p><p></p><p>It means that others can also use the pagoda to fight against enemies.</p><p></p><p>It is equivalent to a cultivator possessing a strange ability, but the difference is that the strangeness requires fusion and mastery.</p><p></p><p>While the White Bone Pagoda only needs a special incantation, it is essentially borrowing the power.</p><p></p><p>It's like an Ordained Taoist, who can invoke spells and rituals to borrow techniques from the Patriarch and senior members of the sect.</p><p></p><p>As long as one holds the pagoda and recites the incantation, they can borrow the power.</p><p></p><p>This incantation is actually the switch and imprint of the Great Grinder. By reciting the incantation, a fluctuation will be transmitted and reach the Great Grinder in the Returning Void. The Great Grinder will then recognize it as one of its own: approved!</p><p></p><p>This ability is something Xuan Huang wants to continue developing.</p><p></p><p>He wants to create talismans that can harness the power of the Celestial Forge, the Great Grinder in the Returning Void, and the Soaring Wooden Pillar, all to envelop his Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>His disciples can then borrow this power to fight against enemies.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the cost is the disciples' essence and spirit, there will always be some consumption.</p><p></p><p>For now, they will try using the White Bone Pagoda first.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment! Xuan Huang inexplicably senses a fluctuation coming from the Great Grinder in the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, wanting to refine a Demon Stone?" </p><p></p><p>Although the Great Grinder lacks sentience, it has instincts, because the small world was nurtured by the Heavenly Will during Xuan Huang's refinement. So Xuan Huang can easily sense its thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After refining the White Bone Pagoda, the Great Grinder actually sent out a fluctuation, wanting Xuan Huang to refine a Demon Stone for it.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Stone was obtained from Qi Long, its source is at least of the fourth rank.</p><p></p><p>Its function is to absorb the distorted souls of Illusory Masters.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang plans to go to the underground Demon Lair to find more to refine for the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, after the Great Grinder imbued the White Bone Pagoda with consciousness, it made a new discovery.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, Xuan Huang temporarily abandoned the research on talismans and decided to refine the Demon Stone first.</p><p></p><p>The same steps, but this time it's even simpler, because the Demon Stone has almost no innate nature.</p><p></p><p>After going through the Celestial Forge, the Great Grinder quickly imbued the Demon Stone with a true self-consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Stone transformed from a stone into a transparent round bead, only the size of a chicken egg, and it looked very beautiful with its shimmering luster.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Let me throw it into the gray mist in the small world?"</p><p></p><p>After the Demon Stone was refined into a round bead, the Great Grinder told Xuan Huang to throw the bead into the gray mist outside the small world.</p><p></p><p>This is not a good place at all? It is the internal space of the Great Grinder itself, and even more so, the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>Although Xuan Huang has long occupied this place and even carved out a small world of a thousand meters in radius, the layers of gray mist outside the small world is something he has always avoided, only using the gray mist when tempering the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>This mist has the ability to return all things to the void, and anything thrown into it will be dissolved until it becomes gray mist.</p><p></p><p>Since the instinctive Great Grinder is telling him to do so, it must be useful for the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>The instincts of such a spiritual treasure rarely manifest, and they only appear when it is related to something extremely important to itself.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang doesn't know what the Great Grinder gained from the refinement of the White Bone Pagoda, but since the Great Grinder is instinctively driving this, Xuan Huang will give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the edge of the small world, Xuan Huang threw the refined round bead of the Demon Stone into the gray mist close to the boundary of the Heavenly Will's coverage.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p></p><p>The round bead was quickly enveloped by a layer of gray mist. Its powerful dissolving power, even though the Demon Stone's source was very strong, could not withstand the erosion of the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire transparent bead had turned into a gray stone of the same size.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? How miraculous?"</p><p></p><p>This is the first time he has discovered a second thing under the dissolution of the Returning Void, other than the gray mist.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the gray mist not only had no grass growing, but even stones and sand were non-existent.</p><p></p><p>Under the power of the Returning Void, everything became gray mist.</p><p></p><p>But this round bead actually became a second existence, a gray stone made of gray mist.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang quickly recited an incantation to retrieve the stone bead.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was quick, the will he projected into the gray mist was also eroded and returned to the Void to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>This is the reason why Xuan Huang has always avoided it - this gray mist can even dissolve one's will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder sent another fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>The general meaning is: Quickly, show it to me.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang: ???</p><p></p><p>What kind of thing did I raise?</p><p></p><p>Obediently, Xuan Huang threw the stone bead that had turned into a stone into the place where the two millstones of the Great Grinder were joined.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder quickly started to rotate.</p><p></p><p>"Is it going to refine the gray mist?"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang seems to understand the Great Grinder's idea, this little guy wants to swallow and refine the Returning Void power of the gray mist.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it could not be accessed, and there was nothing that could carry the gray mist.</p><p></p><p>It can enter by itself, but the gray mist is too much and too strong, even if it enters, it may not be able to come out intact.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder does not have a physical form like the Void Saber, and even if some of it is dissolved, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder first coalesced its true will, and entering the gray mist, what is consumed is its true will.</p><p></p><p>True will needs to be arduously nurtured and born, where would there be extra true will to be eroded by the Returning Void?</p><p></p><p>This time, when Xuan Huang refined the White Bone Pagoda, the Great Grinder discovered that these magical artifacts are bestowed with new life by itself, and are completely controllable subordinates.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates are connected to itself, and it can extract various energies from the subordinates.</p><p></p><p>For example, if the White Bone Pagoda absorbs living beings, the spiritual souls of those living beings can be absorbed and refined, and the ones not needed can be left for the subordinate.</p><p></p><p>The source of the Demon Stone is very high-level, able to absorb the distorted souls of Illusory Masters.</p><p></p><p>Since this is the case, after refining it, let the Demon Stone be able to quickly absorb the power of the Returning Void, so that it can continuously extract 'a little bit' of the Returning Void power.</p><p></p><p>Too much would be too much for its own body to bear, but a little bit at a time, with its own repeated tempering, there will one day come a time when it will no longer fear this gray Returning Void power.</p><p></p><p>By then, it will truly be worthy of the name - the Great Grinder of the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>Not like now, when it's called the Great Grinder of the Returning Void, but is actually just a soul-shattering machine.</p><p></p><p>To become the true Great Grinder of the Returning Void, it needs to achieve: the Returning Void of all things, the Returning Void of the world, the Returning Void of time and space, the Returning Void of all laws, the Returning Void of all Dao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is a grand goal.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Great Grinder, even the current gray mist space is just newly born.</p><p></p><p>It can only simply achieve the Returning Void of all things.</p><p></p><p>It cannot achieve the Returning Void of the world, let alone the Returning Void of time and space, the Returning Void of all laws, the Returning Void of all Dao.</p><p></p><p>If it truly achieves the Returning Void of all laws and all Dao, even Xuan Huang's golden immortal soul, no matter how powerful, will be returned to the Void.</p><p></p><p>All Dao returned to the Void, your golden immortal soul... is just a golden immortal soul.</p><p></p><p>But back to the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>As it swallowed the stone bead containing the Returning Void mist, with the rotation of the millstones, the gray mist temporarily attached to the stone bead began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>The dissipating gray mist was devoured by the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle! Sizzle!"</p><p></p><p>Sounds of corrosion and erosion were heard.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Grinder remained unmoved, allowing the gray mist to erode it.</p><p></p><p>Until the erosion and devouring were in opposition, one being devoured and the other being eroded.</p><p></p><p>In the process of mutual harm, the gray Returning Void power became less and less, while the Great Grinder was tempered to become increasingly tenacious.</p><p></p><p>At first, a wisp of gray Returning Void mist could erode a wisp of the Great Grinder's true will.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, it took two wisps of gray Returning Void mist to erode one wisp of the Great Grinder's true will.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder was continuously solidified and forged.</p><p></p><p>Until the stone bead recovered its original appearance and turned into a glass bead.</p><p></p><p>This means that the Returning Void gray mist absorbed by the stone bead has been refined.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The bead was expelled by the Great Grinder, and Xuan Huang held it in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the bead was already pitted and corroded, no longer looking normal.</p><p></p><p>Even though its source was very strong, it still could not withstand the erosion of the Returning Void power.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, it can be repaired."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang found that the Creator is truly miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Although the bead is pitted and corroded, as long as it absorbs enough distorted souls, it can be restored to its original perfection.</p><p></p><p>How miraculous, to repair by absorbing distorted remnant souls? </p><p></p><p>It really has a sense of "one thing counters another".</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Great Grinder again.</p><p></p><p>The Dao rhythm circulates, slowly rotating, its true will becoming more and more solidified, its essence has been elevated, with a sense of invulnerability to all laws.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual mechanism rises, a sense of roundness and completeness emerges, this time of confrontation with the gray Returning Void power, although it seems to be erosion, is actually a rare tempering.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine that with frequent such tempering, the Great Grinder will one day be unafraid of the Returning Void power, truly deserving of its name.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be impatient, you need to settle, and the bead also needs to be repaired, don't be impatient."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the instinctive intention of the Great Grinder, Xuan Huang comforted it.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder is instinctively conveying its happiness and growth to Xuan Huang, wanting more gray Returning Void power to refine itself.</p><p></p><p>But the bead is only one, although it can continue to be used, if there is no supplementation and restoration, there will eventually be a time when it is completely damaged.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Grinder also needs to settle, at least a few days to settle the true will and spiritual mechanism that has been forged.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that when Xu Ruyi arrives tomorrow, I need to discuss with him the problem of the distorted souls of Illusory Masters."</p><p></p><p>"If there are Exorcist Sect Illusory Masters, then the distorted souls can be used as a supplement for the Demon Stone, so that it can continue."</p><p></p><p>"This is a mutually beneficial situation, I don't think it will be difficult to reach an agreement."</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the distorted souls of Illusory Masters can stabilize the spiritual souls of the Illusory Masters, which is absolutely a good thing for the Illusory Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even if they are not on the verge of losing control, the distorted souls still need to be suppressed and resolved.</p><p></p><p>With the Demon Stone to absorb them, the Illusory Masters can always maintain a peak state.</p><p></p><p>"This Demon Stone is really a good thing, Qi Long is truly a person of auspicious fortune... In this light, even the Demon Stone in the Demon Lair must be very rare?"</p><p></p><p>Ordinary items, once entering the gray Returning Void mist, would have been dissolved long ago.</p><p></p><p>Even after his own refinement, Xuan Huang does not believe that he can refine something that can resist the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Demon Stone was not quickly dissolved is its powerful fourth-rank essence, which played a huge role.</p><p></p><p>Previously, his experience was limited, thinking that the Demon Stone could only absorb distorted souls, but this time there was a big discovery.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Stone also has an extremely strong essence, able to resist the power of the Returning Void.</p><p></p><p>So his previous conjecture was overturned, such precious Demon Stones must not be common.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang still wants to go to the Demon Lair to find more Demon Stones, and then let the Great Grinder solidify, but now it seems he was thinking too simply.</p><p></p><p>This is a surprising side story.</p><p></p><p>After organizing things, Xuan Huang continues with his plan.</p><p></p><p>The plan is to refine artifacts and talismans.</p><p></p><p>The artifact refinement is complete, and there is the surprise of the Demon Stone, so next Xuan Huang begins the research on talismans.</p><p></p><p>--</p><p></p><p>"First, talismans cannot be overly complex, if they are too complex they are useless and difficult to promote and use."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang set the tone.</p><p></p><p>"Secondly, there must be a continuous supply of materials for drawing talismans, if the materials are too scarce it's the same as not having any, it needs sustainability."</p><p></p><p>This is the second tone.</p><p></p><p>"Thirdly, the essence of talismans is to delineate the fluctuations of the laws of heaven and earth, using a point to represent the whole, through leveraging the existing spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, to draw upon the power of heaven and earth, that is to say the essence of talismans is to borrow the power of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So the question is, now that the heavens and earth are distorted and the regular cycle has been broken, can we still borrow the power of the heavens and earth?" </p><p></p><p>This is the main contradiction at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The essence of talismans is a medium, borrowing the power under the operation of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>If the great magnetic field of the heavens and earth is irregular, then borrowing it is out of the question.</p><p></p><p>"The essence is to borrow the spiritual mechanism."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this makes it simple.</p><p></p><p>Tong Tian Jian Mu is very suitable in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Because it can rectify the distorted spiritual mechanism of the heavens, and purify the chaotic and toxic spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy is the trigger for talismans, and the spiritual mechanism is the pattern of talismans, which are the specialties of Tong Tian Jian Mu.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tong Tian Jian Mu's coverage is ten li in radius, which means that within this ten li radius, talismans can be drawn.</p><p></p><p>Because the spiritual mechanism here is not chaotic, and the spiritual energy is very pure.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang also has plans, and is looking to Tong Tian Jian Mu for talisman-related abilities.</p><p></p><p>Gui Xu Da Mo has the ability to refine souls, refine spiritual tools, and bestow divine powers.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Furnace also has the ability to refine pure blood, forge the embryos of magical tools, and even refine elixirs in the future.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Tong Tian Jian Mu has a stable heavens and earth covering ten li in radius, as well as the means to cultivate spiritual medicines and fight enemies. Now if we add the ability to be the source of talisman techniques, it would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang doesn't want to continue refining a new source of talisman techniques. Having too many spiritual treasures and magical tools is not a good thing, it will become chaotic and cause one to lose focus.</p><p></p><p>It's better to continuously strengthen what already exists.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes that a new spiritual treasure needs to be refined, then we can refine it again.</p><p></p><p>In the initial stage, being too complicated will only lead to chaos.</p><p></p><p>"And the strange materials are too hard to find, even if we have them, they are too precious to use for refining talismans, it would be a waste."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang thought, talismans ultimately have the characteristic of being consumable items.</p><p></p><p>Even if the strange materials can be recycled, it's too troublesome. The strange materials can be used to refine talismans that can grow into one's own treasures.</p><p></p><p>Using them as one-time consumables is too much.</p><p></p><p>"So using the leaves, or even the bark of Tong Tian Jian Mu, is the most suitable material for refining talismans."</p><p></p><p>Jian Mu trembled when it heard this, what is this about? In fact, Jian Mu won't shed its leaves, every leaf is an indispensable part of it.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang naturally knows this, and won't use its precious leaves.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he'll use the leaves that it can continuously regenerate.</p><p></p><p>The ones that are piled up with energy, not the true leaves that are indispensable to it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll provide you with all kinds of beast corpses, as well as various chaotic spiritual energies and spiritual mechanisms. As long as you can absorb them, I'll give them all to you... Later you can keep half, and use the other half to regenerate leaves... You little guy, you've hit the jackpot, you're practically a capitalist now."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang comforted.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after hearing this, Jian Mu's leaves trembled, as if in joy.</p><p></p><p>Based on the principle of recycling and long-term development.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if cultivators want Jian Mu's leaves to draw talismans, they will need to provide Jian Mu with various energies that it can absorb and refine. Jian Mu will keep half, and use the other half to regenerate extraordinary leaves for talisman refinement.</p><p></p><p>A perfect cycle.</p><p></p><p>"Can I have ten leaves to try?"</p><p></p><p>After the plan was complete, Xuan Huang asked Jian Mu for ten leaves.</p><p></p><p>Jian Mu didn't move? </p><p></p><p>It seems to be waiting - where's my cut?</p><p></p><p>"This stubborn thing, I'll take some from you too."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang said in frustration, Tong Tian Jian Mu even included itself in the calculation.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>Ten leaves flew over, Jian Mu is too honest, thinking that whoever asks it for leaves must get a cut.</p><p></p><p>Turns out there are people who don't need that. </p><p></p><p>It hasn't even made any money yet, and it's already lost some.</p><p></p><p>Jian Mu always feels like it's at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Ten true leaves, not the regenerative ones.</p><p></p><p>It causes a tiny bit of loss to Tong Tian Jian Mu.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you'll have your earnings in the future, now you need to invest first before you can reap the rewards, you don't understand these things."</p><p></p><p>Its spiritual intelligence is too little, like a fool, so Xuan Huang can only explain more.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Tong Tian Jian Mu is still good, after all, it has a solid existence, and it's the same as spiritual tools and spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>Gui Xu Da Mo and the Heavenly Earth Furnace are even more pitiful, they only have simple instincts.</p><p></p><p>And the Void Knife? It's completely a fool, it eats whatever is given to it, and doesn't want anything if not given.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang always feels like he's raising a few foolish children.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>With Xuan Huang's super-me state, the engraving of talisman patterns comes easily.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the patterns of various talismans are the summaries of high-level masters' insights into the workings of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Tracing out a pattern of the heavenly and earthly laws, to harness the power of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This requires high-level masters to create, and talisman masters can just copy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are also those with unbelievable luck, who by chance copy the right heavenly and earthly pattern even at a low cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But this is very rare.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang has deduced the complete patterns of the heavenly and earthly laws, so after that, copying is easy.</p><p></p><p>It's like standing on the shoulders of giants and looking down.</p><p></p><p>So the talismans he can think of and realize, come easily.</p><p></p><p>"Pacifying Spirit Talisman, Breaking Spirit Talisman, Subduing Spirit Talisman, the three great spirit talismans; Gathering Spirit Talisman, Summoning Spirit Talisman, Igniting Spirit Talisman, the three fundamental spirit talismans; Cloud and Rain Talisman, Wind Summoning Talisman, Lightning Summoning Talisman..."</p><p></p><p>"Concealing Breath Talisman, Breaking Space Talisman, Transforming Rainbow Talisman, Sealing Talisman, Breaking Evil Talisman, Summoning Soul Talisman, Exterminating Calamity Talisman, Annihilating Soul Talisman, Annihilating Qi Talisman, Slaying God Talisman..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, following Xuan Huang's will, almost all the talismans he thought of were deduced into their original patterns.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, will is king, and techniques are just means.</p><p></p><p>After all, all talismans originate from the spiritual mechanism of the heavens, my will represents the will of the heavens, essentially they are equivalent.</p><p></p><p>When one reaches a certain level of strength, one's will can represent the will of the heavens, then for a weak person to just draw a talisman is ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The ten true leaves, Xuan Huang only used three, and found that each one matched exactly what he had deduced.</p><p></p><p>Then it's simple, since they are all correct, there's no need to waste the true leaves.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang took out the human skin left behind after the destruction of the previous puppet, as well as the blood cloth obtained from the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang plans to challenge the difficulty a bit.</p><p></p><p>Use this one and a half strange materials to refine a book, recording the 365 fundamental talismans he has deduced.</p><p></p><p>Refining a single strange material alone, Xuan Huang already has great confidence.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time experimenting with a fusion of one and a half.</p><p></p><p>But the blood cloth and human skin are quite compatible, both being blood-based.</p><p></p><p>The human skin also has the ability to be sewn, making it most suitable for refining into a book.</p><p></p><p>Don't be bothered by the 'disgusting' and even 'evil' materials.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the strange is a fragment of rules, when they take a tangible form, don't simply treat them as just blood cloth and human skin.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they can transform into any tangible existence.</p><p></p><p>Refining them into a book, then it is a book.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang put both of them into the Heavenly Earth Furnace.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Heavenly Earth Furnace is the one getting the biggest bargain.</p><p></p><p>It just keeps quiet and doesn't say anything, not even mentioning that the true meaning in the marrow bones has been absorbed by it, or that it has also absorbed a lot of the true meaning in the magic stones.</p><p></p><p>Now there's human skin and blood cloth, the Heavenly Earth Furnace feels bloated, bloated.</p><p></p><p>Jian Mu and Da Mo, the two fools, seem to have gotten the advantage, but it's the old furnace that has profited the most.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Furnace is particularly hardworking, continuously devouring true meaning, and it has advanced a lot.</p><p></p><p>Without noticing, it has already reached the middle stage of the first realm.</p><p></p><p>After eating the marrow bones, magic stones, and recently Xuan Huang's engraving of the Heavenly Gate, being baptized by the power of the heavens and earth, it has made progress silently.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Gui Xu Da Mo just had a good harvest, and it's also at the middle stage of the first realm, so it's at the middle stage too.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the furnace is working very hard, devouring the true meaning of the blood cloth and human skin, and will advance further.</p><p></p><p>This refining took a bit longer, with Xuan Huang's small world power supporting it, and also trying out the enhanced Annihilating Divine Power of Gui Xu Da Mo.</p><p></p><p>Under the multiple boosts, the blood cloth and human skin were completely stripped of their chaotic divine consciousness, and Xuan Huang bestowed them with rebirth once again.</p><p></p><p>The two, under the guidance of the will of the heavens and earth, slowly began to transform and fuse.</p><p></p><p>Until it took the form of a book.</p><p></p><p>"Draw!"</p><p></p><p>Gui Xu Da Mo imparted a true meaning, and a new Talisman Classic was born.</p><p></p><p>It perfectly met Xuan Huang's expectations.</p><p></p><p>He looks like a newbie in refining tools, and also a newbie in refining talismans, but under the control of his will, it's no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the 'Talisman Classic', simple and clear."</p><p></p><p>With his will as the brush, and his divine spirit as the ink, he wrote three characters on the blank book.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The Talisman Classic trembled, as if it had been reborn.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual mechanism flowed, the aura surging, it was clearly no ordinary object. As the second source of talisman techniques in this world, it may even become the first source in the future, it is destined to be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Then Xuan Huang continued, engraving the 365 fundamental talisman techniques he had deduced, onto it.</p><p></p><p>After the engraving was complete, Xuan Huang felt the Talisman Classic had become much heavier.</p><p></p><p>It had a sense of weight, each engraved pattern was a gathering of the spiritual mechanism in the heavens and earth, how could it not be heavy?</p><p></p><p>"With this, both tool refining and talismans are solved."</p><p></p><p>The Qing Yun Mountain or the forces he represents, need a solid foundation to become strong.</p><p></p><p>His disciples have not yet reached their explosive period, as the one who opens the way and creates the Fa, he needs to work hard.</p><p></p><p>Actually, he himself also likes this feeling very much.</p><p></p><p>Not relying on others, creating everything himself, this is not only a cultivation method, but also a way to continuously strengthen oneself.</p><p></p><p>"Tool refining also requires the Heavenly Earth Furnace, in the future the Heavenly Earth Furnace will be very busy. But it will also gain a lot, if one's not careful, it has already surpassed the first realm middle stage."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at this quietly making a fortune fellow, Xuan Huang smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Others refining tools don't need Gui Xu Da Mo to bestow true meaning, they need to slowly cultivate it themselves, nurturing the magical tools to have true meaning, which is also a process of refining and nurturing treasures."</p><p></p><p>For others refining magical tools, they don't have Gui Xu Da Mo bestowing true meaning and intelligence like he does.</p><p></p><p>They need the refiner themselves to cultivate and nurture it, which takes a bit more time, just like the Void Knife, which Xuan Huang often refines.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true meaning and intelligence bestowed by Gui Xu Da Mo is taken from it. Gui Xu Da Mo can't withstand this kind of extraction, it doesn't even have enough for itself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the magical tools bestowed with true meaning by Gui Xu Da Mo, are they the magical tools of Gui Xu Da Mo, or the cultivator's? It seems that no cultivator would want to hand over the intelligence of their own magical treasures to someone else, that would be too absurd.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, after discussing with Xu Ru Yi, I'll tell Xiao Hui and the others about the White Bone Pagoda and the Talisman Classic, this way they can be on the right track, I've already laid a good foundation for them, how they proceed is up to them."</p><p></p><p>"Also...

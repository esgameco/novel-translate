        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is an old neighborhood with a long history. The small shops along the street have a sparse flow of people, and the passersby have a slightly hurried look on their faces, their figures rushing by.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Xuan, it's getting late, finish up your meal and hurry back home," said the owner of the small eatery, a man in his fifties whom everyone calls Old Wang.</p><p></p><p>The customer is a young man with a stern brow and bright eyes, who seems out of place in the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, boss, I'll be done soon," he replied.</p><p></p><p>"It's been quite unstable in the south of the city lately. I heard there's been a problem in Fulin Residential Area, and two spirit masters were called in to deal with it, but it doesn't seem to have been resolved, otherwise they wouldn't have sealed it off."</p><p></p><p>Old Wang sighed with worry, "When will this cursed situation ever end? It's been six years already, and I've heard that many small countries have completely lost contact."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, full of helplessness, not caring whether the young man named Xiao Xuan was listening or not, as he was quite pessimistic about the future.</p><p></p><p>"It's all the same, just try to get by. When faced with such a situation, there's nothing we can do, is there?" Xiao Xuan stood up, wiped his mouth with a paper napkin, and said, "Alright, boss, I'm leaving now."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, take care."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xiao Xuan's original name was Xuan Ye, but now he goes by the name Xuan Huang. This is quite a bold name to take on. Perhaps it's because he couldn't contain this name, that Xuan Ye, who had transmigrated here, was reborn with this new identity.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in this terribly troubled world, Xuan Huang did not feel much anxiety or indecision. He quickly accepted the arrangement of his fate. His heart is indeed quite large, perhaps because he had read too many transmigration novels in his previous life, combined with his rather sloppy or chaotic past, so there was nothing he couldn't accept.</p><p></p><p>As for his previous life's experiences, they were always melodramatically similar. Perhaps the lives of unsuccessful people are all like that, with the old man of fate hastily scribbling or even photocopying their life scripts.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang doesn't have any deep grudges or grievances. He goes with the flow and has a somewhat resigned attitude.</p><p></p><p>One hazy overtime night, it was as if he had dreamed, and when he woke up, he had arrived in this world that resembles an apocalypse.</p><p></p><p>It's been three days since he transmigrated, and Xuan Huang has a general understanding of the situation this world is facing.</p><p></p><p>It's very similar to the strange novels he's read before.</p><p></p><p>Around six or seven years ago, this world encountered scientifically inexplicable paranormal problems, with all sorts of bizarre and uncanny events occurring.</p><p></p><p>Initially, people experienced panic and arduous struggles, but gradually they discovered...</p><p></p><p>There was no solution.</p><p></p><p>This became quite a predicament.</p><p></p><p>The paranormal phenomena turned out to be unkillable, only able to be sealed and contained.</p><p></p><p>Researchers speculate that this is a kind of paranormal rule, like the rules governing the world's operation - how could they possibly eliminate it?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, spatial rifts like parallel dimensions have also appeared.</p><p></p><p>They come in all shapes and sizes, uncountable, suddenly appearing at any moment. Each one is dangerous, and a small number of them contain human inhabitants, some resembling ancient times, others fantastical worlds.</p><p></p><p>The common factor is that all the discovered small worlds face the same problem as the present world - the invasion of the paranormal.</p><p></p><p>These worlds have cultivators of martial arts, immortal cultivation, magic, and psychic powers, all facing the same dire situation - the loss of control over their extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>For example, in immortal cultivation, previously one would slowly refine one's spiritual energy, but now the spiritual energy is toxic, leading to either going mad or sudden death - neither outcome is good.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the remaining martial arts cultivation that does not reach the extraordinary realm still has a chance, but once the threshold is crossed, it spirals out of control.</p><p></p><p>Then there are the spirit masters mentioned by Old Wang, a type of paranormal controller.</p><p></p><p>They wield the paranormal to combat the paranormal, but the cost is the same as in those previous novels - the constant risk of losing control and dying.</p><p></p><p>The paranormal is not simply ghosts and monsters - not only are they unkillable, but they start at the level of the extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>When mysterious techniques are no longer supported by reality, and cultivating martial arts or immortality cannot reach the extraordinary realm, the spirit masters become the most helpless solution.</p><p></p><p>The paranormal's starting point is the limit of the cultivators, an asymmetric confrontation, combined with their immortality - the situation is unsolvable.</p><p></p><p>Since the invasion of the paranormal, the present world and countless small worlds have all seen the emergence of cultivatable spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Whether you call it spiritual energy, qi, spiritual power, or dark energy, the energy required by fantasy has appeared.</p><p></p><p>It should have been the glorious era of spiritual energy revival, a turning point for the blue planet, with science and the mystical soaring in tandem, regaining mighty powers to reshape the world. Yet, it has withered due to the toxicity of the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Some have speculated that this is a paranormal contamination. However, plants and animals have evolved, and it seems the higher the intelligence, the greater the contamination.</p><p></p><p>Animal instincts outweigh intelligence, and now their already chaotic minds have become even more muddled.</p><p></p><p>Currently, animals have become another disaster, with many ferocious beasts in a state of chaos - three-headed dogs, nine-headed snakes, even defying common sense.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The multi-eyed, multi-limbed monster.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, such cases are not too common, as they have only appeared in the past two years due to the short time period.</p><p></p><p>And these ferocious beasts can be killed, as they are no match for human firearms.</p><p></p><p>As long as you are still a flesh and blood being, and have not completely transcended this realm, it is just a matter of the caliber of the weapon.</p><p></p><p>However, the situation is not optimistic, and one can't help but wonder what it will be like in ten years? Will they evolve unimaginable abilities?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, animals are not as intelligent as imagined the more they evolve. They are driven more by their savage instincts.</p><p></p><p>In addition...</p><p></p><p>After traversing the three days of the Xuanhuang, due to special reasons, he made an even more astonishing discovery.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the upper echelons of this world have also discovered it, but have not spoken of it due to great fear.</p><p></p><p>That is...</p><p></p><p>Humans, who outclass all animals and plants in terms of evolution, are also evolving.</p><p></p><p>Although it has been only three days, Xuanhuang clearly noticed that his body is becoming subtly stronger, and his mental faculties are improving even more so.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation of this world, where the strange invasion has persisted for six years, it is not that the survivors have gotten used to it without a major collapse, but rather their mental and spiritual aspects are strengthening.</p><p></p><p>This may seem like a good situation, but it hides a huge crisis.</p><p></p><p>If...</p><p></p><p>Humans do not perish for decades or even centuries, and continue to exist resiliently, then after evolving to a certain degree, will they lose control? Will they all turn into irrational monsters?</p><p></p><p>Although this is just Xuanhuang's speculation, it cannot be guaranteed that it will not develop in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Unless a way to control it is found, and rationality still exists, while humans evolve into the extraordinary, this would not be an unrealistic fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"The population has decreased by nearly 20% in six years, and this is in the environment of the Summer Country. I've heard that the most severe regions have lost nearly half their population, the situation is dire."</p><p></p><p>"We need to think of a solution. Tomorrow I'll go to the martial arts hall to see the state of the martial artists, so I can compare it to my conjecture."</p><p></p><p>"If it's similar to what I've deduced, then there will be a solution."</p><p></p><p>Walking back home, the sunset was setting and it would soon be dark. There were almost no pedestrians on the streets now.</p><p></p><p>Some soldiers were patrolling the streets, urging everyone to quickly return home.</p><p></p><p>Since the strange revival, the nights have been much more dangerous than the days. Although it's not entirely safe even at home, at least there is some guarantee.</p><p></p><p>As long as you don't enter the murderous patterns of the strange beings, you can basically ensure your safety.</p><p></p><p>So by dusk, there was almost no one outside.</p><p></p><p>After six years, those who didn't obey have been thoroughly educated to be obedient.</p><p></p><p>As for the martial arts halls that Xuanhuang mentioned, they are quite widespread.</p><p></p><p>It is the result of the government's vigorous promotion in the past five years, even before the severing of connections between cities.</p><p></p><p>In addition to martial arts halls, there are also Dao halls (including spiritual and mental cultivation), which are learned from exploring the small world.</p><p></p><p>After all, there is spiritual energy, it's just that one can only cultivate up to the extraordinary realm.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts have three levels: martial disciple, martial practitioner, and martial master.</p><p></p><p>The names are quite arbitrary.</p><p></p><p>A martial disciple can fight about ten people, a martial practitioner about a hundred, and a martial master over four hundred, with the extraordinary said to be able to fight a thousand.</p><p></p><p>The divisions are quite rough, as the time has been too short, and a strict system has not yet formed.</p><p></p><p>From this, we can see that the extraordinary realm starts at a thousand opponents.</p><p></p><p>Yet the lowest extraordinary realm strange beings cannot be killed, showing how formidable they are.</p><p></p><p>The Dao halls are similar, also roughly divided into three levels.</p><p></p><p>Although it has only been five years of promotion, there are still geniuses who have reached the martial master and Dao master levels.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their path is blocked! Not that they cannot cultivate and break through, but they dare not, for breaking through would cause them to lose their sanity and become corrupted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Walking along, Xuanhuang arrived at a small courtyard, which was his home.</p><p></p><p>A standard 'pig's foot' treatment, his parents unfortunately disappeared, and the reason is still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xuanhuang has already found the reason.</p><p></p><p>His previous self was lost because of this, and if Xuanhuang had not transmigrated, he might not have discovered the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Creak~"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang pushed open the small courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>A standard northern quadrangle courtyard, not the old central courtyard, but a valuable house before the change.</p><p></p><p>Now, it can't be said to be the same.</p><p></p><p>Entering the courtyard, a cold, gloomy aura swept over him.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's perception, in the middle of the courtyard towards the west, there was an ancient-looking millstone.</p><p></p><p>It was an old item, later used for decoration and never removed.</p><p></p><p>This is the root cause of Xuanhuang's family's misfortune.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's perception, the millstone was like a black hole, emanating a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>As if it wanted to devour everything.</p><p></p><p>The permeating black mist seemed to have countless tentacles, sweeping towards Xuanhuang as if the mirror had suddenly shattered...</p><p></p><p>Just as the tentacles of the black mist were about to envelop him, Xuanhuang disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

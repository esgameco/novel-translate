        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" </p><p></p><p>Entering through the door, Sun Tong said, "Master Xuan, just now the director of the Exorcism Department, Gao Xiaolan, called to say that the Mysterious Alley has appeared again, and it has already swallowed up an entire pedestrian street. The situation is extremely critical, and Director Xu Ruyi is requesting your assistance."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Alley?" </p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang was taken aback. It's been a while since this thing has shown up. </p><p></p><p>When he first went up the mountain, this thing was causing quite a ruckus, making him feel like his cultivation was progressing very slowly.</p><p></p><p>But later, especially after he came down the mountain, the Mysterious Alley disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it has reappeared after a month.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Alley has been confirmed to be at the Second Realm, and it is very troublesome without a fixed main body.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when it was causing chaos, the walls had been attacked many times, and even broken by spirit cultivators, but unfortunately to no avail. </p><p></p><p>It would just reappear soon after, even if weakened, without its destructive power being affected.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll head there immediately."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang didn't hesitate, quickly transforming into a rainbow light and rushing towards the troubled pedestrian street.</p><p></p><p>"Look, there he goes!"</p><p></p><p>In the lively Qingyun Mountain plaza, the gathered crowd noticed the figure flying out from Xuan Huang's residence.</p><p></p><p>"It's Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>"As expected, he can soar through the void, his will transcending the mortal realm to take flight. It's truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"So this is Master Xuan? He's so handsome!"</p><p></p><p>Some of the female cultivators and warriors couldn't help but exclaim, feeling that such a man was worth possessing.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he's handsome or not is beside the point. The question is, what is Master Xuan rushing off for in such a hurry?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard the news, the Mysterious Alley has appeared, and the Exorcism Department has come to request Master Xuan's support," a well-informed cultivator replied.</p><p></p><p>"The one that was just recently marked as a Second Realm threat?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the one. It had previously appeared in the South City, causing massive destruction. But for the past month, it's been silent. Now it's shown up again."</p><p></p><p>"Second Realm, that's a major calamity. I hope Master Xuan can handle it."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell into a somber mood. </p><p></p><p>These past few days, it felt as if they had entered a new world on Qingyun Mountain, as if the strange disasters were far away.</p><p></p><p>Now, they suddenly realized that the crisis was still there, and it was someone who was guarding and persevering.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's our martial path or the immortal path, it's all being upheld by Master Xuan alone. Fellow Daoists, the road ahead is both bright and perilous. We need to diligently cultivate, to support our own skies, and not let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, but there was a noticeable shift in their mentality.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>The spirit cultivators of the Exorcism Department, who were evacuating the crowd, felt a powerful aura approaching from the sky.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a rainbow light appeared before Xu Ruyi.</p><p></p><p>He had already known that the transcendent-willed Xuan Huang could fly, but Xu Ruyi was still shocked by the speed.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"How's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi replied, "The situation is very bad. There are nearly 300 people trapped inside. You've arrived just in time. I was planning to enter myself. When I go in, you and Director Gao can stand guard. If I don't come out in a short time, you'll have to decide based on the circumstances."</p><p></p><p>"Director Gao..." Xu Ruyi was about to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Director Xu, I'm not familiar with the Exorcism Department's people, and there may be gaps in our coordination. How about this, you stay outside, and I'll go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Xu Ruyi paused.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a Second Realm Anomaly?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi looked at Xuan Huang gravely.</p><p></p><p>"I know it's a Second Realm one. My cultivation has improved a bit recently, and I've gained some insights. As a Second Realm Anomaly, I may not be able to suppress it, but it won't pose a danger to me either. Even if I want to escape, I don't think anyone could stop me."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang spoke directly, without joking.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm very sure. I won't joke around with my own life, nor with the lives of the 300 trapped people."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan, who had already heard their conversation, remained silent, only looking at the two men repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Saving people is like putting out a fire. Xu Ruyi didn't think too long, hesitating for a moment before agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't interacted with Xuan Huang for long, Xuan Huang's steadfast demeanor had deeply impressed him.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi said to Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang smiled at him, indicating that he would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he flickered and disappeared into the misty world.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, just his lightning-fast speed alone, I believe he wasn't exaggerating. Ordinary Anomalies won't be able to hold him back." Seeing Xuan Huang vanish in a flash, Gao Xiaolan suddenly felt very confident.</p><p></p><p>"That's true." Xu Ruyi agreed. That speed, he didn't even notice when Xuan Huang entered the misty realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Entering the pedestrian street engulfed by the Mysterious Alley's rules.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, cries for help, anguished screams, and the sound of frantic breathing and shattering reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>The pitch-black ground was stained crimson with blood, and he could even see severed limbs and body parts.</p><p></p><p>Probing with his will, Xuan Huang could see wisps of energy formed from fear, drifting towards the impenetrable darkness.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang immediately summoned the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the Void Saber appeared, it trembled, indicating that its master was about to fight alongside it again. As a weapon of slaughter, it greatly yearned for such a scene.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb the energy of fear."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang commanded the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>The Void Saber also had the ability to absorb and strengthen itself with fear. And after being empowered by abilities like Dread, Devour, and Soul Annihilation, it had become exceptionally adept at this.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, streams of fear-formed threads, like flowing rivers, came tracing the Void Saber's trail.</p><p></p><p>"Crackle, crackle!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>A rolling sound stood out particularly clearly, even drowning out the surrounding cries and screams from the mist.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang looked up, only to see a severed head rolling towards him.</p><p></p><p>The face was bleeding from all seven orifices, looking like a red ball at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Can you see my body? It hurts so much, where did my body go, can you see it?"</p><p></p><p>The words, imbued with spiritual impact and hallucinations, came from the severed head's mouth.</p><p></p><p>If this were an ordinary person, their spirit would have already been shattered.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang replied simply.</p><p></p><p>"Can you see my body? It hurts so much, where did my body go, can you see it?"</p><p></p><p>The same words, the same spiritual impact.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a mechanical repetition of the same phrase. Xuan Huang had thought he could have a conversation.</p><p></p><p>This kind of tactic might work on ordinary people, but it was useless against him.</p><p></p><p>"I see, you took my body, give it back, give it back..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the seven bleeding orifices on the head began spewing black smoke, which howled and charged towards Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Just as it reached the Void Saber Xuan Huang had manifested, it was blasted apart.</p><p></p><p>"So it's just about absorbing some fear energy, and this lackey shows up to deal with me? Well, that's easy, keep absorbing."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang knew the appearance of the severed head was due to the Void Saber absorbing the fear energy.</p><p></p><p>It was like fighting the Mysterious Alley for its food, so the head showed up.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xuan Huang enveloped the Void Saber with his will, letting it continue absorbing.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered, with it being a Second Realm Anomaly, he couldn't immediately locate the main body of the Mysterious Alley.</p><p></p><p>The mist was like a maze, and he could hear many agonized cries and pleas for help, but going towards them didn't necessarily lead to real people.</p><p></p><p>Without a clear target, Xuan Huang was considering using his domain.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Void Saber's absorption of fear energy had provoked this thing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the Void Knife absorbed more and more fear energy,</p><p></p><p>"Rumbling, splashing—"</p><p></p><p>A dense, drum-like sound came.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, wow.</p><p></p><p>Heads, hands, legs, buttocks, all kinds of human body parts were crawling and rushing towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I'm not afraid of group attacks at all."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled slightly. It's not the main body of the Maze that is surrounding and attacking him, this method is useless against him.</p><p></p><p>Big Grinder, Furnace, Jianmu, aren't they good at dealing with group attacks? "Furnace, come out."</p><p></p><p>Although Furnace has been growing stealthily, with Big Grinder's Magical Stone refining the power of the Abyss, and Jianmu being unrivaled at the first stage, they haven't undergone qualitative changes to enter the second stage.</p><p></p><p>The stealthy Furnace, just by secretly eating and stealthy growth, can't keep up.</p><p></p><p>With so many flesh and blood bodies, even if they are broken, it's enough for Furnace to have a big feast.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The increasingly solidified bronze furnace appeared, with three feet and two ears, shimmering with light, an extraordinary appearance.</p><p></p><p>It had just become familiar with the Ancestral Stele, and was summoned out.</p><p></p><p>Damn the Maze, Furnace and you are sworn enemies, I'll swallow, I'll swallow.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh" like a tornado was stirred up.</p><p></p><p>The dense, broken body parts were being greedily devoured by the furnace.</p><p></p><p>The furnace seemed to be a bottomless pit, no matter how many came, they were quickly swallowed.</p><p></p><p>And inside the furnace, golden flames permeated, the distorted will of heaven stored within, turned into a hammer, pounding with a loud noise.</p><p></p><p>The broken limbs that entered were hammered into powder by the huge Heavenly Will Hammer, this is the Heavenly Will Hammer that Xuanhuang used to hammer himself.</p><p></p><p>The opened furnace was used to hammer the broken limbs, so there was no return, no matter how many entered, it was just a matter of one hammer.</p><p></p><p>But the scattered true essences were quickly absorbed by the furnace, constantly condensing its own true essence.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem to be a loss, so many true essences were gained.</p><p></p><p>The furnace rumbled, the true essence quickly condensed, the entire bronze furnace visibly solidified.</p><p></p><p>It has successfully stolen another meal, its aura advancing towards the late first stage.</p><p></p><p>No matter how it is defined, its three treasures represent Jing, Qi, and Shen (Essence, Qi, and Spirit), Jing corresponds to the Heavenly-Earth Furnace, Qi corresponds to the Tong Tian Jianmu, and Shen corresponds to the Guihu Big Grinder.</p><p></p><p>These three treasures have now shown obvious differences, different fates.</p><p></p><p>Shen, the Guihu Big Grinder, is truly the representative of vast divine abilities, with the most methods, refining the power of the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qi, the Tong Tian Jianmu, is truly the representative favored by the Qi Fate, with all kinds of heavenly Qi, the Corpse-Devouring Tree, connecting to the Underworld, suppressing the Heavenly Spiritual Qi of the Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Jing, the Heavenly-Earth Furnace, seems to be able to only silently devour all kinds of essence and blood, having some Qi Fate but not much, having vast divine abilities but not much either... It can only obediently be engraved by Xuanhuang on the Heavenly Gate, following Xuanhuang's various temperings, and secretly stealing and stealthy growth.</p><p></p><p>Its two companions are constantly flying and progressing, only it is steadily advancing step by step, never rapidly strengthening.</p><p></p><p>Just like now, it has progressed again.</p><p></p><p>But the effort was too great, and after the dense body parts were swept away,</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Maze was enraged.</p><p></p><p>This was the energy belonging to it.</p><p></p><p>Every broken body was a brick that composed it.</p><p></p><p>The mist grew thicker, dense and opaque, with the tearing of the spiritual sense and the impact of the will.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was not mist, but countless resentful souls condensed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang put away the furnace, gripping the Void Knife, his will opened to the maximum, searching for the hidden within.</p><p></p><p>The second stage of the Maze is very troublesome, not like the innate deficiency of a spirit cultivator, the second stage of the Maze can exert its maximum power.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's current ability is not enough to subdue it.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>A towering white bone giant hand emerged from the mist, pressing towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not dodge, raising his knife to meet it.</p><p></p><p>"Clang, crack—"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The huge force, Xuanhuang resisted with all his might, but was still pressed into the mud, fortunately his body and will were covered, his Qi and blood condensed, so there was no injury.</p><p></p><p>He was just pressed into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang forcefully stepped with his legs, instantly jumping out of the pit.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was very puzzled? What other abilities does this Maze have? He had just heard that entering would cause one to lose their way, living beings would crash into the walls and become bricks.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he also discovered that the Maze could absorb fear and grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>It could even self-disassemble, the bricks turning into broken bodies to surround and attack, and the mist also had spiritual and will impacts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the physical manifestation of the towering white bone giant hand had appeared.</p><p></p><p>What other abilities does it have, how can it have so many abilities?</p><p></p><p>This is not the kind of abilities a single Maze should possess.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this is a composite Maze, not just a single Maze, but others as well?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang couldn't help but suspect.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The towering white bone giant hand, with the spiritual impact and powerful attack, came towards Xuanhuang again.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang met it head-on without dodging, wanting to test the limits of his own body.</p><p></p><p>Although he seems to have never paid attention to his body, his body is actually very strong, it's just that he has lacked worthy opponents.</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of his will and the coverage of his Qi and blood, even the white bone giant hand cannot inflict serious injury on him. Xuanhuang plans to experiment to the limit, to see what other methods the Maze has.</p><p></p><p>This time, he must uncover its secrets.</p><p></p><p>On the other side! "Director, you see, the mist has shrunk."</p><p></p><p>The mist covering the entire street was shrinking, revealing the bewildered and frightened people.</p><p></p><p>They were being chased by various broken bodies, some were driven by the spiritual impact of the mist to crash into the walls, but suddenly, these Mazes disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Although this place is still cold and piercing, the minds are gradually returning to normal, and the chasing monster bodies are gone.</p><p></p><p>"Help, help!"</p><p></p><p>A chain reaction started, one call for help, the surviving frightened people all began to shout for help.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, quick, quick save the people, quickly evacuate them."</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Ruyi didn't know what Xuanhuang had done, the mist had shrunk but become denser.</p><p></p><p>And the people who were devoured, except for those who had already met their demise, the remaining ones seemed to have been abandoned, as if the Maze was concentrating its power to deal with other things, and these people were abandoned.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Ruyi's call, the surrounding spirit cultivators and assistants quickly moved forward, carefully lifting or supporting the surviving humans, and quickly transferring them outside the pedestrian street.</p><p></p><p>A rough count showed there were nearly two hundred people.</p><p></p><p>This means that at least a hundred people did not make it out, or had already become a brick of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Master Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>After the evacuation was completed, Xu Ruyi stared at the dense black mist.</p><p></p><p>He only felt the black mist rising, like a black, oppressive cloud, the black cloud was violently trembling, with thunderous rumbles coming from within.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan hasn't come out yet, what should we do, Director?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi looked at the dense mist for a while and said, "Wait."</p><p></p><p>"Wait?"</p><p></p><p>The spirit cultivators questioned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, wait. Master Xuan said that no Maze can keep him from leaving, now that the people have been rescued, but Master Xuan hasn't come out yet, and the Maze has compressed the range of the Mazes, it should be Master Xuan's doing."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "So we can only wait, trust in Master Xuan. If we enter the danger, it may disrupt Master Xuan's plan."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoists and seniors, please subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you Yan Wenming for the reward, it was unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for your votes and subscriptions.

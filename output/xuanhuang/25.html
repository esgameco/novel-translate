        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui immediately stood up and said, "There's no problem at all. The scenic area previously belonged to the government's construction, and the homestays and buildings were all government property."</p><p></p><p>The deputy director Songalso said, "That area was a wasteland, and our martial arts hall can directly take over. Previously, the roads were well-repaired for tourism convenience, and although it has been abandoned for a few years, it is generally unaffected. We will immediately go and tidy it up, striving to renovate it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>For the past six years, the government has been absent.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, every city has a "Demon-Subduing Department" that controls the martial arts halls and Taoist temples.</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Subduing Department occupies the dominant position, with the martial arts halls and Taoist temples as assistants, wielding great power.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's arrange it that way," Xuanhuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need to personally take care of things when others can handle it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a scroll with flickering spiritual rhythms and a book titled "Nine Refinements of the Crucible" appeared in his hands.</p><p></p><p>"This is a visualization diagram that I personally copied, and this book contains refining and fusion techniques. You should make copies of the book and carefully protect the visualization diagram."</p><p></p><p>The people present found the sudden appearance of the book and visualization diagram to be absurd. But considering it was from Master Xuanhuang, they could accept it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuanhuang. We will do our best, for the sake of the martial arts, for the sake of humanity."</p><p></p><p>As a representative, Sun Hui solemnly accepted the book and visualization diagram, as if he was taking on a heavy burden.</p><p></p><p>"You discuss it among yourselves. I'll go back home. Contact me if there's anything."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xuanhuang left, and the group saw him off outside the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Back in the meeting room, the people excitedly and enthusiastically discussed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, humanity finally has the hope of a fresh start. Our martial arts will surely endure forever."</p><p></p><p>The excited Wu Gang, as a martial arts enthusiast, took the "Nine Refinements of the Crucible" from Sun Hui's hands and started reading it.</p><p></p><p>The others didn't pay attention to him, but carefully examined the more important "Visualization Diagram of the Crucible of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>The spiritual rhythms on it were flowing, and after Xuanhuang's extraordinary will was added, along with the support of the small world, the spiritual rhythms could now last for a year. This was a huge change, as previously they could only last for a day, and now it was hundreds of times longer.</p><p></p><p>They were just simply observing and did not immediately start cultivating, as this was not the time for cultivation. They had to restrain themselves from doing so.</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>The people intently focused on the visualization diagram were startled by Wu Gang's loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, impressive, impressive, look at this..."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuanhuang's 'Nine Refinements of the Crucible' not only has fusion and refining techniques, but also a physical body tempering cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the ordinary limit is actually 12,000 kilograms of immense strength. However, this is very difficult. It says that as long as you reach 7,000 kilograms of immense strength, you can attempt to break through to the extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"But to have a higher success rate, you need 8,000 or even 9,000. Anything over 10,000 is considered a breakthrough, and the extraordinary will be easily attainable."</p><p></p><p>"I feel like the cultivation methods we practiced before were all trash. This is the perfect body tempering cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>The excited Wu Gang described to the others.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others were also delighted.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't understand, they knew that high-level cultivation methods and low-level ones were completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>"The body tempering cultivation method we obtained from the small world seems to have a limit of 7,000 kilograms of immense strength," the deputy director High said.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui heard this and said, "Our cultivation limit is 7,000, but the people in the small world also mentioned that there was once a body tempering cultivation method with a limit of 9,000 kilograms of immense strength, but it was lost."</p><p></p><p>"Apparently, the 9,000 kilogram limit cultivation method was lost because it was too difficult to achieve."</p><p></p><p>Comparing the two, the group placed even more importance on Xuanhuang's "Nine Refinements of the Crucible."</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't achieve it, they could still be proud of cultivating such an extraordinary method that breaks the limit of 12,000.</p><p></p><p>"Since Master Xuanhuang wrote this, it means he has accomplished it. He has achieved the 12,000 that was not recorded in the martial arts of the small world. This method can be the fundamental one," Wu Gang said.</p><p></p><p>"The deputy director Wu is right, this method can be the fundamental one," the deputy director Song also said. "But the most important thing is the visualization diagram. Without the visualization diagram to refine the will, even if you reach 7,000 kilograms of immense strength, it will be out of control."</p><p></p><p>"That's correct."</p><p></p><p>The group of senior members</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Nodding in agreement. "Ding ding ding!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui knocked on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow colleagues, the Mysterious Master has done all he can, and now it's time for us to demonstrate our own abilities. We must properly arrange the Mysterious Master's instructions."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Master is right, we warriors should go outside the city, for that is our future." He then said, "Do you all remember the Mysterious Master's words, 'One who is at the same level is undefeatable'?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow colleagues, you all know what this represents, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It means that the Mysterious Master, whose physical and spiritual will have transcended the ordinary, is undefeatable at this level."</p><p></p><p>"Unlike the Spiritual Masters' methods of controlling the supernatural, the martial path does not fear losing control, we can go all out, and even grow stronger the more we fight."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fully understood the meaning of these words.</p><p></p><p>Being undefeatable at the same level means there are no Class C supernatural threats that can defeat them.</p><p></p><p>How could this not excite them? Class C supernatural threats are not common, and each one is the focus of global attention.</p><p></p><p>For example, some people think the Mysterious Alley should be Class C, but it hasn't been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>And the Ravaging Tree in the Fulin Residential Area is said to only be at the peak of Class D, not reaching Class C.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I have something I'd like to say..."</p><p></p><p>The excited crowd was interrupted by the Vice Manager High.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead, Old High."</p><p></p><p>Vice Manager High said, "Regarding the Mysterious Master's matters, let's keep a low profile for now. What about the Spiritual Masters' side?"</p><p></p><p>After he said this, the crowd frowned.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial path has a bright future, currently the Spiritual Masters dominate the world.</p><p></p><p>If the Martial Arts Hall and the Immortal Dao Hall represent unity among everyone.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spiritual Masters, it's not so easy to say. Nowadays it's almost an anarchic state, and the Spiritual Masters have contributed the most to this.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are bad.</p><p></p><p>But they are capricious, and even the relatively normal ones are just lucky.</p><p></p><p>Fused with the supernatural, the supernatural is constantly changing them, causing their emotions, mentality, and thoughts to become very unique.</p><p></p><p>Some are sensitive, some are brutal, some are fragile, and some are even on the verge of losing control, becoming time bombs at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Most of them can still fight for humanity, and that is the greatest fortune.</p><p></p><p>Organizations like the "Salvation Society", the "Divine Alliance", the "Demon Worshippers", and others with notorious reputations for controlling the supernatural, are more evil than the supernatural itself.</p><p></p><p>"Our future is bright, but as Vice Manager High said, there is still darkness before the dawn. We need to be cautious, notify the people of the Martial Arts Hall, keep our mouths shut, and expose ourselves as late as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Mysterious Master doesn't mind, we can't be careless."</p><p></p><p>"Manager, don't worry, I think everyone here is intelligent, we won't expose ourselves in the short term. Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang said, "The Mysterious Master's open attitude shows his strong confidence. Some evil supernatural controllers are inhumane beasts. They shouldn't dare to confront the Mysterious Master, the more they use supernatural powers, the easier they will lose control, but the Mysterious Master won't."</p><p></p><p>"Still, it's better to be cautious."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Old High, you take charge of the renovation and transformation of the Qingyun Mountain Resort. Old Wu, personally instruct the people in the Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Old Song, bring all three sealed supernatural entities that our Hall has to the Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>"The rest of you, especially those at the Martial Arts Master level, temporarily guard and observe the Hall's visualization diagrams. During this time, you can cultivate, and try to summarize your experiences as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, everyone who comprehends the visualization diagrams must write down their own experiences and precautions."</p><p></p><p>"This is a formal order."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Manager!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone has their own tasks, and they nod in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui's strong personal charm and martial cultivation still commands respect from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thank you, fellow Demon King readers, I didn't expect there to be readers who still remembered this after four or five years. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>For this book, I will depict the main character and supporting characters well, regardless of their roles.</p><p></p><p>Please help me collect this, and give Drunken Moon time to slowly write it out.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

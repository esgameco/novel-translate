        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>According to what Uncle Li Bokang said, their Li family village's ancestors came and settled here in the ninth month, so this lake is called the "September Lake".</p><p></p><p>The millstone space in this realm can be freely entered, but one cannot break through the boundary to return to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it will be possible in the future, but the current spiritual energy is not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"Splash--"</p><p></p><p>A surface of clear water emerged from the Blue Star side.</p><p></p><p>The clothes had dried up, and it was already past 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>"Went out hunting, ended up getting soaked, but luckily the harvest was still good, a big black fish and a picked-up centipede."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his harvest, Xuanhuang was quite satisfied with the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The story is twisting and turning, but the harvest is good.</p><p></p><p>Striding with big steps, he headed towards the mountain cave. Due to the mortal limits of his physical body, Xuanhuang could not take to the air and fly.</p><p></p><p>But he could easily take ten-meter steps, and soon returned to the mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>After inspecting the area, he found that no wild beasts had intruded during the time he was away, so Xuanhuang entered the safe house.</p><p></p><p>"Spent over ten days on the mountain, and my will is now complete today."</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the extraordinary has always been his goal.</p><p></p><p>Now the firewood is prepared, and his nine-layered will has also stabilized.</p><p></p><p>So he will go all out in his assault.</p><p></p><p>Although he has been continuously confronting strange supernatural phenomena these past few days, the results have not been bad - he has sealed the Ominous Dream Brush and fought against the Centipede Demon.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, he has not been able to handle them with ease, and even the Centipede Demon was a lucky find.</p><p></p><p>There are still the Blood Pool Anomaly, the Ominous Alley, the Corpse Tree in the Fulin Residential Area waiting for him, he cannot linger.</p><p></p><p>Even the millstone at home has not been resolved, and he has also discovered the Blood Moon World.</p><p></p><p>It's not just a single busy task! First, Xuanhuang refined the big black fish.</p><p></p><p>After the gifts from the Ominous Dream Brush and the Centipede Demon, his refining abilities have become increasingly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Grinding and crunching, he diligently crushed the remnant soul of the big black fish.</p><p></p><p>Then the Heavenly Pillar Tree condensed and wrapped the big black fish with its roots, transforming its skin, fur, and bones.</p><p></p><p>The powerful big black fish, although the Heavenly Pillar Tree had only consumed a third of it, was of very good quality.</p><p></p><p>The reason this big black fish was so fierce was likely due to it being catalyzed by the Blood Moon through the cracks between the two realms.</p><p></p><p>It just had not yet reached the level of the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom--"</p><p></p><p>The pure vital energy began to burn, transforming into top-quality firewood, forging Xuanhuang's will.</p><p></p><p>However, for the nine-layered will, this was still just a drop in the bucket, as reaching the nine-layer perfection was difficult.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang didn't mind, he just consumed two more pills of the Great Elixir, and two bottles of twenty pills each, continuing to turn them into firewood.</p><p></p><p>Until a layer of barrier appeared, Xuanhuang then stopped the forging of his will.</p><p></p><p>"Phew, the nine-layered will is perfected!"</p><p></p><p>In the sunset, Xuanhuang looked at his hands, as if an invisible wave was rippling.</p><p></p><p>This was the manifestation of the will not yet having left the body.</p><p></p><p>The stirring sensation became clearer, waiting to break out of the cocoon.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the remaining three bottles of the Great Elixir, Xuanhuang entered meditation again, this time aiming to achieve the perfection of body refinement, which is a hundred thousand kilograms of immense strength.</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon hung on the branches, and the cold wind howled on the autumn mountain.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the moonlight, Xuanhuang's mind was as calm as still water.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the nine-layer perfection of both will and body refinement.</p><p></p><p>He only awaited the repeated breakthroughs of the barriers to the extraordinary realm, to formally cross over into the extraordinary level.</p><p></p><p>For this, Xuanhuang did not move the Centipede Demon.</p><p></p><p>This was the firewood for his assault on the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Just an hour ago, he had also reached the perfection of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he conducted another self-transcendence simulation.</p><p></p><p>"The will takes form, transforms into mist, and opens up the sea of qi in the lower dantian."</p><p></p><p>"Then the physical body becomes extraordinary, opening up the surging sea of qi, allowing the vital energy to have the possibility of bearing and continuing to progress."</p><p></p><p>This was the method Xuanhuang had simulated through self-transcendence.</p><p></p><p>In this realm's martial dao, when a martial artist reaches the level of being a hundred-person enemy, they can sink their qi into the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Martial dao is the sea of qi in the lower dantian, while cultivating immortality is the yellow court in the middle dantian.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuanhuang's vital energy has not entered the sea of qi, but is accumulated in the flesh and blood throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference between Xuanhuang and this realm's martial dao.</p><p></p><p>A powerful physical body is the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Opening the dantian too early has both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dantian is the carrier that holds the power of qi and blood. In this world, as cultivators become stronger, they accumulate the power of qi and blood in the bitter sea of dryness, becoming more and more powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, they have not opened up a wellspring belonging to the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>This way of entering is simple, but without a wellspring, it is like a tree without roots - it will be consumed quickly, and the recovery relies entirely on self-replenishment.</p><p></p><p>But after the Xuanhuang Qi Sea opens a wellspring, the powerful physical body becomes the greatest supply source of the wellspring.</p><p></p><p>And after the connection of the Four Extremes and Twelve Celestial Pillars, Heaven and Earth will be the greatest source of power.</p><p></p><p>Of course...</p><p></p><p>If the wellspring in this world is opened without the will to suppress it, it may not be a good thing, as it might spiral out of control and drain the cultivators' qi and blood, causing them to exhaust themselves.</p><p></p><p>Under the twisted Heavenly Will, not opening the wellspring is the 'lucky' choice for the cultivators in this world.</p><p></p><p>Unless, like Xuanhuang, one's will can control the wellspring and make it a source of power, rather than a source of turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Having clarified the path ahead, the next step is to solidify the will.</p><p></p><p>The process of will transforming from intangible to tangible is actually simpler.</p><p></p><p>As long as one persists in tempering it.</p><p></p><p>The will may seem mysterious, but it does not exist independently; it must be supported by the essence, qi, and spirit of a carrier.</p><p></p><p>Even with a powerful will, without a carrier, it can only dissipate like smoke and clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Will is strong because its carrier is the entire Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>By extension, for the will to be strong, the essence, qi, and spirit of the carrier must be strong.</p><p></p><p>The path of the will is a path of cultivating the essence, qi, and spirit in harmony.</p><p></p><p>Refining the body, refining the qi, and refining the spirit are all indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the path of refining the will must belong to the realm of the strong.</p><p></p><p>If the essence, qi, and spirit do not reach a certain level, one cannot condense the will.</p><p></p><p>Only Xuanhuang is special, with a high-quality spiritual soul and a small world to compensate.</p><p></p><p>This is the only path under the twisted Heavenly Will of this world.</p><p></p><p>Fate has its own arrangement; the Great Dao of fifty-one has left one, a thread of life.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the already hundred-meter space, it is the largest area Xuanhuang currently controls.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there is no need to shrink the area for the sake of stability.</p><p></p><p>The will that has entered the extraordinary realm is at least ten times the current one.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the area that can be controlled will be a radius of one kilometer.</p><p></p><p>A will of one kilometer in radius is my Heavenly Will; just this vast Heavenly Will alone can withstand the bizarre of the Extraordinary Realm.</p><p></p><p>If combined with extraordinary methods and physique, Xuanhuang's entry into the Extraordinary Realm will make him a top-tier existence in that realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he uses only one percent of his projection in the real world, Xuanhuang can still establish a domain.</p><p></p><p>Within the domain, he can block the killing rules and triggering media of the Extraordinary Realm.</p><p></p><p>The safety will be greatly improved, no longer needing to run away when outmatched.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A night has passed.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning arrived as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>This time, when he saw Xuanhuang, even though Xuanhuang changed every day, the change today was greater.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning couldn't help but ask, "Why do I feel a sense of transcendence when I see you, and I can't help but want to worship you? And there's a strong sense of crisis that makes me want to stay away from you involuntarily?"</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation has made some progress," Xuanhuang replied.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning bitterly smiled and asked, "Is it just 'some' progress? Aren't you progressing every day?"</p><p></p><p>"Just a little bit!" Xuanhuang gestured.</p><p></p><p>Then he said, "Never mind me, how is your visualization of the Heavenly Earth Furnace Visualization Chart going?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning felt a bit gloomy, like a student having his homework checked by a teacher.</p><p></p><p>"The progress is great. I can condense a copper furnace foot within one or two days."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, keep up the good work," Xuanhuang nodded approvingly, as Jin Ning's talent was indeed not bad.</p><p></p><p>Being able to condense a copper furnace foot in just a few days, the initial difficulty of the Heavenly Earth Furnace Visualization Chart has been overcome, and the rest will be faster.</p><p></p><p>Until the next hurdle, the complete condensation.</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion Master said he has found a replacement for you."</p><p></p><p>"No need, not for now. Let him focus on his own matters first."</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion Master said your strength is being wasted here on the mountain."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a complete waste. There are many dangers on this mountain." Seeing Jin Ning about to speak further, Xuanhuang said, "Alright, I'll report the situation to the Pavilion Master within a week at the latest. Just tell him that."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Jin Ning to respond, Xuanhuang exchanged the Heavenly Earth Furnace Visualization Chart with him and bid him farewell.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This kind of space-carrying strangeness, Xuanhuang encountered for the second time, the first one was the space of the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Grinder is more like an extension of the Desolate Ruins, it seems that there are many such extensions, and the Great Grinder in his own home can only be considered as one.</p><p></p><p>The inner world of the Mysterious Clock, or the lost time crevice, is the first time he has encountered.</p><p></p><p>Here, it is like a space out of balance, without up, down, left or right. Time does not flow in this place, only when a person enters, the person's thoughts flow, and then the time in this place will flow.</p><p></p><p>If there is nothing inside, then time will stop.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the place where he had fought before, Xuanhuang headed towards a seemingly illusory mountain range.</p><p></p><p>This place is very vast and difficult to distinguish the size.</p><p></p><p>When time is confused, the distance can no longer be constant, you may run for millions of years but only pass one second, and you may have taken a step but it has already become a completely different world.</p><p></p><p>The illusory mountains seem to be right in front of him, Xuanhuang's will covers, and he leaps up.</p><p></p><p>But after flying for a while, Xuanhuang feels something is wrong, as if he is just treading in place.</p><p></p><p>The illusory mountains have not changed at all, as if he has been running for a long time, but has not narrowed the distance at all.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang stopped his steps and focused his senses.</p><p></p><p>After exploring for a while, he still found nothing, as if he really had flown for a long time just now.</p><p></p><p>"Super-ego."</p><p></p><p>Since his own strength cannot see through the fog of this time, Xuanhuang can only enter the state of super-ego.</p><p></p><p>The super-ego is like overclocking, using the future self to explore the present.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's face changed, and an extraordinary aura emerged, and all kinds of human emotions disappeared instantly.</p><p></p><p>Abandoning the seven emotions and six desires, his mind began to transcend, as if without shackles and constraints, a vague spiritual awareness emerged in his soul.</p><p></p><p>As if at this moment, he is the heaven and earth, he is time, a colorful light surrounds Xuanhuang, as if coming from the future, crossing the river of time to gather here.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, under the state of super-ego, all the illusions were shattered, and the illusory mountains appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>No longer illusory and ethereal, but solid and real.</p><p></p><p>"South Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>The great mountain has a name, and when he sees it, its true name will be engraved in the souls of all beings that perceive its existence.</p><p></p><p>This is an existence with a true name, representing an existence above the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Only when the true self of the fourth level is condensed and born can there be a true name belonging to it, which can leave its imprint on heaven and earth, so that all who see its existence can know its name.</p><p></p><p>When the illusion was shattered, Xuanhuang found himself at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>This place seems to have escaped the inner world of the Mysterious Clock, or even to say that the inner world of the Mysterious Clock is a part of the South Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, surrounding the entire South Mountain, there are countless bubble-like worlds, densely surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has a connection with Jianmu, and found the bubble he came from, a gray fist-sized bubble, with a huge tree with yin and yang flowing in the middle.</p><p></p><p>And more bubbles are gray, with distorted and struggling faces vaguely appearing on the bubbles, as well as various scattered items in the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Some of these items are like the Mysterious Clock, forming strange rules, some are as calm as an ancient well, as if they have not been opened, and some are flashing with light, like fragments of a person's beautiful memories.</p><p></p><p>Some are full of warmth, some are full of sadness, some are lonely, and some are lost.</p><p></p><p>It can be determined that each bubble is a time segment.</p><p></p><p>Densely surrounding the South Mountain, forming a river-like time river.</p><p></p><p>"The South Mountain has a path, time can be crossed, leave your name on the mountain, and you can glimpse the true spirit."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang withdrew his gaze, and in the state of super-ego, he was hardly affected by the joy, anger, sorrow and happiness of the myriad beings.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain leading to the South Mountain, there is an unnamed stele.</p><p></p><p>Engraved with: The South Mountain has a path, time can be crossed, leave your name on the mountain, and you can glimpse the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>This "leaving a name" refers to the true name, not just randomly carving a name to succeed.</p><p></p><p>That countless bubble-like river, each containing beings, even many.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have reached the fourth level of true self and have a trace of great fortune can break through the time fog and come out of the bubble world to the foot of the South Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang carved his own name, not knowing whether he is considered a fourth-level true self existence in this state of super-ego.</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>The moment Xuanhuang carved his name, the entire South Mountain trembled slightly, and the surrounding time river rippled.</p><p></p><p>Countless nameless murmurs, whether surprised, hesitant, suddenly enlightened, or angry, appeared in Xuanhuang's ears.</p><p></p><p>These voices all came from the time river, but from which time segment of the bubble, it is impossible to trace, there are too many, and the changes in the river are too fast.</p><p></p><p>In front of Xuanhuang, a crooked dirt path appeared, the path leading to the mountain top, but he did not know where it led.</p><p></p><p>"In the state of super-ego, I am at the level of the fourth-level true self."</p><p></p><p>"Glimpse the true spirit? What kind of existence is the true spirit? Is this the legendary South Mountain, whose time evolution is as long as the South Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>In the state of super-ego, he quickly deduced, but for the first time discovered that he could not find a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Go up and see."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not hesitate and stepped onto the path towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Not long after.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang found that at the connection point from the foot of the mountain to the middle of the mountain, a water pond appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven-Soul Pool?"</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt that there was no danger, and slowly approached the water pond.</p><p></p><p>The moment he gazed into the water pond, the pond suddenly surged, like boiling water.</p><p></p><p>A golden light flashed in the pond, "Splash", as if peering at some existence, and which existence counterattacked, the jade-green pond water was invaded by the golden light.</p><p></p><p>And in Xuanhuang's perception, the quiet golden immortal soul at the center of the small world flashed inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Seven-Soul Pool trembled, water splashed everywhere, and the already scarce pond water was scattered by more than half, just splashing all over Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Then it quickly became quiet, without a trace of any special aura.</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Even in the state of super-ego, Xuanhuang was also confused. The Seven-Soul Pool should be a kind of reflection of the time river, which can allow the newcomer to see a glimpse of their future path.</p><p></p><p>But why didn't he see anything, and the pond water seemed to have wilted and splashed all over him.</p><p></p><p>"Strange?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The winding dirt path changed.</p><p></p><p>From the foot of the mountain to this Seven-Soul Pool, Xuanhuang walked on this path.</p><p></p><p>But now, the path leading to the middle of the mountain has suddenly become a jade stone paved highway.</p><p></p><p>It's two completely different extremes, one is a muddy and winding small path, the other is a magnificent jade stone paved highway.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Since Xuanhuang doesn't understand, he simply goes on in the state of super-ego without too much emotional entanglement and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he headed towards the middle of the mountain, stepping onto the jade stone paved highway.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Xuanhuang still didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>But soon, it seemed that he had reached the middle of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that at the middle of the mountain, there is another gateway leading up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It is a huge stone mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Mirror?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuanhuang understood a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that after the fourth-level transcendent sees the true self, he needs to further cultivate the seven souls, and after the seven souls is the cultivation of the three souls?"</p><p></p><p>This seems quite obvious, the previous one was the Seven-Soul Pool, and here is the Spirit Mirror.</p><p></p><p>Approaching the Spirit Mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Mirror began to fluctuate, as if penetrating time and space, reflecting the future, the mirror began to form images.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>The entire mirror trembled slightly, the image that was about to condense was abruptly interrupted, and was filled with a golden light, the entire mirror surface emitting a thick golden light.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any image, only golden light.</p><p></p><p>The immortal soul in the small world fluctuated again.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The golden light radiated, forming substantial light in the mirror, pushing Xuanhuang out of the range of the mirror's illumination.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Mirror instantly became quiet again, except that the stone platform where the mirror stood had some cracks.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang seemed to understand, this must be the means of his golden immortal soul.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Seven-Soul Pool before, and now the Spirit Mirror is the same, this is a reflection of his own future, but he discovered the immortal soul, so...</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>The path changed again, the jade stone paved highway disappeared, and a golden rainbow stretched from the mountain top to form a circular platform in front of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Since Xuanhuang understood the reason, he stepped onto the circular platform.</p><p></p><p>This time it was faster, the golden rainbow bridge flashed once, and Xuanhuang had already appeared at the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>The mountain top is a huge platform, as if the South Mountain has been cut in half, leaving a huge platform at the top.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the platform, a huge stele.</p><p></p><p>The true name is: Sealing Spirit Stele, also called the True Spirit Stele.</p><p></p><p>It is the same as the one he carved his name on at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuanhuang's name was engraved on the stele, and it was the first name.</p><p></p><p>Dimly, Xuanhuang felt that he had changed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the state of transcendence, one becomes exceptionally sensitive - a change bestowed by fate. One's fate seems to have strengthened and gained an eternal quality.</p><p></p><p>It's as if one's fate has been fixed, only able to grow and never diminish.</p><p></p><p>Although the specific benefits are not clearly discernible, an indistinct yet profound sense of great advantages, with almost no drawbacks, is felt.</p><p></p><p>This Sealing Stele also seems to have a connection with oneself, as one's name is engraved upon it.</p><p></p><p>And at this very moment...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt his fate had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>The golden divine soul in the small world suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>It abruptly appeared here, and in a flash of lightning, the immortal golden divine soul merged into the Sealing Stele.</p><p></p><p>"Rumbling, crashing!"</p><p></p><p>The Sealing Stele trembled violently, the part embedded in the Southern Mountain gradually detaching, causing the entire mountain to shake.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding bubble river was forcefully pushed away.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The stele was completely uprooted and then carried away by the immortal golden divine soul, disappearing at the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Rumbling!"</p><p></p><p>In the Returning Void Millstone World, a massive stele descended from the sky, replacing the previous location occupied by the golden divine soul.</p><p></p><p>And Xuanhuang's name on the Sealing Stele had turned completely golden due to the divine soul's immersion, as if the immortal golden divine soul had dyed it with its golden radiance.</p><p></p><p>The moment Xuanhuang's name turned golden on the Sealing Stele, its violent struggles suddenly ceased. </p><p></p><p>It was as if the Stele had resigned itself to its fate - unwilling, wanting to resist, and wishing to return home, but ultimately accepting its new circumstances after the complete fusion of Xuanhuang's name and the golden divine soul.</p><p></p><p>On the Southern Mountain, Xuanhuang felt awkward, looking at the large hole left by the removal of the Sealing Stele from the mountain peak. The mountain was violently shaking, but seemed to lack intelligence, only able to react instinctively.</p><p></p><p>Until a thunderous bell toll resounded.</p><p></p><p>Revealed in the sight was a colossal bell at the center of the mountain peak platform. Slowly rotating, the airflow it generated formed numerous bubbles.</p><p></p><p>These bubbles were the source of the bubble river, and the memory fragments or time segments seemed to be produced by the bell's rotation.</p><p></p><p>The transcendent Xuanhuang, who could previously induce a sense of proximity in others, now felt a similar sensation when observing the giant bell in his transcendent state.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of existence is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Can it remain unaffected even by the collision of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the rules of the myriad realms become distorted for any transcendent existence. </p><p></p><p>Yet in his explorations, Xuanhuang found that this was not an absolute truth. The unnamed Southern Mountain and its inhabitants were not distorted, and their time memories, which should have been distorted, had instead become the river surrounding this existence.</p><p></p><p>The Sealing Stele on the mountain peak was also not distorted, and had even been taken away by his own divine soul, struggling briefly before seemingly finding the small world acceptable and ceasing its resistance.</p><p></p><p>This could be due to the complete integration of Xuanhuang's true name and the golden divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the massive bronze bell was also not distorted. Instead, the waves of its rotation were the memory fragments of countless sentient beings.</p><p></p><p>"These are all true spirit-level existences, yet they have not been distorted."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang seemed to understand - some existences will not be troubled by the fusion of the myriad realms, nor will they be distorted by the twisting of the rules, for they are the Dao itself, unaffected by the destruction of the realms.</p><p></p><p>"No, the true self level can achieve this."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shook his head. It is not the untouchable true spirit level that can avoid distortion, but the true self level.</p><p></p><p>However, the difference is that there are no longer any fourth-stage true selves. The fourth-stage true self has been crushed in the fusion of the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>The true spirit level remains unshaken even in the face of the fusion of the realms.</p><p></p><p>This has created a remarkable situation - the weaker true self level is destroyed by the distortion of the world's rules, while the stronger true spirit level continues to exist in abundance.</p><p></p><p>"This is a messed up world."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang finally understood.</p><p></p><p>"The true self level needs to be rebuilt and cultivated by sentient beings, while the true spirit level is unaffected by the fusion of the realms, so they continue to exist."</p><p></p><p>The survival status of cultivators is normally a pyramid, with fewer and fewer high-level existences. </p><p></p><p>But in this world, there are countless lower-level cultivators, a missing middle layer, and a scarcity of the highest levels.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang, lost in his insights, was blown away by the airflow from the bell, like a leaf in the wind from the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly awakened, the Southern Mountain was in upheaval, and the bronze bell, or the Cosmic Bell, was suppressing with massive airflows that swept Xuanhuang towards the boiling river.</p><p></p><p>"Stabilize!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang locked onto the bubble of his previous path, and quickly returned to the bubble he had come from, avoiding being lost in the river.</p><p></p><p>"Splash!"</p><p></p><p>The bubble followed the turbulent river waves.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Entering the world within the mysterious bell, Xuanhuang finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This exploration has truly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Achieving what he has done is almost unheard of in the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>No one can have fourth-stage true self abilities in less than ten years of the fusion of the realms, even in a transcendent state, even with the assistance of a powerful divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Other beings do not possess such a divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Due to his "special fourth-stage true self" level, he was able to pierce the bubble of space-time, emerging from the rolling river to the foot of the Southern Mountain.</p><p></p><p>After having his true name engraved and passing three "trials", he reached the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he uncover a great secret, but his divine soul even took away what seemed to be at least a true spirit-level Sealing Stele.</p><p></p><p>This is truly rare.</p><p></p><p>In the small world, Xuanhuang looked at the towering stele, emanating an awe-inspiring divine presence, with the Dao essence flowing and the rules coalescing.</p><p></p><p>Prominently engraved on the stele were the two characters of Xuanhuang's name.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had a feeling that the moment he could wield this Sealing Stele would be when he reached the true spirit level.</p><p></p><p>Based on his mountain climbing experience, it would be: fourth-stage true self, fifth-stage spirit refinement, sixth-stage three souls, and seventh-stage true spirit.</p><p></p><p>Before the fourth-stage true self, it is the transformation and growth of the body, vital energy, and spirit. Reaching the fourth stage, the self becomes complete, and the refinement of the soul begins, leading to the fusion of the refined vital energy and soul to give birth to the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>This is the extent of Xuanhuang's current understanding.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the small world, there has been no change since the Sealing Stele's arrival.</p><p></p><p>It is still a thousand-meter control area, with the only difference being the addition of the immortal golden divine soul and the now-integrated Sealing Stele, both of which cannot be erased.</p><p></p><p>The golden divine soul that has entered the Sealing Stele, Xuanhuang can clearly feel it growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>The constant fluctuations emanating from the Sealing Stele seem to be nourishing the golden divine soul like a miraculous elixir, and this is the first time Xuanhuang has sensed its growth and strengthening since discovering it.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious growth ability appears to come from endless time and space, from the past, present, and future, above and below. Xuanhuang currently cannot discern its origin.</p><p></p><p>However, there is one thing Xuanhuang still doesn't understand - why taking the Sealing Stele did not result in any consequences or punishment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Heavenly Dao is in the process of reorganization, just as when the Heavenly Dao was newly born and there were no predestined arrangements, so I could take this crucial Heavenly Treasure without any retribution from a source demanding it back."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang could only speculate this way.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he released his four treasures that had been constantly trembling and exuding endless yearning since his return.</p><p></p><p>The Returning Void Millstone, the Tong Tian Wooden Pillar, the Void Knife, and the Heaven and Earth Smelter were like excited children, constantly circling around the Sealing Stele, with the Tong Tian Wooden Pillar even directly embedding its roots into the part of the stele buried underground, trying to envelop it.</p><p></p><p>As the Sealing Stele constantly emanated its aura, the four treasures were intoxicated in their pursuit and rotation.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xuanhuang didn't release the four treasures immediately was that he was worried about potential dangers, but now it seems there are no dangers, and it is instead a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The four treasures are like children, and the Sealing Stele is a powerful ancient elder. Xuanhuang doesn't understand the interpersonal dynamics of the world of treasures, but if the four treasures can "behave," perhaps the elder will provide guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Too complicated, I can't figure it out."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shook his head. "But as long as there are benefits, it's fine. Being near the Sealing Stele, not only can it accelerate the condensation of my true self, it may even accelerate the condensation of my true spirit."</p><p></p><p>"That giant bronze bell also seems very powerful, and the Southern Mountain appears to be a Heavenly Treasure as well."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked at the Sealing Stele, and couldn't help but think of the Southern Mountain, the bronze bell, as well as the Seven Soul Pond and the Divine Soul Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Did these treasures gather together during the collision of heaven and earth, the fusion of the myriad realms? Or are the Seven Soul Pond and Divine Soul Mirror just part of the Southern Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Unable to understand it for now, Xuanhuang did not insist, knowing that as his cultivation rises, time will provide the answers.</p><p></p><p>It is now afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang went out to check, and the constantly bustling construction on Qing Yun Mountain had completely stopped. He needed to clear up two mysterious pieces of information tonight.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, Master Xuan, there is an important matter to report," came the hurried voice of his assistant, Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang sent out the information file and said, "Come in!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bald head darted about.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the main peak of Qingyun Mountain, on a mountain peak that was currently under development, in a simple large hall, a group of senior monks were gathered together.</p><p></p><p>The leader was Monk Minghui.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there were nearly a thousand monks who had come to Qingyun Mountain in the south, all of them renowned high monks and masters.</p><p></p><p>They were experts and geniuses in the fields of qi cultivation, body cultivation, and spirit cultivation, as well as some very devout spirit cultivator monks.</p><p></p><p>"How is your cultivation going, everyone?" Minghui asked.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, currently we have too many monks and too little resources. There are queues to participate in the visualization practices, even if one has merit points, it's still not enough. We need to compete with the Taoist and Confucian factions. Furthermore, the Mysterious Master has issued an order, requiring us to give up one-fifth of our shares..."</p><p></p><p>The monk continued, "Fortunately, our Buddhist faction has produced many elite cultivators. We cover body, qi, and spirit cultivation. We are currently negotiating with the Grand Marshal of the Martial Alliance, Sun Hui, to see if we can exchange our body cultivation shares for their qi and spirit cultivation shares. We can temporarily focus less on body cultivation and emphasize more on spirit and qi cultivation practices."</p><p></p><p>"But... the Confucian and Taoist factions have been disrupting us. They are also negotiating with the Martial Alliance to exchange shares."</p><p></p><p>A senior monk said, "Abbot, the Taoists and Confucians are doing this intentionally, they are being too overbearing."</p><p></p><p>Minghui did not speak for a while, then said, "This kind of situation will be unavoidable in the future. All of you are eminent monks, high cultivators forged by the world. You should understand that our previous alliance and mutual support was an exception. After the Mysterious Master's teachings, that tacit understanding will be broken, and competition will be the norm."</p><p></p><p>The monks present were all true high monks, so they just complained a bit without getting too worked up.</p><p></p><p>Minghui continued, "We must strive for what we need, not just strive but give it our all. We need to change, if we don't change, we will be eliminated... Previously, our Buddhist faction was too excessive. This is an opportunity for us to change. Those hypocritical and false monks must be resolutely expelled. Those who have lost their Buddhist compassion and do not understand true Buddhism must also be removed..."</p><p></p><p>In short, it was a time for reorganization.</p><p></p><p>Although the Buddhist faction had undergone a strange revival, it was no longer as strong as before, having been greatly weakened.</p><p></p><p>The previous false monks who had usurped reputations had already been scorned.</p><p></p><p>But Minghui felt that it was still not enough, they could not overturn the world's perception of them.</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist faction was too large, with many false monks, but also true high monks. The key was that the false monks had been rampant, while the true high monks were neglected.</p><p></p><p>This situation had to change, not only for the world's perception, but also for the Mysterious Master's view.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the views of the upper echelons were the most important, such as the Mysterious Sovereigns.</p><p></p><p>The views of the common people didn't matter much, because they posed no threat to the monks.</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" Minghui asked.</p><p></p><p>An elder monk said, "There is a rumor targeting us."</p><p></p><p>"Go on."</p><p></p><p>The elder monk said, "It's the old claim that the Buddhist faction does not produce anything real, especially in the current situation of population and food crises, etc. This is being spread by the Confucian faction... They've been doing this for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>After these words, the assembled high monks fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Confucians, they had been at odds with them for too long. Not only the Confucians, even the Taoists were often brought out by them for criticism.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Confucians were the dominant school, and even though they couldn't defeat the Buddhists, they didn't dare to curse them, only enduring. But now that the situation had changed, their old tricks had resurfaced.</p><p></p><p>But what the corrupt Confucians said was also true.</p><p></p><p>Now with the dwindling population, strange occurrences, and a chaotic world, the Buddhist faction needed to change.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's change. We will be self-reliant, the Buddhist faction has done this before. To shut others' mouths, it's not about making them stay silent, but us taking action to make them shut up. Stop trying to suppress others, from now on we'll prove ourselves through our actions."</p><p></p><p>Minghui said, "No matter who it is, no matter which eminent monk, they must actively participate in the frontlines of subduing fierce beasts and dealing with strange phenomena. Our Buddhist faction is not afraid of sacrifice. If the spilled blood and sacrifices of our Buddhist faction can restore our reputation, then starting from this old monk, we will use our own blood and dedication to earn the respect of the world."</p><p></p><p>Minghui spoke with great solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said gravely, "Some people need to use their own blood to wash away the past disgrace and decline, and also let the world see our change. Do you all understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>The assembled high monks were stirred, waves rippling in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Abbot Minghui was going to take drastic measures. "Some people need to sacrifice themselves to redeem the disgrace" - this meant that some monks would have to die.</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't be just any death, it had to be a death with value. For example, "A high monk vowing to die saving ordinary people, perishing together with a fierce beast." Or "A certain high monk making a great vow, disappearing while exploring a strange phenomenon, leaving no trace."</p><p></p><p>Or "A certain monastery exhausting its wealth to aid the homeless, the entire monastery's monks vowing to remeasure the earth, sacrificing themselves one by one in the wilderness."</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>Change was necessary, in this era of competition, falling into decay was no longer an option.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After discussing the serious matters, the senior monks then explored their cultivation experiences.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the most important thing. No matter how one chose to martyr themselves, they still needed the ability to do so, couldn't just be sending themselves to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, currently we have 300 people who have participated in the visualization practices. The most are 136 who have comprehended the 'Heaven and Earth Law' Soaring Tree visualization. 58 have comprehended the 'Return to Void Law' Great Grindstone visualization. The remaining 104 have comprehended the 'Smelting Law' Heaven and Earth Smelter visualization. Among them, nearly half, 62 people, have entered qi cultivation, 21 have entered spirit cultivation, and 42 have entered body cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, we have nearly a hundred eminent monks researching the forging of spiritual artifacts, over 200 people researching talismans, and others studying spirit herbs and even formations."</p><p></p><p>Minghui listened and nodded, "What have you gained?"</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, you have been resolving our doubts in cultivation, and the eminent monks here are also wise. Our doubts in cultivation have been resolved. But for artifact forging and talismans, we need to conduct experiments."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Minghui nodded. Artifact forging required obtaining strange phenomena for sealing, then refining them in the Heaven and Earth Smelter, and finally self-tempering.</p><p></p><p>Talismans required using the Soaring Tree, needing to exchange leaves with the Tree.</p><p></p><p>These all required hands-on experimentation, mere research was not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Then go experiment. Whether it's artifact forging or talismans, our Buddhist faction needs to have our own masters. Appropriately raise the merit points of the artifact forging and talisman masters, let them experiment, don't be afraid of failure. We are in the same situation as the Taoist and Confucian factions..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"At the starting line, I don't ask you to surpass others, but at least don't fall behind," said the elder.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we will humbly follow the instructions of the Sect Master," they replied.</p><p></p><p>Just as a person cannot be without a leader, an organization also cannot be without one. Since Minghui has been elected as the Sect Master, we must obey the words of this Buddhist patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sect Master is also an inner disciple of the Xuanshi Sect, and currently the one with the highest cultivation. </p><p></p><p>It is said that the Sect Master has already engraved three inscriptions, and is on the same level as the other two Jiutongdao cultivators, Mr. Yan. This is the result of their previous accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the fourth layer of Lianyi, the three only need time. Monk Minghui has already reached the seventh layer of Lianshen and Lianqi, which means he has smoothly passed the barrier of Lianfa Lianyi seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>With the powerful Qi and Shen as guidance, as long as he makes up for the deficiency in Jing, he can quickly reach the Lianfa Lianyi seventh layer. </p><p></p><p>Engraving the inscriptions is not as difficult as cultivating the Fa.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in less than a week, the previously leading Jin Ning has fallen behind. It is said that he just reached the second layer of Lianfa Lianyi today, and it will be difficult for him to catch up with the three in a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jin Ning's strongest Lianти is only at the fourth layer. With the fourth layer of Jing, as long as he makes up for the deficiency in Qi and Shen, he can also reach the Lianfa Lianyi fourth layer without any barriers. But it's just the fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio can reach the Lianfa Lianyi seventh layer without any barriers.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio, including Jin Ning and Sun Hui, have all tried to cultivate the Fa.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said: the Xuanshi Sect is not ordinary, their creation and cultivation are so fast, and it is extremely difficult for themselves and others to follow in the Xuanshi Sect's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>After feeling the difficulty of cultivating the Fa, the crowd decisively chose to learn Lianfa first, and then cultivate the Fa later.</p><p></p><p>Currently, it is the very beginning of the competition, and they need to move forward step by step.</p><p></p><p>They cannot let the difficulty of cultivating the Fa hinder their cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Before it is really necessary to cultivate the Fa, Lianfa should be the main focus.</p><p></p><p>Only when Lianfa can no longer make them progress, will they then cultivate the Fa.</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's analysis, with the help of Lianfa, that is, with the help of their own three vessels, they cannot improve infinitely.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Transcendent First Stage Xuanbian is actually very simple, using Lianfa and relying on Xuanhuang's vessel to guard the cultivator, the cultivator only needs to reach the first layer of Lianyi Fa.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Second Stage Tongxuan, relying on the vessel of Lianfa to guard the cultivator's divine soul, requires the cultivator to reach the fourth layer of Lianyi Fa.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Third Stage Dongxuan, relying on the vessel of Lianfa to guard the cultivator's divine soul, requires the cultivator to reach the seventh layer of Lianyi Fa.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Fourth Stage Zhenxuan, relying on the vessel of Lianfa to guard the cultivator's divine soul, requires the cultivator to reach the level of the Transcendent First Stage Xuanbian.</p><p></p><p>This is the fundamental principle.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it is impossible to infinitely enhance through Lianfa alone, the true Lianyi Fa needs to keep up.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the group of eminent monks exchanged insights, Mingui said, "Tomorrow, I will be able to reach the fourth layer of Lianfa, and engrave the fourth inscription. The Xuanshi Sect Master said that the fourth layer represents the middle stage, and there will be a great enhancement compared to the initial stage. In the initial stage, one can only visualize the object to guard the divine soul, but in the middle stage after engraving the four inscriptions, the connection with the visualized object will deepen, and one can summon the visualized object to fight enemies in a short time, and also cultivate with the help of the visualized object."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "The object I visualize is the Guiqu Damotor. The Xuanshi Sect Master said that this treasure was born to deal with 'Shen', whether it's Sheshen, Zhengshen, Lianshen, or Shishen, it has tremendous power. Even if the will can keep up, it can continue to enhance the level of Lianshen."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, I have reached the seventh layer of Lianshen. Previously, I did not dare to cultivate it for fear of losing control, but now, as long as the will can keep up, I can continue to cultivate Lianshen or Lianqi. The Xuanshi Sect Master said that to improve the will, at least one of the Jing, Qi, and Shen must be at a high level. I need to increase the level of Lianshen, so that Shen can be a lighthouse to guide the progress of Jing and Qi, and achieve the enhancement of will."</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, if I reach the middle stage of Lianfa Lianyi, I will personally demonstrate the means of the middle stage to provide guidance for all of you."</p><p></p><p>After Mingui finished speaking, the others thanked Mingui for his guidance. Having a senior brother to lead the way is indeed a good thing. The senior brother can pass on his experience to them, which is also the reason why organizations are often formed.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, your cultivation in Lianqi is also outstanding. Can you comprehend the 'Heavenly Law Tong Tian Building Wood Visualization Diagram' to achieve the dual cultivation of Qi and Shen?" asked a senior monk.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible, but not now," Mingui shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He is not only good at Lianqi, but also at Lianти. However, the current priority is to focus on one path and make progress, and only when that path becomes difficult to advance further will he consider other paths.</p><p></p><p>If he were to cultivate Qi and Shen simultaneously, the Jiutong Laodao and Mr. Yan would laugh at him.</p><p></p><p>The two of them are not inferior to him in talent, and they have not cultivated Qi and Shen together either.</p><p></p><p>Even the Xuanshi Sect Master, the Xuanshi Sect Master's Jing, Qi, Shen, and Yi are all four cultivated...no, that's not right, the Xuanshi Sect Master's Jing, Qi, Shen, and Yi are all four cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"For now, we should strive to obtain more opportunities for comprehension. There are only a thousand people who have come to Qingyun Mountain, and only three hundred of them have the chance to comprehend. Not to mention that some people fail to enter the door once or twice, securing the opportunities for comprehension is the most important thing," Mingui summarized.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, can we try other methods, such as exchanging quotas with the scattered cultivators?" asked a senior monk.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!" Mingui exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, this five-part division was personally arranged by the Xuanshi Sect Master. The Xuanshi Sect Master divided it this way to leave hope for the scattered cultivators and ordinary people. If you try to exchange quotas with the scattered cultivators by increasing contribution points, do you think the Xuanshi Sect Master will be happy about it?" </p><p></p><p>He continued, "The Confucian, Taoist, and Martial Alliance are not fools. Why don't they use this method to exchange quotas? Greed is something that requires a price to pay. You can try your best to compete with the Martial Alliance, Taoist, and Confucian factions, and the Xuanshi Sect Master will be pleased, as 'the pivot does not decay and the flowing water does not rot.' But you must never go to the scattered cultivators for their quotas, this is a red line, and it is not to be mentioned again in the future, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded solemnly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of Xuanhuang's arrangement is to prevent monopolization, as monopolization is terrifying, leaving no chance for ordinary people to stand out, which is a very hopeless situation.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a young monk came to the door and reported, "Reporting to the Sect Master and eminent monks, the Taoist Sect is going to refine talismans, and the Confucian Sect has also decided to exchange materials to refine talismans."</p><p></p><p>The senior monks were startled, thinking that the other two sects had attacked them again.</p><p></p><p>Mingui paused for a moment, then smiled and said, "Since our Dharma friends from the two sects are making such a big fuss, how can we Buddhists not go and witness and congratulate them? Come, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for your subscriptions, collections, votes, and the generous reward from the Conqueror 1 Xin Cheng patron. </p><p></p><p>I humbly ask for more subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

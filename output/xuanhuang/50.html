        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Master Ma said, "The reason why this prediction can be spread is that the higher-ups want to build confidence in the spiritual practitioners, so that they won't be defeated by the difficulties in the future. After all, you spiritual practitioners belong to the 'special sensitive' group. If we don't give you some hope, then..."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma didn't finish his sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Then they might become more out of control," Gao Jue murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, you don't need to worry. I will find a way." </p><p></p><p>Master Ma said confidently, "Just because I don't have a way doesn't mean Xuan Shi doesn't have a way. Besides, I haven't learned Xuan Shi's new cultivation techniques yet. Once my cultivation level improves, even though I'm currently at a loss, perhaps I'll find a solution."</p><p></p><p>"Xuan, does Xuan Shi really have a way?" Gao Jue asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't had the chance to ask him about this yet, but it's coming soon. In a few days, when the martial arts school moves to Qingyun Mountain, Xuan Shi will transmit the cultivation techniques. At that time, I'll shamelessly ask him about your and your senior brother's situation."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma cared about his disciples, as if they were his own sons.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." Gao Jue expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"You ungrateful disciple, what nonsense are you saying? Anyway, go and keep an eye on the Bizarre Forum, see how people react after the news about Xuan Shi spreads."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue smiled slightly, "Okay, Master."</p><p></p><p>"This ungrateful disciple!" </p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Master Ma smiled with insight.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue hung up the phone, rubbed his face, and organized his thoughts. Then he opened the Bizarre Forum, a website where spiritual practitioners and high-level immortal cultivators discussed and commented.</p><p></p><p>The titles of the posts were all eye-catching:</p><p></p><p>"Shocking, humans have broken through the martial dao and risen against the trend!!"</p><p>"The South City is in chaos, a reversal of the martial dao, how to view this situation?"</p><p>"Unbelievable, shocking, shocking, the martial dao still has a future!!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue opened a post with many comments.</p><p></p><p>"Are you kidding? The martial dao can surpass the extraordinary? Your family's martial dao! Those who understand know, has your will been eaten by a dog? Without will to replace you, how can you surpass the extraordinary without losing control? Truly brainless."</p><p>"Agree with the comment above, now anyone dares to say they can surpass the extraordinary. Martial artists, it's not that I look down on them, but wanting to surpass the extraordinary while ignoring the rules of the bizarre is just nonsense."</p><p>"I'm also curious, who is talking nonsense? Has humanity become so rotten that we need such false news to boost our confidence? Moreover, even if you want to boost confidence, at least find a lie that's not easily refuted, using the martial dao surpassing the extraordinary as a joke, I even want to curse out loud."</p><p></p><p>Until Gao Jue saw a comment by the ID "A Devout Seeker of the Dao":</p><p></p><p>"Let me share my own feelings and experiences. First of all, I am from South City, and I am disappointed in the comments of the fellow Daoists above.</p><p></p><p>When did we humans become so absurd? Without investigation, they directly think it's impossible. Where is the attitude of seeking truth from facts? Where is the virtue of not speaking without investigation? </p><p></p><p>Just because it's beyond our own understanding, we reject it completely. Is this the attitude of a true expert?</p><p></p><p>I personally witnessed the extraordinary abilities of Master Xuan, welcome to prove me wrong. The news about the one-stage peak bizarre corpse tree in South City that was recently resolved, the source is the South City Exorcism Department. Shouldn't you look at the source before opposing it?</p><p></p><p>It should be normal that what one person cannot do, another can. Why not accept it? ..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the rebuttal against the slanderers, High Jue felt that it all seemed too familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the Master's account?"</p><p></p><p>High Jue let out a bitter smile, as the Master had urged him to go online and investigate the news.</p><p></p><p>Well, the Master was much faster, already engaging in a war of words with the scholars.</p><p></p><p>In any case, without Jia Zhengyi's suppression, the news about Xuanhuang Chaofan had completely exploded. This news was even more shocking than a small country being mysteriously erased.</p><p></p><p>"They actually opened up a path to martial arts transcendence? I am a martial artist, and I very much hope the news is true. If it is true, it means we humans have gained more means to deal with the mysterious invasion."</p><p></p><p>"I won't say anything else, I am a martial artist, a bit far from the South City, but I have decided to set out for the South City immediately. If it's true, it will be a pilgrimage; if it's false, then so be it. At least I will have anticipated it."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go together, let's go to the South City."</p><p></p><p>"I also want to go, but it's too far, I'm afraid I'll die on the way, so I'll just wait for the big shots to investigate whether the news is true or false."</p><p></p><p>"If your heart is moved, what should you do?"</p><p></p><p>"My heart is also moved, but I feel it's false, so I'm not moved, I plan to observe."</p><p></p><p>"The news was issued by the South City Exorcism Department, their official website has been besieged, and everyone is asking them to provide real evidence. The South City Exorcism Department has not responded yet."</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely false, they made a mistake."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Director, Director."</p><p></p><p>In a spiritual medium reception place in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>With a serious expression and a hint of worry, Xu Ruyi was standing by the window, looking at the bustling crowd below.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the deputy director Gao Xiaolan knocking on the door, he responded.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Did the headquarters agree?"</p><p></p><p>"No, Director, the headquarters said we should seek help from the provincial headquarters as much as possible, and the headquarters here has no manpower."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gao Xiaolan's answer, Xu Ruyi sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If we could get support from the provincial headquarters, it would be great. The headquarters here knows it well, after the Mysterious Gate incident, the Daiyue headquarters lost nearly 70% of its experts. With the current strength of the Daiyue headquarters, except for Mr. Blue, the third-stage great expert who is in charge, the remaining spiritual mediums are not as good as us. How could the Daiyue headquarters support us?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan said, "Director, we said that, but the headquarters in the capital city said they couldn't handle it, they are asking for help everywhere, they really can't take care of it all. Some have proposed that each province and city should manage their own affairs, each province and city should defend themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" Xu Ruyi coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"If it's like this, it's equivalent to the fragmentation of the Exorcism Department. Then will they return the spiritual mediums who support the headquarters for us?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan was stunned, "Uh, this may not be possible, the headquarters in the capital city still needs spiritual mediums."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, the people who proposed 'each managing their own affairs' are just deceiving fools, right? They don't let our people go, but instead tell us not to come and seek help. 'Each managing their own affairs', how can there be such a good thing?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan: "So, the headquarters' dragon teachers didn't agree to 'each managing their own affairs', but they also can't spare any manpower to support us."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi fell silent, as if making a decision.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he said, "Forget it, since we can't get any support, we're just wasting time here. Let's leave tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Alley, the haunted trees in the Fulin Community are about to reach the second stage, the new station of the Mysterious Bus Line is in our South City, there are suspected appearances of Mysterious Paper People, the Mysterious Blood Print incident, and the Mysterious Gate of the Daiyue headquarters are all approaching our South City. Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a turbulent time. Why have these troublesome and powerful mysterious phenomena been approaching our South City recently?"</p><p></p><p>This was the purpose of his seeking help.</p><p></p><p>Recently, South City has been surrounded by several troublesome mysterious phenomena.</p><p></p><p>A single Mysterious Gate phenomenon had caused the provincial headquarters' experts to lose 70%. That's quite terrifying. </p><p></p><p>If it happened in South City, what would they do? "Director, has the haunted tree in the Fulin Community been sealed?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, what's the matter?" Xu Ruyi was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

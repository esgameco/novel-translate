        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What an incredible pair of words.</p><p></p><p>This was a world beyond the ordinary, but to hear someone say they were extraordinary was still shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xuanhuang, how did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang looked at Xuanhuang still floating in the sky, firmly believing this was the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>And Xuanhuang did not seem out of control or frantic.</p><p></p><p>"I'll explain later."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang slowly descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the purpose of their coming here, Xuanhuang knew he needed to go down the mountain for now.</p><p></p><p>But he had no intention of leaving for good.</p><p></p><p>This place was truly a geomantic treasure trove, not only having the blood pool, but also the undeveloped secret realm of the Blood Moon World.</p><p></p><p>Going back to the martial arts hall or going home would not be very convenient.</p><p></p><p>In the nearby valley, there was an abandoned resort.</p><p></p><p>A landscape garden, and there were four or five multi-story hotels and inns, if cleaned up properly, it would be a good place to stay.</p><p></p><p>Since it has already been abandoned, might as well tidy it up and live there himself.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang really liked the ancient architectural scenic area.</p><p></p><p>As for the millstone at home, he wouldn't go stir it up for now, wait until he was confident enough to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go down the mountain."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two still in a daze, Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>This person seemed carefree, but was actually quite smart.</p><p></p><p>His attitude towards Xuanhuang immediately changed, and he had an obedient look.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was a bit lacking, still looking dazed.</p><p></p><p>The things that needed to be cleaned up, Xuanhuang had all placed in his spiritual space.</p><p></p><p>After entering the extraordinary realm, the area he could control reached one kilometer, a full ten times more than before, and very stable.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after his body entered the extraordinary, Xuanhuang felt his physical strength reach 100,000 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at this moment, to boast of strength would no longer be appropriate.</p><p></p><p>The extraordinary will, and the extraordinary energy that comes with the extraordinary body, are the most important.</p><p></p><p>In the car...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang closed his eyes and sat in the back seat, the dazed Jin Ning bit his lip to wake himself up.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang did not dare let Jin Ning, who was in such a state, drive, so he had to drive himself.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the three arrived at the Southern City Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any orders?"</p><p></p><p>The car stopped in front of the martial arts hall, Wu Gang did not get out of the car but asked instead.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang opened his eyes and said, "You can gather the current senior members and martial artists at the martial arts hall, just say that the martial way still has a future, and those who want to continue to progress can wait in the training hall."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Gang's breathing became heavy with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He loved this kind of news so much.</p><p></p><p>On the way here, he was still thinking about this matter, thinking about how to get Xuanhuang to reveal the secret of extraordinary control without losing control.</p><p></p><p>He even calculated what kind of price he would have to pay.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang's words made him feel his vision was too small.</p><p></p><p>No need for any heavy price, Xuanhuang... no, Lord Xuanhuang's vision was truly broad.</p><p></p><p>"Jin Ning, you take Lord Xuanhuang to rest in the No. 1 private room."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang instructed Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>Nothing needs Xuanhuang's involvement, he will handle it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang thought, the big bearded guy really knows how to get things done.</p><p></p><p>He then followed Jin Ning out of the car, while Wu Gang ran enthusiastically towards the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>The unrestrained smile on his face, one wouldn't know if he thought his wife had just given birth.</p><p></p><p>Until he had escorted Xuanhuang to the private room to rest, Jin Ning didn't dare say a single unnecessary word.</p><p></p><p>After closing the door, he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xuanhuang had suppressed all his aura, the instinctive impulse and the previous shock were not something that could be easily eliminated in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Calming himself down, he also quickly headed to the senior office of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Wu Gang, are you sure what you're saying is true, and not just talking nonsense?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>Before Gold Ning could even step into the office, he heard the booming voice of the Headmaster Sun Hui.</p><p></p><p>"What the Headmaster said is absolutely true, Gold Ning can testify to it."</p><p></p><p>"Clack!"</p><p></p><p>Gold Ning immediately opened the door and came in: "Yes, yes, yes, I can testify that what Headmaster Wu said is all true."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Headmaster Sun Hui, Deputy Headmaster Wu Gang, Deputy Headmaster Gao Jian, and Deputy Headmaster Song Hongliang turned their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Come and sit down, tell us slowly."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian, the deputy headmaster in charge of personnel, gestured for Gold Ning to come and sit down.</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster, it's true. Xuanhuang has reached a transcendent level, and he hasn't lost control. I and Gold Ning saw with our own eyes that he can fly in the air..."</p><p></p><p>"That kind of unconscious pressure is not something that can be faked. When you get close to him, there is a sense of closeness, not an eerie evil feeling."</p><p></p><p>"The great man also said in his own words that the martial way still has a future."</p><p></p><p>"Ask Gold Ning."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang pointed at Gold Ning.</p><p></p><p>Gold Ning immediately nodded: "Yes, yes, yes, Xuanhuang has been changing every day, I told Deputy Headmaster Wu, and today Deputy Headmaster Wu..."</p><p></p><p>Gold Ning detailed the experiences of the past period and today.</p><p></p><p>Silence.</p><p></p><p>A long silence.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Deputy Headmaster Song Hongliang suddenly let out a puzzled voice.</p><p></p><p>This puzzlement was what the other three headmasters also wanted to know.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, how can the martial way have a future, and humans can be transcendent without losing control? Isn't this the very thing we have been longing for? Why are you still not satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang suddenly glared at Song Hongliang.</p><p></p><p>Song Hongliang hurriedly shook his head, with a wry smile on his face: "You misunderstood, I want this even more than you, I just can't figure it out for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Gold Ning interjected: "Esteemed Headmasters, I've seen on the forum that someone once said that as long as the will is strong, one can achieve control over the transcendent. Maybe Xuanhuang is just like that?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Gold Ning could be certain.</p><p></p><p>Because in the past few days, as he has been contemplating the Observation Diagram, he has felt his will constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>It's just that before, he didn't understand why the spiritual rhythm of the Observation Diagram was not distorted.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems he understands.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the spiritual rhythm was not distorted is probably because Xuanhuang's will was suppressing it.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>It's better not to mention this point, otherwise it will be even more confusing.</p><p></p><p>How did Xuanhuang achieve such a strong will? The forum has said it.</p><p></p><p>The starting point of will requires being above the transcendent, and even the ordinary transcendent is not enough, it needs to reach a certain high level before the will can be refined.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the starting point of will requires an extremely high difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Headmaster Sun Hui sighed: "Little Gold, you may not understand, everyone has a will, and it can even be forged, it's just that it requires the suffering of hardship and the richness of life experience."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui shook his head: "Will is everywhere but difficult to grasp, it's like the Tao, everywhere but you can't comprehend it at your level."</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster, the Heavenly Dao is not complete, the four nines are unfolded, there must be a glimmer of hope and unexpected things."</p><p></p><p>This time, Gold Ning's response was very firm.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui's eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gold is right, there must be a glimmer of hope. We are just pondering here without any use, Xuanhuang, well... Xuanhuang's breakthrough means he has his own way."</p><p></p><p>"Rather than trying to figure it out, it's better not to think about it. This is the miracle we have been longing for, since the miracle has appeared before us..."</p><p></p><p>"Then what we need to do is seize the opportunity, follow him, follow the miracle."</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Headmaster Wu, Deputy Headmaster Song, Deputy Headmaster Gao, act quickly, summon all the personnel and management staff in the martial arts hall to the training hall..."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Sun Hui stood up, resuming the proper demeanor of a headmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The three quickly stood up and responded.</p><p></p><p>Then they left quickly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

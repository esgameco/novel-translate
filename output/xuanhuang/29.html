        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is not a simple delusion, but a kind of rule.</p><p></p><p>Since it is a rule, it represents a powerful ability. Now, few people have lost their mental control, and there is still room for resistance.</p><p></p><p>Once the mental control is lost, everything in its illusory realm will be reflected on the physical body in reality.</p><p></p><p>This is the eerie and terrifying reason.</p><p></p><p>There is yin and yang in heaven and earth, and there is an inner and outer world.</p><p></p><p>The eerie rules occur in the inner world, but their effects are the same in both the inner and outer worlds. The outer world will also synchronize with the changes.</p><p></p><p>The original yin and yang are divided, but the will of heaven is twisted, and the rules collide, causing the yin and yang to be reversed, resulting in various strange events.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's talk about the illusion of Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the silhouette of the woman working at the desk has turned around.</p><p></p><p>The woman's face is covered with dense stitches.</p><p></p><p>Her twisting body is like a puppet, as if pieced together.</p><p></p><p>Her abdomen is empty, just a mass of dense threads.</p><p></p><p>Her facial features are extremely uncoordinated, as if hastily assembled.</p><p></p><p>One eye is on her forehead, and the other is next to her nose bridge.</p><p></p><p>The intense visual impact makes it impossible for Sun Tong to calm down.</p><p></p><p>This is beyond the will of an apprentice to control.</p><p></p><p>And as the fear is amplified, the eerie woman's body is slowly growing larger.</p><p></p><p>As if Sun Tong's fear has catalyzed the eerie transformation.</p><p></p><p>The eerie woman, holding a needle and thread, slowly approaches Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>The panicked and disoriented Sun Tong deeply regrets and hates her uncle at this moment.</p><p></p><p>She hasn't even gotten the benefits, and now she has to endure this kind of test.</p><p></p><p>Which novice can withstand such a test? "Catch her, catch her, she's more beautiful than me, sew her..."</p><p></p><p>The dismembered doll on the desk, both pitiful and gloating, cries out.</p><p></p><p>The cries, like hammers striking Sun Tong's mind.</p><p></p><p>She tries to run away, but her whole body is in disarray and she falls to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her hands feel a sticky sensation, and a glance reveals the ground is covered in black blood.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over, don't sew me, ah, help!"</p><p></p><p>The completely out of control Sun Tong cries out in despair.</p><p></p><p>But it's futile, as the ever-growing eerie woman grabs her feet and throws her onto the work desk.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, sew you, sew you, how pitiful..."</p><p></p><p>The dismembered doll on the desk, looking askew, watches as Sun Tong is thrown onto the desk.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sun Tong is engulfed by overwhelming fear.</p><p></p><p>The dim lighting, the blood-stained desk, the dismembered doll that can speak, and the eerie woman who has grown to three meters tall...</p><p></p><p>Wanting to scream, she finds she has no strength left.</p><p></p><p>But then! A thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the dark space begins to shake.</p><p></p><p>Then, a cracking sound, and the Xuanhuang suddenly enters.</p><p></p><p>The moment Xuanhuang enters, the space begins to twist, as if it's about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>The dismembered doll is directly shattered into pieces on the ground, and the eerie woman's movements become sluggish.</p><p></p><p>The blood on the ground disappears with Xuanhuang's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>In the external perception, Sun Tong, who has lost her psychological resistance, lies limp on the ground. Xuanhuang knows the time has come.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't intervene now, Sun Tong will be dismembered and sewn, with the same effects on her physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang opens his hand, and a golden giant hand instantly forms, grabbing the three-meter-tall eerie woman.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, the eerie woman is crushed.</p><p></p><p>A bloody, mutilated human face appears in front of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the illusory space belonging to Sun Tong shatters.</p><p></p><p>"Me?"</p><p></p><p>A jolt.</p><p></p><p>The prostrate Sun Tong suddenly wakes up, quickly standing up, feeling disoriented.</p><p></p><p>It's as if she had a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the dark living room, Sun Tong now understands everything.</p><p></p><p>She had been dragged into the eerie rules, and at the critical moment, Xuanhuang intervened and saved her.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Still need to exercise, this won't do, you can't be a good assistant like this."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, it's time to end this."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xuanhuang's words, Sun Tong felt both aggrieved and blushed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cloud Fei and Jin Ning standing there in a daze, Sun Tong realized that she was the first to lose her senses and was the first one Xuanhuang rescued.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout from Xuanhuang, the mist in the entire living room was dispersed, revealing a dilapidated and decaying room that emitted a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>"I...!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang, Jin Ning, and Cloud Fei were all startled.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were in the midst of being chased, when suddenly the entire world shattered, and they were left bewildered, looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took a step as if soaring through the air, instantly appearing in the bedroom on the west side.</p><p></p><p>With a "boom", he pushed open the half-open bedroom door.</p><p></p><p>Rushing towards the corner of the room, where a broken and bloodied doll was in a box.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had already largely understood this mysterious ability, a puppet-sewing type that can absorb the fear of living beings to grow.</p><p></p><p>But in Xuanhuang's eyes, its effect is not significant, as this type of mysterious ability is quite common.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the seven emotions and six desires to grow is almost an indispensable skill for mysteries.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang was a master of mysteries, then this mysterious ability would have a great effect.</p><p></p><p>He could use the sewing ability to control more mysteries and thus achieve advancement.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang doesn't need that.</p><p></p><p>It's better to let his Void Knife directly devour and become the nourishment for the advancement of the Void Knife.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after locking onto the doll mystery, Xuanhuang did not hesitate at all.</p><p></p><p>The Void Knife appeared in his hand, and he slashed towards the doll mystery in the box.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the superhuman realm, the Void Knife's blade intent became more refined, and its sharpness was unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>The doll mystery instinctively sensed the crisis and made its maximum effort to resist.</p><p></p><p>Countless threads of silk flew into the air, trying to entangle the fast-approaching blade.</p><p></p><p>But.</p><p></p><p>With the blessing of the first-level superhuman will, how could the doll mystery resist?</p><p></p><p>"Bang, bang, bang!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Knife charged forward, cutting through all the blood-red threads blocking its way.</p><p></p><p>Until it struck the doll.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>A chilling scream echoed out, completely inhuman in sound.</p><p></p><p>The dissolving rules on the Void Knife began to operate, gradually dissolving the doll mystery, including its rules.</p><p></p><p>"Still want to struggle?"</p><p></p><p>Golden blood qi surged in Xuanhuang's hand as he fearlessly grasped the struggling doll mystery.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming will instantly turned into a sharp blade, piercing through the doll mystery's defenses.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that this place was not suitable for a fierce battle, Xuanhuang would not have used such forceful methods, and would have let the Void Knife compete on its own.</p><p></p><p>But after all, it was upstairs, and the aftershocks of the battle would have destroyed the entire building.</p><p></p><p>Out of caution, he directly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>The doll mystery grasped in his hand quickly lost all its abilities the moment Xuanhuang's will pierced through its defenses.</p><p></p><p>The mist permeating the room dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And in the not-too-distant plastic surgery clinic, the "family of three" quickly withered away, leaving behind three distorted dolls with the remains of broken, bloodied skin on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, storing the Void Knife embedded in the doll and the doll itself in his will space, allowing the Void Knife to slowly devour and consume it.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p></p><p>A gust of cool autumn wind blew in through the shattered glass.</p><p></p><p>The dust settled.</p><p></p><p>This wind dispersed the thick stench of evil, blew away the demonic family, and awakened the stunned Wu Gang, Sun Tong, and the others.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Because of the heating problem, I went to appeal this morning and afternoon, making my head a bit muddled.</p><p></p><p>Please continue reading.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

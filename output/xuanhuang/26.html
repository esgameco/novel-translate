        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Back to the long-missed home.</p><p></p><p>When opening the door, although it was noon, the eerie force emanating from the grinding stone was like falling into an ice cellar.</p><p></p><p>A layer of invisible mist covered Xuanhuang's body, and he slowly approached and carefully sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed a second-tier level."</p><p></p><p>In his analysis, the grinding stone was a second-tier level. After his recent advancement, Xuanhuang personally sensed it.</p><p></p><p>"It has not yet awakened, without any eerie rules. Just by approaching it, this is the intensity of the second-tier eerie force."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it has not awakened yet. If this thing fully awakens, perhaps half of the southern city will be devoured by it.</p><p></p><p>It is a very dangerous time bomb.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find a way to resolve it as soon as possible. It won't be good if it awakens."</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Xuanhuang closed the door.</p><p></p><p>He dared not stay long in such a home.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The old neighborhood.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang, a bowl of noodles, please."</p><p></p><p>Walking on the familiar cobblestone street, the crowd was bustling at noon.</p><p></p><p>In front of the familiar Old Wang's noodle shop, Xuanhuang found a familiar seat and ordered a bowl of noodles.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, isn't this little Xuan? I haven't seen you in over ten days."</p><p></p><p>Old Wang greeted him familiarly.</p><p></p><p>"I had a task, just got back."</p><p></p><p>Old Wang widened his eyes and smiled, "I heard your Martial Arts Academy requires cultivator-level to carry out tasks. Does that mean you've become a cultivator, little Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a small breakthrough, just a little bit."</p><p></p><p>"Incredible!" </p><p></p><p>Old Wang urged his wife to cook noodles for Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>He personally sat down and asked, "My second son is in the third year of high school at XX High School. He's been learning martial arts for three years, but he's always complaining that it's too difficult. Do you have any experience at your academy?"</p><p></p><p>Old Wang asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The eerie force awakening did not change the ordinary people's aspiration for their children to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Not much different from the cabbage parents before.</p><p></p><p>"What experience? The schools teach all the experience. Our martial arts teachers are also teachers from various schools. It's all the same, no hidden secrets."</p><p></p><p>"That's why I say this kid is hopeless. He keeps telling me martial arts is useless, and his goal is to become an Eerie Spiritual Master. This rascal is trying to drive me crazy. Is it that easy to become an Eerie Spiritual Master? That's playing with one's life!"</p><p></p><p>Old Wang complained and listed his son's disobedience.</p><p></p><p>"Let him persist, maybe there will be changes. Changing paths at this time is no different from..." Xuanhuang almost let something slip.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean 'no different from'?" Old Wang listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, just that he should persist. Look at me, it's because I persisted that I had a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Old Wang expressed his full agreement, "Indeed, one must persist. Learning martial arts, how could it be easy? I just didn't catch the good era. If I had..."</p><p></p><p>Old Wang boasted about his own capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xuanhuang smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few like Old Wang in the Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>This Old Wang himself didn't persist either. Although there were also reasons of natural talent, he had his own reasons for not being able to persist.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's slight smile made Old Wang feel awkward for no reason.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let me go check if it's ready."</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, no hurry, I'm off duty today."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang responded casually.</p><p></p><p>In the bustling crowd, Xuanhuang aimlessly watched.</p><p></p><p>Although his temperament was aloof, he blended into the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The mundane atmosphere could soothe the heart.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was actually quite good.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, he walked among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>A figure caught Xuanhuang's attention.</p><p></p><p>He saw a woman, her face pale, trying to stand upright, but trembling uncontrollably, making her look particularly awkward.</p><p></p><p>In her hand, she held a flyer, but in Xuanhuang's eyes, it was stained with fresh blood, with an eerie aura permeating it.</p><p></p><p>It had the same quality as the eerie dream brush and love letter he had suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, are you selling something? Let me take a look at the flyer, maybe I need it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang walked up to the woman and suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The woman was startled, completely unaware of Xuanhuang's approach.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you... you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed like she was making an important decision.</p><p></p><p>The woman was hesitant for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It's best not to force this painful moral dilemma, as the human heart can only withstand so much back-and-forth.</p><p></p><p>While the woman was hesitating, Xuanhuang directly took the flyer.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a medium.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this flyer would undoubtedly trigger a strange murder pattern.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see, oh, it's actually a plastic surgery medical flyer, what era is this that there's still plastic surgery?" </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had a look of incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>The woman was completely dumbfounded, but her expression also had a hint of relief.</p><p></p><p>"I thought it was a supermarket sale, but it's actually plastic surgery. Forget it, I'll help you throw it in the trash. Ma'am, don't go into this field, it has no future."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>After walking about five or six steps, the woman's shout suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, ma'am?"</p><p></p><p>The woman quickly walked up to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Looking around to ensure no one was there, she quietly said to Xuanhuang, "I've encountered a strange incident, do you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded and calmly said, "I believe you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman became anxious, and tears were about to spill from her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling the truth, wuwu... I'm not lying."</p><p></p><p>"Ma'am, don't get agitated, I really believe you. Come, let's go over there and talk slowly."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang decisively pulled the woman to sit on a rest chair by the street.</p><p></p><p>If this lady lost control and kept crying and shouting, it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Even after sitting down, the woman kept saying, "I'm telling the truth."</p><p></p><p>"Ma'am, I really believe you. I'm a member of the martial arts hall, specialized in handling this. Don't cry, crying won't solve the problem. Come, tell me slowly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman finally calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Especially when Xuanhuang said he specialized in handling this, she seemed to have found a foothold.</p><p></p><p>Her strained body suddenly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, I used to be a doctor at a plastic surgery clinic, co-owned with a colleague. Business was bad a year ago, so we closed down."</p><p></p><p>"Then why are you still distributing flyers?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked following her words.</p><p></p><p>"The problem lies there. Yesterday, the colleague I co-owned the clinic with suddenly came to me, saying business was bad and asked me to promote it more, and gave me the flyers."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang frowned: "Didn't you close down? How come your colleague is still asking you to distribute flyers."</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>This question made the woman completely unable to hold back, and she broke down in tears.</p><p></p><p>After a while, she stammered: "Not only did we close down a year ago, but my colleague also passed away seven days ago."</p><p></p><p>"I personally attended her funeral."</p><p></p><p>"But she appeared again yesterday, and asked me to distribute the flyers."</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang also didn't know what to say for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A dead person appeared again, and even asked her to distribute flyers because of bad business.</p><p></p><p>"Don't cry, how did your colleague die?"</p><p></p><p>"Murdered in a home invasion, the killer is still at large, a very twisted killer who even peeled off her face skin."</p><p></p><p>Interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you go seek help, go to the exorcism department, or even a Taoist temple or martial arts hall?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman's tear-stained face showed a hint of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>She stammered: "I had a mentality of taking a chance, thinking that if I gave the flyers to someone else, I would be fine."</p><p></p><p>"Then why did you regret it?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was not angry at all, but rather asked with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, don't be angry. Just now, that was indeed my idea, but when you took the flyer, I regretted it, I can't harm others like this."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the woman wiped her tears and became a little more determined. She continued: "You're right, I should go to the exorcism department for help, I can't do this to harm others."</p><p></p><p>There's still hope, it's not beyond redemption.</p><p></p><p>"A promising student!"</p><p></p><p>...

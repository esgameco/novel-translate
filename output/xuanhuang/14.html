        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three crippled ones were howling in pain, and two were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, they encountered a wolf pack.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, three were severely injured, and the somewhat intelligent wolf pack immediately scattered.</p><p></p><p>During this, two slow ones were stunned by the Xuanhuang Void Knife.</p><p></p><p>It's enough, Xuanhuang didn't slaughter them all.</p><p></p><p>Not yet ferocious beasts, just ordinary wild animals with a little evolution, are very fragile before Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the two injured ones, Xuanhuang calmly threw them into the mysterious Blood Pool Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then he waited quietly for the changes in the wolves.</p><p></p><p>About thirty minutes later, the agonizing howls of the wolves came.</p><p></p><p>'Rumble—'</p><p></p><p>Two huge black wolves walked out of the crevice.</p><p></p><p>The eerie power was inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>When the crippled wolves came out, they had transformed into two giants at least two meters high and four meters long.</p><p></p><p>"Roar~"</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with brutality, and the moment they saw Xuanhuang, it was as if they had encountered their greatest natural enemy.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, they pounced on Xuanhuang instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh~"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang swung his long blade and charged towards the ferocious wolves.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious...</p><p></p><p>Even though the two ferocious wolves were robust and mighty, facing the nearly 5-ton Xuanhuang, coupled with the support of the Void Knife, it was only a matter of time before the two wolves died.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, one is worth a bottle of the Great Elixir."</p><p></p><p>"This way is more economical."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Pool Realm is truly a treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>If this thing were in the normal Xianxia world, it would definitely be a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>In fact, all the eerie things in this realm are treasures in the normal world.</p><p></p><p>Due to the condensation of the rules, there is an endless supply of energy, and as long as there are ways to deal with them, they are almost ancestral treasures of the sects.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the fragments are also the Dao.</p><p></p><p>If a sage obtains them and comprehends the laws within based on the fragments, it's unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the two ferocious wolves, he returned to the safe house.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to first push up his Refining Body realm, and then refine it to the ninth layer.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grinder, the Wooden Furnace, and the Smelting Furnace were refined in turn...</p><p></p><p>The remaining pure qi and blood were quickly refined and absorbed by his body.</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>When he reached the ninth layer of Refining Body, his body seemed to be on fire, with a faint glow visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>This is close to the mortal limit, with a colossal strength of 9,000 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Swinging a fist gives a sense of piercing the air.</p><p></p><p>His skin became even more delicate, with a faint layer of light covering it.</p><p></p><p>As long as he takes one more step, with his qi and blood leaving his body, he can achieve defensive and offensive capabilities.</p><p></p><p>The saying goes: "If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail."</p><p></p><p>It's a very vivid analogy, and at this moment, Xuanhuang is eagerly anticipating his next confrontation with the Eerie Letter tonight.</p><p></p><p>Until the time comes.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom—"</p><p></p><p>The intense collision sounds arrived as expected.</p><p></p><p>The eerie existence clearly exhibits both "terribleness" and "stupidity".</p><p></p><p>If it were an intelligent female ghost, it would definitely not provoke Xuanhuang, as there are so many easily crushed beings, why bother to provoke a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But the Eerie Letter cannot, it can only follow the rules.</p><p></p><p>Just like last night, Xuanhuang let down his active defense.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh—"</p><p></p><p>It was the same scene as last night, turning into a large courtyard, and then changing his identity...</p><p></p><p>"Heartless man..., damn it..."</p><p></p><p>The repeated scenes were nothing more than more intense spiritual impacts.</p><p></p><p>The female eerie being had already moved from the seventh side room to the sixth room.</p><p></p><p>This time, Xuanhuang did not hurry to take action, planning to just pass the time by using the eerie being's spiritual impacts to temper himself.</p><p></p><p>He had already squeezed out the essence from the Blood Pool Eerie, so there was no reason for the Eerie Letter to be spared.</p><p></p><p>This kind of will-tempering method is free, and using the Great Elixir would cost him money, even the "guarding spring" Blood Pool Eerie would take time.</p><p></p><p>At this point, a surreal scene appeared.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuating spiritual impacts were heading towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The curses turned into a forge.</p><p></p><p>It lasted for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A pulling force came.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang sensed no danger, so he followed the pull.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>The silvery laughter came.</p><p></p><p>A female figure appeared before Xuanhuang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's gaze swept over, and it was no longer the ancient-style courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But a riverbank in the spring warmth and blooming flowers.</p><p></p><p>Dreamlike, only the figure of the woman had a graceful figure, walking like a gentle deer, appearing very cute, like a simple and adorable young lady.</p><p></p><p>The floral dress swayed, the tight-fitting top, her hair half-tied, she looked like a beautiful sight in the world.</p><p></p><p>Spring warmth, lush trees and flowers everywhere,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young girl was as beautiful as a painting, her laughter intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>"Lingling, my mom has agreed." "It won't be long before I marry you."</p><p></p><p>"I will make you the happiest woman..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>A slightly flippant male voice came from behind the mysterious figure.</p><p></p><p>Sappy sweet-talk, even in the present day, could still make a young maiden's heart flutter.</p><p></p><p>"Am I being drawn into the bizarre counterattack: memory?"</p><p></p><p>The scene kept changing.</p><p></p><p>The woman always showed her back, never revealing her face.</p><p></p><p>The male voice, however, became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Starting from a distance, speaking sweet nothings, he gradually drew closer to the mysterious figure.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>"Lingling, I can give you my heart..."</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure suddenly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Even with prior preparation, he almost fell for the trap.</p><p></p><p>The male voice, along with the endless sweet words, gradually became the voice of the mysterious figure himself.</p><p></p><p>The words were clichéd, but when he said "I can give you my heart," the mysterious figure found his own heart pounding violently, as if it was about to burst out of his chest.</p><p></p><p>Although this was a test of willpower, such an experience was best avoided.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>The moment he broke free, the sky suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The warm spring scenery transformed into a gloomy, icy rain.</p><p></p><p>The man disappeared, and the graceful, charming figure of the woman became a hunched, battered form, subjected to the cold rain.</p><p></p><p>Slowly...</p><p></p><p>The figure that had been facing away turned around.</p><p></p><p>An indescribable sense of horror - its eyes were black holes, emitting black mist.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe-hehe-"</p><p></p><p>A labored, gasping breath, as if on the verge of death, came from its blood-stained mouth.</p><p></p><p>Its abdomen was a bloody mess, and a half-white, half-fleshy infant's arm could be seen hanging from it.</p><p></p><p>The intense impact.</p><p></p><p>While the horrifying visual was disturbing, the powerful spiritual assault that accompanied it was the real danger.</p><p></p><p>The bizarreness was not just a visual shock; it was a layered, twisted pattern that defied resolution.</p><p></p><p>Those who could not withstand the assault would become part of its operation.</p><p></p><p>Like a running field, the trigger point was the resonance point.</p><p></p><p>Once the resonance point was triggered, the magnetic field of this operation would sweep in, until the victim became part of the field.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the mysterious figure entered a small world.</p><p></p><p>In the real world, his will was not yet formed, unable to condense the visualization.</p><p></p><p>But this was the dream world, the bizarre rules of the love letter.</p><p></p><p>Here, the small world's divine will could manifest.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble--"</p><p></p><p>A black and white large mill appeared, standing between the mysterious figure and the bizarre woman.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre spiritual assault collided head-on with the Great Mill of Oblivion.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Mill began to turn.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble-Whoosh-"</p><p></p><p>The bizarre spiritual assault was also a spiritual force! Although mixed with the illusory power of dreams and twisted intentions, it was a professional match.</p><p></p><p>The Great Mill of Oblivion's visualization was the perfect fit for this.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mysterious figure's will could hold out, with the power of the small world supporting him, the Great Mill could have a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh-"</p><p></p><p>The endless stream of spiritual distractions was crushed by the Great Mill, continuously extracting the true essence, and the Great Mill became increasingly solidified.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure gritted his teeth and held on.</p><p></p><p>Under the bizarre rules, even as the bizarre power of the love letter was being eroded, this thing had no intelligence and would not stop until it exhausted itself.</p><p></p><p>This formed the bizarre scene.</p><p></p><p>The love letter's bizarreness constantly emitted spiritual remnants to attack, and the Great Mill of Oblivion accepted them all.</p><p></p><p>While time slipped away...</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure clearly felt the power of the love letter's bizarreness weakening.</p><p></p><p>"Could this thing be drowning in its own stagnation?"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure speculated.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the dream world began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!" It shattered.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of the dream's collapse, the mysterious figure quickly reached out and grasped a blood-stained calligraphy brush in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hum~"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual force trembled again.</p><p></p><p>When he focused his gaze again, he found himself back in the safe house.</p><p></p><p>...

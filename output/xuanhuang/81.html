        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The creation of talismans, although Yan Lai was well-prepared, even the simplest summoning talisman, he only succeeded on the third try.</p><p></p><p>But the purpose was achieved. When he released the summoning talisman in the square, it caused an uproar among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>This meant that what the Mysterious Master said had all come true - whether it was forging weapons or creating talismans, they could become the means for future cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This represented a significant increase in their methods.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai happily announced that the Confucian School would start selling various talismans, which was a form of advertising.</p><p></p><p>But Yan Lai was also frustrated. He had simulated and learned the summoning talisman countless times, but even the simplest one took him three tries to succeed. If it was a more difficult talisman, he didn't know how much time he would waste.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that 110 sheets of leaves were a lot of materials, but now it seemed they could only allow him to learn three types of talismans, and even those were the simplest ones.</p><p></p><p>"It's really not easy," Yan Lai sighed.</p><p></p><p>The crowd dispersed, and everything was very successful - forging weapons and creating talismans began from this day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Martial Dao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Several senior members watched the performances of the Taoist and Confucian schools.</p><p></p><p>But they showed no signs of disappointment, as if the progress of the two schools had no impact on them.</p><p></p><p>"How's the progress on the Blood Pool Secret Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian: "Reporting to the Overseer, it's already done. We can proceed with the plan after reporting to the Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>"How about the preparation of the beasts and animals?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian: "Overseer, the farms under our jurisdiction are all ready - chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, cattle, and sheep are all prepared, and we've even prepared some wild beasts."</p><p></p><p>"Very good. No matter how the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists perform, our primary goal is the Blood Pool Secret Realm, and then the Blood Moon World. This is the opportunity given to us by the Mysterious Master. As long as we utilize these two well, we may be the ones who have the last laugh."</p><p></p><p>The core of the Martial Dao Alliance was simple.</p><p></p><p>They found that they couldn't compete with the Confucians in terms of scheming and management, couldn't compete with the Buddhists in terms of wisdom and action accumulation, and couldn't compete with the Taoists in terms of technical talents and experience.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they had left was their loyalty to the Mysterious Master and the opportunity that came from the Mysterious Master being from their Martial Dao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Since they couldn't outmaneuver them mentally, they would use sincerity and action to prove themselves. After all, this was something warriors were good at.</p><p></p><p>They would diligently do what the Mysterious Master designated them to do, without fighting or competing, firmly following the Mysterious Master.</p><p></p><p>If the Mysterious Master said to develop the Blood Pool Secret Realm, they would go develop it. If the Mysterious Master said there were great opportunities in the Blood Moon Secret Realm, they would go develop the Blood Moon Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now it was the Martial Dao Alliance's turn.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how are Old Song and Old Zhao's comprehensions going?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Long, a typical martial artist, had chosen to join the like-minded Martial Dao Alliance and become one of the executives. But he didn't manage anything, it was just an honorary position. His only goal now was cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Long said, "Overseer, I've found the key breakthrough. I'm confident I can complete the comprehension in one or two days."</p><p></p><p>Song Hongliang: "Overseer, I'm still a bit behind. I may need about a week."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Hui nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang would also need three or four days, Jin Ning had already completed it and started refining the second Esoteric Inscription, and he himself was also in the process of engraving the third Esoteric Inscription.</p><p></p><p>Of the ten people the Mysterious Master had designated, his own school occupied five of them, which was the biggest advantage.</p><p></p><p>As long as they moved quickly, the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists would still fall behind.</p><p></p><p>The active performance of the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists was due to the strong reasons of the Martial Dao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The rapid refinement of the Esoteric Inscriptions had quickly narrowed the gap. As long as they completed the comprehension of the Observation Diagram, the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists would be no match for them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the completed Observation Diagram would at least provide a Level 7 Spiritual Defense.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't have very strong offensive abilities, you also couldn't break through their defenses.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that the three old fellows of the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists were going to refine the fourth Esoteric Inscription, which was a mid-level Esoteric Inscription with offensive abilities. This would be a headache.</p><p></p><p>They were still far behind, just starting to engrave the third Esoteric Inscription.</p><p></p><p>"Keep working hard. Since we have a huge advantage, we must maintain it. At the same time, we can't slack off in recruiting and cultivating young talents. Although the contribution points are temporarily not enough, once the Blood Pool Secret Realm is developed, we won't lack contribution points."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Overseer."</p><p></p><p>The group received the orders and left to carry them out.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>"Old Song, Old Zhao, Wu Gang, Jin Ning, let's go. The Mysterious Master summons us."</p><p></p><p>Just as Sun Hui was about to make a concluding speech to encourage everyone, he suddenly felt his spiritual sense shaking.</p><p></p><p>A message had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning also received the same message.</p><p></p><p>This was the spiritual communication that the Mysterious Black and Yellow could establish with them after their comprehension of the Observation Diagram was complete.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Long, Wu Gang, and the others quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the three Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists, as well as Dou Ming and Ma Dazhang who had joined the Taoist school, also received the message.</p><p></p><p>The ten people were summoned by the Mysterious Black and Yellow again, and after quickly instructing their subordinates, they hurried to the Mysterious Black and Yellow's villa.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ten people gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Mysterious Master is waiting for you. Please come in," Sun Tong welcomed them at the door.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The ten people simply greeted each other and entered the villa, arriving at the main hall where the Mysterious Black and Yellow received guests.</p><p></p><p>"Please sit down."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Black and Yellow was actually quite casual, but his strength made everyone feel too awestruck to be at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>The group half-sat down, sitting up straight, just like subordinates being summoned by a superior.</p><p></p><p>"How was the first time forging weapons and creating talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong immediately stood up: "It is thanks to your grace, Mysterious Master... I have gained a lot, but I am still unable to achieve the miraculous transformations like you. I can only erase the distorted consciousness, but I have not yet refined the..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai: "Mysterious Master, I feel that creating talismans is easy to learn but difficult to master. To be honest, the three successful attempts were pure luck. If you ask me to draw another one, I'm afraid I would fail again. The experience is there, but it's very little."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the responses of these two, the other eight people fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>This kind of experience, only by standing with the Mysterious Master could they speak of it, it was very precious.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Black and Yellow said: "The main issue is the lack of control and willpower. Solve these two aspects and it will improve a lot... Secondly, your cultivation bases are a bit lacking, there's no other way but to slowly accumulate experience."</p><p></p><p>He continued: "But trying is already good, you've opened the way. However, don't overemphasize it, you all should still focus on cultivation as the main priority, understand that cultivation is the true path."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the three Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists: "After refining the fourth Esoteric Inscription, with the abilities of the Heavenly Earth Smelting Furnace, the Heavenly Reaching Tree, and the Returning Abyss Grindstone, don't underestimate these three treasures just because they are Observation Objects and not focused on killing."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Black and Yellow continued: "Jiu Tong's Chain Technique looks good at restraining people, but it's still far inferior to the Heavenly Earth Smelting Furnace's devouring ability. The furnace fire inside can also be released to attack enemies, its killing power is also extremely formidable."</p><p></p><p>He went on: "In terms of support, you can refine ferocious beasts and strange phenomena. The refined pure energy is even stronger than elixirs. Additionally, when suspended above, it can radiate protective divine light, unbreakable unless the strength gap is huge."</p><p></p><p>He continued: "The Heavenly Reaching Tree is the same, its life and death abilities are quite strong. Life can heal wounds and restore, comparable to life-saving elixirs... Death can turn into the Scythe of the God of Death to destroy the enemy's life force. It can be said to have both offense and defense, and when summoned, it also has the protection of the yin-yang cycle."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It cannot be broken... There are also various other abilities, such as catalyzing plant growth, controlling plants, stabilizing the celestial mechanism and purifying the spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said: "Although the Guihu Great Grinder's spiritual attack is the strongest, its spiritual defense is also the strongest. As the grinder rotates, it can crush the enemy's spiritual soul. Without spiritual defense techniques, it is unbreakable. Refining the spiritual soul is just ordinary, and the Guarding Dao Divine Light is equally powerful. The Guihu Nine Seal Technique I teach is top-tier, whether it's for attacking enemies or refining the spiritual soul."</p><p></p><p>Currently, even the strongest among them have not reached the level of the fourth Inscription Dao.</p><p></p><p>So they are not very familiar with the mid-stage techniques of the Fusion Dao Refining Intent.</p><p></p><p>As Xuanhuang described it, they realized that they had thought too simply. It is not just powerful, it is extremely powerful. Pardon their verbosity, for they could not find better words to express it.</p><p></p><p>Capable in both offense and defense, with supportive cultivation abilities, it is truly eye-opening. What more could one need in terms of spiritual elixirs? The enemies themselves are the best kindling.</p><p></p><p>It can be called an invincible technique.</p><p></p><p>It is similar to the devouring type of Dao techniques, but without any side effects.</p><p></p><p>According to the descriptions in many novels, this is practically the protagonist's "golden finger", surpassing even the "Devouring All" technique.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual essence of other living beings can be refined and enhanced without any aftereffects.</p><p></p><p>However, it requires compatibility. The Guihu Technique can enhance the spiritual soul without side effects, but devouring the vital energy, spiritual energy, and magical power does not work that way. That requires the Heavenly-Earth Melting Furnace visualization.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Heavenly-Earth Melting Furnace can devour the enemy's blood essence, but the spiritual soul and magical power require the Guihu Technique and the Heavenly-Earth Technique.</p><p></p><p>Unless one cultivates all three techniques in harmony.</p><p></p><p>But that is impossible, as cultivating the three techniques together is too difficult, not only in terms of comprehension and time, but also in terms of being able to control them.</p><p></p><p>The idea of consolidating three visualization diagrams in one's consciousness is truly dreadful.</p><p></p><p>What immense willpower and control would be needed to maintain balance, and what high levels of enlightenment would be required to achieve it? It's best to focus on one path.</p><p></p><p>The Master said that as long as one aspect, be it spiritual essence, vital energy, or magical power, is strong enough, it can drive the development of the other two, which is the great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I value you ten greatly, so the best way for you now is to go into battle, to slay the fierce beasts, to temper yourselves... Commanding a great force and standing high above may indeed be intoxicating, but the times have changed. Only those who can harness their own power will have the last laugh. Do not be obsessed with power and status. Delegate when appropriate, and avoid neglecting your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The ten hurriedly stood up and bowed, saying, "We are grateful for the Master's teachings."</p><p></p><p>The weight of his words did not require a heavy hammer. Xuanhuang's tone was calm, but it resonated deeply within them.</p><p></p><p>Was this a criticism of their recent competitive behavior? Not exactly. Xuanhuang was simply offering a few words of advice. He was glad to see their competition.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted them to focus on the right priorities and adjust their mindset.</p><p></p><p>Competing through slaying enemies and protecting the masses, that was what Xuanhuang wished to see.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Blood Pool Secret Realm is ready. Awaiting your command," said Wu Gang immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I will personally go and make some adjustments. Afterwards, the Blood Pool Secret Realm can operate normally. It can be used to cultivate fierce beasts, and a batch can be prepared for tempering purposes."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Since my Qingyan Mountain is located in the Southern City, there are too many fierce beasts running rampant in the Southern City and its surrounding wilderness. You should organize a cleanup operation. In the future, any disciples who learn my Dao techniques must remember that wherever they settle, they must protect the local populace. If they lack this sense of responsibility, they should not learn my techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>This could be considered a grand aspiration, as well as a set of principles for his disciples.</p><p></p><p>If one learns his techniques and gains power, they must also bear the corresponding responsibilities and obligations. </p><p></p><p>They must have a sense of perseverance and attachment. Without these, they will eventually become lost and stagnant. What would be the meaning of their existence? If their abilities are insufficient, they can just go with the flow or even become complacent. But if they have the power and choose not to use it, that would be a waste of the heavenly bestowed abilities.</p><p></p><p>Filled with contemplation and solemnity, the ten left Xuanhuang's villa.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then appeared at a bustling mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the familiar scene, Xuanhuang came to the waist of the mountain where the Blood Pool Anomaly was located.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that he had been guarding this place just over a month ago, time had indeed passed quickly, and things had changed.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jintian, the familiar "Uncle Liu", noticed Xuanhuang's arrival. He was now in charge of the development of the Blood Pool Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu!" </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang almost called him "Uncle", but changed his mind. Addressing him as "Uncle" would make Liu Jintian uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Adhering to his principle of not causing trouble for others, Xuanhuang called him "Old Liu" instead.</p><p></p><p>This form of address brought a wide smile to Liu Jintian's face.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, you've come."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Please, come in."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Xuanhuang was very cautious. He had guarded the pool for over ten days before, but had never actually entered it.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that his cultivation would not be enough, and he would be harmed by the Blood Pool Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time entering.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the fissure, the Blood Pool Anomaly's invasion had intensified.</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang was guarding it, there were only faint red traces at the connection between the Blood Pool Secret Realm and reality. Now, this blood-red hue had invaded half the cave.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Blood Pool Secret Realm would continuously encroach on the surroundings, until it was completely integrated into the real world, becoming a part of it.</p><p></p><p>This was the result of the merging of the worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star was expanding every day due to the countless spaces merging in.</p><p></p><p>This was still considered a relatively good outcome.</p><p></p><p>Some areas directly shattered and transformed into strange domains, adding new land to the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>"You all wait outside, I'll go in alone."</p><p></p><p>He said this to the group.</p><p></p><p>This was Xuanhuang's first time entering the Blood Pool Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>A cold and turbulent aura rushed towards him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the air was filled with blood, the dense bloody scent making one uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will manifested as a protective divine light, and he surveyed the entire Blood Pool Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had seen it in the videos before. The Blood Pool Secret Realm was not very large, about the size of a small village.</p><p></p><p>It was filled with a crimson mist. At the center was a blood pool about three zhang in size, the blood within bubbling and emanating an assault on the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>It was as if countless evil demons were roaring. If one's consciousness was destroyed, living beings would uncontrollably walk into the blood pool and be devoured and dissolved.</p><p></p><p>"Early Dao Realm, not quite at the peak."</p><p></p><p>After a brief assessment, Xuanhuang reached this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>It was still not as powerful as the previous Corpse Tree Anomaly and the Ominous Bell.</p><p></p><p>But with the support of being a secret realm, it could reach the peak of the Early Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the beings who enter can withstand the spiritual soul assault, they can avoid being devoured."</p><p></p><p>"But ordinary people would find it difficult to resist the assault. A safe path needs to be carved out."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang found the area that needed to be changed.</p><p></p><p>"But no need to rush. Let's first raise the Void Saber to the Early Dao Realm level."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took out the Void Saber. Among the four brothers, it was the only one still at the Mid Dao Realm level, the poor thing.</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum!"</p><p></p><p>The appearing Void Saber was still full of enthusiasm as always. </p><p></p><p>Whenever it was summoned by Xuanhuang, it would vibrate excitedly, as if saying: "Use me and you will be invincible, with me you are unstoppable. Master, let's fight together!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

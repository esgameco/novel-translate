            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your secret has ultimately become mine. Wouldn't it be better if you just told me about it?"</p><p></p><p>"You're joking."</p><p></p><p>Through the relentless efforts of Da Mo, Qi Long's spiritual soul was completely shattered and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the secret he had mentioned also appeared in Xuan Huang's memories.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Xuan Huang had refined a 'human' being. Previously, it had not checked the memories of the slain creatures, not because it couldn't, but because there were none.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang perfectly assimilated Qi Long's memories.</p><p></p><p>Through this process, Da Mo also broke through to the mid-stage of the first realm, reaching the same level as the Void Knife, second only to Tong Tian Jian Mu.</p><p></p><p>As a result, its abilities in the metaphysical realms of soul, spirit, dream, and heart became even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Exploring Qi Long's memories, Xuan Huang discovered that six years ago, Qi Long had mastered the Deceptive Shadow during a life-and-death trial.</p><p></p><p>Originally the target of the Deceptive Shadow's invasion, due to luck and unwavering faith, he had transformed into a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>He did not join the Exorcism Department, but remained a solitary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the following years...</p><p></p><p>Through Qi Long's memories, Xuan Huang learned many secrets it had not known before.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Deceptive Society, which was established by a 'Superintendent' - a powerful cultivator at the third realm - who gathered like-minded individuals.</p><p></p><p>It gradually grew larger and larger, and the Superintendent's Deceptive abilities allowed them to control a Deceptive Tower, which had the nature of binding the earth spirits and could move freely, making it extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the Deceptive Tower could rival Xuan Huang's domain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it did not require piecing together puzzles; it could simply grow stronger over time, which was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were other Deceptive Spiritual Cultivator organizations, some of which Xuan Huang was familiar with, such as the 'Salvation Society' and the 'Demon Worshippers'.</p><p></p><p>There were also righteous organizations like the 'Exorcism Sect' and the 'Golden Messenger'.</p><p></p><p>It was an eye-opening array of diverse factions.</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Long's secret...</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, in the southern Wu City, Qi Long had discovered a Demonic Lair in an underground fissure.</p><p></p><p>It was called a Demonic Lair because it was filled with a black mist that could drive people insane.</p><p></p><p>From the mist, the sounds of ancient battlefield-like clashes could be heard from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Through the Deceptive Shadow's abilities, Qi Long had barely survived and made a remarkable discovery.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the mist, there was an ancient, red-glowing multi-story building.</p><p></p><p>In front of the door hung a large red lantern that was captivating.</p><p></p><p>There were ancient-dressed soldiers constantly coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Those who entered were missing limbs or severely mutilated, but when they came out, they were completely whole.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that there was something inside the building that could restore them.</p><p></p><p>The specific and detailed secrets, Qi Long did not know.</p><p></p><p>This was already a difficult discovery for him.</p><p></p><p>Even the three-story building was not too deep into the center of the black mist, only at the edge.</p><p></p><p>Normally, this would not be anything worth paying attention to.</p><p></p><p>It was just a newly discovered Deceptive place, or perhaps even an entrance to a Deceptive world.</p><p></p><p>But when he came out of the mist, he had an unexpected harvest.</p><p></p><p>At the time, due to his prolonged fusion with the Deceptive Shadow, he was in a high-pressure period and at risk of collapse and distortion.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, whether it was the black mist's ability to suppress Deceptive powers or the red building's ability, his Deceptive Shadow and Deceptive abilities were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This allowed his collapsing mind to be relieved.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long was overjoyed by this discovery.</p><p></p><p>If the Demonic Lair had this ability, he would no longer fear the danger of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if he conducted a second Deceptive fusion here, would it be much easier?</p><p></p><p>He was eager to experiment, with the goal of obtaining Jia Zhengyi's important puzzle piece, the Deceptive Cloak.</p><p></p><p>He had been in contact with Jia Zhengyi for a long time, but Jia Zhengyi had not agreed to trade with him.</p><p></p><p>Until recently, Jia Zhengyi unexpectedly contacted him first.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long was extremely excited, but to prevent Jia Zhengyi from seeing through his intentions, he had to act rationally.</p><p></p><p>He had a mentality of 'if I get it, I'll be happy; if I don't get the Deceptive Cloak, it's also fine'.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he was desperately craving it.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly taking it would be difficult. The Exorcism Department in Southern City...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi was indeed a true Second-Stage Master.</p><p></p><p>However, his ability, the "Mysterious Heart" of Xu Ruyi, was still a source of great frustration for him. Everything seemed so perfect.</p><p></p><p>Just like six or seven years ago when he had narrowly escaped death to master the Phantom Shadow, he had fortunately reached the peak of the First Stage.</p><p></p><p>At the moment when he was about to lose control, he discovered the Demonic Lair and suppressed the invasion of the Mysterious Essence into his soul.</p><p></p><p>Good news then came - Jia Zhengyi had agreed to make a deal with him.</p><p></p><p>With the Demonic Lair that could suppress the Mysterious Essence, he had become adept at controlling two Mysterious Essences, and it seemed that reaching the Second Stage was a foregone conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>"Alas, he doesn't even know how the Mysterious Essence is suppressed, he just simply explored the periphery of the underground Demonic Lair?" </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang also thought it was a pity that this guy had discovered too little.</p><p></p><p>However, he was content, as this Demonic Lair was of no use to him, but could be of great use to the Mysterious Essence Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if there is a price to pay for suppressing the invasion of the Mysterious Essence?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not quite believe that there was a free lunch when it came to the Mysterious Essence.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Qi Long had unknowingly lost a lot, and he just hadn't noticed it.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Lair is not too far away, I can go and take a look when I have time."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Essence Soldiers, the Suppressing Mysterious Essence Aura, and the Mysterious Essence Buildings were all quite intriguing.</p><p></p><p>But now, what Xuanhuang wanted to do was not these things.</p><p></p><p>"Jia Zhengyi, Jia Zhengyi!"</p><p></p><p>"This guy is still waiting for news, can't let him wait too long, that would be impolite."</p><p></p><p>"It's best to let him reunite with his 'old friend' Qi Long as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not like threats to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>It's better to resolve it as soon as possible, this thing shouldn't be left until the new year.</p><p></p><p>He made a decision.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even go to check on the harvest of eliminating Qi Long.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long's Phantom Shadow had a shadow space where he could store items that existed in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>This ability was not bad, and after Xuanhuang mastered the Phantom Shadow, he discovered a room-sized space filled with Qi Long's belongings.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of things, a collection accumulated over the years.</p><p></p><p>But on the other side.</p><p></p><p>A very low-key small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the several homes of the Deputy Director Jia of the Demonic Department in the Southern City Town.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the martial arts and Tao sects, they would gather and live in a martial arts or Tao sect community.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Essence Cultivators would not.</p><p></p><p>Because in the martial arts and Tao sect communities, there are both immortal and martial practitioners' families.</p><p></p><p>But the Cultivators are a mobile Mysterious Essence, they dare not gather together. Gathering their families together would be like catching them all in one net.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Cultivators have eccentric personalities, and it is very irrational for them to gather together.</p><p></p><p>So each Mysterious Essence Cultivator prefers to live alone, and they do not gather together.</p><p></p><p>"Tick tock, tick tock..."</p><p></p><p>Time kept passing.</p><p></p><p>The waiting Jia Zhengyi was a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>He placed great importance on the assassination of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, he had used his special privileges to suppress the spread of Xuanhuang's martial arts, but he had reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>As the time for Xu Ruyi's return approached, he would no longer be able to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>The three deputy directors of the Demonic Department, one had followed Xu Ruyi to the headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Another was not very friendly, but there was no major enmity either.</p><p></p><p>A fence-sitter deputy director, as he had failed to make progress in recent years, coupled with the long-term invasion of the Mysterious Essence, his personality had also changed a bit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he did not pay much attention to Jia Zhengyi's actions, having an attitude of "after I'm gone, let the flood waters rage on."</p><p></p><p>But there were also many Cultivators at the lower levels who were friendly towards Xuanhuang, just like Xu Ruyi, their thoughts not yet twisted, hoping for the resurgence of humanity.</p><p></p><p>These Cultivators still existed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, too young." Thinking of this, Jia Zhengyi sneered.</p><p></p><p>... (End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the haunted tree in Fulin Community was dealt with, aside from the recently disappeared mysterious alley, there were no other incidents that required Xuanhuang's intervention.</p><p></p><p>Before Xuanhuang achieved his extraordinary accomplishments, the Southern City was already operating, and it could continue to function even without him.</p><p></p><p>The calm performance of the Exorcism Department temporarily relieved the anxious Sun Hui.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, although he was excited by Xuanhuang's powerful abilities, he was also worried that with Vice Director Ru not present, the group led by Jia Zhengyi might scheme and plot.</p><p></p><p>At the routine meeting:</p><p></p><p>"Old High, how is the renovation of Qingyun Mountain going?"</p><p></p><p>Deputy Director High Jian replied, "Director, it will be completed within a week at the latest."</p><p></p><p>"No unexpected issues, I hope?"</p><p></p><p>High Jian shook his head and said, "No unexpected issues. The martial artists in the hall are very enthusiastic. However, the people from the Taoist Hall came to discuss with me, saying they want us to reserve some space for them."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Deputy Director Xia Qing. She said it was the idea of Li Tong and Master Ma, and she didn't hide anything from me. They want to be closer to Master Xuan, to get the advantage of being near the water."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui nodded in understanding and asked, "Can we make space for them?"</p><p></p><p>"Director, Qingyun Mountain is very large, and the tourist area we are renovating is not small. Leaving a little space for the Taoist Hall won't affect us."</p><p></p><p>High Jian continued, "Moreover, Xia Qing said they will expand, and this is just a temporary location for them. After their expansion, they will return the space to the Martial Arts Hall."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui understood and said, "Then you handle it as you see fit. As long as it doesn't affect us, it's fine to provide them with convenience."</p><p></p><p>After all, they have had a good relationship for many years, and the Taoist Hall and Martial Arts Hall have never had conflicts, but have even been allies in many battles.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Director."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui then said, "The second matter, in the next ten days or so, how is the progress on the Heavenly Furnace Visualization Diagram?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the senior martial artists present at the meeting.</p><p></p><p>The deputy director in charge of this matter, Song Hongliang, stood up and said, "Director, according to Master Xuan's new classification, our current martial artists at the Refining Body mid-stage, that is, above the fourth layer of martial disciples, are considered the early stage. The seventh layer is the late stage, and the first three layers are the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>"Currently, our martial artists at the fourth Refining Body layer have the best comprehension of the Visualization Diagram, and some have already reached the stage of condensing the Copper Furnace with three feet, while the slowest ones have at least comprehended one foot of the Heavenly Furnace."</p><p></p><p>"These are not the fastest ones in our hall. The fastest is Jin Ning, who has already comprehended half of the Visualization Diagram and is making rapid progress. He is confident of reaching 90% in half a month. As for fully comprehending the Visualization Diagram, it depends on luck."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Sun Hui understood.</p><p></p><p>He himself had not fallen behind, and would occasionally observe the Visualization Diagram when he had time.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Director was not only due to his personal abilities, but also his powerful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After Xuanhuang's teachings, their system has become more complete.</p><p></p><p>For example, Sun Hui's own cultivation is at the fifth Refining Body layer, just not reaching the extreme limit of the sixth layer like Master Liu.</p><p></p><p>In the past week, aside from comprehending the Visualization Diagram, the members of the Martial Arts Hall have been systematically correcting their previous mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's "Nine Refinements of the Furnace" is too advanced and more complete in its system.</p><p></p><p>For example, the book states that if one's strength reaches 7,000 kilograms, they can attempt to break through to the extraordinary realm, but Xuanhuang does not recommend it. It's better to aim for 9,000 kilograms to have a greater grasp.</p><p></p><p>If one is a genius and doesn't mind spending time, they can even attempt to reach the limit of 10,000, 11,000, or 12,000.</p><p></p><p>The path has been clearly laid out, the rest is up to one's own destiny.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing now is to comprehend the Visualization Diagram. This is the prerequisite for everything. To make physical progress, one's will must keep up.</p><p></p><p>Even if one cannot catch up with the fusion of techniques, they still need to fully comprehend the Visualization Diagram.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, each meeting is not only for handling incidents, but also a way to exchange insights.</p><p></p><p>So Sun Hui asked, "Any insights to share?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The others seemed to be in deep thought after he spoke. He had no choice but to call on someone: "Xiao Jin, you started the earliest and are currently the fastest, so you come and say something."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was a typical case of being the first to get the moon by the water pavilion. He had been contemplating the Observation Diagram for nearly a week longer than the others.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, fellow Daoists, I'll just say it simply."</p><p></p><p>"Since I was lucky, I obtained the Master's bestowal earlier, and I also happened to become the Master's assistant, so I had more opportunities to inquire."</p><p></p><p>"I won't go into my own experience, as I've mentioned it before. I'll just talk about what the Master told me the day before yesterday when I asked him for clarification."</p><p></p><p>This caught the attention of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"The Master said that although we are late starters in the martial arts, the mysterious revival has occurred within a few years, and we are able to achieve the fourth layer of Body Refinement without systematic learning, which means we all have some natural talent in the Dao."</p><p></p><p>"So, comprehending the Observation Diagram is not too difficult. The difficulty lies in the two stages of entering the Divine Concentration Observation Diagram - the initial entry is difficult, and achieving mastery is even more so. As long as we can enter the initial stage, we can quickly reach the later stage, but whether we can perfect it depends on the individual."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Concentration Observation Diagram belongs to the martial arts' static cultivation, which emphasizes the state of mind and insight, focusing on the balance of Jing (essence), Qi (vital energy), and Shen (spirit)."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps our talent lies more in the physical aspect, while our Qi and Shen are a bit lacking. We should try to sit in meditation to regulate our breathing, or take some tonics to supplement our Qi and Shen, and we should see some gains."</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing is to understand ourselves and face ourselves honestly. These aspects are at the two extremes of our previous martial arts cultivation. The Master said that the combination of movement and stillness, the cycle of Yin and Yang, is crucial for any kind of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, fellow Daoists, these are the things the Master told me. I've said what I have to say."</p><p></p><p>The crowd burst into applause, indicating they had gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>The Master's words about the combination of movement and stillness were truly brilliant.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in their martial arts, they had focused on increasing their physical strength and mastering various techniques.</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder they were called crude martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Master's teachings on the combination of movement and stillness, the cycle of Yin and Yang, had opened their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare call them crude martial artists now? They too were about the combination of movement and stillness.</p><p></p><p>It was just that no one had pointed them in the right direction before, and they had taken the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>The key is static cultivation! The coordination of Jing, Qi, and Shen is what they must remember.</p><p></p><p>In their future cultivation, they need to pay attention to these aspects, supplement their Qi where needed, and nourish their Shen.</p><p></p><p>"Good, well said, we have gained a lot. The Master is indeed far-sighted and has clearly pointed out the direction for us."</p><p></p><p>As a staunch supporter of the Master, and having gained a lot himself, Sun Hui said, "Fellow Daoists, the Master has already ground and sifted the teachings for us. If we don't work hard, it would be a waste of the Master's efforts. We can't be like rotten wood that cannot be carved."</p><p></p><p>"We are fortunate to have the Master, but we can't just have one Master. This is not the Master's wish either. The Master wants everyone to become a dragon, for humanity to regain its former glory."</p><p></p><p>"I won't hide it from you, I've received news from the headquarters that the mysterious phenomena occurring in the world are increasing, and their intensity is also growing. The small worlds discovered are the same."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the next critical point is about to arrive, possibly the ten-year period of the mysterious revival."</p><p></p><p>"Previously, we always talked about the fusion of the myriad realms. Now it's becoming a reality. The various cities are being pulled apart, and many small worlds are merging into our blue planet."</p><p></p><p>"The area of the blue planet is constantly expanding, and some technological means have already become ineffective. Now we can still communicate, but that's also thanks to the Master's mysterious network provided by the Dragon Masters at the headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui said solemnly, "All these phenomena indicate that the disaster is still intensifying, and we don't know when it will end. With the cities being pulled apart, in the future, we can only rely on ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, let's work hard."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Division of the Times"</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>[The new era is coming, and there must be a new division, so that we can better guide human progress. The first stage is the mysterious change, the second stage is the penetration of the mystery, the third stage is the profound understanding, and the fourth stage is the true Martial Saint; The first stage of the Immortal Dao is the foundation building, the second stage is the Purple Palace, the third stage is the Golden Elixir, and the fourth stage is the Primordial Spirit Immortal.</p><p></p><p>This is the result of the joint research of our Martial Dao and Immortal Dao cultivators, and it has been confirmed by the Mysterious Master...</p><p></p><p>This represents a great progress of humanity. We have finally ended the chaotic era and ushered in the era of pioneering the extraordinary and forging ahead. </p><p></p><p>The protagonists of this era are you, him, and me... The Martial Dao and Immortal Dao are rejuvenated, with the Mysterious Master as the leader...]</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>"Encounters on Qingyun Mountain":</p><p>[As a Martial Dao disciple, I went to Qingyun Mountain in the south with both expectation and doubt - I don't know if I was a bit hot-headed at the time...</p><p></p><p>But after meeting the Mysterious Master on Qingyun Mountain, I was completely convinced. It was as if I had seen the Martial Ancestor. It is difficult to express my feelings in words, as a 'rude and vulgar martial artist' like me cannot write any magnificent words.</p><p></p><p>I just want to say to my fellow Martial Dao friends who are still hesitating: everything is real. The Mysterious Master has indeed opened up the extraordinary Martial Dao, and has publicly revealed it without reservation. The Mysterious Master's magnanimity is rare, and it is also a blessing for us humans.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in such an era, a talent like the Mysterious Master who can move heaven and earth, with a heart as vast as the sea and spreading the Dao throughout the world, will appear.</p><p></p><p>A single enlightenment has led me to the gate. Now I write these words with great excitement, and I just want to tell my fellow Martial Dao friends: the Martial Dao is on Qingyun Mountain.]</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>"Is This the Reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor?"</p><p>[As a humble Dao practitioner, I was fortunate to have encountered this extraordinary opportunity, and I have gained a lot, which I am delighted to express.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Master on Qingyun Mountain not only opened up the extraordinary Martial Dao, but also the cultivation of Qi and Spirit in the Immortal Dao, creating three laws as if opening up the heavens and the earth, with epoch-making significance.</p><p></p><p>I was lucky to follow the footsteps of the Mysterious Master. The Mysterious Master once said that he hopes to see me again at the high mountains of the great Dao, which is such a beautiful expectation. I have never had great dreams, but now I have been infected by the Mysterious Master, and I have the realization of 'hearing the Dao in the morning and being willing to die in the evening'... Indeed, the era needs pioneers, the era needs heroes.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Master is a hero, and even greater than a hero. Forgive my unrestrained words, even if you kill me, I still feel that the Mysterious Master is the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor, seeing the chaos and strangeness of this world, he has come to enlighten all beings...]</p><p></p><p>——</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the Buddha Descends to the World"</p><p>"The Sage Comes to the World"</p><p>"The Mysterious Master Can Be Called the Martial Ancestor"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"The entire Taoist community congratulates the Mysterious Master on the success of his Fa creation, and also respects the Mysterious Master for spreading the Dao throughout the world..."</p><p>"The entire Buddhist community, with the same heart as Master Xuanzang in seeking the true scriptures, should pray for all beings, relieve suffering and difficulty, and put into practice the teaching of 'if I do not enter hell, who will?', and go to Qingyun Mountain..."</p><p>"As for us Confucian disciples, we should..."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Another new day has arrived.</p><p></p><p>After the relocation of the martial arts school to Qingyun Mountain and the second Dao transmission by the Mysterious Master, which led to enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The online world is boiling.</p><p></p><p>Especially after the efforts of the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist communities, it has formed a situation of overwhelming momentum.</p><p></p><p>According to the Confucian idea, it was originally supposed to be low-key.</p><p></p><p>Don't give the Mysterious Master too much publicity, quietly make arrangements, and then promote it after the situation is established.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the plan has not changed as quickly.</p><p></p><p>Not only the three schools, but also many Spiritual Masters and scattered cultivators have heard the Dao.</p><p></p><p>These people, after discovering that the Mysterious Black and Yellow is real, no longer care about these things, and all kinds of unbelievable posts are flying.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spiritual Masters, some have a friendly attitude, some have sour words, and even add fuel to the fire, not optimistic about the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they are not pessimistic about the Martial Dao and Immortal Dao, but about their own status.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the extraordinary opening of the Immortal and Martial Dao, their status as Spiritual Masters may no longer be unique.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Spiritual Masters who came yesterday were not just curious onlookers who happened to come.</p><p></p><p>There were also many undercover investigators from various major forces.</p><p></p><p>As early as last night, various major forces believed that an incident would break out, but unexpectedly it was calm.</p><p></p><p>These people immediately thought of something, that the old forces of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism had not taken action, and even wanted to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>This made the emerging Spiritual Force unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Since you want to suppress it, I'll expose it.</p><p></p><p>This led to the discussion of the Dao transmission in Qingyun Mountain last night, which erupted today.</p><p></p><p>It was a tactic of the new emerging Spiritual Force.</p><p></p><p>This forced the old forces of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism to join in passively. Since it's like this, they can only go big.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they gave the Mysterious Master strong support, putting up banners like the reincarnation of the Dao Ancestor, Buddha, and Sage.</p><p></p><p>This can somewhat intimidate the new emerging Spiritual Force, and also let everyone see their attitude of supporting the Mysterious Master.</p><p></p><p>Bringing out the Dao Ancestor, Buddha, and Sage is a desperate support.</p><p></p><p>This is the current situation of the strange forum.</p><p></p><p>Of course, different from the praise of the Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist, and Martial communities.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Masters of the new emerging forces have different moods.</p><p></p><p>Some are truly happy, some truly hate it, some are indifferent, and some want to destroy Qingyun Mountain and the Mysterious Black and Yellow.</p><p></p><p>"Are those old guys crazy? What era is this that they are deifying? Don't they know that their era has passed... What Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, what mythical gods and ancestors, where are they when the strange invasion is happening? Why don't we see the gods and ancestors they boast about appearing?"</p><p></p><p>"Well said, it is we Spiritual Masters who risk our lives to save the people in the world. Now that there is a Mysterious Black and Yellow, they feel they are powerful again? I've said before not to sympathize with the weak and ordinary people. They will lift you up when they need you, and abandon you when they don't."</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary people really don't deserve pity. They are all weathervanes. You can say they lack knowledge and are immature... But why do they always use lack of knowledge and immaturity as an excuse, while we strong ones have to sacrifice to prove ourselves?"</p><p></p><p>"The one above is right. The reason is that ordinary people make up the majority, even 99%. Strong ones have always been a minority, so under the absolute advantage, even if ordinary people are wrong, it's just wrong, you can't have 99% die, can you? You can only let the strong ones suffer."</p><p></p><p>"This is unfair..."</p><p></p><p>"You all have gone off topic. Now let's talk about this Mysterious Black and Yellow. I admit he is a legend, but this kind of high-profile publicity, calling him the Dao Ancestor, Buddha, and Sage, is too much, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he just appeared and it's already so outrageous. If this continues, who knows what will happen?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I'm also a Spiritual Master, let me say something. There must be some tricks in it. Such things should have had news yesterday, but they only appeared in full force today. This must be because the Confucian, Taoist, Buddhist, and Martial communities don't want to overly publicize it... But an accident happened, and someone doesn't want him to be low-key."</p><p></p><p>"I agree with the one above. I'm a Spiritual Master and also a Taoist. Fellow Daoists, there's no need to say it so harshly. Can't you see, this is a plot and scheme? Pushing the Master to the forefront, we three old forces, with thousands of years of history, won't be so stupid as to be enemies with all Spiritual Masters. Think carefully about the reason?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Counterattacking by using their own tactics, this is the advantage of the old forces. They have too many disciples and followers infiltrating various industries.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>Self-performance, adding online water army, adding high-profile and desperate support, eliminating most of the misunderstandings.</p><p></p><p>Until the afternoon, the boiling strange forum finally calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>As for Qingyun Mountain...</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Sun, I don't know why the Master has summoned us?" Master Ma asked.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Mysterious Black and Yellow had been cultivating as usual.</p><p></p><p>In terms of his own cultivation, Mysterious Black and Yellow had completely condensed the second heavenly pillar, a 27-meter-high second heavenly pillar standing in the mist of the sea of Qi.</p><p></p><p>One heavenly pillar is higher than the other. </p><p></p><p>To bury the second heavenly pillar, the will needs to stand on the first heavenly pillar and push the second one deeper into the mist of the sea of Qi.</p><p></p><p>Likewise, the third heavenly pillar needs the will to stand on the second pillar and push the third one even deeper.</p><p></p><p>Connecting the earth and heaven's power, each heavenly gate corresponds to three pillars.</p><p></p><p>As long as the three pillars of this stage are completely condensed, and the corresponding will reaches the fourth layer, they can engrave the second heavenly gate, opening the second pole of the four extremes of heaven and earth. Until the four gates correspond to the twelve heavenly pillars, the first stage of the mysterious change of cultivating the will is complete.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mysterious Black and Yellow had opened a heavenly gate, and just completed the condensation of the second heavenly pillar today.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not cultivate the will today, needing to settle down and recover, not rushing to do it in one day.</p><p></p><p>At noon, Mysterious Black and Yellow notified his assistant Sun Tong to summon the previous ten people.</p><p></p><p>These ten people, as expected, will be the ones he often summons in the future.</p><p></p><p>They are all people with great fortune, just like the scattered cultivators Du Ming and Zhao Long.</p><p></p><p>This is something Mysterious Black and Yellow will not misjudge.</p><p></p><p>The poor Li Tong from the South City Taoist Temple has ultimately paid the wrong price.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma became one of the ten, and it seems he was forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Here.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Master Ma's inquiry, Sun Tong also didn't know why the Master had summoned them.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma, senior masters, I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"Wait... Sun disciple, don't call us seniors in the future, we are all students of the Master, just call us Elder Ming Hui."</p><p></p><p>The old monk is quick-witted, not daring to be called senior in front of Mysterious Black and Yellow's people.</p><p></p><p>"And you, Elder Jiu Tong, it's best to just call us Elders, or even just call us by our names directly."</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"What the two of you mean is what I mean too, as a student, how dare I call you seniors in front of the Master, that would be too embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>"Sun Miss, you can just call me Du Ming."</p><p></p><p>"Sun Miss, you can call me Old Zhao."</p><p></p><p>"Sun... that Tong Tong, you can just call me however you like." Sunhui almost slipped and said the wrong thing when he entered the city.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sun, you can call me Elder Wu."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone asking her to change her address, Sun Tong truly felt the proximity to power for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Is this what it means to have no idle people in front of the prime minister? "Okay, fellow Daoists and big brothers."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong went along with it, if she didn't agree, it would seem too affected and not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Sun disciple, do you really not know why the Master has summoned us? Is it because of the forum?"</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>After all, the forum was in an uproar all morning.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they as fellow Daoists and disciples have many online water armies, and various means, so they have slowly calmed it down a bit.</p><p></p><p>But the seeds have been sown, and the Mysterious Master has been completely pushed to the forefront.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be, right? I see the Mysterious Master hasn't been online at all, maybe he doesn't even know what's happening online, and even if he knows, the Mysterious Master probably doesn't care, right?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong hesitated to say, she has a little understanding of Mysterious Black and Yellow.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious Black and Yellow is a pure homebody, and doesn't like to go online at all, just cultivating and researching all day long.</p><p></p><p>If there's nothing going on, he can stay in his room all day without coming out.</p><p></p><p>How strange.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, the emerging Spiritual Force is not well-intentioned, wanting to use the Mysterious Master to attract attention and push us to the forefront. It's shameful to say, we've caused trouble for the Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>The original plan was to be low-key and gather in secret, but the plan didn't change as quickly as the situation.</p><p></p><p>The group arrived at Mysterious Black and Yellow's villa.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A mysterious new building had appeared in the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>A white glowing pagoda, nearly thirty meters tall, emanating a strange fluctuation. </p><p></p><p>But this fluctuation was not purely an evil aura, it had a hint of sanctity.</p><p></p><p>Looking closer, it was not made of stone or steel and concrete, but rather it seemed to be made of white bones.</p><p></p><p>"Come and take a look, this is the White Bone Pagoda I have refined, it belongs to the Dao of Artifact Refining, what do you think?" </p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang saw the crowd arrive and asked them.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was puzzled, this is artifact refining? </p><p></p><p>Such a large artifact? How was it refined, the Dao and Techniques have just been opened up, how did the supporting methods of artifact refining already appear?</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi, what is this?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Hui asked on behalf of the crowd, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This is me refining and transforming the strange thigh bones from the Martial Pavilion, removing their chaotic spirituality, and reforging them into a trial pagoda that can temper the will and train the ability to control, it is also a true Fa Artifact."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang explained in detail, making the crowd smile with delight.</p><p></p><p>This is actually a Fa Artifact? And a trial Fa Artifact that can increase one's foundation?</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"The White Bone Pagoda has nine layers, each corresponding to a level of will refinement. As long as one can endure the pain of the nine layers of bone shattering, and temper their will and train their control in this intense pain, they can explore the breakthrough of extraordinary will... Refining Fa is ultimately too difficult, I observe that you all prioritize Fusion Fa over Refining Fa... But to achieve great accomplishments, Refining Fa is the foundation... Feeling that you all are hesitant in Refining Fa, I have experimentally refined this Pagoda, and it can be considered a success, the path of Fa Artifact Refining has also been opened up."</p><p></p><p>Wow, there's even more shocking news.</p><p></p><p>Not only is it a trial pagoda, but it has also opened up the path of Fa Artifact Refining.</p><p></p><p>"We thank Xuanshi."</p><p></p><p>All words seem pale, there's nothing they can repay, they can only express their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Refining Fa Artifacts is not easy, nor is it simple, in order to conform to reality, I have targeted the strange as the materials. </p><p></p><p>For example, the Pagoda, it is the reshaping of the strange, as long as there are sealed strange things, you can rely on the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace... Afterwards, you can often refine and cultivate it, making it connected to your own will, catalyzing a controllable Fa Artifact Spirit...</p><p></p><p>To activate the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace to refine artifacts, you can use your own vital energy, spiritual energy, and divine soul... Or you can use other kindling.</p><p></p><p>In short, it's not simple, your cultivation, if you want to refine Fa Artifacts, you need to prepare enough kindling, this point needs to be noted... Don't be unprepared, causing the kindling to be insufficient, and the strange things not being refined, being activated instead, that would not be good..."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang mentioned the precautions.</p><p></p><p>He will not use his own vital energy to refine artifacts for others, whoever wants to refine artifacts needs to prepare their own materials.</p><p></p><p>So, he told everyone the precautions.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd thought, isn't this as it should be? Of course they should prepare the strange materials, prepare the 'kindling', do they expect Xuanshi to refine it for them? Do they have no shame?</p><p></p><p>The food has been fed to their mouths, what else do they want?</p><p></p><p>So after Xuanhuang finished speaking, the Dao Pavilion's Ma Daozhang, Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist trio were delighted.</p><p></p><p>They have sealed strange things, especially the Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist trio have many, as the saying goes, they have many disciples.</p><p></p><p>In this way, as long as they prepare the 'kindling', they can start the furnace and refine artifacts?</p><p></p><p>Fa Artifacts!</p><p></p><p>Such a longed-for treasure.</p><p></p><p>"If any of you have discovered and collected strange flame-type things, you can also bring them for trade, and I will personally refine a Fa Artifact for you."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang added a sentence, it's better to collect together than for him to collect alone.</p><p></p><p>However, the crowd did not think so.</p><p></p><p>They thought: what trade, if there is any, they will all give it to Xuanshi, they want to make contributions.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist trio.</p><p></p><p>Due to their large influence, they have already started to think about the strange flames that Xuanshi mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The most famous strange flame is the Abyssal Hellfire Domain, one of the six A-rank strange things.</p><p></p><p>But this, if you don't know, it's fine, no one can guarantee that they can go to the Abyssal Hellfire Domain and obtain the flame.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Hellfire, no matter how you look at it, is not suitable as the flame source for the furnace of artifact refining.</p><p></p><p>As for the Martial Pavilion, it seems a bit difficult, it seems they have already given the three strange things they had to Xuanshi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they don't feel they have lost, how can they not think about the benefits Xuanshi has given to the Martial Pavilion? One cannot only look at the input and not the return.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all just need to pay attention to these, let's talk about talismans."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang interrupted the crowd's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>In his hand appeared a book shining with divine light, which was the "Talisman Dao Sutra".</p><p></p><p>"This is according to my deduction, 365 talisman inscriptions that can be used, within the stable Heavenly Mechanism of the Tong Tian Building, they can be drawn. However, unless your vital energy is extraordinary, ordinary martial artists cannot use vital energy as the spiritual medium, Qi Refiners and Spirit Refiners can guide spiritual energy and divine soul to draw talismans."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he looked at Ma Daozhang, Jiu Tong Daoist, Ming Hui Monk, and Yan Lai, etc.: "You can gather your disciples and fellow Dao companions to experiment a bit, the first 120 talismans can be refined without reaching the extraordinary; the middle 120 require Xuan Bian Realm cultivation to refine; the last 120 require Tong Xuan Realm cultivation to refine, and the final 5 can only be drawn by those in the Dong Xuan Realm."</p><p></p><p>"You all take it and research it, the refining materials are the leaves of the Tong Tian Building, you need to provide them... In any case, it's an equal exchange, if you want to refine talismans, go and exchange with the Tong Tian Building, as for the brushes and ink, you can figure it out yourself, that's not difficult, just imbue them with spiritual energy or divine soul."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, everyone has already gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>The refining of artifacts and treasures has been taken care of, the refining of elixirs and medicines has also been taken care of, the refining of talismans does not seem to be a problem for the Master either.</p><p></p><p>To be shocked again would be truly unbearable, they would lose their composure.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Xuanshi."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded again, and Xuanhuang handed the "Talisman Dao Sutra" to the more suitable Jiu Tong Daozhang.</p><p></p><p>Daoists are more adept at these things.</p><p></p><p>"How's your progress in comprehending the Visualization Diagrams, have you successfully transformed?"</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the matters of talismans and artifact refining, Xuanhuang asked about their cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi, we have already transformed successfully, we just need to stabilize for a few days and then we can continue to comprehend the corresponding Visualization Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>Jiu Tong, as the representative, answered.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xuanhuang asked them, not the martial artists, the martial artists do not need to transform.</p><p></p><p>"Good, in the coming year, I will lecture twice a month, on the 1st and 15th, the 1st will be on Immortal Dao, the 15th will be on Martial Dao, and if you have any doubts, you can ask me then."</p><p></p><p>In the beginning of the teaching, it is still necessary to lay the foundation, and also to resolve their doubts.</p><p></p><p>After a period of time, when his disciples have grown, he can free himself.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he will only lecture the higher-level directions for those with higher cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And the basics, he will let them pass on themselves.</p><p></p><p>After the group had no further questions, they left with the "Talisman Dao Sutra" and the miniaturized White Bone Pagoda that was less than 30 centimeters tall.</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Pagoda will be placed near the Qing Yun Mountain Square, and those who need to temper their will can provide the Pagoda with resources, energy or points, and recite the incantation to enter the corresponding level of trial.</p><p></p><p>So, when the Pagoda reappeared on the square, now 27 meters tall, the crowd gathered around the square excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Although only a day had passed since the previous lecture, there were still endless cultivators rushing in from afar.</p><p></p><p>They had missed the crucial lecture the day before, which was a pity.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Martial Pavilion's Sun Hui or the Dao Pavilion's Li Tong, after a simple assessment of the arriving cultivators, they gave them a pass.</p><p></p><p>This pass represents that they can move around Qing Yun Mountain, and can also comprehend the corresponding Visualization Diagram through contributing points.</p><p></p><p>This is a rough plan formulated by the Dao Pavilion and Martial Pavilion in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>It still needs to be gradually improved.</p><p></p><p>There are only three Visualization Diagrams, and everyone wants to comprehend and learn, so necessary contributions are indispensable.</p><p></p><p>As long as there is the corresponding contribution, one can enter the secret room to comprehend the corresponding Visualization Diagram, and the contribution can also obtain the three methods created by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Furnace Nine Refinement Method", "Tong Tian Building Restoration Method", "Gui Xu Nine Seal Method", these three refinement methods correspond to the three Visualization Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>In fact, cultivators only need to comprehend the Visualization Diagrams, they can learn the refinement methods they had before.</p><p></p><p>For example, in Martial Dao, one does not need to learn the "Furnace Nine Refinement" of the 12,000 Gigantic Strength Limit, they can refine their own 7,000 Gigantic Strength.</p><p></p><p>But no one does this, with the top-tier methods corresponding to the Visualization Diagrams, who would still refine the previous 7,000 pounds limit?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is about refinement methods.</p><p></p><p>For Fusion Fa, one must correspond to the "Furnace Nine Refinement Method", "Tong Tian Building Restoration Method", and "Gui Xu Nine Seal Method".</p><p></p><p>So for a time, Luoyang was in short supply.</p><p></p><p>On Qing Yun Mountain, points have become the most precious thing at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As long as you have points, you can comprehend the Visualization Diagrams, you can obtain the corresponding three methods, and now you can even enter the Pagoda to temper your will and train your control.</p><p></p><p>Even Jiu Tong, after Sun Hui explained the White Bone Pagoda, also mentioned the notice of talisman refining and Fa Artifact refining, which also require points.</p><p></p><p>What are points? Points are various elixir energies, various sealed strange things, various spiritual medicines, various hidden intelligence, various beast and fierce beast corpses and blood, as well as various tasks assigned by Qing Yun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Points, points...</p><p></p><p>This is the common cry in the hearts of all the cultivators on Qing Yun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Points are related to the Dao path, it's just that simple.</p><p></p><p>They even heard that since more and more people are coming to Qing Yun Mountain, in the future, staying on Qing Yun Mountain will also require points.</p><p></p><p>This makes people dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>But this is also a practical problem, with more and more people, it is impossible to grow indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>There can only be a points exchange system.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I saw you just went to the points exchange counter to exchange points, can you lend me a bit, I will return it to you, as long as I comprehend the "Tong Tian Building Visualization Diagram", I will rise quickly, and I will not forget you then."</p><p></p><p>A person said to a young man who had just come out of the exchange counter.</p><p></p><p>"Scram! Do you think I'm a child? Even if I comprehend the Visualization Diagram and rise quickly, do I need your help to comprehend and rise on my own? Do I still need you?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>No trust, no standing.</p><p></p><p>After the points system was established, it is actually not beneficial to the Confucian-Daoist-Buddhist trio, including Du Ming and Zhao Long, and the crowd of the Martial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After all, their learning also requires points now.</p><p></p><p>But they are ultimately people of great fortune, and they are also people with thoughts.</p><p></p><p>They know that they must set an example themselves, and cannot forget themselves because of Xuanshi's favor.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, these ten people also need to contribute points in order to enter the secret room to comprehend the Visualization Diagrams.</p><p></p><p>If you formulate the plan yourself, but you don't follow it, others will even less likely follow it.</p><p></p><p>However, points are currently severely lacking, everything is just beginning, not yet in the normal stage.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the lack of points, Sun Hui and others are formulating plans.</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's instructions, to hunt fierce beasts, to guard strange points, to deploy the development of blood pool secret realms... as well as to gather volunteers to participate in the exploration mission to the Blood Moon Small World.</p><p></p><p>Only when the points start rolling in can it work.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>PS: Two updates, 13,000 words, please subscribe and support, thank you.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

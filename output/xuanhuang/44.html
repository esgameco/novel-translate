        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you let this crude and violent man rise up, do you not think about whether the Spiritual Masters can still maintain their status and treatment? It's truly a rotten wood that cannot be carved."</p><p></p><p>Shameless people will not admit that they are shameless. </p><p></p><p>Instead, they will feel that everything they do is for your own good, for the greater good.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Xuanhuang could have been immortal, but who told you to be so powerful that you were able to resolve the Bizarre Corpse Tree, which even I am wary of?"</p><p></p><p>"To display such ability just at the start, if you were to grow further, it would not be simple. I can only be at ease when you are dead."</p><p></p><p>This was the important basis for his decisive action.</p><p></p><p>He initially just wanted to probe Xuanhuang, but Xuanhuang's performance truly shocked him.</p><p></p><p>Resolving the Bizarre Corpse Tree so thoroughly, keeping such an enemy alive would not let him sleep at night.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it didn't have to be this way, as he hadn't committed a major mistake.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang actually didn't mind, but Jia Zhengyi didn't think so.</p><p></p><p>He believed that by causing Xuanhuang some trouble, by probing him, it was a matter of life and death.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that his twisted personality made him act in a twisted manner all the way through.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover..."</p><p></p><p>He let out a gloomy smile: "I am not the Evil Department Director of South City, I am the Patriarch of the mighty 'Demon Worshipper' sect. Killing those who obstruct the arrival of the Bizarre is simply my duty."</p><p></p><p>This was his secret.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Worshipper sect is an organization of the bizarre established abroad.</p><p></p><p>It is an evil organization that worships the arrival of the bizarre as salvation, and believes one should not resist, but strive to integrate.</p><p></p><p>As for the sacrifices in the process of integration, they are just a small price to pay.</p><p></p><p>After all, with god-like abilities, what does it matter if a few people die? Their death is an honor.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Worshipper sect is a very large organization, rumored to have a Patriarch and two Vice-Patriarchs who are all Third-Realm Bizarre Masters.</p><p></p><p>Under the Patriarch, there are Twelve Patriarchs, all of whom are Second-Realm existences.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be a huge organization that even a country dares not offend too much, extremely crazy.</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi is one of these Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say that his identity in South City is just one of the puppets of the Patriarch of the Demonic Puppet Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Demonic Puppet Hall is an extremely dangerous and troublesome figure among the Demon Worshippers.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the bizarre ability to replace people with puppets, his true self is unknown, but his replacement puppets are quite famous.</p><p></p><p>They are almost unkillable, even if you mobilize a huge force to besiege and kill them, it is only one of his replacement puppets.</p><p></p><p>And due to the strength of the true self, Third-Realm and below Spiritual Masters cannot even tell if it is the real person or a puppet.</p><p></p><p>Even Third-Realm Spiritual Masters need to have the ability to detect in order to discover the truth.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they are extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Xia Country is so conservative, there is no birth of advanced thoughts."</p><p></p><p>"Before the arrival of the bizarre, it was like this, and even after the arrival of the bizarre, it is still conservative."</p><p></p><p>"The advanced thoughts abroad have already stated clearly, the bizarre is an unstoppable rule, do not try to resist it, but to adapt and integrate with it, just doing some ridiculous acts of trying to defy heaven and change fate, thinking that 'man can triumph over nature' is laughable."</p><p></p><p>"Relying on a few myths, what 'Peng Lai filling the sea', what 'Kuafu chasing the sun', what 'Foolish Old Man Removing the Mountains', 'Yu the Great Controlling the Floods', these imaginations to support, too conservative."</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, man can triumph over nature? Bullshit."</p><p></p><p>"Just not learning advanced thoughts, ordinary useless people die, so be it. What's the use of protecting, protecting, protecting the weak? What can the weak do?"</p><p></p><p>"And the dog shit-like idea of guarding the way for those with hope, escorting them and letting them grow up."</p><p></p><p>"If Xuanhuang was born in a place with advanced thoughts, would I have to go through the trouble of assassinating him? I could just directly kill him, what's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Those who have the hope to replace me, should I not eliminate them as soon as possible? Still thinking about letting them grow up to be a support, what a laughable idea."</p><p></p><p>"If they grow up, will they still remember what you've done for them?"</p><p></p><p>"This country is done, there's no hope."</p><p></p><p>"If this matter cannot be accomplished, killing Xuanhuang will not be enough to satisfy my resentment."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There are too many people... I'll just have to give up this identity and get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Jia Zhengyi felt a bit relieved.</p><p></p><p>At worst, if Xuanhuang died, Xu Ruyi might come looking for trouble, but he could just slip away.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity to lose this identity."</p><p></p><p>"This antiquated country still has some extraordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Yue Dragon Master? A third-tier Deceptive Network Manipulator, someone the Sect Leader is very eager to obtain. And what about the three Wonders at the Headquarters - the Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian?"</p><p></p><p>"How did these three old fellows become so powerful, yet not lose control?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even had a chance to get close to them yet."</p><p></p><p>This was one of Jia Zhengyi's hidden objectives.</p><p></p><p>"This place is just full of unbelievable people, it's uncanny."</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi shook his head, thoroughly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he detected something unusual.</p><p></p><p>His shadow suddenly expanded, and a massive force assaulted him, causing his body to become sluggish against his will.</p><p></p><p>Then the shadow rapidly grew taller, taking on the form of a giant tree.</p><p></p><p>The tree roots quickly entwined him.</p><p></p><p>"No, you're not Qi Long, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>In his panic, he activated his Substitute Puppet ability - the tree roots entwining his legs quickly withered, turning into a cloth puppet's cotton legs. But after breaking free, the legs mysteriously reappeared, fully intact.</p><p></p><p>This ability was truly powerful, not only allowing substitution, but also rapid replacement of his body's limbs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no one respond, a sense of crisis swept over Jia Zhengyi, and he unhesitatingly fled at top speed.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he seemed to have run into an invisible wall.</p><p></p><p>That's when he realized he was completely isolated within a radius of several meters.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang?"</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>He thought of something, but the more he thought about it, the more shocked he became. If it really was Xuanhuang, how did he acquire the Deceptive Shadow ability? It was impossible that he had simply killed Qi Long and immediately mastered the Deceptive Shadow.</p><p></p><p>If this was true, it was truly terrifying. Who could so effortlessly fuse with the Deceptive, when it was a matter of life and death for most to do so?</p><p></p><p>Yes, he was absolutely right. But Xuanhuang did not fuse with the Deceptive - he directly enslaved and replaced it.</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi couldn't understand this.</p><p></p><p>For an opponent like this, Xuanhuang wouldn't even bother talking, he would just directly eliminate him, as that was the purpose of this trip, not to waste time chatting.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang remained silent, and Jia Zhengyi couldn't see where he was, only the abilities inherent to Xuanhuang appearing one after another.</p><p></p><p>Trapped as he was, Jia Zhengyi suddenly felt his life force ebbing away. Even more terrifying was that it wasn't just the life force of this puppet body, but also his hidden true self.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was being drained across the boundaries of time and space, just like his old friend Qi Long - the first time he had encountered something more sinister than himself.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Jia Zhengyi made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang, I underestimated you. I thought the old man was attentive enough, but your abilities have exceeded my control. You are a truly terrifying young man."</p><p></p><p>"But we will meet again. Be prepared for endless assassination attempts."</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>As Jia Zhengyi finished speaking, his body began to twist and distort, until it no longer resembled a human, leaving only a blood-soaked, eerie puppet.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"He ran away? A Substitute Puppet?"</p><p></p><p>"This guy is a second-tier?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang instantly materialized, picking up the fallen puppet to examine it.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, this person was actually a second-tier Deceptive Manipulator? "That shouldn't be, if he's second-tier, why hide it? Could he have some secret?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Substitute Puppet. Qi Long's memories indicate it's the ability of the Demonic Disciple Twelfth Patriarch, the Puppet Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Could this guy be one of the Puppet Patriarch's puppet bodies?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang seemed to have understood something.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

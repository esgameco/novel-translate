        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now that he had Xu Ruyi's affirmation, Xuanhuang was finally certain.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Anomaly had been fused, even if one later regretted not being able to control it, it would still die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>If the Anomaly was abandoned, the abandoned Anomaly, due to its resonance with the Spiritualist's magnetic field, would put the original host as the top priority to be eliminated, even more so than violating the Anomaly's rules.</p><p></p><p>If the Anomaly was abandoned and then sealed, the sealed Anomaly would not act.</p><p></p><p>However, other Anomalies would see the original host as "monk's flesh" due to their resonance with the Anomaly's rules, and they would completely devour and assimilate him until he was thoroughly consumed.</p><p></p><p>These were the two "must die" scenarios that Xu Ruyi mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xuanhuang ask this, Xu Ruyi uncertainly asked, "Could the Master have a way to erase this kind of rule?"</p><p></p><p>He asked with hope.</p><p></p><p>"I can't guarantee, but we can try," Xuanhuang replied.</p><p></p><p>"Master, could you explain in detail," Xu Ruyi requested.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang responded, "Just as I mentioned earlier about the Jianmu and the White Bone Treasure Pagoda, due to my extraordinary willpower, I can completely erase the chaotic and distorted consciousness of the Anomaly, allowing it to return to the original starting point of the rule fragments. At this stage, the Anomaly has not yet absorbed the resentment of heaven and earth and the turbidity... Even if what Director Xu said about resonating with the Spiritualist, it would still be pure."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Xu Ruyi largely understood.</p><p></p><p>"The abandoned Anomaly goes to find the Spiritualist who abandoned it first because the two have resonated and fused with each other, so it can be compared to the Anomaly's other half. The Anomaly is born due to the resentment of heaven and earth and the turbidity bestowing consciousness, so it is distorted and bloody... Master's meaning is that you can erase its distorted and turbid consciousness, so there would no longer be the fatal factor of the Anomaly's distorted consciousness, and it would only be a rule fragment, thus avoiding the entanglement with the Spiritualist?"</p><p></p><p>"That's the general idea," Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Deputy Director Gao Xiaolan was excited after hearing this. She said, "In that case, as long as the Anomaly that one doesn't want to continue fusing with is handed over to you, Master, you can erase its distorted and turbid consciousness, and the previous Spiritualist will be completely liberated?"</p><p></p><p>Despite Gao Xiaolan's outstanding temperament and charming mature woman image, her code name was "Anomaly Curse Gao Xiaolan."</p><p></p><p>The Anomalies she controlled were very special, being Curse-type Anomalies. As long as she cursed a person or object, anyone weaker than her would be annihilated by her cursing ability.</p><p></p><p>But the price was extremely high - the curse caused her body to gradually rot. For a woman, this was equivalent to a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she held a high position, being the Deputy Director of the Occult Department in Nanshi Town, so she could exchange expensive divine blood to compensate for it. But this Anomaly thing was not something a normal person could accept, as the permeating stench of decay could not be concealed.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, she dared not see her family. It was not that her family was disgusted with her, but she was afraid of her family discovering her abnormality and being terrified.</p><p></p><p>If she could really abandon the Anomaly without suffering retaliation, Gao Xiaolan wanted to try it. But she also had concerns, knowing her own situation. Her body had already been riddled with holes and rotted many times. Even if the divine blood could compensate and restore her, she didn't know if her body would be able to withstand it after abandoning the Curse Anomaly, and she might just collapse at that moment.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the Anomaly was constantly changing the Spiritualist's body. Some Spiritualists were even more tragic, their entire bodies already withered and rotted, with even their internal organs empty, yet they could still live due to the Anomaly's fusion ability, only maintaining their consciousness. For these Spiritualists, it was already too late to abandon it, and they could only walk the path to the end, continuing to find the same source puzzle pieces, seeing if they would eventually be completely fused with the Anomaly, or if they would become a chaotic consciousness remnant consumed by the Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gao Xiaolan's inquiry, Xuanhuang said, "You could say that. As for the second situation of becoming an Anomaly-body constitution, it's also simple - learn my technique, strengthen your willpower or vital energy, and change the previous body field, then you can avoid the drawbacks of the Anomaly-body constitution."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said, "Of course, what I've said is all speculation, as I haven't personally tried it or had any Spiritualists come to me for modification... But I'm very confident."</p><p></p><p>After he finished speaking, the scene fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>This thing requires the Spiritualist to abandon it themselves. If the Spiritualist is unwilling, Xuanhuang can't do anything.</p><p></p><p>Some people hate fusing with Anomalies, but some people like it, as it represents extraordinary abilities. Over the years, a system has even formed from top to bottom, with various countries accepting people with this special quality to undergo the dangerous Anomaly fusion.</p><p></p><p>Before there were other means to counter the Anomalies, this was the best approach.</p><p></p><p>To suddenly say that fusing with Anomalies is an evil path and that one should immediately change course? That would go against all Spiritualists.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang only proposed: - to provide an opportunity for those who don't want to become Spiritualist Anomaly Masters to regret it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your research on Spiritualists. If there are people who regret becoming Spiritualist Anomaly Masters... I won't guarantee other places, but I will personally recommend them to come to the Occult Department in Nanshi Town," Xu Ruyi first expressed his gratitude, intending to stop this topic.</p><p></p><p>Ever since conversing with Xuanhuang, the surprises Xuanhuang had given him were too many, but he hadn't forgotten the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>"Conversing with the Master has been greatly beneficial. Just now, what the Master said was of utmost importance to us. I express my gratitude to the Master here. But..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi's tone changed as he continued, "Distant water cannot extinguish a nearby fire. This time I came, the current tense situation is still the main issue. Yesterday I briefly mentioned it to the Master, but the Master may not be fully aware, so let me explain it in detail."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang responded seriously, "Please go on."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I won't hide from you that previously I went to the provincial headquarters and the capital headquarters to seek aid, the reason being that Nanshi Town is currently being surrounded by a group of powerful Anomalies."</p><p></p><p>He continued, "Unfortunately, the provincial headquarters, due to the Third-Order Anomaly Gate incident, has lost nearly 70% of its experts, so they rejected our request for aid. I had no choice but to go to the capital headquarters, and it was during this time that the Jia Zhengyi incident occurred."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang listened, nodding continuously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi went on, "Regrettably, the capital headquarters was also not ideal. Various places are experiencing a new round of powerful Anomaly resurgence, and the capital headquarters cannot spare any manpower to help us, so we have to resolve it ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood the course of events and asked, "Director Xu, could you please elaborate on the specific Anomalies?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Ruyi nodded and asked Gao Xiaolan to report.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan took out a file and said, "Master, currently the Occult Department in our Nanshi Town is managing and controlling 27 Anomalies. Many of them were quickly dealt with after being discovered, some are being specially monitored to prevent triggering their rules; the dangerous ones that have formed killing rules, we have to make great sacrifices to seal them..."</p><p></p><p>"As for the ones that are difficult to seal, the earth-binding Anomalies, we can only dispatch people to guard them, like the blood pool that the Master previously watched over."</p><p></p><p>"With the above, although it's arduous, we can still barely cope."</p><p></p><p>"But the following ones are what we cannot handle, and the reason we sought aid."</p><p></p><p>"The Anomaly Bus, a Second-Order Anomaly, can transport Anomalies through space. Each station it sets up is either a special Anomaly danger zone or has Anomalies rampaging in the city from the bus."</p><p></p><p>"The Second-Order Anomaly Alley, confirmed to be Second-Order, it can appear unnoticed and replace any alley in the city. Once you enter, the killing rule is hard to escape, and every killed person becomes its building material, a blood brick."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One Second-Order Anomaly after another was listed, and Xuanhuang felt they were extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Print Anomaly, Second-Order..."</p><p>"The Head Anomaly, Second-Order, the trigger rule may be as simple as a head movement..."</p><p>"The Anomaly Tomb, a top-tier Second-Order Anomaly, the dead are...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Control, the grave will become a special domain, and once you enter, you will be buried..."</p><p></p><p>"And the terrifying third-tier bizarre, the Bizarre Gate. It traverses time and space, transforming into myriad forms, perhaps opening an ordinary door, but upon entering, it is already a bizarre world..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What does Minister Xu want me to do?"</p><p></p><p>After hearing about the current dire situation in South City, Xuanhuang did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that after Xuan Shifu created the extraordinary martial arts, I had an idea, hoping that Xuan Shifu could solve the immovable bizarre things we are temporarily controlling and guarding, as well as the bizarre things that have not yet triggered the killing rules."</p><p></p><p>He continued: "Xuan Shifu knows that every time we use the bizarre power, we are advancing towards death. Using it once represents being further invaded by the bizarre, so many bizarre things that we can completely seal, we haven't used the power to seal."<div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>This is the drawback of the Spirit Masters, using the bizarre to fight the bizarre, the cost is the consumption of one's own.</p><p></p><p>So many bizarre things that have not formed a disaster, the Exorcism Department will seal them up, rather than solve them themselves.</p><p></p><p>This has led to the discovery of too many, which will disperse the personnel, after all, they all need to be guarded.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang is different, he is extraordinary in himself, and he can fully recover after resting.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang agreed, this is something he can do, and he also likes to do it.</p><p></p><p>As long as it does not exceed his own extraordinary Xuanbian level, whether it is the peak of the first tier or the initial stage, it is an easy situation for Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how can he be called the undefeated of the first tier?</p><p></p><p>"How many are there?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan said, "We are guarding twelve, eight are sealed, and the others are those we know the triggering rules, and we can trigger the medium to attract them by completing some rituals."</p><p></p><p>"How many are second-tier?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xiaolan said, "Among the twelve we are guarding, two are second-tier, one is a Bizarre Tower and the other is a Muddy Path, the rest are first-tier; the sealed ones are all first-tier, and there is one confirmed second-tier that needs a medium to trigger, and there is one suspected to be second-tier, but not confirmed, the rest are all first-tier, please take a look at the information."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took the information and looked through it.</p><p></p><p>In total, there were twenty-seven recorded, which is a terrifying number, not all of them, but the ones that have been active recently.</p><p></p><p>This is just one city, and they have discovered this many. </p><p></p><p>What about outside the city? What about the ones that haven't been discovered?</p><p></p><p>Among the clearly marked second-tier ones, there are the Bizarre Tower, the Bizarre Path, and the Bizarre Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>The Bizarre Tower is a dangerous tower in the suburbs, and each room inside is a maze, like hell, with a gruesome murder scene in each room. </p><p></p><p>Since it is immovable, as long as you don't enter, it's still relatively stable, so apart from the initial hundred residents of one tower being killed, the Exorcism Department has also lost two Spirit Masters and more than twenty previous investigation personnel and government soldiers.</p><p></p><p>The Bizarre Path is a muddy small road, a road in an abandoned park, once you enter, you will be swallowed, like a swamp, and there will also be mud people bizarre things appearing.</p><p></p><p>As for the Bizarre Butterfly, it is a summoning type, like the Pen Immortal, as long as you perform a specific ritual, use your own middle finger's blood to simply draw a butterfly pattern, and recite: "Butterfly immortal, butterfly immortal, reunited in dreams," it will summon the Bizarre Butterfly into your dreams.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuanhuang hesitated for a while.</p><p></p><p>This is the second dream-type bizarre thing he has encountered, and his own Bizarre Dream Brush has not been used yet.</p><p></p><p>The rest, except for the suspected second-tier bizarre 'Mirror Person', are all first-tier bizarre things.</p><p></p><p>The summoning ritual types are not unique to South City, these summoning ritual types have appeared in many cities.</p><p></p><p>As long as someone is foolish enough, they will appear.</p><p></p><p>"I will take care of all these first-tier bizarre things in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang finished reading and said a sentence that shocked them again.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan Shifu? I don't quite understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "That's exactly what I mean, I will temporarily handle all these first-tier ones, starting tonight."</p><p></p><p>Since he's free, he might as well do it. The arrangements he had made have been handed over to Sun Hui and the others.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui and the others are currently processing the path to the Blood Pool Secret Realm, which will be a source of resources in the future.</p><p></p><p>The path to the Blood Moon Secret Realm is also being opened, after all, after making contact, that vast world needs to be connected by roads.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang plans to deal with these first, and incidentally accumulate some private collections.</p><p></p><p>Bizarre things are all treasures, and in his hands, they can all be turned from waste to treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even if they can't, he can let his four foolish disciples devour and fuse them.</p><p></p><p>If these nearly twenty bizarre things are all thoroughly ground down, Jianmu, Xukong Knife, and the Furnace, they might all reach the peak of the first tier.</p><p></p><p>They might even be much faster than their master Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Also, after Minister Xu goes back, he can tell the Spirit Masters in the department that there are soothing spirit stones here that can alleviate the invasion of the bizarre, they can be exchanged for bizarre things, and even if they don't have any, they can still queue up. In addition, my Qingyun Mountain collects various bizarre things and bizarre information, we can provide talisman, alleviate invasion, and seal bizarre services."</p><p></p><p>Using the soothing spirit stones to alleviate the invasion, naturally it's free for the good people, but for those previous Minister Jia's people, they need to queue up.</p><p></p><p>As for when it's their turn, it depends on your 'queue-jumping money'.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xuanhuang's series of plans and 'business solicitation', Xu Ruyi and the others left satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang will start acting tonight.</p><p></p><p>As long as Xuanhuang says he will do it, it will greatly alleviate their personnel pressure and also solve new problems.</p><p></p><p>The more problems that accumulate, the more they appear, and now there is a cleaner-upper, they are very happy, not to mention their previous gains.</p><p></p><p>As for Xuanhuang's 'queuing up' to alleviate the invasion, they understood it, but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>After all, you previously plotted against them, and they didn't kill you, which was already a favor.</p><p></p><p>And they still want him to alleviate the bizarre invasion for free, where does such a good thing exist.</p><p></p><p>As for why Xuanhuang didn't retaliate against those people, the reason is very simple, he has no time.</p><p></p><p>His schedule is full every day, how can he have time to bother a few underlings, as long as he solves the culprit Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>He almost forgot about Wei Zixuan.</p><p></p><p>Maybe if he thinks about it one day, he'll go collect the debt, if he doesn't think about it, he'll just let it go.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the Exorcism Department people left, Xuanhuang summoned Sun Hui and issued the "Bizarre Elimination Task".</p><p></p><p>It's to guard the scene and maintain order, not to ask them to deal with the bizarre things.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there is no one in Qingyun Mountain who can do it, so it's just to let them train along.</p><p></p><p>After giving the order, Xuanhuang carefully reviewed Gao Xiaolan's information.</p><p></p><p>"Bizarre Clock, Bizarre Toilet, Bizarre Knife, Bizarre Crow, ah, the Scarecrow Watchman of the Wheat Field, the Flower Primary School, the Longevity Clothing Store..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the various bizarre things, he excluded a few at the end.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang plans to go check out the Bizarre Clock first.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a time-type bizarre thing? Or something else?"</p><p></p><p>According to the description, it's an ordinary hotel room, but after entering a specific room, the clock hanging on the north wall, as long as it ticks, it will transform the time and space, turning it into a loop of a murder case.</p><p></p><p>There will be an hour of lost time and space, to survive and get out, one needs to live through an hour of being hunted, otherwise, they will be killed in this forgotten time and space.</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be a fixed time slice that keeps looping, and once you enter the room, you will be passively brought into the looping time, and during this period, you will be hunted by the bizarre things in this forgotten space?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was interested in this, following his hobbies, he'll go solve this one first.</p><p></p><p>"If it's really time reversal, it would be interesting, but with only one room looping, it doesn't seem too strong."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was thinking of time reversal, but this clock looks very different.</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

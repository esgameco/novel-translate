        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That means one pill can be used as firewood to burn for 20 minutes, and with another pill, I can forge my will to the second layer."</p><p></p><p>"As a warrior, I was given a bottle of ten pills, and I was given another bottle when I came to guard this place, so now there are 17 pills left, which is 540 minutes, or nine hours."</p><p></p><p>"If it takes two hours to refine one layer, can these 17 pills allow me to break through to the fourth layer?"</p><p></p><p>"But I also need to replenish my blood, and the difficulty may increase as the layers increase. Conservatively, I can reach the third layer of will refinement."</p><p></p><p>On the app, the supreme elixir costs 50,000 per bottle, and Xuanhuang has 3 million in savings, so he plans to buy 20 bottles first.</p><p></p><p>"20 bottles, 200 pills, that should be enough to refine my will to the ninth layer, or even enter the realm of the extraordinary, and also bring my body to the ninth layer."</p><p></p><p>The supreme elixir can only be purchased by warriors, while ordinary disciples can only buy the lesser elixirs.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this world is not lacking in elixirs.</p><p></p><p>This world is not a world where the path to advancement is simply taking drugs.</p><p></p><p>When martial artists reach a certain level, they even need to control their enhancement.</p><p></p><p>If they accidentally break through, they would lose control.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they don't dare to say there are many elixirs, but there are definitely not few.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xuanhuang placed an order, and tomorrow he will have Jin Ning bring it over.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang prefers to use fierce beasts as fuel, as elixirs are convenient but not as good as fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>After all, he can also refine his own "Returning to the Abyss Technique" and "Heaven and Earth Technique".</p><p></p><p>Three techniques, three visualization diagrams.</p><p></p><p>The visualization diagram for the "Smelting Furnace Technique" is a three-legged bronze cauldron, the "Returning to the Abyss Technique" is a black and white grinding mill, and the "Heaven and Earth Technique" that Xuanhuang refers to is the diagram of the World Tree reaching to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth have both form and formlessness, and the ancient World Tree connected heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Starting with the vastness of heaven and earth is not very good for comprehension, so it's better to sketch the diagram of the World Tree reaching to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>From the formless to the formed, refining the will is like this, and refining artifacts is the same.</p><p></p><p>First have the intent, then have the tool, this is a way of nurturing spiritual treasures.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's small world, as the embodiment of the Heavenly Will, he imbues the tools with true intent, and then condenses them. This is the path of refining the will, and also the path of refining artifacts.</p><p></p><p>This world is so desperate.</p><p></p><p>Since he has been reborn in this place, with such good conditions, Xuanhuang wants to open a path for the world.</p><p></p><p>This is his visualization diagram, and if he continues to refine it, who can guarantee it won't become a real spiritual treasure?</p><p></p><p>Relying on spiritual treasures as a foundation, as an anchor to stabilize the will.</p><p></p><p>As long as these three tools become powerful enough, just by visualizing them, they can become the will-anchoring points for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Then cultivators can cultivate relying on the Heavenly Will controlled by Xuanhuang, and they won't fear losing control or becoming distorted.</p><p></p><p>Then everyone will come to refine artifacts for Xuanhuang, everyone will come to contribute to Xuanhuang's world, a crowdfunded cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if at a certain point, powerful cultivators can become independent of Xuanhuang's techniques, they have still contributed, right?</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang doesn't want to control all cultivators for life, he just wants to be an investment starter for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This is not a fantasy, but a real possibility based on his superior reasoning.</p><p></p><p>As long as he reaches the fourth layer of true intent, he will understand that he is real, even if the world is not complete or distorted, it doesn't matter, because he is real.</p><p></p><p>Once he reaches the fourth layer, Xuanhuang can let people visualize him, or visualize the three tools he has refined - the Heavenly Smelting Furnace, the Returning to the Abyss Grindstone, and the World Tree reaching to the Heavens - as the foundation for their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Those refining essence can visualize the Heavenly Smelting Furnace, those refining qi can visualize the World Tree reaching to the Heavens, and those refining spirit can visualize the Returning to the Abyss Grindstone.</p><p></p><p>Cultivate the three together? Come, take a look at Patriarch Xuanhuang's visualization diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Comprehensive coverage, a one-stop shop for your future path.</p><p></p><p>But the prerequisite for all this - Xuanhuang needs to be strong enough, and the three visualization diagrams need to be refined to reality.</p><p></p><p>This is the reason why Xuanhuang wants fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that after refining a mouse, the mouse's remaining soul was refined by the Returning to the Abyss Grindstone, and the turbid remaining soul was ground away.</p><p></p><p>A trace of the "true essence of the Dao" existed, and it was actually absorbed by the illusory Returning to the Abyss Grindstone.</p><p></p><p>The Returning to the Abyss Grindstone had refined a trace of it, and if Xuanhuang didn't control this small world, he wouldn't have even noticed.</p><p></p><p>The illusory World Tree was the same.</p><p></p><p>After the chaotic spiritual nature of the mouse was Dao-ified, a trace of the "true essence of qi" was absorbed by it, and it had also refined a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Smelting Furnace was the same, after refining the blood and qi, it had also absorbed a trace of the "true essence of essence".</p><p></p><p>After being triple-refined by the three, the mouse was completely transformed from the real to the illusory.</p><p></p><p>It was like a reversal of chaos, becoming a substantial part of Xuanhuang's controlled world.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the world has become a little more stable.</p><p></p><p>There was almost no waste at all.</p><p></p><p>What kind of change is this? Xuanhuang can only speculate on the changes of the three tools, but the mouse's ability to be completely reversed from chaos, he doesn't understand.</p><p></p><p>It was just today that he saw the suspicious A-rank six Bizarre Lands, and Xuanhuang's superior reasoning...</p><p></p><p>Could the Grindstone Space not be the true Abyss after all?</p><p></p><p>An immature Abyss?...</p><p></p><p>The first night passed peacefully.</p><p></p><p>At 9 o'clock in the morning, Xuanhuang appeared at the foot of the mountain on time, and received the supplies and ordered supreme elixirs from Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>After Jin Ning's cold reminder, he returned to the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to refine the will."</p><p></p><p>After a night's rest, his currently fragile body has fully recovered, and today he will reach the second layer of will.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing two more supreme elixirs, Xuanhuang entered into cultivation.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later...</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness space, there was a tremor, and Xuanhuang had reached the second layer as expected.</p><p></p><p>The remaining qi and blood energy, Xuanhuang did not continue to forge his will, but had his physical body refined.</p><p></p><p>His physical body also reached the second layer of refinement, with a strength of 2,000 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Then another supreme elixir was swallowed, and through the qi and blood energy of the supreme elixir, Xuanhuang not only stabilized the second layer, but also made significant progress.</p><p></p><p>Without any bottlenecks, as long as his body and will can keep up, he can actually reach the peak.</p><p></p><p>But everything needs adaptation, the will needs to adapt to control, and the physical body also needs to adapt to control, this is the key at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As for techniques?</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is not paying much attention to them for now, as long as his essence, qi, and spirit are strong, and his will is strong, techniques are not that important.</p><p></p><p>Because all techniques are born from the will, forged from the essence, qi, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The will is the source of all techniques, and the vital energy and spirit are the foundation for the execution of all techniques.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, techniques that do not reach the extraordinary are useless, as they only differ in evasion and attack.</p><p></p><p>At 1 o'clock in the afternoon...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang turned off his phone, and since he could not cultivate for the time being, Xuanhuang began to supplement his knowledge.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a martial artist, there are many things he can see, just in the Zhenxie APP of the Great Xia, Xuanhuang was greatly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was already afternoon, Xuanhuang planned to patrol the mountain.</p><p></p><p>For a whole day, no beasts had been attracted by the blood pool, and he was just waiting for the beasts to enter the furnace.</p><p></p><p>If the mountain does not come to me, I will go to it. Putting on a two-meter-long knife on his back and holding a hunting rifle in his hand, the rest are in his consciousness space.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the consciousness space was unstable, but now the will has been refined to the second layer, but he has not expanded the small space, so it is very easy to collect weights not exceeding a thousand catties.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, he sensed the direction where the beast aura was, and Xuanhuang headed west.</p><p></p><p>About ten minutes later, Xuanhuang came to a secluded small valley.</p><p></p><p>This place was originally a resort area, but it has become desolate after the mysterious invasion.</p><p></p><p>But there was no news of any mysterious incidents happening here.</p><p></p><p>And the mysterious are not close to each other, after the appearance of the blood pool secret realm, it would be difficult to encounter the mysterious even if one wanted to.</p><p></p><p>At least within a radius of a thousand meters, it is difficult.</p><p></p><p>It's not that two mysteries can't be close to each other.</p><p></p><p>It's that without triggering the rule of the appearance of the mysterious, the two mysteries will be separated by a certain rule.</p><p></p><p>There is already one mysterious being beside him, and it has also triggered the rule of the appearance of another mysterious being...</p><p></p><p>Well, a disaster has occurred.</p><p></p><p>When two mysteries meet like magnets, the power of the explosion is incomparable.</p><p></p><p>At that time, humans are not the primary target of the victims.</p><p></p><p>The two mysteries will first destroy each other until one is silenced.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it is a collision of two fragments of rules.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's not absolute.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has seen on the Zhenxie APP the mysterious bus that travels to various mysterious locations, and the mysterious wooden boat that travels between various time-space ripples, both carrying many mysteries.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the mysterious are different, so it's not absolute.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Another group of wild boars?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked towards the valley.</p><p></p><p>He found a group of wild boars leisurely frolicking and foraging, sniffing here and there.</p><p></p><p>"These things breed too fast, and there are no natural predators, so the wilderness has become their playground."</p><p></p><p>In his sight, there were more than twenty wild boars, big and small.</p><p></p><p>One of them was particularly conspicuous, estimated to be at least 1.5 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>With sharp and large tusks, its body was covered in thick mud and soil, exuding a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang observed for two minutes, and besides the fierce boar king, there were seven adult individuals, and the rest were half-grown.</p><p></p><p>Calming his mind, Xuanhuang had no intention of using the hunting rifle.</p><p></p><p>One shot from the rifle would at most kill two, and then the wild boars would scatter in all directions, and it would be difficult to find them in the dense forest around.</p><p></p><p>With his own two-ton strength and powerful will, dealing with a group of non-ferocious wild boars would be easy.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then put away the hunting rifle and drew the knife on his back, slowly approaching the wild boars.</p><p></p><p>With a strong will, he could fully control his aura, even stronger than the concealment technique, as mentioned earlier, the will is the source of all techniques.</p><p></p><p>Like a passing wind, Xuanhuang slowly approached two adult wild boars.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't ambush the boar king was that the boar king wouldn't flee in fright.</p><p></p><p>As for the other boars, it's hard to say, as they might immediately flee if he killed the boar king.</p><p></p><p>Subtle prediction is also a manifestation of a strong will, like precise calculation, he judged which direction the wild boars would approach.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waited at the predicted location.</p><p></p><p>One minute...</p><p></p><p>"Jie~Ao~"</p><p>"Gururu~"</p><p></p><p>A flash of white light was seen.</p><p>One wild boar's head had been severed.</p><p>The remaining one was also cut in half by the long knife and could no longer stand, letting out a "jie ao" cry of agony.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>The wild boar herd immediately went berserk.</p><p>Since the boar king had not been killed, the herd still had a backbone, and they all looked to the boar king's reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Ao ao—"</p><p></p><p>The awakened boar king snorted white steam, its eyes fiercely staring at Xuanhuang.</p><p>Immediately, there was a flurry of vegetation and flying stones, the boar king charged forward with its tusks raised, rushing towards Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Duang—"</p><p></p><p>The sound of colliding with the trees came.</p><p>Then, the flashing blade of Xuanhuang evaded.</p><p></p><p>The dazed boar king had not yet regained its senses when the sharp object had already pierced through its neck.</p><p></p><p>"Ao—"</p><p>"Splash splash—"</p><p></p><p>Like an out-of-control elephant, although severely injured but not completely extinguished, it struggled in its death throes.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the boar king's struggle, Xuanhuang smoothly withdrew the long knife.</p><p>Then the blade flashed again, passing through the boar king's mouth and out the back of its head.</p><p>Withdrawing it again with the momentum, it was all done in one smooth motion.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh—"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not continue to pay attention to the boar king, but instead forcefully threw the knife, piercing through another wild boar that was still dazed and had not run away.</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang—"</p><p></p><p>Two gunshots, and two wild boars fell to the ground. It was only then that the wild boar herd reacted, squealing and scattering in all directions.</p><p>He could have shot and killed another one, but Xuanhuang didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>Four killed by the knife, two by the gun, all adults, that was about enough.</p><p></p><p>Everything was almost done in one continuous motion, as if Xuanhuang had practiced it countless times, which was also due to his formidable will.</p><p>He didn't even catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>"Flap flap—" At this moment, the boar king finally stopped kicking its legs.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang retrieved the thrown long knife and went to the second wild boar that was still not dead, delivering a final blow.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>"Although it's the first time in actual combat, I'm still quite satisfied, with only two connections and one action not quite perfect."</p><p></p><p>He quickly reviewed and analyzed, restoring his will, and found areas that could be improved.</p><p></p><p>...

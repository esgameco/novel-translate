        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shocking the divine soul...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had something to say, but he couldn't open his mouth, not like he could engage in the eerie back-and-forth of a computer program.</p><p></p><p>This was the rule of the eerie killings.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked quite at ease, without a trace of being affected.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people encountering such a dream realm, coupled with the attack on their divine soul, would have long since experienced their divine soul scattering, fear spreading, and nightmares one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Find it."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's gaze swept across the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The eerie woman in disguise was in this courtyard, specifically in which room needed to be searched.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was in the main house, so the eerie woman must be in the surrounding side rooms.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Void Knife, Xuanhuang took a step forward, heading towards the side rooms to the west.</p><p></p><p>The moment he took a step, he could clearly feel the weight of a thousand catties.</p><p></p><p>In the illusory transformed world, it was like wearing heavy shackles, which was also the reason for the ordinary person's panic.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will was strong, which allowed him to take steps and move around. Ordinary people coming in would feel as if Mount Tai was pressing down on them, without the slightest ability to act.</p><p></p><p>They could only remain in their original position in terror, waiting to be devoured by the approaching eerie presence day by day.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Like a shattered dream.</p><p></p><p>The moment Xuanhuang took a step, a clear sound of shattering could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The illusory courtyard shook.</p><p></p><p>"Heartless bastard... Damn it... I want you to die..."</p><p></p><p>Urgent curses began to pour out, as if triggering the fast-forward button for the eerie killings.</p><p></p><p>In an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang locked onto the source of the sound, which was in the outermost woodshed.</p><p></p><p>The eerie woman was in the woodshed.</p><p></p><p>It was six rooms away from the main bedroom where Xuanhuang was.</p><p></p><p>According to the pattern of getting closer by one room each day, the time for the killing would be six or seven days.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the woodshed, the greater the resistance.</p><p></p><p>By the time he reached the fourth room, Xuanhuang was already gritting his teeth to persist.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was an advanced eerie presence, and even for someone as strong as Xuanhuang, it was still difficult to actively seek it out.</p><p></p><p>This eerie presence did not actively approach, and Xuanhuang found that he had difficulty making contact with it.</p><p></p><p>He paused and pondered for a while. "If I leave this place now, will the eerie presence stop here, or will it go and find Liu Wenhao?"</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation...</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang used all his mental strength to strike a blow towards the woodshed where the eerie presence was.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle..."</p><p></p><p>In front of him, it was not air, but layer upon layer of spatial barriers.</p><p></p><p>The full-force blow, after passing through the fifth side room, reached halfway into the sixth side room, when "Boom!" the entire dream realm shattered.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was shocked out of it, and when he opened his eyes again, he was in the safe house.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of waiting for the call to be answered came.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, how is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I didn't dare to sleep, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Anxious voice came from the other end of the phone, Liu Wenhao.</p><p></p><p>"Then you're safe for now, and if anything happens, tell me immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, brother."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wenhao on the other end of the phone didn't ask much more, hearing Xuanhuang say 'you're safe for now', he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Hanging up the phone, Xuanhuang knew it was just as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>The eerie presence of the love letter did not cross over to find his brother, it seems the love letter medium was more important than the already invaded dream realm.</p><p></p><p>It's also possible that the eerie presence of the love letter was too weak and had not yet developed the ability to spread out.</p><p></p><p>This made it easier.</p><p></p><p>Since I, the one holding the medium, am the primary target, Liu Wenhao's place is safe.</p><p></p><p>According to the plan, the eerie presence will confront me in the dream in seven days...</p><p></p><p>By then, who will kill whom is yet to be seen.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the situation, Xuanhuang thought: "Just now, if I had confronted it directly, the one who would have failed would definitely be me, but the eerie presence's power needs seven days to gradually unleash, so I seem to be in control."</p><p></p><p>The eerie presence of the love letter is very weak, but it is still a first-level eerie presence.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang didn't have his "hanging" stacking, facing this situation, it wouldn't be easy to say.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Xuanhuang used all his strength in one blow, taking advantage of the shattering of the dream realm to escape.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, the eerie presence of the love letter will appear in the sixth room, getting closer and closer, getting stronger and stronger, until the seventh day arrives.</p><p></p><p>This requires Xuanhuang to grow stronger day by day in order to break free safely.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he has this ability.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The eerie presence of the love letter attacks the dream realm, and my will condenses a protective shell. After being attacked, I actually have the ability to temper my will even further?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang discovered that his will, after being impacted by the eerie presence, originally needed until tomorrow to continue refining, but now it could be done immediately.</p><p></p><p>Since it's like this, there's nothing more to say.</p><p></p><p>He needs to race against the eerie presence of the love letter, and since he now has a way to enhance himself, he might as well continue.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang casually displayed his Great Elixir, and prepared to face the challenge ahead.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Launching the assault on the eighth layer of Refining the Will.</p><p></p><p>In the not-so-large safe house, there was no wind, yet it moved on its own.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and profound energy of assaulting the eighth layer of Refining the Will seemed to be able to interfere with reality.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a gentle breeze, the meaning was different.</p><p></p><p>"Rumbling—Swoosh—"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, the will was constantly forged, and the medicinal elixir that had been transformed from the great cinnabar pill was burning fiercely like kindling.</p><p></p><p>Because Xuanhuang had been refining the will in the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, the condensation degree of the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible was thicker than the Tong Tian Building Wood and the Gui Xu Great Grindstone.</p><p></p><p>The first thing to take shape was definitely the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>"Hum—"</p><p></p><p>A tremor came from the sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will had successfully advanced to the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>Combining with the eighth layer of Body Refinement, a sense of complete safety.</p><p></p><p>He dared not say that he had completely established a foothold in this realm, but at least he had a foothold now.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The fierce display of the great cinnabar pill was a bit too much for him to bear.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang counted and found that he had five bottles left.</p><p></p><p>"Two bottles of the ninth layer, three bottles of perfection. It's about as expected, it seems I need to continue guarding the Blood Pool, otherwise I'll need to buy more great cinnabar pills."</p><p></p><p>To achieve a breakthrough to the Transcendent Realm, the great cinnabar pills would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to continue catalyzing the fierce beasts tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>And so, the dawn arrived...</p><p></p><p>From afar, he saw Jin Ning hurriedly getting off the car.</p><p></p><p>His face was full of questions, as if he had countless questions to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Can you tell me how the spiritual aura on the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible is maintained without being distorted?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, Jin Ning asked the question he most wanted to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the spiritual aura be distorted?" Xuanhuang did not answer, but instead asked.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was taken aback and said, "It is naturally the distortion of the world's Heavenly Will, so the spiritual aura within the world is also distorted."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then just imbue the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible's visualization diagram with a Heavenly Will that is not distorted, and the spiritual aura will not be distorted."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible?" Jin Ning was confused. "Are there two Heavenly Wills?"</p><p></p><p>"There are many, the fusion and collision of the myriad realms, there are so many worlds existing."</p><p></p><p>"No... that's not the problem here, brother." Jin Ning was completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The collision and fusion of the myriad realms are all in distortion, where do the many undistorted Heavenly Wills come from?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled and said, "There is still a glimmer of hope, the Heavenly Dao is four-nine, there is still a glimmer of hope."</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was speaking in riddles, but at this moment, he could not reveal too much.</p><p></p><p>He needed to let people gradually accept that he was different, not to come up too high, for his strength did not allow it.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, since you won't say, I won't ask anymore." Jin Ning looked at Xuanhuang and then said, "It's just that the spiritual aura has disappeared, perhaps it was consumed when I was visualizing, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning thought that he had destroyed Xuanhuang's precious spiritual aura visualization diagram.</p><p></p><p>"How far have you visualized?" Xuanhuang continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"I... I haven't even condensed one foot of the Tripod of the Copper Furnace yet?" Jin Ning was embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"If there was still spiritual aura, how long do you think it would take you to visualize the complete diagram?" Xuanhuang asked further.</p><p></p><p>There was not a trace of the heartache that Jin Ning had expected.</p><p></p><p>"You... you don't mind that the spiritual aura is gone?" Jin Ning asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shook his head and said, "It's fine, you just answer how long it would take."</p><p></p><p>"This..." Seeing that Xuanhuang was very serious, Jin Ning thought for a while and said, "If I had enough spiritual aura, I feel I could condense one foot in seven days, the three feet would take at least half a month, as for the complete Tripod of the Copper Furnace... I don't know... I don't know if it will get harder and harder."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty of entry and the difficulty of completion are two major hurdles." Xuanhuang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, Jin Ning's talent was very good.</p><p></p><p>In a month, he could condense nine-tenths of the Heavenly-Earthly Crucible, and as for the last one-tenth to perfection, this would require an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could complete it directly.</p><p></p><p>Or it might take half a year to six months, and still be a little short.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators nowadays all start from the middle, groping their way forward, and they can still become martial artists and Immortal Cultivators. These people are all geniuses.</p><p></p><p>At the latest in two months, martial artists at the Martial Master realm, and Immortal Cultivators at the Forging Realm, should all be able to completely condense the visualization diagram.</p><p></p><p>In half a year, martial artists at the Martial Warrior realm, and Immortal Cultivators at the Spirit Refinement realm, should also be able to completely condense the visualization diagram.</p><p></p><p>This is a general inference.</p><p></p><p>There is no guarantee that there won't be geniuses who are even faster, nor is there a guarantee that there won't be Martial Masters or Immortal Cultivators who are excruciatingly slow.</p><p></p><p>"Then you continue, I still have a visualization diagram with spiritual aura, you continue."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then took out another Heavenly-Earthly Crucible visualization diagram and took the one without spiritual aura from Jin Ning's hand.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning: ...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The first round of recommendations for the new book, which is a matter of life and death for a book, I sincerely request that all book friends read and collect it. This book is a slow-burning type, but it will definitely be spectacular later on. It's not brainless, there are no logical loopholes, and the author is also an old bookworm who will avoid toxic points, so it may be a bit bland, and can only be supplemented by setting the plot, I beg everyone to support it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

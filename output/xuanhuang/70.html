        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moonlight today was hazy, as if covered by a layer of mist.</p><p></p><p>On the west side of the South City, there was a dilapidated street, with various warning signs towering around, the coarse and blood-red characters making people shudder.</p><p></p><p>Only those who were not ordinary people would come to this place.</p><p></p><p>Three cars came rushing in, their markings clearly indicating they were from Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"They're here, they're here. I just received the notice from the director and couldn't believe it, but they really came."</p><p></p><p>Guarding this place were two spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>Due to the strange abilities of the Ominous Clock, and its location in a densely populated urban area, there had been many incidents of people accidentally wandering in, so spirit masters were often stationed here.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ominous Clock could not move, its abilities were quite peculiar. It would mysteriously appear at certain time points, as if time itself was resonating.</p><p></p><p>Inexplicable incidents would occur in the nearby residents' homes. Often by the time they were discovered, it was already too late, so the Exorcism Department paid special attention to this.</p><p></p><p>According to the information provided by Gao Xiaolan, they still didn't fully understand the Clock's abilities. It was true that it was a地灵诡异 (earth spirit anomaly), but it could also transcend the bound location and appear in other places at any time.</p><p></p><p>The temporal anomaly, caused by the resonance of time, was virtually impossible to defend against.</p><p></p><p>Recently, there was even a risk of it spreading. The Clock's abilities were strengthening, but the area that could be sealed off was not limitless.</p><p></p><p>After the invasion of the anomaly, at least 30% of the residential buildings and public facilities had become uninhabitable, and the living space of the residents had been greatly compressed.</p><p></p><p>The eleven people who followed Xuanhuang were the previous ten and Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had focused on cultivating these ten.</p><p></p><p>This time, Jin Ning's task had some difficulty. He was currently the only one who had fully comprehended the Visualization Diagram, and had even begun to engrave the first talisman.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Xuanhuang or the others, they all needed him to experiment and see how effective the complete Visualization Object in suppressing the spirit would be.</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's speculation, as long as one could comprehend the complete Visualization Object in suppressing the spirit, even without further refining the talisman, they would have the strength of the seventh layer of will.</p><p></p><p>This was a baseline. It meant that as long as one comprehended the complete Visualization Object in suppressing the spirit, they would have the strength of the seventh layer of will.</p><p></p><p>Continued refinement of the talisman would only increase the borrowed power, but the strength would not increase unless one engraved more than eight talismans.</p><p></p><p>This was actually quite good, as it provided them with a baseline.</p><p></p><p>Generally, a first-stage anomaly would find it difficult to instantly pull someone with the seventh layer of will strength into its rules.</p><p></p><p>The seventh layer of will strength was like establishing a door in one's own spirit. This door might not be very sturdy, but it was still stronger than having no defenses at all.</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang cultivated the seventh layer of will before, the Ominous Brush Pen had difficulty directly pulling him into the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>The integration of will, the seventh layer representing the doors of the spirit, dream realm, illusion formation, and the mind, etc.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>The two guarding spirit masters, one was very thin and exuded a foul odor, with a pervasive aura of anomaly. </p><p></p><p>The other was a woman, her whole body tightly wrapped, but her left arm could clearly be sensed as only bare white bones.</p><p></p><p>"You two have worked hard. Just wait here from now on."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang respected those who had made contributions and maintained their human thoughts to protect the greater good.</p><p></p><p>"We dare not, Master Xuan, please be careful."</p><p></p><p>The spirit masters were taciturn people, perhaps due to their profession, or perhaps because of the anomalies they had experienced.</p><p></p><p>"You two go to Qingyun Mountain tomorrow. Director Xu should have told you, I will resolve the spirit souls that have been invaded by the anomaly for you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on their cold faces.</p><p></p><p>The news learned today had the entire Exorcism Department of South City very excited.</p><p></p><p>This meant that they were at least not afraid of being invaded and losing control to the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>With this kind of support, whether it was to live longer or to continue fusing with the source anomaly and advance, it would play a crucial role.</p><p></p><p>"It's only natural."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the eleven people who came with him, he said, "You nine be careful. If there is real danger, try to delay as much as possible, I will resolve the anomaly as soon as possible. Of course, you can also choose not to enter... Jin Ning, you pay attention too. There is a furnace guarding you, so you can be more at ease, but still be careful. As for Sun Tong, you just stay here with the two spirit masters, don't go in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The eleven people responded.</p><p></p><p>All ten chose to enter, with no one choosing to stay behind.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity was rare, to follow the Master to deal with the anomaly, this was a very precious chance.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, it would be simpler for Xuanhuang to enter alone, and he wouldn't have to worry about them.</p><p></p><p>But this wouldn't do. His disciples still needed tempering.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't start training them soon and bring them out, there would be even less time in the future.</p><p></p><p>Having chosen to be the leader of a force, or even a Patriarch, he had to bear the corresponding responsibilities. </p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that no one was hesitating, Xuanhuang turned and stepped into the cordoned-off area, heading towards the gloomy inn.</p><p></p><p>This place used to be an inn, and the eighth room on the second floor was where the Ominous Clock resided.</p><p></p><p>The Clock had appeared for three years, and this place had long been abandoned, the stench of decay permeating the air. The dark and deep entrance of the inn was like the gaping maw of a devouring beast.</p><p></p><p>Messy furniture and city trash blown in by the wind covered the lobby floor.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the trash, a creaking sound constantly echoed.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the inn, a cold, ominous aura had begun to permeate the air.</p><p></p><p>It was not the nauseating stench of blood, but a deep, bone-chilling coldness, as if they had fallen into the gates of hell.</p><p></p><p>The entire inn was very quiet.</p><p></p><p>The occasional sound of the wind blowing the debris sounded particularly jarring.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>The ten couldn't help but take a deep breath, only to shiver from the icy air.</p><p></p><p>"Pitter-patter, pitter-patter!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not linger, heading towards the stairs to the second floor.</p><p></p><p>There was always a sense of being watched, as if countless ghosts and demons in the surrounding darkness were peering at them.</p><p></p><p>At least hundreds of people had died here, but their bodies were nowhere to be found, their fates unknown.</p><p></p><p>And the inexplicable feeling of being watched, as if those who had died were peering at them, wanting to pull them into the realm of death.</p><p></p><p>Those whose will was not firm would have likely already succumbed in this environment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, those who came were not ordinary people. With Xuanhuang leading the way, it gave them a tremendous boost of energy.</p><p></p><p>It felt as if they had been walking for a long time, but the less than twenty steps to the second floor seemed to stretch on endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the second floor, it was much more spacious here.</p><p></p><p>At least there were no piles of city trash, only some broken furniture and the ominous and terrifying individual rooms.</p><p></p><p>Each room was like a tomb, or even the entrance to a hellish realm.</p><p></p><p>One couldn't help but not dare to approach, fearing that a door would suddenly open and bony hands would reach out to pull them in.</p><p></p><p>Room 8, at the farthest end of the second-floor hallway.</p><p></p><p>With the target locked, Xuanhuang advanced towards it.</p><p></p><p>The ten followed with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>From this, it was clear that the Ominous Clock was far stronger than the previous anomalous dolls.</p><p></p><p>Just slowly approaching, without even entering the anomalous rules, these martial and Tao masters were already feeling mentally exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"At least a first-stage late or even peak Ominous Clock," Xuanhuang estimated.</p><p></p><p>"Thud, thud, thud!"</p><p></p><p>The footsteps sounded like heartbeats, the icy aura growing even heavier, the air they breathed in feeling like swallowing ice.</p><p></p><p>They arrived at Room 8.</p><p></p><p>The door was loose and rickety, as if a gust of wind could blow it down.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Xuanhuang opened his spiritual perception and pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>"Pitter-patter, pitter-patter!"</p><p></p><p>The silent room was pitch black, only the ticking of an unknown clock breaking the silence.</p><p></p><p>After the eleven entered, the small room did not feel cramped at all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The space transformed, no longer the dark room, but dimly lit with a vicious-looking man wielding a blade, hacking and slashing.</p><p></p><p>The man had no facial features, his entire face seemingly sewn together with skin.</p><p></p><p>A faceless man, nearly three meters tall, the blade he held over a meter long. The entire room was drenched in thick blood, with countless corpses scattered about.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's spiritual perception sensed that this was at least...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The space was actually in a temporal-spatial rift, no wonder it was called the Lost Land.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the people who were killed couldn't be found, it turned out they were all in this place, exiled by the temporal-spatial distortion.</p><p></p><p>The intense visual stimulation and the thick bloody smell, the three-meter-tall faceless man seemed to be sneering and examining the prey.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't pay attention to these, the faceless man couldn't break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>Despite the faceless man's towering stature, after the second celestial pillar had condensed in his dantian, it had expanded to sixty thousand square meters, which was sixty thousand tons of gigantic force. With a swing of his fist, there was no fancy movement.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The faceless man was directly blasted apart, with scattered blood splashing everywhere.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang didn't care about these, he and the ten people who followed him into this place were all killed by the faceless man in other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the faceless man was simple, the difficult part was finding the Ominous Clock.</p><p></p><p>It was the source of the anomaly, only by finding it, sealing it, or erasing its twisted consciousness, could the temporal-spatial distortion be broken.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang didn't even bother to investigate the cause.</p><p></p><p>After all, every anomaly has fragments of memories, which are the origins of their birth.</p><p></p><p>It should be that someone was brutally killed in this room, and the faceless man was the terrified victim's murderer, not knowing the specific person, so the victim's fear was amplified, becoming the unknown faceless man, representing the victim's not knowing who the killer was.</p><p></p><p>Later, for whatever reason, whether the hotel owner concealed it or the killer disguised it, the murdered person was not discovered, died with resentment and was forgotten, the resentment combined with the Ominous Clock...</p><p></p><p>In any case, it should be like this, all familiar clichéd stories.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't care about this, he just wanted to resolve the Ominous Clock as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>This temporal anomaly was indeed special, and this place was the Lost Land, the exiled existence.</p><p></p><p>After blasting the faceless man, Xuanhuang didn't find any trace of the Ominous Clock.</p><p></p><p>Only the ticking sound came from somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, since I can't find it, I'll just blast it to pieces."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang immediately took action, and the Void Knife appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it appeared, the Void Knife seemed to sense the aura of its kind, trembling excitedly, it had been a long time since the master used it.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang used all his strength, plus the various abilities of the Void Knife, to slash violently around.</p><p></p><p>Since the Ominous Clock couldn't be found in the room, he would break through its rule coverage, he was sure he could still find it.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's powerful and heavy slash seemed to split the temporal-spatial fabric, and the blood-red room was split in half from the middle.</p><p></p><p>"Crack! Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Even the steady ticking sound that had been coming all along started to stutter.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red room shattered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, what came into view was a dim temporal-spatial realm, this place was gloomy and dark, with a hazy yellow sun and moon hanging in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Sun and moon in the same sky, and in the distance were impenetrable mists and mountains.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely not South City, nor even the Blue Star world.</p><p></p><p>"Another world? Or a broken and forgotten temporal-spatial realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had never seen such a world before.</p><p></p><p>After splitting open the room covered by the Ominous Clock's rules, it turned out to be a dilapidated temporal-spatial realm.</p><p></p><p>Just like a temporal fold, this place had sun and moon in the same sky, with one distorted figure after another walking aimlessly and numbly, without purpose or direction.</p><p></p><p>Each figure was like a lingering soul, fragmented and twisted, they must be the remnants of the previous victims.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether they were lingering souls, shadows, or unabated resentment? Or unforgettable thoughts? When they saw Xuanhuang appear, their distorted figures began to have a target.</p><p></p><p>They all opened their arms wide, reaching out to grab Xuanhuang, wanting to drag him into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>It was so similar to the feeling of being watched before.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood, the ones who had been watching them before were these existences.</p><p></p><p>Whether they called it the Forgotten Temporal-Spatial Realm or the Other World, they were watching from here.</p><p></p><p>"You're already dead, don't linger anymore, I'll send you to rebirth."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge tree root appeared in Xuanhuang's palm.</p><p></p><p>No matter where Jianmu was, it could always connect through the Small World. </p><p></p><p>In fact, one could say that wherever Xuanhuang was, Jianmu could take root through the Small World connection.</p><p></p><p>Even in this world.</p><p></p><p>It was a rare alternative space, as long as Jianmu's roots took root here, this place would be within Jianmu's connected range.</p><p></p><p>Through the Small World, Jianmu had already gained the ability to connect to all worlds.</p><p></p><p>The thick tree roots like a giant dragon, sweeping away the distorted figures with a death aura like a tornado.</p><p></p><p>Those indescribable existences were quickly shredded and absorbed by the roots.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the Heavenly Jianmu, at this moment, represented the destination of death.</p><p></p><p>Even though the distorted figures struggled constantly, they still couldn't stop it.</p><p></p><p>Until with a 'thud', one distorted figure was crushed, and a black box it was holding fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang took a closer look, it was not a black box, but an ancient grandfather clock.</p><p></p><p>Previously, this grandfather clock was fused with the distorted figure, so it couldn't be detected.</p><p></p><p>It was not until all the figures were shredded that the clock fell out of the memory of the distorted figure.</p><p></p><p>"Hidden so well, not only in the Other World, but also in the memory of the distorted figures in the Other World."</p><p></p><p>"Like a nested doll."</p><p></p><p>The hotel, second floor room 8, the blood-red room, the Other World, the memory of the figures in the Other World.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang hadn't crushed and swept them away, it would have been troublesome.</p><p></p><p>If he had played the anomaly rules with the Ominous Clock? </p><p></p><p>You break it, layer after layer, one more layer.</p><p></p><p>This temporal anomaly was indeed difficult to deal with, in the end it was hidden in the memory of a certain figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure must have been the victim.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Having found the culprit, Xuanhuang didn't linger, using the Small World positioning to leave this world.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, he was back in the hotel's second floor room 8.</p><p></p><p>"Break!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a one-meter-sized domain appeared, enveloping the old clock.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will-forged knife broke through the anomalous power that shrouded the Ominous Clock's twisted consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Unlike breaking the anomalous consciousness of the puppet before, even though the puppet's consciousness had the protection of its anomalous power, it was instantly shattered by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>But the anomalous power of this Ominous Clock was much more difficult to deal with, Xuanhuang's will-forged knife seemed to be entering layers of temporal mist.</p><p></p><p>To lock onto its consciousness, he first had to break through the temporal envelopment, which was a great challenge.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the domain's ability to lock down the temporal-spatial realm, Xuanhuang felt that even a second-rank spirit master would find it difficult to seal the Ominous Clock.</p><p></p><p>"Here it is!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's domain suppressed, time and time contended, he took the opportunity to find a gap.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" A sound like a temporal-spatial ripple rang out.</p><p></p><p>The twisted consciousness of the Ominous Clock was the image of a woman covered in blood with a shattered face, should be the victim of room 8.</p><p></p><p>"Screech!"</p><p></p><p>The tragic cry was particularly chilling.</p><p></p><p>But under the will-forged knife, the Ominous Clock's consciousness was shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>With the Ominous Clock's consciousness broken, it meant the anomalous rules disappeared.</p><p></p><p>A few loud "Boom, Boom, Boom" sounds.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that in the not-so-large room 8, as if squeezed out by the temporal-spatial realm, Sun Hui and the other nine people were pushed out.</p><p></p><p>They appeared in the not-so-large room.</p><p></p><p>They all looked disheveled and unkempt, with multiple wounds on their bodies, and the weakest Song Hongliang even had a broken leg.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan! You..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dazed ten people, Xuanhuang said, "It's over, I've suppressed the Ominous Clock."</p><p></p><p>"Phew..." The ten people let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The usually elegant and well-dressed Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio were also covered in blood and very disheveled.</p><p></p><p>The calm and unruffled demeanor was gone, the monk no longer looked like a monk, the Taoist no longer looked like a Taoist, and the scholar also looked very messy.</p><p></p><p>The image of the high-level figures was gone.</p><p></p><p>But they no longer cared, just being able to come out alive was good enough.</p><p></p><p>The ten of them had all experienced the chase and killing by the three-meter-tall faceless man, and in Xuanhuang's hands, it was simply the Grim Reaper.</p><p></p><p>"Recover a bit, and then we'll leave. Tonight's targets are the Ominous Clock and the Longevity Robe Shop, we still have to continue."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang left first, letting the ten people recover.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Morning.</p><p></p><p>"Line up, line up, don't cut in line, that cultivator is talking about you, line up."</p><p></p><p>"Stand back, don't crowd, those who cultivate the Dao go line up over there."</p><p></p><p>"Here, take your ID card."</p><p></p><p>"Name, where are you from, cultivation level?... This is the standard of our Southern City Qingyun Mountain, those who haven't broken through are called 'Lian Ti' (Body Refining)."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At the Qingyun Mountain registration point, a long line had formed again.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xuanhuang's second sermon, endless streams of people have been flocking here.</p><p></p><p>Whether they are martial artists or cultivators, they have formed a great pilgrimage seeking the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Since the martial arts hall moved to Qingyun Mountain, it has been constantly undergoing renovations, with countless people participating every day.</p><p></p><p>There are not yet many tasks defined, but the number of people going up the mountain is increasing day by day. Sun Hui, Li Tong and others discussed.</p><p></p><p>Utilizing the influx of people, they will provide certain points to develop Qingyun Mountain and accommodate the constantly arriving people.</p><p></p><p>The several peaks not far from Qingyun Mountain are also vigorously undergoing transformation.</p><p></p><p>The high-level figures of the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist sects have all arrived, and they have quickly formulated plans, each occupying one of the mountains near Qingyun Mountain to establish their own mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>The area around the main peak of Qingyun Mountain is also undergoing development.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, is this Qingyun Mountain? Is the Master teaching the Dao here?"</p><p></p><p>A young girl asked.</p><p></p><p>Tightly holding her hand was a teenager who looked about fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p></p><p>The teenager's face was resolute, with a maturity beyond his years. Feeling the spiritual energy of Qingyun Mountain, the tense body of the teenager relaxed considerably.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Xiaocao, this is Qingyun Mountain."</p><p></p><p>When it was their turn, the registration personnel asked, "What's your name, where are your parents? Where are you from, what's your cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, my name is Lin Fan, this is my sister Xiaocao, Lin Xiaocao. Our parents were mysteriously killed, we are from Yongshi City. I am a martial artist, at the Body Refining first layer. My sister has not yet cultivated."</p><p></p><p>The young girl's name was Xiaocao, and the teenager's name was Lin Fan, both having rather extraordinary names.</p><p></p><p>The teenager was fifteen, the young girl nine years old.</p><p></p><p>The two of them could be said to have experienced the intrusion of the mysterious from their childhood, and even more tragically, their parents had passed away.</p><p></p><p>Brother Lin Fan had struggled to support his sister, and with the government's assistance, they had barely managed to survive.</p><p></p><p>The talented teenager Lin Fan had exceptional martial arts aptitude, and in his first year of learning martial arts, he had already reached the Body Refining first layer.</p><p></p><p>By chance, he learned about Xuanhuang, and the teenager gritted his teeth and, accompanied by his sister, made the arduous journey to arrive at the Southern City Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Very inspiring.</p><p></p><p>"Take your ID cards. You, young man, can go with the adults to work and earn points, and your sister can go to the childcare center over there."</p><p></p><p>The registration personnel, seeing their young ages, carefully explained to them.</p><p></p><p>Letting the teenager go work to accumulate points, while the young girl has specialized personnel to take care of her.</p><p></p><p>Although the childcare place is quite simple, just newly built, at least there is one.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir."</p><p></p><p>Experienced in hardship, the teenager knew how to be grateful and respectful to others.</p><p></p><p>Struggling to survive, cautiously and steadfastly.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to be fifteen?"</p><p></p><p>The registration personnel suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>The teenager was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been in contact with the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan replied, "Less than a year."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it seems you have good natural talent. Let me give you a suggestion, would you like to try our test? If you pass, you can be admitted into our martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>Lin Fan hurriedly said, "Please go on, sir."</p><p></p><p>The registration personnel pointed to the ID card on his chest and said, "I am a member of the Southern City Martial Arts Hall. Your talent can be tested in our hall's trials. If you meet the standard, you will be recruited into our martial arts hall. Our martial arts hall was founded by the Master, with the most complete martial arts heritage. Even if your talent is truly outstanding, you don't need to earn points, the martial arts hall will provide for you. You just need to..."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said, "In short, as long as your talent is outstanding, you don't need to do anything else, just focus on cultivating. Your sister can also be placed in our martial arts hall, we have specialized personnel..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Fan was overjoyed. "Sir, I agree, I am willing to take the test."</p><p></p><p>He was very familiar with the Southern City Martial Arts Hall, and as the gentleman said, it was the place where the Master originated. It was also the place where the Master had the most direct lineage.</p><p></p><p>It was said that among the ten people the Master had chosen, half were from the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>This was definitely the greatest force he could access.</p><p></p><p>The competition for talents had already begun.</p><p></p><p>Since the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions had arrived in large numbers and occupied the mountain peaks, this kind of competition had already started.</p><p></p><p>As the place where Xuanhuang originated, the martial arts hall could not easily be integrated into any faction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was not yet a dedicated martial arts force, so Sun Hui and others decided to build their own, calling themselves the Master's direct disciples.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists and talents flocking from all directions, these past few days, had almost all been recruited into the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall has also been officially renamed: Qingyun Mountain Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Separating from the previous Southern City Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Southern City Martial Arts Hall is still under the jurisdiction of the Qingyun Mountain Martial Arts Alliance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After registration, entering Qingyun Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The arriving martial artists and cultivators were like entering a grand garden.</p><p></p><p>"Sure enough, as the forum said, the spiritual energy here is complete and pure."</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Tong Tian Building they mentioned? They said it's 50 meters high, but it seems to be over 60 meters."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the White Bone Pagoda for tempering willpower? They say it requires 10 points to enter. It can actually refine control and willpower, truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Those are spiritual artifacts, real spiritual artifacts, of course they are not ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Look, someone is coming out, stumbling and drenched in sweat, seems to have been severely tormented."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they say the pain of having one's bones shattered, with the addition of extraordinary power, how could it be easy."</p><p></p><p>"These are not things we can covet as soon as we arrive. We should first accumulate points to exchange for the Contemplation Diagrams."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist is right, the Contemplation Diagrams are the most important. Only by learning the Contemplation Diagrams can we change our previous path and pursue higher realms."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that yesterday, the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist leaders, as well as the Martial Arts Hall's Pavilion Master Sun Hui, have all fully comprehended the Contemplation Diagrams. Now there are already five who have fully comprehended the Contemplation Diagrams?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I heard they have been following the Master these past few days to deal with the mysteries in Southern City. This is the third day, the six mysterious locations in Southern City have already been cleared by the Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Master's methods are truly profound, guiding us on the path. Using mysteries to counter mysteries, this path needs to be corrected..."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>As he finished speaking, a cold gaze from a distance looked towards him.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened to be overheard by two passing cultivators, and the younger cultivator looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"Shh, keep your voice down. The Master is the Master, you are you. You haven't reached the transcendent realm yet, don't make rash conclusions."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the situation, his friend reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>The man realized he had spoken wrongly, and quickly apologized, bowing towards the two distant cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator among the two said, "Alright, don't mind these things, calming the spirit is important."</p><p></p><p>They were from the Southern City Exorcism Department, following the plan to come here to soothe the spiritual erosion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Souls</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang and his group were respected, especially in the past three days.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang resolved two eerie incidents every day.</p><p></p><p>He had completely eliminated six eerie incidents, greatly reducing the manpower needed in the Exorcism Department.</p><p></p><p>The resident spirit masters of the Exorcism Department, under Xuanhuang's instructions, took turns coming to Mount Qingyun to alleviate the erosion of their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>"I respect Master Xuan, but what is he? Just an ordinary person daring to say our path needs correction. Hmph, why didn't he say that before? Do we not have other ways to integrate the eerie incidents? Making ourselves neither human nor ghost-like. I'm so tired of these armchair strategists who comment so brazenly."</p><p></p><p>The young spirit master said indignantly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, let's go."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged spirit master pulled him away.</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Watching the two spirit masters leave satisfactorily, Xuanhuang was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, they've recovered again. The Demonic Pearl (a nickname) can continue to absorb the Abyss' power."</p><p></p><p>After three to four days of continuous absorption, the Abyss Grinder had made great progress. If this continued growth persisted, the Abyss Grinder would eventually possess the inextinguishable characteristic of Abyss power.</p><p></p><p>And in these three days, Xuanhuang had cleared two fixed points per day, eliminating a total of six eerie incidents.</p><p></p><p>The first night's Eerie Clock and Eerie Shroud, the second night's Death Crow and Toilet Swallowing Eerie, as well as the third night's Pig Slaughter Knife Eerie and Smoke Eerie.</p><p></p><p>Night operations, day cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's cultivation, in these three to four days, had forged his Mystical Will's second layer four times. Another six times and he would reach the third layer of Mystical Will, able to condense the third Celestial Pillar.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xuanhuang's sea of qi had a golden blood qi that had reached 60 meters wide. On the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace, a celestial gate had been engraved. Two Celestial Pillars stood tall in the mist of the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>Even the gushing spring at the center of the sea of qi had become larger due to the sea's expansion.</p><p></p><p>The widened spring made the connection between the body and the sea of qi even tighter, enhancing Xuanhuang's energy output.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of growing stronger every day made Xuanhuang more confident.</p><p></p><p>The online Divine Alliance, Demonic Believer, and Underworld forces had previously issued kill orders against him.</p><p></p><p>It would be impossible for him to have no worries at all.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the past few days, going out at night to eliminate eerie incidents.</p><p></p><p>Surely the spies of those evil sects had already discovered this. If they acted, they would definitely strike when he was out clearing the eerie incidents.</p><p></p><p>Mount Qingyun had a suppressive effect on spirit masters, and the Towering Celestial Tree stood there. The sects' spies must have discovered this as well.</p><p></p><p>So they probably wouldn't dare attack him on Mount Qingyun, only when he was out clearing the eerie incidents at night.</p><p></p><p>"Just give me a little more time. Once I condense the third Celestial Pillar and expand my sea of qi to 90 meters, I'll reach the late stage of the First Realm spirit master. Then even if Second Realm spirit masters come, I'll be able to handle them more easily," Xuanhuang thought.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's "late First Realm" referred to the standards of other spirit masters.</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's Four Extremes and Twelve Celestial Pillars, reaching four gates and ten pillars would be considered his late stage.</p><p></p><p>But by his own standards, after four gates and ten pillars, Xuanhuang would be able to directly defeat Second Realm eerie incidents.</p><p></p><p>The standards were different. Reaching one gate and three pillars was considered the late First Realm for other spirit masters, while Xuanhuang's limit was four gates and twelve pillars.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, Xuanhuang's classification was more in line with the eerie incidents in this world.</p><p></p><p>No one had ever heard of spirit masters being able to handle eerie incidents above their realm. Even at the same level, spirit masters couldn't defeat eerie incidents.</p><p></p><p>Spirit masters relied on control when taking action. If they acted recklessly, the eerie incidents within them would devour and assimilate them.</p><p></p><p>So spirit masters were the weakest among their peers.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was the strongest among his peers.</p><p></p><p>Because he could not only defeat spirit masters above his realm, but also eerie incidents above his realm.</p><p></p><p>One gate and three pillars vs. late First Realm spirit master, two gates and six pillars vs. invincible First Realm spirit master and late First Realm eerie incident, three gates and nine pillars vs. First Realm eerie extreme and early Second Realm spirit master, four gates and twelve pillars vs. early Second Realm eerie incident and mid Second Realm spirit master.</p><p></p><p>This was just the capability of his martial cultivation. Add in his Mystical Will being one level higher, plus his Small World, and with a few helpers, Xuanhuang could directly fight and even slay Second Realm spirit masters with just one gate and three pillars plus Mystical Will and Small World.</p><p></p><p>As for the few helpers, the Void Knife, Abyss Grinder, Towering Celestial Tree, and Heavenly-Earthly Furnace, each had its own karmic opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before he could achieve First Realm invincibility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were inscribed cultivation texts on the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace, Abyss Grinder, and Towering Celestial Tree.</p><p></p><p>After Jin Ning comprehended the complete Heavenly-Earthly Furnace visualization diagram, a connection was formed between him and the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace, an invisible thread like a causal line extending from the Furnace into the profound.</p><p></p><p>Now there were two threads on the Heavenly-Earthly Furnace, one connected to Jin Ning and one to Sun Hui.</p><p></p><p>The Towering Celestial Tree also had two threads, connected to Jiu Tong and Yan Lai respectively.</p><p></p><p>Only the Abyss Grinder had one thread, connected to Ming Hui and Shang.</p><p></p><p>These five were currently the ones who had comprehended the formations completely.</p><p></p><p>The insights and spiritual illumination of these five were constantly transmitted along the threads to the three artifacts, making them increasingly more real.</p><p></p><p>The power of faith could turn the unreal into the real, let alone this kind of insight and spiritual illumination. As more cultivators connected, the day the three artifacts fully manifested would come sooner.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang even suspected that the three artifacts might advance faster than himself.</p><p></p><p>They might be at about the same progress when reaching the Profound Enlightenment Realm, but when reaching the Profound Mysteries Realm, with more cultivators connected, the three artifacts might progress even faster than him.</p><p></p><p>But Xuanhuang didn't mind. The faster, the better. The stronger the three artifacts, the stronger he would be.</p><p></p><p>Don't forget that the three artifacts' origins were the Mandate of the Small World, and the Mandate of the Small World was his own, right? The stronger the three artifacts, the stronger the Small World, and the stronger the Small World, the stronger he would be.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the Small World.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Small World still maintained a radius of 1,000 meters, not expanding further.</p><p></p><p>According to the tenfold progress, it would expand to 10,000 meters at the Profound Enlightenment Realm, 100,000 meters at the Profound Mysteries Realm, and 1 million meters at the Profound Truths Realm.</p><p></p><p>It's just unknown how large the Abyss is.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Small World had broken free from its previous unstable state. Since Xuanhuang's Mystical Will had transcended, it could almost infinitely accommodate items.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the Small World, he had stored a three-story building as his resting and storage place.</p><p></p><p>Entering the building, Xuanhuang took out eight eerie items.</p><p></p><p>Six of them were the ones he had personally sealed in the past three days, and the other two were gifts brought by the Exorcism Department, as compensation for alleviating the distorted spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>These two were a wooden box and a portrait of a beauty.</p><p></p><p>The wooden box eerie wasn't anything special. Writing a person's name and birthday in fresh blood and placing it in the box would cause the person's soul to be devoured, with the victim dying a little each day.</p><p></p><p>Similar to a curse-type eerie incident.</p><p></p><p>The beauty portrait was an ancient painting of a beautiful woman. Opening the scroll at midnight would cause the woman in the painting to step out, dragging the person in and turning them into a pile of white bones beneath her feet. The more souls it consumed, the more vivid the woman in the painting became.</p><p></p><p>The bones of all living beings became the foundation for her to condense and step out of the painting.</p><p></p><p>Useless to the Exorcism Department, but useful to Xuanhuang, as well as the previous six eerie items, Xuanhuang was thinking about how to turn them from waste into treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't use them himself, he could refine them and add them to Mount Qingyun's treasure trove, which could be exchanged for points.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang first picked up the Eerie Clock, as he was very interested in this item. Especially the inner world, which he hadn't explored these past few days. Taking this opportunity to investigate the inner world, he could then refine it again or fuse it with other items.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

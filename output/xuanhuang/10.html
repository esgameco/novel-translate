        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three days had passed in a flash, during which Xuanhuang encountered two instances of animal mutation.</p><p></p><p>Both were the result of his own negligence, otherwise it would have been impossible for any animals to enter.</p><p></p><p>It was a wild cat and a wild dog.</p><p></p><p>The sinister invasion coupled with animal mutation, as the abandoned pets of domesticated cats and dogs were numerous in the wilderness area.</p><p></p><p>And Xuanhuang had undergone three days of tempering, and at this moment he had reached the seventh layer of body refinement and the seventh layer of will refinement.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the peak of martial artists and immortal cultivators in this realm.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists in this realm, the advancement of each layer was not as significant as Xuanhuang's. According to the Zhenxie APP forum, the strongest martial artist in this realm had a colossal strength of 6,000 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>Further advancement would risk losing control.</p><p></p><p>It seems that for the nine layers of body refinement, every three layers is a checkpoint, and a strength of 7,000 kilograms represents entering the late stage of body refinement. The will control of martial artists in this realm is only at the initial stage of will refinement, which may be the ultimate limit.</p><p></p><p>In three days, Xuanhuang had refined and assimilated the ferocious beasts that were catalyzed out and the ones that had invaded on their own, and he had also consumed one bottle of the Great Elixir to reach his current realm.</p><p></p><p>The further one goes, the more energy and fuel is required.</p><p></p><p>The remaining ten bottles of the Great Elixir are sufficient, and if that's not enough, he can continue to catalyze ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation grows stronger, his will also becomes stronger, and he handles the ferocious beasts with ease. The only time-consuming thing is the mutated ferocious beasts from the blood pool, which is a bit of a hassle.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness space, the area has expanded from 10 meters to 50 meters.</p><p></p><p>The seventh layer of will can control an area of 70 meters in radius, and Xuanhuang has left himself ample room, not controlling the full 70 meters, as that would be too strenuous.</p><p></p><p>Now he has much more leeway, and the items he can absorb have even reached over 20,000 jin.</p><p></p><p>The will at the late stage of refinement has played a significant role.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the seventh layer, Xuanhuang clearly feels that his will is undergoing a transformation, becoming more refined.</p><p></p><p>If previously it was relying on imagination, now he can truly sense it.</p><p></p><p>There are also changes in his physique, with his qi and blood surging, and he can even emanate a mist-like burst, though he still cannot detach it from his body.</p><p></p><p>It's very similar to the nature of qi and blood like smoke, except the qi and blood mist is still very thin. Xuanhuang feels that if he can perfect his body refinement, he will truly achieve the state of qi and blood like smoke.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the first stage, the detached qi and blood power, combined with his will, will allow Xuanhuang to manifest the three insights he has gained: the Heavenly Furnace, the Great Grinder, and the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>As long as he doesn't lose control, once he reaches the first stage, he will have the ability to contend with the sinister, regardless of whether it's qi refinement, body refinement, or spirit refinement.</p><p></p><p>This was inherent, it's just that the Tao of this realm has been distorted.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Xuanhuang's methods of dealing with the sinister will be unleashed.</p><p></p><p>With his will coalescing into a tangible gaseous form, as long as he slightly taps into the power of the small world within his consciousness space, he will be able to form a domain in the real world where his will is the will of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Within this domain, the rules do not encroach, unless the sinister is far superior to Xuanhuang. Within the same level, the rules of the sinister cannot affect Xuanhuang within his domain.</p><p></p><p>With his will solidified into a tangible form, even in a gaseous state, it can still be used against enemies.</p><p></p><p>Weak sinister beings will be directly replaced and have their source principles taken over by Xuanhuang's will.</p><p></p><p>The will can also be combined with qi and blood, used with the Void Saber, extended as an expansion of the consciousness world, or used for enchantments, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Once I cross into the first stage, the sinister will become my new fuel."</p><p></p><p>The composed Xuanhuang, after gaining such formidable power, also has a touch of "loftiness", his thoughts momentarily becoming unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>However, he soon regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>In these three days,</p><p></p><p>Jinning arrived as scheduled, and each time he saw Xuanhuang, he felt a difference.</p><p></p><p>He always had the sense that Xuanhuang was becoming more ethereal, with the aura of a cultivated immortal.</p><p></p><p>Those who knew understood that Xuanhuang was doing his "mountain viewing" work, while those who didn't would think Xuanhuang was cultivating deep in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't hide or keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>In this kind of world, with such strength, there's no need for low-key behavior.</p><p></p><p>He intends to become a man who opens the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Jinning also brought news of the recent events in the Southern City, which were more or less the same, with countless risks appearing every night.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the troublesome sinister alley did not appear.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there is now another existence in the Southern City that has successfully tamed the sinister, which excited Jinning's usually cold expression when he told Xuanhuang about it.</p><p></p><p>He also told Xuanhuang that he had found a replacement for him, a civilian who had just become a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>However, this place is Xuanhuang's feng shui treasure land, so Xuanhuang refused the replacement.</p><p></p><p>He said that the civilian should go handle other matters for the next ten days or half a month.</p><p></p><p>Jinning thought about it, and since Xuanhuang had just reported three incidents, the newly minted martial artist civilian wouldn't be as outrageous as Xuanhuang, so for safety's sake, Jinning agreed to Xuanhuang's request.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang is ultimately a "martial master" in combat power, and such a person is too much of a waste here, so he will be transferred away after some time, as there are places that need him more.</p><p></p><p>That day!</p><p></p><p>"Old Jin, wait."</p><p></p><p>After delivering the supplies and chatting with Xuanhuang, just as Jinning was about to leave, he was called back by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then took out a painting, which had a flickering spiritual aura and an indescribable qi lingering around it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The painting was precisely the "Visualization of the Crucible of Heaven and Earth" by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"If you have nothing to do, you can use your mental focus to sketch this image in your mind. If you can clearly outline the three-legged bronze cauldron in this image, you may gain something."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was not a person who liked to joke around, and Jin Ning was the same way - both had a somewhat cold demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xuanhuang say this, Jin Ning felt that he was not joking, as this was not Xuanhuang's character.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning chose to believe him, as Xuanhuang had been changing day by day in these past few days. </p><p></p><p>Besides Xuanhuang himself, the one who probably understood him the most was Jin Ning, who delivered supplies to him every day. Although curious about Xuanhuang's changes, the taciturn Jin Ning could hardly bring himself to say anything superfluous.</p><p></p><p>Since Xuanhuang was doing this, he would just accept it.</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, you must bring this image every day, don't forget." After seeing Jin Ning's acceptance, Xuanhuang added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll see you tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand and turned to walk up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"...Strange fellow."</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, Jin Ning still carefully put away the image and then drove off.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back in the safe house in the mountain cave, Xuanhuang fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"If my will reaches the Transcendent Fourth Stage and I can achieve the level of Fa having a spiritual entity, I won't need to add will and spiritual inspiration to the visualization image every day. Now I can only add it once a day."</p><p></p><p>A visualization image infused with the spiritual inspiration of the Transcendent Fourth Stage will self-absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and the spiritual charm attached to it for people to comprehend will never fade.</p><p></p><p>The visualization image he is currently making can also allow people to visualize, but it requires daily refinement to be effective.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it is still relying on the will of the small world to add the spiritual energy, as Xuanhuang himself cannot do it yet.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit troublesome, but as an experiment, this little trouble is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, if it works, it will bring hope to the people of this world."</p><p></p><p>"That is my wish."</p><p></p><p>All things and matters need to be built upon a foundation. Xuanhuang is paving the way by deducing the Dao, then crowd-funding the forging of tools, and crowd-funding the expansion of his small world all require a foundation.</p><p></p><p>Now he is starting the experiment, and when he reaches the Transcendent Fourth Stage, he can quickly and seamlessly connect everything.</p><p></p><p>So that when he achieves the Transcendent Fourth Stage, the cultivators he has crowd-funded will already be prepared.</p><p></p><p>On the other side...</p><p></p><p>Driving back to the martial arts hall, Jin Ning, as usual, reported to the deputy hall master Wu Gang.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang said that?" </p><p></p><p>Jin Ning nodded and said, "Yes, he said there's no rush for now, as the new martial artists cannot handle the strange situation of the blood pool."</p><p></p><p>"This kid, he's a new martial artist too... No, a martial master..." Wu Gang chuckled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jin Ning's reports day after day, if it weren't for Jin Ning's calm and indifferent personality, Wu Gang would have thought Jin Ning was joking.</p><p></p><p>Changing day by day, becoming a martial master after going to the mountain for three days. </p><p></p><p>Was he going to see the mountain or to cultivate the Dao?</p><p></p><p>If Wu Gang wasn't tied up as the deputy hall master, he would have gone to take a look himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go rest now. This afternoon, go to Zhangxian County to investigate the paper person incident."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning nodded in agreement, then left Wu Gang's office.</p><p></p><p>Back in his own cultivation room, Jin Ning took out the visualization image given by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning carefully looked it over, but couldn't find anything strange about it.</p><p></p><p>"This is a visualization image?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning had heard of visualization images before, they existed in the small cultivation worlds, but after the strange invasion, they were no longer useful.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try."</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't see anything unusual, Jin Ning could only try to condense the image in his spiritual sea according to what Xuanhuang had said.</p><p></p><p>Whether cultivating immortality or practicing martial arts, entering a focused state of mind and regulating one's breath is a necessary prerequisite. As a martial artist, Jin Ning was very familiar with this.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's this?"</p><p></p><p>As he focused on the visualization image and sank into his spiritual sea to start outlining the Crucible of Heaven and Earth, Jin Ning suddenly awoke with a start.</p><p></p><p>"The Crucible of Heaven and Earth"</p><p></p><p>Even before he had outlined the appearance of the crucible, just as he began visualizing it, his spiritual soul shook.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual inspiration in the depths told him the name of this image, like a kind of imprint.</p><p></p><p>To visualize it, you must first know its true name.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary visualization images are just like paintings, without any spiritual charm, and thus useless.</p><p></p><p>If you go to observe and meditate on them, you will only become confused and unable to enter your spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>Visualization images with spiritual charm are different.</p><p></p><p>As long as you can capture the spiritual charm within, it will resonate with your spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>These spiritual charms will enter your spiritual sea and become a true presence.</p><p></p><p>As long as you can completely visualize such a visualization image, it will be imprinted in your spiritual soul, impossible to forget, and a single thought can bring it to life.</p><p></p><p>"A visualization image with spiritual charm, this... Hasn't been distorted by the strange energy?" </p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was somewhat shocked. A visualization image with spiritual charm, yet it had not been twisted by the strange will of the heavens?</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? What protected the spiritual charm of this image from being distorted?"</p><p></p><p>Doubts, shock, bewilderment, disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning's heart was in turmoil, completely defying his common sense.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

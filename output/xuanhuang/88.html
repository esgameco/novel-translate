        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The layers of barriers were unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>Transforming the body, imitating temperament was just a small trick.</p><p></p><p>Opening the private room door, a young girl's agonizing scream reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Wei Zixuan and Wu Deli were brutally engaging in primitive actions, rampant and unrestrained, with wails and laughter intertwined.</p><p></p><p>With so many people present, and two ladies as well, Xuanhuang couldn't understand the reason for this perverse behavior.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps their minds were abnormal.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, how's Big Tiger brother doing?" </p><p></p><p>The unconcerned Wu Deli asked while thrusting his hips.</p><p></p><p>"Come over, let me tell you all Gou Dianzhus' exact words."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang called out impassively, beckoning everyone to gather and discuss.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Deli casually threw away the young girl, like discarding trash, and quickly pulled up his pants to come over.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang sat down next to the eldest, Wu Deren.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan came over, his "sexual interest unsatisfied", and the change in this person was too great compared to their first meeting.</p><p></p><p>The first time they met briefly, Wei Zixuan was solemn and aloof, indifferent to the people of the martial arts hall, when they first dealt with the strange blood pool.</p><p></p><p>Now his appearance was ugly, exuding a lewd, twisted aura.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's actions went unnoticed by the others, only the sinister old leader Wu Deren had a slight tremor, but he soon shook his head and ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Drawn by the other half of the divine blood rewarded to "Dagger Tiger".</p><p></p><p>The three of them were fighting each other, none of them wanted to get involved, so obtaining the soothing medicine and divine blood was difficult, without a good way.</p><p></p><p>Each time they obtained the soothing medicine, they had to resort to underhanded means, or robbery.</p><p></p><p>This time they took on the task, which was considered to resolve a major crisis, if they didn't soothe their twisted spiritual souls, they would truly become bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group of eight people - the three Sinister Mouse brothers, the four from the Exorcism Department, and their "companion" Liu Yuting gathered and seated, waiting for him to speak.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, tonight is a dark and windy night suitable for killing... no, not people, but killing the bizarre, there are some who need to be erased and forgotten."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>The eight were puzzled, involuntarily pondering what it meant? In that instant, they all unconsciously pondered and wondered.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous repulsive force assaulted them.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The entire space where the nine were seated, as if suddenly a large hole was broken through.</p><p></p><p>A gaping maw swallowed everything, including the eight people and the tables and chairs they were sitting around, as well as everything on the tables and chairs.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Only the dozen or so young girls who were knocked aside let out a cry of alarm, regaining their senses and looking at the group that had suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"Dagger Tiger, what do you want to do? Looking for death?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--"</p><p></p><p>In a distorted space, everything was shrouded in a hazy gray, with distant illusory mountains, bizarre to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The group of eight were pulled by Xuanhuang with all his might, dragged into the world of the Sinister Bell, or the time fragment space.</p><p></p><p>There was the second-tier Sinister Mouse leader Wu Deren, whom Xuanhuang had no confidence in directly suppressing.</p><p></p><p>There were also the peak first-tier Sinister Mouse brothers Wu Deyi and Wu Deli, and even Dong Xingbao was a peak first-tier bizarre ability.</p><p></p><p>With so many people, if it were in the real world, Xuanhuang would only dare to guarantee that he would not be defeated in a fight with the three Sinister Mouse brothers, but he would not be able to kill them.</p><p></p><p>He could only pull them all into the inner world.</p><p></p><p>Here, after Xuanhuang's exploration, there were two paths to walk out.</p><p></p><p>One was to break through the illusion and go out to the memory river, and the other was the entrance of the Sinister Bell.</p><p></p><p>To break through the illusion and go to the memory river, these people could not do it, they needed the fourth-tier true self condensation to explore.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang could walk out with the help of his abnormal spiritual soul's super-ego.</p><p></p><p>As for the entrance of the Sinister Bell, Xuanhuang had placed it at the Exorcism Monument site, although he could not use the power of the Exorcism Monument, but he could rely on its might.</p><p></p><p>By placing the Sinister Bell at the site where the energy of the Exorcism Monument circulates, it is equivalent to the path of the Sinister Bell being covered by the Exorcism Monument.</p><p></p><p>Even for the small borrowing, it was not something that the highest second-tier spiritualists like them could break open.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there is another path, which is the path connected by the Wooden Chains.</p><p></p><p>This is an existence controlled by Xuanhuang, and it is also the means he intends to use to defend against the enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Xuanhuang?"</p><p>"Aren't you Dagger Tiger?"</p><p></p><p>The eight suppressed their shock and quickly scanned the hazy and bizarre land, looking for a way out.</p><p></p><p>While trying to communicate with Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, only to see Wei Zixuan's feet were entangled by tree roots, violently pulling him into the ground, leaving a hole filled with fresh blood and flesh fragments.</p><p></p><p>This was a forceful pull into the ground, his body was torn apart by the small hole and the huge pulling force.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, save..."</p><p></p><p>An incomplete agonizing scream came from the small hole.</p><p></p><p>Instantly the hole closed up, as if it had never existed, only the blood-mixed black soil proved that it had existed.</p><p></p><p>"No?"</p><p></p><p>Some people were on the verge of collapse, like Exorcism Department's Lü Yuan and Sun Xuelian.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zixuan had just disappeared, this place was too sinister, wouldn't the next unlucky one be themselves?</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang, we have no enmity, it was Gou Jianren's plotting, my three brothers and I have no intention of killing you, can we discuss it?"</p><p></p><p>Only to see Wu Deren's appearance had already changed greatly, with a huge rat head, the rat's mouth emitting corrosive and dissolving black gas, the blood-red rat eyes captivating, with a power that once locked on, one would be immobilized.</p><p></p><p>The second brother Wu Deyi had an even greater transformation, with a rat body but a human head, the disgusting rat body oozing rotten black blood, the contours of countless bloody faces fleetingly appearing, like countless pieces of flesh and blood randomly combined, the black blood flowing on the ground, turning into a muddy swamp.</p><p></p><p>As for the third brother Wu Deli, his transformation was the smallest, only adding a huge rat tail.</p><p></p><p>The fur on the tail was like deadly needles, as long as they were activated, they could shoot out poisonous needles. And the rat tail had three sections, only the bare bones had no flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Forming a three-section rat tail, each section was independent yet integrated, severing the tail to survive, representing each section having one life.</p><p></p><p>And the bizarre abilities of the three brothers were completely a unified rat segmentation.</p><p></p><p>Only the leader, who had mastered two bizarre abilities, had a rat head, rat mouth and rat eyes as two bizarre abilities.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to see that the three brothers had great opportunities, almost obtaining an inherited bizarre puzzle.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, the three from the Exorcism Department and Liu Yuting didn't have anything special, Dong Xingbao's hair had turned into a swaying green grass.</p><p></p><p>Lü Yuan had a glass ball bizarre ability, able to explore and hallucinate, Sun Xuelian had a pair of blood-red embroidered shoes on her feet.</p><p></p><p>And Liu Yuting's hair was like snakes, a weakened version of Medusa.</p><p></p><p>But these people were all first-tier existences, as long as they were first-tier, Xuanhuang didn't care, he had solved the time-type bizarre Sinister Bell himself, let alone these common threats that were not much of a threat.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang, I was instigated by others, I have no intention of targeting you, I helped spread the news that you have transcended the martial dao, we are friends not enemies."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao was anxious, the grass on his head swaying.</p><p></p><p>His words actually contained an unstable spiritual soul, making people's thoughts unsteady, the temptation to sway with the wind.</p><p></p><p>Because of swaying with the wind, and avoiding harm for self-interest, it made him very difficult to lock down, an almost first-class survival ability.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were mystical rules that always allowed him to avoid being hit or attacked.</p><p></p><p>Wallflower's strangeness? Xuanhuang had never seen such an absurd and bizarre ability before, more like a tiny branch of the power of fate and causality.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't escape the lock of causality and destiny, but ordinary locks and attacks could be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was dancing on the line of death, but he always managed to miraculously dodge and resolve it.</p><p></p><p>There was also a kind of ability that could make people ignore or even forget him, allowing him to easily blend in anywhere without drawing attention.</p><p></p><p>It was a very special and rare ability.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, enough nonsense, he doesn't even want to talk to us," Wude Ren said coldly, his rat-like mouth emitting black gas.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wude Ren's words and Xuanhuang's continued silence, the others felt a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had quickly refined and absorbed Wei Zixuan, obtaining a black hole-like giant mouth that could devour everything, including thoughts and memories. But Xuanhuang didn't have time to study it.</p><p></p><p>Although he had pulled the eight of them into this inner world and instantly killed Wei Zixuan, as Wude Ren said, he had difficulty killing the three brothers.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's plan was to exhaust them. As long as the two passages remained unbreakable, they wouldn't be able to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuanhuang's cultivation was at the third layer of the Xuan Change Refining Will, with a top-tier One Gate Two Pillars. But he still hadn't consolidated the third Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could consolidate the third Heavenly Pillar, his strength would rise again. Even if he couldn't directly contend with the three Rat Brothers, as long as he could reach the level of Two Gates Four Pillars, which would take about 20 days, he would be confident in fighting them.</p><p></p><p>"I can outlast you, and you will be trapped here," Xuanhuang thought, having no intention of communicating with them.</p><p></p><p>The Rat Brothers were not human, so Xuanhuang had no reason to seek them out. His goal was to stop them from continuing to harm people, as they were a disaster in motion.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang clearly remembered the events in the secret room, with the two cold corpses of the young girls in the corner, and the unknown fate of the other dozen or so girls. This was the secret location of the Anomaly Association, which was both righteous and evil.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had already defined them as the evil path, providing ordinary girls as sacrifices for the Ling Masters to abuse and vent their desires. This was undoubtedly evil.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang wouldn't use morality and bottom lines to dictate others, but he would use them to regulate himself. If he felt something was wrong, he would act on it.</p><p></p><p>In this inner world, after Xuanhuang's instant kill of Wei Zixuan, the other seven became much more cautious, fully unleashing their anomalous powers.</p><p></p><p>An hour passed, and the three brothers were frantically searching for a way out, with one exploring and two guarding, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tragic scream rang out - it was Liu Yueting. A sword beam had appeared out of nowhere, instantly cutting her in half at the waist, and she was dragged into the ground by tree roots.</p><p></p><p>Wude Ren immediately unleashed a black mist to viciously corrode and dissolve the tree roots, but the damage was not severe, and the roots quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang frowned, realizing that the second-layer attacks were indeed powerful, even lightly grazing causing significant damage. The gap between the first and second layers was like heaven and earth, an insurmountable chasm for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"The goal is achieved, trapping them here. At least they can't escape or do any more harm," Xuanhuang thought, choosing a tactical delay rather than a retreat.</p><p></p><p>He withdrew the connection with the wooden spirit, confident that with the Anomaly Clock, he wouldn't get lost. "See you tomorrow night," he said, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Wude Ren felt the threatening presence disappear, thinking Xuanhuang couldn't hold out and that they might have a chance to find a way out. The other three also quickly withdrew their anomalous powers, desperate to survive.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang returned to Qingyun Mountain, not immediately dealing with the anomalous hair of Liu Yueting and the blood mouth of Wei Zixuan. His priority was to consolidate his third Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Team leader, what does 'Director Dong' mean? I don't understand," the subordinate asked.</p><p></p><p>The team leader did not respond, but instead had a serious expression on his face, recalling Director Dong's words.</p><p></p><p>"You all say that Deputy Director Jia has disappeared. Could it be that Xuanhuang did it?" the leader asked.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang? That's impossible, right? How could he do it? Why would he do it?"</p><p></p><p>The team members hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Why can't he? Who created the mysterious corpse tree at the peak of the first level?" The leader said impatiently, "Is it because you all ignored Xuanhuang's existence when Deputy Director Jia suppressed the news?"</p><p></p><p>"You are all spirit masters. Put aside your pathetic pride and ask yourselves honestly, can you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Us?" </p><p></p><p>The spirit master team members felt embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They had indeed ignored Xuanhuang, and Deputy Director Jia had suppressed the news, causing them to also pretend Xuanhuang didn't exist.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had forgotten the shocking news of Xuanhuang's martial arts prowess, and also forgotten Xuanhuang's absent-minded state when he resolved the mysterious corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>In the end, their position determined their mindset. Standing as spirit masters, they were unwilling to acknowledge the rise of a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Could it really be this martial artist Xuanhuang who did it?" one team member angrily said, "Hmph, what a huge nerve, daring to plot against the people of our Exorcism Department. This is outrageous. Team leader, let's go arrest him right now."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" </p><p></p><p>The team leader shouted coldly. </p><p></p><p>Looking at his subordinates, he wondered if this guy was about to lose control, or if he had lost his mind. "Do you have any evidence?"</p><p></p><p>The man was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have evidence, can you defeat him? Deputy Director Jia disappeared without a trace. Can you surpass Deputy Director Jia?"</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The angry team member felt his scalp tingle, feeling like he was about to gain some wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"Team leader, can we just let this go?" </p><p></p><p>The team leader sighed deeply, "This is not for us to decide. Since Director Dong doesn't care, what can we do? Let's wait for Director Xu to come back before deciding anything."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, fine."</p><p></p><p>The calmed down team member finally realized that he probably couldn't defeat Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was no longer the time before the invasion of the mysterious, when law enforcement could just investigate and summon suspects on suspicion alone.</p><p></p><p>Now that the powerful forces had been consolidated, things were in disarray.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and immediately release the news about Xuanhuang's martial arts prowess. Spread the news that such a person has appeared in our Southern City, as Director Dong said, he is the pride of our Southern City."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The team leader realized that as long as he let go and opened his mind, everything would be fine.</p><p></p><p>In today's internet age, especially after the invasion of the mysterious, the orthodox internet has gradually disappeared. The mysterious network controlled by the Daoist masters has become an irreplaceable tool.</p><p></p><p>The high-level Daoist Gao Jue learned about the team leader and Director Dong's conversation that morning.</p><p></p><p>He immediately called his master, Daoist Ma.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the news I gathered is that Director Dong is letting it go, and the young members of the investigation team seem unwilling to continue taking action."</p><p></p><p>Daoist Ma was relieved to hear this, feeling that things were developing in a good direction. </p><p></p><p>It was like waiting for the clouds to part and see the sun. Although he himself didn't do anything, the mere participation was important.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Gao Jue, continue to investigate the news, and tell me everything related to Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Hesitating, Gao Jue on the other end of the phone asked, "Master, do you trust Xuanhuang so much?"</p><p></p><p>"What Xuanhuang, call him Master Xuan. My Dao path is all on Master Xuan, how could I not pay attention to him."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue felt frustrated, "Master, you keep calling him Master Xuan, what about me? Should I call you Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there a possibility that we spirit masters can also learn Xuan... Master Xuan's techniques? I heard you talking about refining the will, since ordinary people can do it, can we do it too?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue was actually quite sad. After all, he was still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Little was adopted by Taoist priest Ma. For over twenty years, he has been a Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>Aspiring to cultivate immortality is not just a longing, but an intense desire.</p><p></p><p>By chance, he has mastered the Devilish Eyes, but he has never given up his ambition to cultivate immortality.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, your master has also been considering this recently. It's not just you, but also your senior disciple Gao Ming's situation. You are still lacking, but your senior disciple's condition is not good."</p><p></p><p>That's right, Taoist priest Ma is an extraordinary person, and he has another disciple named Gao Ming, who can manipulate the Devilish Eyes, possessing the ability to see through illusions and perceive the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>This ability is not particularly powerful in terms of destructive force, but it is more effective in a supportive role.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they went to the headquarters of the Exorcism Department.</p><p></p><p>Working at the headquarters, Gao Ming often uses his bizarre abilities, so the demonic influence has become more severe, already on the verge of losing control.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the headquarters is aware of Gao Ming's importance and has provided him with many divine blood and other medicinal treatments.</p><p></p><p>But the situation is still not ideal.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Taoist priest Ma has also been pondering the Xuanhuang techniques, both from the martial arts school and from his own inquiries. He has been studying them thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>As a Taoist priest who has been seeking the Dao all his life, his abilities are naturally not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>After his careful contemplation, he has indeed gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>"Your master has done some research, but unfortunately, I cannot solve the problems you and your senior disciple are facing. According to my speculative guesses, you both belong to the 'spiritual root' existence, so you are in sync with the demonic forces and can manipulate them."</p><p></p><p>"That's precisely why you and the demonic forces resonate at the same frequency. However, this relationship is not stable. If there is even a slight fluctuation in this frequency, it will lead to a systemic collapse."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if the demonic forces are a magnetic field, and you yourselves are also a magnetic field, but the demonic magnetic field is the evolution of chaotic fragments, while you are just small individual magnetic fields. This is an unequal relationship. Although you have managed to resonate, one is too strong, and the other is too weak."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan's method is to refine the will, but I cannot guarantee that if you refine your will, it won't lead to a loss of control due to the strengthening of the frequency resonance."</p><p></p><p>"Unless someone with great magical power can lower the frequency of the demonic forces you control, or temporarily seal them, and then you can strengthen yourself after severing the connection, and then gradually confront them."</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue on the other end of the phone listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "Master, I've seen a study that says the ultimate path for us Spiritual Masters is to completely merge with the demonic forces, replacing their distorted primal instincts with our own spiritual intelligence. Isn't that a viable option?"</p><p></p><p>"Difficult, difficult, difficult," Taoist priest Ma sighed.</p><p></p><p>"That is the ultimate beautiful aspiration, but as I said, humans are too weak, and the demonic rules are too strong. Who can guarantee that after you completely merge with the demonic forces, your spiritual intelligence will still exist and not be erased in the process of fusion?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if someone succeeds, not to mention one in ten thousand, it would be difficult to find even one in a hundred thousand. It's simply courting death."</p><p></p><p>"There are not a few Spiritual Masters who take the risk of losing control and try to gamble, but have you ever heard of anyone succeeding?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue heard this and felt his future prospects were bleak.</p><p></p><p>"Master, does this mean there's no way out? Can we only continue the piecemeal fusion, or find something that can repel them and gradually strengthen ourselves? If the chance of completely merging with one demonic force is 0, is the chance of controlling two 50%, and three 77%?"</p><p></p><p>This is the most optimistic projection.</p><p></p><p>It means that when you completely merge with the demonic forces, you are facing the demonic forces as your opponent, a one-on-one battle.</p><p></p><p>This is equivalent to courting death, as the human spirit and soul can never surpass the demonic rules.</p><p></p><p>But controlling two, with yourself making three, the two demonic forces will fight each other first, and the human may be able to take advantage.</p><p></p><p>Controlling three, with yourself making four, the three demonic forces will battle it out to determine the dominant one, and the human's chance of benefiting will be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just a theory, and no one has succeeded so far.</p><p></p><p>Because the more you control, the stronger the demonic forces become. If you can't defeat a first-tier demonic force, you certainly can't expect to defeat a combination of three second-tier demonic forces.</p><p></p><p>Even if the combination is third-tier, the individual ones are at least second-tier.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

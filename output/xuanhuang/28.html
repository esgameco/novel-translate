        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As they approached the doorway, everyone could smell a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>Just as the old man had said, it was truly pungent.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's eyes were different now, he saw more.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the door was filled with a sense of decay, as if it had undergone a long period of weathering.</p><p></p><p>There was also a hint of bloodiness.</p><p></p><p>The door was locked, but with a single glance from Xuanhuang, the lock was instantly crushed into a metal ball.</p><p></p><p>Yun Fei and Sun Tong were dumbfounded, especially Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>She had not experienced Xuanhuang's teachings, having been summoned by her uncle Sun Hui that morning.</p><p></p><p>However, she could be considered an early graduate, as the Sun family had produced a figure like the headmaster Sun Hui, so the martial arts were flourishing.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was currently a sophomore and had reached the warrior level, so she could graduate early.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had not graduated early to avoid gossip from the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing Xuanhuang's extraordinary abilities, the "upright" headmaster Sun Hui no longer cared about such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>He said, "Go ahead, I want to arrange for my niece to be Xuanshi's assistant."</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi has worked so hard, researching the martial arts for the sake of all humanity, for the future of humanity... What's wrong with arranging a female assistant for him? If you're not satisfied, you can also cultivate and teach."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Sun Tong's understanding of Xuanhuang was based only on her uncle's description.</p><p></p><p>She was not foolish or princess-like, with a normal mindset, and did not have a hysterical reaction after hearing about the arrangement.</p><p></p><p>But she was curious about Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>She also understood her uncle's good intentions.</p><p></p><p>By serving as an assistant to such an existence, as the saying goes, "the one closest to the water tower gets the moon first."</p><p></p><p>If she steadily and diligently assists, and aligns herself with Xuanhuang, there will surely be benefits that fall upon her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, without seeing Xuanhuang make any grand gestures, the solid lock was instantly crushed into a metal ball, leaving her astonished.</p><p></p><p>This unassuming act made it seem even more extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>If Xuanhuang had performed a flamboyant display of techniques, the shock would not have been as great.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Li, you don't need to go in, just wait downstairs."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the situation, as long as they entered the door, they would enter a strange space.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang made the arrangement, as it would be dangerous for ordinary people to enter.</p><p></p><p>The people from the martial arts school were all at the warrior level, and there were even some at the martial teacher level, like Wu Gang.</p><p></p><p>Even Sun Tong, who had not experienced actual combat, was at the warrior level.</p><p></p><p>At least on the surface, she was a "hundred-person enemy."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you all be careful," Li Li agreed decisively.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't want to go in, as she always felt uneasy about it.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was no danger inside, as someone who had experienced such a strange incident, she just wanted to stay as far away as possible and not get involved with this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we're professionals," Xuanhuang assured her.</p><p></p><p>The few people from the martial arts school looked at each other, thinking: We are professionals at cleanup and support.</p><p></p><p>Li Li quickly went downstairs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Based on my judgment, as long as you enter this door, you will enter a strange space. So everyone, be careful, don't be curious, don't move around too much, don't waste time, and do as I say, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"We understand," the four people expressed their support.</p><p></p><p>"And you don't need to be afraid, it's just a first-level strange phenomenon, not the top-tier kind. It's a bit stronger than a newly born strange phenomenon, but I have experience, so don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang comforted them.</p><p></p><p>"This?" Wu Gang detected a hint of the unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanshi, have you experienced this before?"</p><p></p><p>"Not long ago, I sealed a strange painting brush with the ability to enter dreams. It's not that terrifying, and as long as your willpower is cultivated to... " Xuanhuang suddenly paused, then criticized, "Speaking of which, I have an opinion on the titles. What's with all this 'martial disciple,' 'warrior,' 'martial teacher' nonsense? If you haven't reached the advancement, just call everyone a 'martial disciple' from now on."</p><p></p><p>After the criticism, the four people looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wu Gang, who had been demoted from a martial teacher to a rookie disciple.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare to argue.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang continued, "...Hmm, as long as your willpower reaches the seventh layer of a martial disciple, even a typical first-level strange phenomenon won't be able to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You've been pulled into the bizarre rules, your will will form your own defense, and even the weak bizarre ones will find it difficult to pull you into the bizarre laws."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, there's nothing to be afraid of. What's scary is that you don't have the power to deal with it, can't solve the problem, that's what's scary."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, stick close."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Xuanhuang pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>"Creak!" A sudden cold aura swept over them.</p><p></p><p>The moment he stepped in, Sun Tong looked back, and the door they had entered was already gone, replaced by layers of indistinct mist.</p><p></p><p>"Here they come!"</p><p></p><p>The anxious group was awakened by Xuanhuang's words.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they don't want to control their nervousness, but they can't.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre space is not something you can avoid by trying to stay calm, not nervous, and not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Its aura sweeps over you, and those who haven't transcended the ordinary can't control it.</p><p></p><p>"It hurts, it hurts so much, don't sew me, don't..."</p><p></p><p>Chilling cries came from the mist, like a child begging for help.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>What appeared before the five people was a dimly lit small room, with the back of a woman bent over a desk, seemingly working.</p><p></p><p>The desk looked like an operating table.</p><p></p><p>On the operating table was a dismembered, shattered doll.</p><p></p><p>The doll's pitiful cries, but the woman seemed not to hear them.</p><p></p><p>She was holding a needle and thread, hesitating, as if considering how to stitch.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she moved and began to sew the leg.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, get away!"</p><p></p><p>This cry came from Sun Tong and the others.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang watched this scene with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that the four had been pulled into the illusion.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, the bizarre one was sewing the doll, and they felt that it was sewing them.</p><p></p><p>The reason Xuanhuang didn't enter was because this thing was really weak. At first, a beam of light like a needle tip struck his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>But... the needle tip broke instantly.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't he intervene?</p><p></p><p>Isn't this a trial for the newcomers?</p><p></p><p>In a critical moment, he can step in himself, but for now the others are not in danger.</p><p></p><p>It's just sewing the leg, there's still the arm, viscera, and head.</p><p></p><p>No hurry.</p><p></p><p>Through his transcendent eyes, Xuanhuang examined everything.</p><p></p><p>The mist was seen through, and it was actually a dim living room.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the living room lay two bodies, a man and a woman, their faces stripped off.</p><p></p><p>The bodies were already rotten, but fortunately it was late autumn, so the disgusting "insects" were not there.</p><p></p><p>Presumably these were the parents of the deceased.</p><p></p><p>And in the west corner of the living room, the bedroom door was slightly ajar, with dried blood stains spreading from the doorway.</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the room, a broken box contained a doll that was bizarrely busy with needle and thread.</p><p></p><p>Very focused and meticulous, sewing its own broken body.</p><p></p><p>The doll was covered in countless threads, as if it had been cut open and sewn countless times.</p><p></p><p>Half of its body was stained with blood, looking very creepy.</p><p></p><p>Locked in Xuanhuang's gaze.</p><p></p><p>The doll's needle and thread work paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But immediately, it resumed the regular sewing of its broken body.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the bizarre one that just came into being is not the killer of the woman, but the doll that harmed her."</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to guess that the woman's back in the previous bizarre illusion was the deceased.</p><p></p><p>"No, don't stab me, it hurts--"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong's agonizing scream came.</p><p></p><p>Rookies are rookies, they're all martial artists...? No, they're all in the initial stage of apprenticeship. Cloud Fly and Jin Ning are gritting their teeth and persisting, one is sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>The gritting-teeth Jin Ning is probably fighting for his life against the bizarre in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>The sweating Cloud Fly is probably running away from the bizarre in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>Only the rookie Sun Tong has been caught by the bizarre in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>As for Wu Gang?</p><p></p><p>Tightly clenching his fists, not uttering a word, it seems he is also counterattacking.</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is the way of heaven."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked up at the pitch-black night sky and said, "The world is changing, the will of heaven is twisted, the human way has more than enough to supplement the deficiency, but it is not acceptable to have too much surplus. Excess will lead to loss of control."</p><p></p><p>"We can only replace the will of heaven with our own will, reduce the surplus and make up for the deficiency, achieve the unity of essence, energy, and spirit, and then temper the will."</p><p></p><p>"So the elder's meaning is that our energy and spirit are stronger than our essence. If the essence is like firewood and is consumed, it will become more imbalanced. The imbalanced essence, energy, and spirit will be difficult to coordinate and unify, and thus fail to achieve the purpose of tempering the will."</p><p></p><p>Li Tong immediately expressed the meaning according to Xuanhuang's words.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the meaning."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Li Tong felt relieved, finally managing to say a word that the elder approved of and was satisfied with before the Taoist master.</p><p></p><p>The bystanders, Wu Gang, Sun Hui, Sun Tong, and others, felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, isn't this the prototype of their own recent efforts to perform well?</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing did not compete with the pavilion master and the Taoist master.</p><p></p><p>She timidly asked, "But, we don't have the better method, the Furnace Nine Refinements that the elder has, do we?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Deputy Pavilion Master Xia, you don't need to speak for now."</p><p></p><p>Although Li Tong said this, he was secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>This is a good subordinate, asking what he himself was too embarrassed to ask.</p><p></p><p>The dust has settled, and he has supported Xuanhuang and the martial arts pavilion correctly.</p><p></p><p>Now it's time to reap the rewards. Even if they are just cheering, their full support is at the risk of being hated by the evil people in the Exorcism Department.</p><p></p><p>Those evil people cannot deal with the martial arts pavilion with Xuanhuang in charge, but it would be easy to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>If anything happens, they can just blame the supernatural, as people die all the time anyway.</p><p></p><p>"This can be done."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was not the kind of person who would force others to satisfy his own special preferences.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts pavilion is risking danger to come and cheer, even if they are useless, their attitude is shown.</p><p></p><p>Providing them with a path forward is simple, especially since he had already planned to promote it.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the biggest beneficiary will be himself.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the martial arts pavilion's experts are all diligently contemplating and visualizing the diagram, but no one has been able to refine it completely.</p><p></p><p>As long as they can refine the complete visualization diagram, it will be the beginning of binding with the Furnace of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Their future cultivation will all strengthen the Furnace of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's small, gathering sand into a tower, collecting feathers into a coat, the future is what matters.</p><p></p><p>Isn't letting the martial arts pavilion comprehend the Ascending Wood and the Great Grinder also gathering sand into a tower?</p><p></p><p>Even the other realms they comprehend, which suppress the spiritual rhythms, can be gathered into the will of the small world, also an accumulation.</p><p></p><p>It's a two-for-one deal.</p><p></p><p>With so many benefits, how could he not promote it?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, when Xuanhuang said "This can be done," the entire martial arts pavilion was excited.</p><p></p><p>"We can also cultivate the Furnace Nine Refinements?" "But?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly made a turn, almost causing these people to lose their footing.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Furnace Nine Refinements is ultimately not suitable. I have the 'Ascending Wood True Method' and the 'Great Grinder Nine Seal Method,' which are more suitable for cultivating energy and spirit."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The people of the martial arts pavilion realized their horizons were too small.</p><p></p><p>The great Xuanhuang, no, they should call him Master Xuan, who can teach the Dao and explain the mysteries, is truly a teacher.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuan actually has the 'Ascending Wood True Method' and the 'Great Grinder Nine Seal Method,' which are cultivation methods for refining the spirit and energy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This?"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts pavilion people were excited and just about to ask how to obtain these methods.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang noticed that the Ascending Wood could now control the tree body to enter the small world.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, Xuanhuang didn't want to linger here and withdrew the Ascending Wood before it could become a true Spiritual Tree.</p><p></p><p>As for the complete fusion and transformation, it would take time, but there's no rush.</p><p></p><p>Being able to move it is enough for now.</p><p></p><p>"You all step back."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang called the crowd to step back.</p><p></p><p>"Retract!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>A giant tree...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The trembling, the tree roots began to detach from the soil.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, until they were completely separated, then rapidly shrinking, disappearing into the dark yellow brow? The crowd: ... Such a large tree is gone, disappeared into the Xuanshi's brow? What kind of technique is this? Is this the martial way?</p><p></p><p>How is it so similar to the immortal cultivation legends of the mustard seed space and the cosmos in the sleeve?</p><p></p><p>Or is it a space opened up within the body?</p><p></p><p>Is the extraordinary so outrageous? Suddenly, not only the Dao Pavilion, even the martial arts schools have never seen such a grand scene.</p><p></p><p>The decaying saber that Xuanhuang occasionally appeared, and the illusory smelting furnace that appeared from time to time, they had already felt outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, a tree dozens of meters tall can be retracted.</p><p></p><p>"Old Sun, go back first, the yin energy in this place will dissipate in a few days, and the blockade can be lifted then."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui immediately snapped out of the shock, looking at the nearly 20-meter-deep tree pit, feeling a bit "dizzy".</p><p></p><p>He immediately followed Xuanhuang's instructions to gather the martial arts school members and leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dao Pavilion's Li Tongnian was anxious in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The 'Rebuilding the Tree Returning to the True Law' and the 'Returning to the Void Nine Seal Law', I need to perfect and organize them. By the time the martial arts school moves to Qingyun Mountain, they should be perfected. After all, the laws you cultivate, I cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>"After the creation law is perfected, I will try it first. If there are no flaws or omissions, I will notify Sun Hui to contact you. Don't worry, I'm very familiar with the creation law."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang explained directly, not speaking in riddles.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>Xia Qingmeng was stunned: "Creating now?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang replied: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma, Li Tongnian: "..."</p><p></p><p>It's so outrageous, is this still a human? </p><p></p><p>He has already created martial arts laws, and now he's also coming up with immortal cultivation laws? Even though there was a bit of speculation before, when faced with it, the shock was still unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>Too much shock tonight, the brain is concussed.</p><p></p><p>"Sun Hui, make the arrangements, I'll go back first."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Xuanhuang flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ...</p><p></p><p>They're used to it, they're used to it! Xuanhuang went back first because he had something to do.</p><p></p><p>After all, retracting such a large tree, although the small world has become more stable, it still needs to be taken care of.</p><p></p><p>The Jianmu is also in a critical period of transformation, it's better to go back and stabilize it first.</p><p></p><p>Back at the martial arts school's courtyard, the people left behind didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang entered the small world, and the originally empty small world now had a giant tree of yin and yang circulation.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had calculated, after the life-representing Jianmu fused with the death-representing dead tree, the yin-yang cycle appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Gather!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang empowered his spiritual consciousness, imbuing the Jianmu with the will of yin and yang, accelerating this transformation.</p><p></p><p>The same goes, no matter how small, it is the will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>The yin-yang Dao essence bestowed by the small heavenly will is also the Dao.</p><p></p><p>With a 'whoosh', after being empowered by Xuanhuang's heavenly and earthly will, the Jianmu's transformation sped up even faster.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it was half green leaves and half withered leaves, and now it has become all green leaves.</p><p></p><p>And the death of death, the yin of yin, began to gather under the tree roots.</p><p></p><p>Death to the extreme, life comes; or life to the extreme, death comes.</p><p></p><p>Reaching a kind of cyclic beauty.</p><p></p><p>And the level of the Jianmu began to accelerate rapidly, the moment of fusion is the first level, and now it is rushing towards the peak of the first level.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang deduced that after the complete fusion, the Jianmu will reach the peak of the first level.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the one that surpasses the other three treasures.</p><p></p><p>And the Jianmu can no longer be completely counted as a treasure.</p><p></p><p>It is a existence similar to a heavenly and earthly spiritual root, both a powerful treasure and a spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>In the future when fighting enemies, it is not necessary to summon it out in full.</p><p></p><p>Just the tree roots can kill the enemy, after all, it is the extreme of death.</p><p></p><p>If it's to save people, the tree branches are like the willow branches in the jade bottle, although not the three-light divine water, but full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>When it becomes powerful enough, it can also revive the dead and restore the white bones.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

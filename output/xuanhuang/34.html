        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xuanhuang was very confident, Sun Hui immediately felt relieved, but he also wanted to play his own role.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he tentatively asked, "Master Xuan, since the Zhenxie Department is so wary of us, we can join forces with the Daoguan. We have a common voice."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang inwardly smiled, this common voice, would it not be a common target to be struck? But he asked, "What do you have in mind?"</p><p></p><p>Receiving Xuanhuang's affirmation, Sun Hui became very confident. "Master Xuan, I carefully studied your 'Nine Refinements of the Crucible', and found that the Daoguan could also learn from it, just by taking the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"I suppose they won't refuse, as having a future path would be a stroke of luck for them."</p><p></p><p>"After all, both the martial path and the Dao path are the Dao, different routes to the same destination, the only difference is the starting point."</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang indicated that it was unnecessary, saying, "There's no need. You can cultivate whatever you want to cultivate. The formation of will requires the three refinements of essence, qi, and spirit. I just chose to start from the martial path of the physical body. I also have the methods to refine qi and spirit, I just didn't tell you."</p><p></p><p>The three: ??</p><p></p><p>What? You also have the methods to refine qi and spirit? You're really impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, is this really true?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true."</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Sun Hui excitedly said, "This perfectly solves the problem. If the Daoguan knows that you have the methods to refine qi and spirit, they will surely stand by our side."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that's true. However," Xuanhuang corrected, "The key is to become strong yourself. Relying on others to take your side is not a good idea. Old Sun, you need to change this mindset."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Master Xuan's teaching is right. I, Old Sun, have been suppressed for six or seven years, and have also been 'weak' for six or seven years. I'm not quite used to it yet, I need to learn."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui was not annoyed, he hoped for more of such critical education.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her uncle's performance, Sun Tong suppressed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem..." Sun Hui said awkwardly, "Master Xuan, the people from the Zhenxie Department will withdraw this afternoon, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go there tonight, you all prepare."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go prepare."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Sun Hui planned to leave. When he reached the door, he thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the director of the Zhenxie Department, Xu Ruyi, is upright and has risked his life to protect South City, he is a respectable person. But people have good and bad sides, the black sheep of the Zhenxie Department do not represent the entire department."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, no need to say more. My current achievements are also thanks to the efforts of the people in the Zhenxie Department. I'm aware of this in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood Sun Hui's meaning.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he was afraid Xuanhuang, in his youthful vigor and suddenly elevated status, might hate the entire Zhenxie Department.</p><p></p><p>With Xuanhuang's words, he was relieved.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, some extraordinary beings have a mentality that ordinary people don't have.</p><p></p><p>So young, yet so steady, a chosen one.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui and Wu Gang left.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's separate courtyard, it became calm again.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, this was something he had anticipated, nothing too concerning.</p><p></p><p>He began to adjust his breathing and restore the will consumed by the sealing of the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>Until the evening...</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang walked out of the separate courtyard,</p><p></p><p>The entire martial arts hall was already on high alert.</p><p></p><p>"Ready?"</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts hall's top experts are all ready to follow you, Master. In addition..."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui said, "The news has reached the Daoguan. The Daoguan is said to be fully supporting us. The Daoguan's Headmaster Li Tong and Deputy Headmaster Xia Qing are leading the team."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The Daoguan is not bad."</p><p></p><p>This was a bit unexpected.</p><p></p><p>But not entirely unexpected.</p><p></p><p>When Zhao Xi and Xia Qing reported the martial arts hall's secret,</p><p></p><p>The usually unconcerned Xia Qing just casually had someone investigate.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that the situation would take a dramatic turn. This morning, the Daoguan received the news from the Zhenxie Department.</p><p></p><p>With the department director Xu Ruyi away on a business trip to the Xia capital headquarters, the actions of Jia Zhengyi and others could not be stopped by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were quite a few people with the same mentality as Jia Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>And some others who were indifferent, as it didn't concern them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The news shocked Xia Qing when he heard about it.</p><p></p><p>He immediately reported it to the head of the Dao Pavilion, Li Tong-nian, who then called Sun Hui.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui did not hide anything, telling what should be told and not telling what should not be said.</p><p></p><p>But that was enough.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Pavilion quickly held a meeting, and then nine out of ten supported the Wu Pavilion. They were all cannon fodder used by the Taoist priests.</p><p></p><p>They were actually happy that the Wu Pavilion had produced such an extraordinary figure as Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>As Sun Hui said, Immortal Cultivation and Martial Arts are both the Dao, just different paths leading to the same destination.</p><p></p><p>Before, there was no hope at all, but now at least they can improve the Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Cultivation is not about the Taoist priests manipulating the bizarre, leaving no room for turning back. </p><p></p><p>We are different.</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui sighed and said, "As long as one is not a psychopath, they will be genuinely delighted at the emergence of an existence like Master Xuan, because this represents hope."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't flatter me. Are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, ready."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's set off."</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang waved his hand and got into a car. Dozens of cars then roared away.</p><p></p><p>The people left behind at the Wu Pavilion were both excited and anxious. </p><p></p><p>They all understood what this departure meant.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Pavilion's transformation from a caterpillar to a dragon would happen tonight.</p><p></p><p>Although they could not personally participate, they could still participate in spirit.</p><p></p><p>They watched the departing convoy with burning gazes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"They're here, they're here."</p><p></p><p>Not far from the Fu Lin Community, there were already three groups of people: the soldiers maintaining order, the hidden "Yin people" from the Exorcism Department like Wei Zi-xuan, and the openly supporting Dao Pavilion members.</p><p></p><p>"These peasants are actually so united?" </p><p></p><p>A gloomy voice spoke, belonging to the One-Eyed Dragon, who had one eye covered by an eyepatch, faintly emanating a bizarre force.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zi-xuan smiled: "They are just a bunch of country bumpkins. Now that Martial Arts has opened up an extraordinary path, the Immortal Cultivators can't sit still, can they?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! They are all heterodox and deviant paths. It's just that this group of waste cannot manipulate the bizarre, so they fantasize about ascending to the heavens with their human bodies, which is simply laughable."</p><p></p><p>Such an absurd statement was said so naturally.</p><p></p><p>The other few bizarre Taoist priests also expressed agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Waste is waste, they will be disappointed after tonight."</p><p></p><p>"I hope they don't cry!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The excitement of the small group of Yin people from the Exorcism Department contrasted sharply with the solemn atmosphere of the Dao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The head of the Dao Pavilion, Li Tong-nian, had a grave expression. </p><p></p><p>There was both expectation and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Master Ma, what do you think the outcome will be tonight?"</p><p></p><p>The Dao Pavilion's Master Ma and the Wu Pavilion's Mr. Liu were two extraordinary figures - one a martial arts peak master, the other a peak refiner. Both had reached the limit, and going further would mean losing control.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan Huang must be genuine, but the situation tonight is hard to say. The Exorcism Department has become more and more outrageous."</p><p></p><p>"I also believe Master Xuan Huang is extraordinary, but as you said, now that Master Xuan Huang has been exposed, the road ahead will be difficult. Those Taoist priests are almost becoming bizarre themselves. It's really pitiful."</p><p></p><p>Both of them believed that Xuan Huang was extraordinary, and his bizarre abilities were real, not fake.</p><p></p><p>But they were worried about Xuan Huang's future.</p><p></p><p>As for addressing him as "Master Xuan Huang"?</p><p></p><p>This was a sign of respect for a powerful figure, a respect for the pioneer who opened the path.</p><p></p><p>Truly cultivated and self-improving people would not try to elevate themselves by belittling others - that would make them look like a clown, which is very laughable.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Director Xu is not here," Li Tong-nian said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma sighed deeply: "Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on this person. If he can break through, he will become a dragon. If he cannot break through..."</p><p></p><p>"Then he will not break through..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Song Hongliang gritting his teeth and persisting, Sun Hui asked, "Master, everyone, I can't continue for now. My leg seems to be broken, and following you all will only be a burden. I'd rather not get involved in the strange affairs of the Funeral Clothing Shop."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui nodded and said, "Alright, if you can still persist, then come along. If you can't, then go back to Qingyun Mountain first."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's just a broken leg, it's only inconvenient to move around... I'll see it through to the end, I'll follow you all."</p><p></p><p>Song Hongliang did not plan to retreat for now. This was not only about the Taoist master's opinion, but also about his own steadfastness in his heart. For a martial artist, having a broken leg or arm is quite normal. To have achieved the Dao, one is already extraordinary, a broken leg is nothing, not even paralysis.</p><p></p><p>Without needing anyone's support, he slowly followed the group to the outside of the inn. At this time, the inn and the blocked streets had undergone a great change. The cold and eerie aura began to dissipate, and although it was still dilapidated, there was vitality.</p><p></p><p>"You two report to Director Xu that the Ominous Bell has been resolved, and later go to the Funeral Clothing Shop in the south, and have the resident spirit master there pay attention."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xuanhuang's words, and seeing the dissipating cold and gloom, the two guards understood everything. Although greatly surprised, they also regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Seeing is believing, the rumors about Master Xuan had long been sensational in the Southern City, and were still being discussed on the paranormal forums. But no matter how much one hears, it is not as direct as experiencing it oneself.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang led the group of eleven people and rushed away.</p><p></p><p>"Then... does this area no longer need to be cordoned off? Can it be inhabited after a period of time?"</p><p></p><p>The female spirit master asked.</p><p></p><p>"It should be like that. I heard that recently, due to the appearance of Master Xuan, many cultivators have been rushing here, and many ordinary people with sensitive information are also migrating to the Southern City. As the Southern City population increases, this area can be unsealed to accommodate the influx of residents."</p><p></p><p>The female spirit master let out a bitter laugh, "Unexpectedly, the revival of the paranormal has caused the real estate market to heat up. I couldn't afford it before."</p><p></p><p>The male spirit master also said, "Me too, before the paranormal revival, I was part of the 'no house' group, and couldn't afford it at all."</p><p></p><p>On the other side...</p><p></p><p>"It's resolved," High Xiaolan said to Xu Rui'an after hanging up the phone.</p><p></p><p>Xu Rui'an heaved a sigh of relief, "Sure enough, it was Master Xuan. It's really resolved."</p><p></p><p>"The stationed spirit masters said that Master Xuan has gone to the Funeral Clothing Shop, and the group that followed Master Xuan into the Ominous Bell Inn are all disheveled, and the deputy director of the Martial Arts Hall, Song Hongliang, has even broken a leg."</p><p></p><p>Xu Rui'an waved his hand unconcernedly, "Normal, it's already good that they survived. After all, why did Master Xuan bring them? I think this is to temper them. Jade needs to be polished to become a tool, and Master Xuan alone, even with three heads and six arms, cannot solve all the problems. Master Xuan is right to train them, so that they can cope with the future situation."</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan nodded in agreement, "They reported that Master Xuan took less than 15 minutes to resolve the Ominous Bell, very quickly. And the paranormal forces around the Ominous Bell Inn are dissipating, and it will return to normal in a few days."</p><p></p><p>"That area is not small, right?"</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan said, "Director, that area is quite large. In recent years, the affected area of the Ominous Bell has been expanding, so the cordoned-off area has been increasing. Such a large area being released can accommodate a lot of residents."</p><p></p><p>"Then you should discuss with Qingyun Mountain, see if they need it, and consult their opinions. Don't just take over after Master Xuan has cleaned it up."</p><p></p><p>High Xiaolan expressed her understanding.</p><p></p><p>Xu Rui'an asked again, "How many spirit masters are guarding the Funeral Clothing Shop?"</p><p></p><p>"Director, the Funeral Clothing Shop threat is smaller than the Ominous Bell Inn, so there is only one spirit master stationed there. If it weren't for the Funeral Clothing Shop being in the old city with a dense population, it wouldn't even need a guard. The paranormal clothing in the Funeral Clothing Shop is not difficult for Master Xuan to resolve."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's wait for the news... Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Rui'an couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>It had been years since he had felt this way. More and more paranormal incidents were being discovered, and more and more places needed to be guarded. But spirit masters were not easy to come by, and the huge losses in sealing the paranormal were not ideal.</p><p></p><p>Now there was finally hope. With Xuanhuang as a 'professional' cleaner, and a fearless superhuman cultivator, it was good news for the Southern City.</p><p></p><p>For him, the Director of the Southern City Exorcism Department, it was a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, don't forget to bring some bargaining chips when you go to Qingyun Mountain tomorrow to alleviate the paranormal erosion of the spirit masters... Master Xuan said he would alleviate it for free, but we can't be ignorant. Some paranormal seals that are difficult to integrate, the ones we don't need, we can give to Master Xuan. He may be able to refine them into treasures useful to our spirit masters."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Director."</p><p></p><p>Since Jia Zhengyi's 'disappearance' and Dong Xingbao's change to silence after visiting Qingyun Mountain, the entire Southern City Exorcism Department has been under the sole control of Xu Rui'an. His orders can be fully implemented without any constraints.</p><p></p><p>However, there is still a small group of people, such as Wei Zixuan and others, who still have ideas. They were just scared off by Master Xuan's methods, and are now hesitating whether to flee or try to correct their mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuan has not bothered them so far, which makes them both happy and angry. Happy that Master Xuan doesn't care about them, and angry that Master Xuan doesn't care about them.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in status and the rise of the Dao have made them very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>It was already 10:30 at night.</p><p></p><p>After resolving the Ominous Bell Inn, Xuanhuang's group drove to the Funeral Clothing Shop.</p><p></p><p>The eleven people were very silent on the way.</p><p></p><p>Each of them was preparing for the next test, and also reflecting on their recent performance.</p><p></p><p>"How do you feel, Xiao Jin?" </p><p></p><p>In the second car, the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist trio, along with Sun Hui and Jin Ning, five people.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there is a buffer. The Crucible Observation Map can form a kind of portal-like existence, and it has the ability to defend when the paranormal invades, whether it's the divine soul or the dreamlike mentality. But it's just a buffer, I was only able to resist for less than 10 seconds before being pulled into the blood-colored room by the Ominous Bell."</p><p></p><p>Jiutong heard this and said, "10 seconds is not bad. Master Xuan said our three have the ability of Refining Intent at the fourth layer, but in the face of the Ominous Bell's rules, we were powerless and instantly pulled into the paranormal rules."</p><p></p><p>Minghui also said, "Disciple Jin, you only have the first layer of Refining Intent, but because of the suppression of the imagined object in your divine soul, you have the ability of the seventh layer of Refining Intent, which is already extraordinary... Fully comprehending the Observation Map, you indeed have the power of the seventh layer of Refining Intent."</p><p></p><p>Yanlai expressed his agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the faceless man in the blood-colored room? Do you have any countermeasures?" Sun Hui asked further.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning let out a bitter laugh, "No, although I can alleviate the impact of the faceless man on the divine soul, the effect is not ideal. I have already refined my body to the fourth layer, with a strength of 4,000 kilograms, but I was still easily knocked away by the faceless man."</p><p></p><p>"Me too," Sun Hui said.</p><p></p><p>Not only has Jin Ning's willpower progressed greatly, and he has comprehended the perfect Observation Map, but his body refinement has also reached the fourth layer in the past month.</p><p></p><p>And Sun Hui has even reached the sixth layer of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it is a paranormal extraordinary, the strength of the faceless man is at least 100,000 per strike. The gap between us is too large, which is understandable. Even the Taoists are no match for it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"One strike, you can only avoid the entanglement." </p><p></p><p>The difference between the extraordinary and the ordinary is huge.</p><p></p><p>Before Xuanhuang became extraordinary, his limit was only 12,000 kilograms of force. After reaching the first level of Xuanbian, his starting point was 100,000 kilograms, with an ultimate limit of 3,600,000 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the limit before becoming extraordinary was 12 tons, while the limit after Xuanbian was 3,600 tons, a difference of 300 times.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, one punch from Xuanhuang could easily destroy the Faceless Man.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the Faceless Man is not strong, but that Xuanhuang is too powerful.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanbian limit he calculated was 3,600 tons, but that doesn't mean he can always achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The Four Extremes Twelve Celestial Pillar Smelting Furnace Technique, in fact, as long as one reaches the perfection of one extreme with three pillars, there are ways to enter the second level of the Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not do this, he planned to refine all four extremes with twelve celestial pillars.</p><p></p><p>According to the division:</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, reaching one extreme with three pillars is the limit, and continuing to forge is very difficult, with a huge threshold. Whether they can break through to the second level of the Extraordinary depends on luck, and the possibility of failure is very high.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses can try to reach two extremes with six pillars, which will greatly increase the chance of entering the second level of the Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>For the top geniuses, those monstrosities can try to reach three extremes with nine pillars, and they can definitely enter the second level of the Extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Only the Founding Ancestors or the ultimate geniuses with great fortune can attempt the perfect Four Extremes Twelve Celestial Pillar [technique].</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang belongs to the latter, being both a Founding Ancestor and an unparalleled monstrosity since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>After all, each level is more difficult than the last, not only in the difficulty of forging the will, but also the crisis in each forging.</p><p></p><p>Each time the Heaven's Gate is opened, it is a huge crisis. If the forces of Heaven and Earth are not well controlled, they will devour you.</p><p></p><p>Each time the connection to the Celestial Pillars draws the forces of Heaven and Earth, it is also a huge test. If not controlled properly, you will be devoured by the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Talent, perseverance, and fortune are all indispensable.</p><p></p><p>The Faceless Man's strength exceeds 10 tons, but the difference is huge compared to Xuanhuang's 60 tons of colossal force.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Faceless Man is not the main body, but just an illusion of the Ominous Bell, and it is not a power-type anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the responses of the others, Jin Ning's melancholy was somewhat relieved, and he said, "I feel the Ominous Bell is much stronger than the previous puppets. If I were to face the puppet anomaly now, I wouldn't be so passive."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Ominous Bell's abilities are at the top of the first level, but we don't know how the Master will break it. Could breaking the blood-colored space set it free?"</p><p></p><p>The others really didn't know how Xuanhuang would do it. It's not just about breaking the blood-colored space, but also the inner world, and the anomalous shadows within the inner world.</p><p></p><p>"We need to work hard," Jiu Tong finally concluded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I hope the next shroud anomaly won't be so troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Ming Hui shook her head and took out a document, saying, "It's still very troublesome, a life-absorbing anomaly, similar to the corpse tree the Master subdued before."</p><p></p><p>"Take a look," Ming Hui handed the document to the four of them.</p><p></p><p>After reading it, Jin Ning sighed in relief, "This one is not too bad, the Faceless Man was a combination of power and anomaly, but this shroud anomaly should only be an anomalous power, not its forte."</p><p></p><p>The discussion continued as they arrived at the shroud shop.</p><p></p><p>It was another blocked-off street, but the lights in the nearby high-rise buildings showed that there were residents living nearby, indicating the threat level was not too high.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>The guardian here was an elderly spirit master, looking to be in his sixties or seventies. His right leg was heavily invaded by the anomaly, constantly oozing blood, appearing very ominous.</p><p></p><p>After greeting him, Xuanhuang also told him to go to Qingyun Mountain tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang noticed that all the guarding spirit masters were heavily invaded in their spiritual minds.</p><p></p><p>It seems that guarding these places, while not requiring much fighting, still poses dangers, so those heavily invaded by anomalies are stationed here.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." </p><p></p><p>The elderly spirit master forced a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Who's coming with you?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master Songsong is not going, so we're all going," Xun Hui replied.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the ragged group of ten, Xuanhuang had not spoken to them along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, be careful," Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Although they were just going through the motions, they still needed some experience.</p><p></p><p>Standing at the entrance of the shroud shop, Xuanhuang sensed that this place was much weaker than the Ominous Bell Inn.</p><p></p><p>From the information he had seen, this was also an anomaly that absorbed people's life force.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that today was the showcase of the Towering Wood.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the already rooted inner world or this shroud shop, they were both the forte of the Towering Wood.</p><p></p><p>After entering the shroud shop, the anomalous rules descended.</p><p></p><p>An old man with a face full of corpse spots, bone-thin, appeared, wearing a shroud and moving sluggishly and dully.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the group that had entered, he seemed to be unaware of their presence, busy with his own work.</p><p></p><p>But the others could feel that they were surrounded by an anomalous force, absorbing their vitality.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning sighed in relief, as his spiritual furnace visualization was resisting this absorbing force, just as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>As for Xuanhuang, after a quick sense, he immediately lost interest, finding it too ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Once entering the anomalous rules, one's life would be absorbed, and their body would develop corpse spots, as if being invaded by time.</p><p></p><p>"Finish it," Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>Since it was so ordinary, might as well resolve it quickly.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the Towering Wood appeared out of thin air, quickly enveloping the shroud-wearing old man.</p><p></p><p>The old man, like a puppet, offered no resistance.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten seconds, the shroud-wearing old man was completely drained, leaving only the shroud tightly wrapped by the Towering Wood roots, deprived of any struggling ability.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The anomalous space shattered, and the anxious group who had just entered suddenly felt a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>"This... is it over?" Xun Hui looked at the restored shroud shop in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go," Xuanhuang's voice came from the doorway.</p><p></p><p>Everyone realized that it was indeed over.</p><p></p><p>Had it been a minute since they entered? It didn't seem to be even that long.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" </p><p></p><p>The guarding spirit master outside was also surprised, unconsciously rubbing his eyes, as if he had seen wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what was that?" the spirit master asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's resolved, this anomaly was not that strong, and it had no special abilities," Xuanhuang said with a 'regretful' tone.</p><p></p><p>"Report to your captain that the task was completed smoothly tonight, and we'll continue tomorrow night."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xuanhuang got into the car.</p><p></p><p>The guarding spirit master: ...</p><p></p><p>"Spirit master, we'll be going first," Xun Hui reminded the still dazed spirit master as they passed by him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay," the elderly spirit master snapped back to his senses, feeling embarrassed, and quickly took out his phone to report to Ru Yi.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the call, Gao Xiaolan and Ru Yi reported it truthfully.</p><p></p><p>Ru Yi picked up a pen and erased a red dot marked on a map of South City.</p><p></p><p>This represented the shroud shop anomaly.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the next few days, with two anomalies disappearing each day, Ru Yi was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

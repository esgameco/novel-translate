        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A newly named, vast lake surface.</p><p></p><p>The lake surface is shimmering with ripples, and it is difficult to see the opposite shore even when looking far away, indicating the enormous size of this lake.</p><p></p><p>The lake water is a deep blue and extremely clear. If one doesn't look closely, one would think it is a beautiful scenic area.</p><p></p><p>But that is not the case. Half a year ago, there was no such lake here, and this place was still a remote wilderness.</p><p></p><p>A spatial secret realm has been shattered, forming this lake surface.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Star is constantly expanding in area as the small worlds and secret realms are broken and merged.</p><p></p><p>No one knows exactly how large the current Blue Star is. If it weren't for the Dragon Teacher's mysterious network, the human beings on the Blue Star would have already split apart.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the Moon-Falling Lake has not added any beauty to this place, but rather marks the beginning of a disaster.</p><p></p><p>At night, this lake is like a mirror, and it can somehow violently absorb moonlight, even emitting a huge glow.</p><p></p><p>The lake water that has absorbed endless moonlight will also radiate an invisible halo during the day.</p><p></p><p>Drinking the water from this lake can rapidly evolve wild beasts, although not as extremely fast as the blood pool secret realm.</p><p></p><p>But under the long-term influence, the effect keeps increasing.</p><p></p><p>This has led to astonishing changes in the trees, wild grasses, and wild flowers around the lake.</p><p></p><p>There have been carnivorous plants on the Blue Star before, but they were just a few types like the Venus flytrap, which pose no threat to humans.</p><p></p><p>Under the catalysis of the Moon-Falling Lake, the plants that have followed it from the same shattered space have become demonized.</p><p></p><p>The plants that originally existed on the Blue Star have also become gnarled and thorny over the past half year, giving a sense of ferocity, with some trees even growing distorted human faces on their trunks.</p><p></p><p>This is already a form of spiritual pollution. Staying in such a forest for a long time will only lead to depression and panic, driving one to madness.</p><p></p><p>The animals that have followed the spatial shattering are also becoming the scourge of this place.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the wilderness of the Blue Star is so dangerous is not only because the native beasts have become fiercer, but also because of the arrival of creatures from the shattered small worlds.</p><p></p><p>This is the second threat after the mysterious phenomena.</p><p></p><p>The ferocity of the native beasts of the Blue Star can still be traced. But these monsters and beasts that have merged into the Blue Star from the small worlds are the real troublesome existence.</p><p></p><p>The only consolation is that no world-destroying demonic beasts have appeared yet. The current ones are still not transcendent.</p><p></p><p>As mentioned before, firearms can eliminate 99% of these fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious phenomena rampant, the Blue Star expanding, fierce beasts rampaging - this is the fundamental state of near-anarchy on the Blue Star.</p><p></p><p>Exhausted, feeling hopeless, numb, not caring anymore, let it be.</p><p></p><p>As individual cities, they can only cling together to survive.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Moon-Falling Lake, the somewhat world-weary Minghui looked at the roughly drawn map.</p><p></p><p>"How's the situation at the southern Dao Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Dao Gate is still advancing, with significant casualties. According to the information from half an hour ago, we have lost seventeen practitioners."</p><p></p><p>Minghui nodded impassively, "And us?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, we have lost even more, twenty monks."</p><p></p><p>Minghui's grip on the map betrayed his emotion, almost tearing it.</p><p></p><p>"Make sure to properly retrieve the remains of the deceased monks."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>In less than three days since receiving Xuanhuang's guidance, the situation has become like this.</p><p></p><p>The martial alliance has divided into two parts - one is focused on developing the blood pool secret realm, the other is clearing the wilderness of fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist sects have dispatched nearly half of their top experts to clear the wilderness around the southern city and some newly formed lands.</p><p></p><p>In two days, the Buddhist sect has lost twenty people, the Taoist sect seventeen, and the Confucian sect thirty-one, the most.</p><p></p><p>It may seem cruel, but it is not. The Blue Star has countless people dying every day, perishing in the mysterious phenomena, the wilderness, and the unbearable hardships.</p><p></p><p>Even the spirit masters have people dying every day, let alone the common people, let alone the Confucians, Taoists, and Buddhists.</p><p></p><p>It is just that the tranquility of Qingyun Mountain has concealed the upheaval of the world and the anguished cries of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>As the head monk and Buddhist leader, Minghui understands that these sacrifices, though heartbreaking, are necessary.</p><p></p><p>Without sacrifice, there can be no dignity. They need to fight and kill the fierce beasts and mysterious phenomena to prove the existence of humanity.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" "Rumble!" "Amitabha!"</p><p></p><p>The main Buddhist force is attacking the west, and a group of beasts not native to the Blue Star are being surrounded on a battlefield spanning six or seven miles.</p><p></p><p>Minghui's body suddenly emitted a faint glow, and a hazy giant millstone slowly rotated above his head.</p><p></p><p>The attacks of the fierce beasts were deflected.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, four large gray seals were sent flying towards four dog-like giant beasts nearly five meters tall.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>The divine seals targeted their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>"Woof - Howl -"</p><p></p><p>Agonizing cries were heard. The bodies of the four giant dog-like beasts were unharmed, but their spiritual souls had been completely shattered by the divine seals.</p><p></p><p>"Gather!"</p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>Minghui let out a loud shout, and the hazy giant millstone above his head began to slowly rotate.</p><p></p><p>The shattered spiritual souls of the four dog-like giant beasts were drawn in. The damaged spiritual essences were extracted, while the rest were ground into a pure spiritual essence-like existence.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>It was then absorbed by Minghui, strengthening his own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Minghui no longer looked like a venerable monk, but more like an old demonic cultivator who extracts souls and refines them.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, collect the corpses. The blood, flesh, and bones of these fierce beasts are also precious."</p><p></p><p>This shout further cemented the impression - not only does he extract souls and refine them, he also doesn't spare the blood, flesh, and bones, truly a demonic monk.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the other monks, however, they see this as the true manifestation of a great monk.</p><p></p><p>They have witnessed Minghui's extraordinary abilities many times in the past two days and exclaim, "This is what a true great monk should be like!"</p><p></p><p>It's all over, a group of demonic monks.</p><p></p><p>"The casualties are not small, but the gains are even greater. For the Buddhist sect to achieve rebirth and transcendence, we must descend into the hell realms."</p><p></p><p>In just three days, Minghui's own spiritual cultivation has already reached the late stage of the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>As long as he continues, he will be able to reach the eighth layer in less than ten days, of course, excluding any bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Venerable Teacher was right. The wilderness is the best place for advancement."</p><p></p><p>Minghui fully understands Xuanhuang's intentions now.</p><p></p><p>The countless fierce beast corpses that can't even be fully transported are points, as well as resources for the Buddhist sect's cultivators of the body and qi.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the tempering of the will on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Many monks have reported that despite the extreme danger, their progress has been tremendous, especially the warrior monks.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield is undoubtedly the greatest opportunity for them, the body cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a blood-soaked senior monk approached.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are too many fierce beast corpses at the moment. We need at least two spatial storage rings, otherwise it will be very difficult to transport them back."</p><p></p><p>The roads in the wilderness have already been severed. Suddenly there are mountains here and lakes there, making transportation impossible.</p><p></p><p>Large transport aircraft can't take off and land, and helicopters are too small in capacity.</p><p></p><p>This has led to the killed fierce beasts being unable to be brought back, which is a tremendous waste. Especially since they cannot afford to waste these precious resources.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The resources are all there.</p><p></p><p>"Let the Venerable Gold Light make the purchases, try to exchange as much as possible, at least two storage rings, or a storage belt and bracelet, just get as many storage items as possible. We will need these storage equipment in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The reporting monk immediately went to contact the Venerable Gold Light, who was still on Mount Qingyun and would soon come to provide support.</p><p></p><p>The clear-sighted Minghui had completely refined the spiritual souls of the four fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Minghui's aura had deepened slightly.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The warrior monks were at the forefront, some wielding giant cleavers and spears, some carrying multi-barreled machine guns ready to provide support at any time.</p><p></p><p>The qi-refining monks followed closely behind, along with the spirit-refining monks and monks carrying enhanced heat weapons guarding the rear.</p><p></p><p>Blood and fire coexisted, slaughter was the main theme.</p><p></p><p>Blood was spilled everywhere, both from the monks and the fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Lamentations fill the land, blood covers the city!" </p><p></p><p>Minghui sighed softly, regained his composure, and quickly rejoined the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Taoist elder with the youthful appearance held a long spear.</p><p></p><p>Despite his advanced age, he was a martial arts cultivator at the fifth layer of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>His long spear sang as he moved with agility, confronting a three-meter-tall multi-legged unknown fierce beast.</p><p></p><p>The fierce beast's body was already pierced with numerous wounds, the intense pain stimulating its primal instincts.</p><p></p><p>The multi-legged fierce beast charged forward, not understanding the concept of leaving room.</p><p></p><p>"Good vicious beast, come, look at the spear."</p><p></p><p>The elder did not retreat but advanced, raising his hand to thrust the spear, the sound of it piercing the fierce beast's throat.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah—"</p><p></p><p>Violent struggling and a child-like agonized scream.</p><p></p><p>The elder smoothly withdrew the spear, stirring it, and a gush of thick blood sprayed out like a fountain.</p><p></p><p>The elder quickly retreated, this fierce beast was not long for this world, thrashing in its death throes, it would not be wise to approach now, just let it die on its own.</p><p></p><p>Not far away,</p><p></p><p>A giant tree towered up, supporting the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Collect!"</p><p></p><p>Dozens of large and small fierce beasts around seemed to be locked in place, their bodies constantly struggling, their vitality gradually fading. Their spiritual souls were intact, their flesh and blood unharmed, but their qi and life were gone.</p><p></p><p>Jiantong was highly skilled in facing group attacks.</p><p></p><p>With the protective Dao treasure light, the fierce beasts could not break through the defense, and Jiutong stood amidst the encirclement of the beasts, unleashing the divine ability of the Heavenly Pillar Visualization.</p><p></p><p>The life force dissipated, and the qi was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Life and qi equal life.</p><p></p><p>The dissipating life force and qi were quickly absorbed and refined, some of the life force and true essence were fed back to Jiutong.</p><p></p><p>Jiutong's cultivation of qi refinement rapidly advanced, already reaching the peak of the seventh layer.</p><p></p><p>He was faster than Minghui, mainly because Jiantong was so adept at dealing with group attacks.</p><p></p><p>Minghui could only attack four fierce beasts at a time with his four great seals, while Jiutong could handle an entire group.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Jiutong was stronger against group attacks, but in terms of focused powerful attacks, he was weaker than the Returning Void Nine Seals.</p><p></p><p>One was stronger in single combat, the other in facing group attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Dao sect was responsible for the south, the Martial Dao Alliance for the north, the Buddhist sect for the west, and the Confucian school for the east.</p><p></p><p>The four factions joined forces to clear the Moonfall Lake.</p><p></p><p>After refining and regulating his breathing, Jiutong received a report.</p><p></p><p>In a similar situation, many fierce beasts had been killed, but it was difficult to retrieve them.</p><p></p><p>They could only contact the supporting personnel to exchange storage rings, trying to exchange as many points as possible, which was negligible compared to the harvest.</p><p></p><p>It was not just the harvest of points and wealth, but also the harvest of cultivation and the tempering of will on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As for the losses and those who died in battle, the battlefield was cruel, how could there be no casualties.</p><p></p><p>Lamenting the spring and mourning the autumn was useless, the best way to respond to their fallen comrades was to kill more fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Continue cultivating, continue to grow stronger, walk deeper into the Dao, this was the best response to their comrades' dreams.</p><p></p><p>Carry on their dreams.</p><p></p><p>On the west side were the "demonic Buddhists".</p><p></p><p>Here were the "demonic Daoists".</p><p></p><p>All covered in blood, their qi and blood surging, eyes filled with rage, holding weapons with blood-soaked souls.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>"Vicious beast, taste my blade!"</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Slaughter was the main theme.</p><p></p><p>In the east, there was also a group of "crazy scholars".</p><p></p><p>Don't think that scholars are physically weak, they are proficient in all kinds of martial arts, from body refinement to qi refinement to spirit refinement, they were no less fierce than the fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront of the battlefield was the illusory Jiantong, and the branches and leaves of the Heavenly Pillar Tree were swaying, scattering white halos.</p><p></p><p>The white halos entered the surrounding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Each person infused by the white halo instantly became energized, their weakened aura rapidly strengthening, more powerful than drinking a tonic.</p><p></p><p>If Jiutong had demonstrated the death of the Heavenly Pillar Tree, then Yanlai was demonstrating its life.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, he was a super healer.</p><p></p><p>Continuously replenishing the blood and vitality of the battling cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators quickly threw the slain fierce beasts towards the roots of the Heavenly Pillar Tree, and the tree roots rapidly entwined and refined them.</p><p></p><p>Some of the refined essence was then returned to Yanlai, and Yanlai used the Rejuvenation Art to constantly replenish the cultivators' qi and energy.</p><p></p><p>It was a cycle of utilization.</p><p></p><p>This was probably the main reason for the Confucian school's greatest sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was invigorated like they had taken a stimulant, how could they not fight to the death? As a result, they ended up accidentally perishing.</p><p></p><p>Another stronghold was captured, and in front of them was a strange and bizarre forest.</p><p></p><p>This place was not far from the lakeside.</p><p></p><p>"Control!"</p><p></p><p>The illusory Heavenly Pillar Tree trembled, and threads of grayish-white qi flows scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Each qi flow targeted a strange tree.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the strange trees violently twisted and struggled, their tentacle-like branches becoming even more animated.</p><p></p><p>The fierce beasts ambushed in the strange forest were immediately affected.</p><p></p><p>The tree branches and roots rapidly entwined them.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>"Hiss hiss hiss—"</p><p>"Splash—"</p><p></p><p>Various sounds came from the forest. Looking from above, the strange forest had become an army of trees.</p><p></p><p>This made it difficult for the fierce beasts within to defend.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, kill them, the strange trees have been brought under my control."</p><p></p><p>Yanlai's face was now pale, the Heavenly Pillar Tree's ability to control plant puppets was powerful, but his cultivation was too low, and this extraordinary technique had almost drained all his essence and qi.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian school greatly respected their Patriarch, this was the image of a "great Confucian scholar" in their hearts. Not literary talent, but transforming into a super high-level support and healer.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Even so, the fierce beasts in their death throes still inflicted damage on the Confucian school. But the outcome was already decided, the Confucian school suffered the most losses, but they were also the first to clear a path to the Moonfall Lake.</p><p></p><p>The development and utilization of Moonfall Lake was now under their control.</p><p></p><p>After all, the lake was the true paradise for fierce beasts and monsters, the surrounding areas were just appetizers.</p><p></p><p>This lake had immense development potential, with all kinds of miraculous abilities worthy of their great investment.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set and the moon rose, the surface of the lake was like a silver mirror, as if it had absorbed all the surrounding moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, a huge shadow would appear on the lake surface, and occasionally a school of large, fanged fish or snakes would swim by, like a vast abyss that could swallow everything.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, the fellow disciples were all exhausted, their bodies covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-three people had died, the injured were not too many, and they had all been healed.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing more than saving the world with a single thought!" </p><p></p><p>Yanrai said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He then turned around, preparing for the coming of the night, which would be even more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

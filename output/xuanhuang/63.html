        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He has already been revered by the Confucianists, Taoists, and Buddhists as the reincarnation of the Buddha, the Taoist Patriarch, and the Sage.</p><p></p><p>If one knew, they would not admit it. Not to mention whether these claims are true or not.</p><p></p><p>Even if they are not true, he is just himself, not the reincarnation of anyone else, and does not need to boast about his background.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the crowd, he began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of qi in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The will covered the golden sea of qi, and a 30-zhang (about 100 meters) sea of qi was grasped by a large hand.</p><p></p><p>"Condense!"</p><p></p><p>A loud shout, and a 6-zhang (about 20 meters) golden celestial pillar condensed.</p><p></p><p>This process lasted for about 10 minutes.</p><p></p><p>The will's large hand, grasping the 6-zhang celestial pillar, transformed into a rainbow light and ascended to the peak of the first celestial pillar in the sea of qi mist.</p><p></p><p>Each celestial pillar needs to be farther than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>To make the celestial pillars reach farther, one can only ascend the first celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Exerting all his strength, the will's large hand threw the 6-zhang blood-qi celestial pillar into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The 6-zhang celestial pillar thundered as it landed, standing in the sea of qi mist farther than the first celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the sea of qi mist surged and churned, trying to topple the blood-qi celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Stabilize!"</p><p></p><p>The large hand formed by the Xuanhuang will pressed down on the second 6-zhang celestial pillar.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the sea of qi mist no longer churned, and the second celestial pillar was firmly rooted in the sea of qi mist.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although the sea of qi was his own, it was also the sea of qi of all living beings.</p><p></p><p>The sea of qi is endless, and the 30-zhang he controls is his own world.</p><p></p><p>This endless mist is not controlled by Xuanhuang, but is the sea of qi of all living beings under the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It's just that each living being's sea of qi is like a separate dimension, and no matter how much it expands, it cannot be contacted.</p><p></p><p>The large hand formed by the will returned to the 30-zhang golden sea of qi under his control.</p><p></p><p>"The second celestial pillar is established. As long as I can condense and fully integrate another 3 zhang in the next two days, I can proceed to the second layer of will cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xuanhuang withdrew his mind and left the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>He has already taken up residence on Qingyun Mountain, and his previous plans have all been completed.</p><p></p><p>Next, he needs to formulate a plan for the next period of time.</p><p></p><p>First,</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, Xu Ruyi will come to see him to discuss the strange situation in South City.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang actually hopes that the more strangeness, the better, as long as it does not exceed his control, he should be able to resolve it all.</p><p></p><p>In addition, due to the Linggen Tong Tian Building Wood standing in reality, combined with the blessing of the small world's Tianyi,</p><p></p><p>He has obtained a spiritual land of ten li (about 5 kilometers) in all directions, where cultivators can cultivate, and some uncontaminated precious herbs can also be planted.</p><p></p><p>Although it will take time, it is still a good start for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Second,</p><p></p><p>There is the strangeness of the Blood Pool, which is the second place he has established.</p><p></p><p>It is not covered by the Tong Tian Building Wood's coverage, so after meeting with Xu Ruyi, he should go to the Blood Pool secret realm to investigate.</p><p></p><p>While at it, he should also tidy it up and use it as a catalyst for fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Third,</p><p></p><p>The appointment with Village Chief Li Baokang of the Li family in the Blood Moon World.</p><p></p><p>He had said that he would go to the Blood Moon World at the latest in a month, and that time is almost up. He wonders how the Blood Moon World is doing?</p><p></p><p>When he went to the Blood Moon World that time, it was just a hurried visit, and it still needs to be explored.</p><p></p><p>But the Blood Moon World is very large, and it would be a waste of time for him to explore it alone.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang plans to send people from the Wuguan to explore, as long as they are careful.</p><p></p><p>The Li family village is also doing well, and the strangeness of the Blood Moon only poses a small danger as long as one does not actively make contact with it.</p><p></p><p>The most dangerous thing is the fierce beasts catalyzed by the Blood Moon.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Blood Moon is like the moon in legends, able to pour down the divine elixir?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang wondered.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, I'll explore it slowly."</p><p></p><p>Fourth,</p><p></p><p>There is also the underground demon cave that he learned about from Qi Long, which still needs demon stones to solidify.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If there is time, Xuanhuang will go and take a look himself.</p><p></p><p>This demonic cave that Qi Long discovered was only the surface, and it is said to be very large, but Xuanhuang does not know what is in the deeper mist.</p><p></p><p>The fourth...</p><p></p><p>The fourth is the threat of those few cults online, which needs to be paid attention to.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is not yet at the level of the second-stage Penetrating Mystery, and there are many second-stage spirit masters in the cults.</p><p></p><p>Although it is not to the point of being assassinated by a third-stage Penetrating Mystery expert, arranging a second-stage Penetrating Mystery one is still possible.</p><p></p><p>I can survive in the hands of a second-stage Penetrating Mystery spirit master, but I cannot fight them head-on, let alone suppress them.</p><p></p><p>This needs to be noted.</p><p></p><p>The fifth is a new problem.</p><p></p><p>After this, there will be more cultivators coming here out of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>I don't need to worry about this, as there are people from the martial arts hall and the Tao hall, and there are also the three leaders of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>I welcome all who come to seek the Tao here.</p><p></p><p>"Finally!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang thought of the last problem.</p><p></p><p>It is the problem of forging tools and drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>Currently, whether it is the martial way or the cultivation of immortality, the methods are too few.</p><p></p><p>It is unlikely that they can enter the extraordinary realm in a short time, so auxiliary means are needed.</p><p></p><p>As for auxiliary means, nothing is more direct than magical tools and talismans.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang took out the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace and the Returning Void Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>He also took out a strange and powerful leg bone, which was one of the three strange things preserved by the martial arts hall before.</p><p></p><p>The blood cloth and light bulb are not suitable for forging into magical tools for now.</p><p></p><p>This leg bone is not bad.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang threw it into the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Forge!"</p><p></p><p>Activating the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace, it began to slowly rotate.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will and the will of the small world permeated the furnace, converging on the leg bone.</p><p></p><p>Strange things are all natural treasures, they are all rare treasure embryos.</p><p></p><p>They are all formed by the rules of heaven and earth. Even if they look insignificant, they are still precious.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang intends to erase the innate instinct of the leg bone.</p><p></p><p>However, this so-called instinct is actually a chaotic consciousness born from the absorption of the resentment of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As long as its chaotic consciousness is erased and a new sound consciousness is endowed, the leg bone can become a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it still retains its ability to devour bones and evolve, making it an evolvable treasure.</p><p></p><p>In fact, one could even say that strange things are all evolvable treasures.</p><p></p><p>In the furnace, even the sealed strange thing began to struggle violently before its consciousness was erased.</p><p></p><p>Being sealed is just being sealed, but erasing the chaotic consciousness is equivalent to a direct rebirth.</p><p></p><p>The strange leg bone does not want to be reborn, it just wants to remain in a dazed state.</p><p></p><p>"Still struggling, how many people want the opportunity for rebirth, but you don't cherish it? Being in a dazed state like this is so unproductive," Xuanhuang muttered.</p><p></p><p>Thinking, why are you struggling, a newly born resentful consciousness? It's better to be reborn quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Be suppressed!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The cosmic power of the small world began to increase.</p><p></p><p>How strong can the consciousness of a just-born resentful being be? Although it struggled violently, it was still erased by the will of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>After the chaotic consciousness of the strange thing was erased, Xuanhuang quickly took it out of the furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly threw the leg bone into the Returning Void Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>Endowing a new spiritual consciousness is the Returning Void Great Grinder's most skilled technique, as it is an expert in this field.</p><p></p><p>A thread of subtle true meaning flew out from the Great Grinder and merged into the empty leg bone.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p></p><p>Like the sound of branding, the leg bone was imprinted with the true meaning belonging to the Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the Returning Void Great Grinder is the source of the leg bone.</p><p></p><p>...

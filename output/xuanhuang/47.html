        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After sorting through Qi Long's gains, Xuan Huang found nothing particularly noteworthy.</p><p></p><p>He had expected some kind of sealed, mysterious item, but there was none.</p><p></p><p>It made sense - who would deliberately collect such strange items? They must have been traded or sold off.</p><p></p><p>Holding onto something mysterious and useless to oneself is a dangerous thing. If one accidentally triggers the revival of the mystery, even a Demon Subduing Spiritual Master would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long's most important collection was the suppression medicine known as "Divine Blood", and a stone he had picked up from an underground demonic cave, called the "Demon Stone".</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang probed with his mental sense and obtained the small world, activating his transcendent perception.</p><p></p><p>To his amazement, these two items were quite special.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Blood could suppress the demonic corruption of the divine soul, while the Demon Stone could absorb the demonic aura invading the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>One suppresses, the other absorbs.</p><p></p><p>These two items must have some secrets.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Blood is a product of the Demonic Sect, and it is said that only the Demonic Sect in the entire world can produce the Divine Blood.</p><p></p><p>As for the Demon Stone, Qi Long had picked it up by chance when he wandered into the demonic cave.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Xuan Huang the most was that the Divine Blood contained pure, uncorrupted divine souls.</p><p></p><p>This means that after consuming it, one's divine soul can be strengthened. Such purity and massive energy, yet untainted - this at least indicates that the source of the Divine Blood is at the Fourth Realm True Self level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without the support of the True Self, it would be impossible to remain uncorrupted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this does not mean the Divine Blood itself is Fourth Realm, but rather its source is Fourth Realm, similar to how the Primal Spiritual Essence condenses the True Self. Therefore, the blood it nurtures or breeds also carries the characteristics of the True Self, remaining uncorrupted.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Stone is the same - it is not the Demon Stone itself that is Fourth Realm, but the source that imbues its existence is at least Fourth Realm, allowing it to absorb the corrupted divine souls and emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting?" Xuan Huang looked at the Divine Blood and Demon Stone in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Of the sources he currently knows that bestow true meaning at the Fourth Realm level, there are seven: the Sea of Blood, the Abyss, the Ruins of Return, the Azure Skies and Yellow Springs, the Nightmare World, the Nine Nether Hellfire Realm, and the Bitter Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Blood and Demon Stone seem to be the eighth and ninth.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang is very interested in these seven places, because if sentient, intelligent beings can be birthed there, they would be at least Fourth Realm at the starting point.</p><p></p><p>Only existences at the True Self level can establish a foothold in these seven places. If Fourth Realm beings are born, they are not simple demonic entities, but intelligent existences.</p><p></p><p>Even if demons reach the Fourth Realm, they will give birth to True Self spiritual intelligences.</p><p></p><p>Existences that have not birthed True Self spiritual intelligences cannot possibly attain the Fourth Realm.</p><p></p><p>By extension, if a Demon Subduing Cultivator reaches the Fourth Realm and has not lost their sanity, occupying the dominant position, they will completely master the demonic rules and become a True Self existence.</p><p></p><p>At that point, they need not worry about being corrupted by the demonic, for they will be the sovereign of the demonic rules.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang already knew that the demonic possesses a dual nature.</p><p></p><p>If you can completely control and refine it, you will ascend to the heavens, becoming an existence that commands part of the rules.</p><p></p><p>But if you falter in the refinement process, you will become part of it, nourishing the countless slain remnant souls until it births a new spiritual intelligence at the Fourth Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is similar to the initial opening of the Primordial Chaos - with so much resentful energy and weak souls becoming ferocious beasts, devoid of reason and only driven by slaughter. </p><p></p><p>While the strong ones who control themselves become the first born sacred gods who establish the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>This is why, in the fusion of the myriad realms, wondrous places can always be birthed.</p><p></p><p>The Ruins of Return, the Abyss, and the other seven places are equivalent to the Sea of Blood, the Dark Depths, and the like in the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>It is practically a remake.</p><p></p><p>And if sentient beings are birthed in these places, they would start at the Fourth Realm level.</p><p></p><p>The reason they have not appeared yet is that the fusion of the heavens and earth is still too short, and these wondrous places are still in the process of gestation - not to mention the birthing of spiritual beings.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Being born divine is still far from complete. "If humanity is not destroyed by the fusion of the myriad realms, it will be the existence before the great cataclysm."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suddenly thought of the books he had read in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the living beings born from the fusion of the myriad realms and the rebirth of the world will attack humanity, the ancient relic?"</p><p></p><p>"But, it's too early to think about that. That will be an event in the distant future, for now, humanity is still focused on how to survive."</p><p></p><p>"Only by living through the fusion of the myriad realms will there be a chance to face the 'attack' of the new world's living beings."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious birth of the fusion of the myriad realms has just begun.</p><p></p><p>As the time of the fusion increases, the mysterious beings born will become more and more.</p><p></p><p>Until the day when the myriad realms are completely fused and no longer collide and shatter, then no new mysteries will be born.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find a way to obtain some of this divine blood."</p><p></p><p>After refining the divine blood, Xuanhuang was pleasantly surprised to find that it had an effect on his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's divine soul is special, a white fourth-tier divine soul, as well as a golden immortal divine soul that can often become invisible and that the Guiyu world is powerless against in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>When he stepped into the realm of the extraordinary, it had a growth effect on the white divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, no matter what means were used, even if the level was too low, they had no effect on the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the divine blood could.</p><p></p><p>"Thinking about the origin of his fourth-tier, it can be understood."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang picked up the magic stone again.</p><p></p><p>This thing should also be able to promote the growth of his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>However, Xuanhuang did not refine it, as the divine blood could still be obtained from the Mysterious Association, while the magic stone was occasionally found by Qilong in the Magic Abyss, and he didn't know if there were many of them.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't plan to refine it, one magic stone was equivalent to just one drop of divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Although it can promote the growth of the divine soul, the effect is not great.</p><p></p><p>It's better to keep it for now.</p><p></p><p>The magic stone can absorb the divine souls that have been eroded by the Demon Seizers, and the eroded divine souls absorbed will turn into mist with fourth-tier characteristics.</p><p></p><p>This characteristic, if refined, would be a pity.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang thought that he could try to create a tool specifically for the Demon Seizers who are about to lose control, to alleviate the erosion of their divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Then transform it into a special mist and refine it himself? This seems to be a good business opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Refining tools is something Xuanhuang is very familiar with.</p><p></p><p>"Or simply fuse it into the Guiyu Great Grinder, let the Great Grinder's divine soul specialty grow, and become even more specialized."</p><p></p><p>After this idea came up, Xuanhuang immediately smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>"Just do it this way, as long as the tools are enough, no need to refine too many, it's better to constantly enhance their characteristics."</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Guiyu Great Grinder was already professional in refining divine souls.</p><p></p><p>It only knows how to grind and extract the true essence. Of course, the means against enemies are just a side effect.</p><p></p><p>If it can be fused with the magic stone, the Great Grinder will have a new ability, which can transform the broken divine souls into pure divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Pure divine souls are beneficial to anyone, like divine soul liquid, divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the characteristics of the magic stone, which can transform the divine soul into a special mist, and have a strengthening effect on the fourth-tier divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"One piece is a bit too little, it seems that after moving to Qingyun Mountain, I need to go explore the underground Magic Abyss."</p><p></p><p>He only has one piece of magic stone, which is not enough for the Great Grinder to fuse.</p><p></p><p>To make the Great Grinder fuse, it's equivalent to the physical manifestation of the Tong Tian Building Wood.</p><p></p><p>The Building Wood has fused a 50-meter-high corpse tree.</p><p></p><p>One piece of magic stone cannot completely materialize the Guiyu Great Grinder, it's too little.</p><p></p><p>Even if it is fused, its condensed mist characteristic will not be transformed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the magic stone is not a fourth-tier magic stone, but a characteristic bestowed by a fourth-tier origin.</p><p></p><p>This requires a large amount of magic stones, or directly find the fourth-tier origin.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

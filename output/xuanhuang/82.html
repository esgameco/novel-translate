            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go, have a hearty meal," Xuanhuang waved his hand, and an invisible beam of light instantly covered the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The blood pool was frozen by the sudden restraint, struggling violently but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Saber followed closely, plunging into the restrained blood pool.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>Drinking the enemy's blood has always been the Void Saber's dream, a simple yet persistent dream. With the master's protection, there was nothing to worry about as it immersed itself in the blood pool, unleashing its devouring power.</p><p></p><p>Since it had fused with the Butcher's Knife, it had reached the mid-stage of the first level. It had thought that it would take some time to grow further. But this opportunity came quickly, and fortunately, the Void Saber's innate strength was robust, or else such frequent devouring and evolution would have been difficult to digest.</p><p></p><p>"Gurgling-" The visible blood pool shrank rapidly, while the Void Saber was quickly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>The blood pool was very much to the Void Saber's liking, and with the addition of the Butcher's Knife's bloodthirsty ability, it was even more suitable.</p><p></p><p>Devouring, dissolving, assimilating...</p><p></p><p>The restrained blood pool struggled violently, but could not break free from Xuanhuang's restraint. However, due to the fierce resistance, the entire secret realm began to tremble, as if it was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, I'll resolve you all at once."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had originally planned to let the Void Saber drink its fill first, weaken the blood pool's strangeness, and then find a way to solve the problem of ordinary people's difficulty in entering. But he didn't expect the two to be so closely united, with the restraint weakening the blood pool's strangeness, causing the secret realm to be on the verge of a massive collapse.</p><p></p><p>It's better to complete it all at once.</p><p></p><p>This secret realm was not large, and for Xuanhuang, who had strengthened his body and will, the borrowed divine power of the small world had also increased.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble-" A huge sound came, and a massive breach appeared at the center of the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>A large hole opened in the sky, like a punctured balloon, and a powerful devouring force surged from the breach in the secret realm space.</p><p></p><p>When a Spirit-Sealing Stele was added to Xuanhuang's small world, and his golden spiritual soul fused with the Spirit-Sealing Stele, Xuanhuang found that his small world had become vastly more stable.</p><p></p><p>From the initial ability to only accommodate less than a thousand catties of mass, Xuanhuang now planned to devour this secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the secret realm is small, it is still a space, and any space has special scarcity. In other words, as long as one knows how to utilize it, it is a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, after Xuanhuang had killed Qi Long, he had mastered Qi Long's shadow strangeness.</p><p></p><p>After many days of exploration, Xuanhuang discovered more features of the shadow strangeness, and found that as long as it devoured shadows, it could grow rapidly, and its growth potential was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Qi Long's strangeness was completely unaware of the treasure it was guarding, and there was no need to find other puzzle pieces to advance the shadow strangeness.</p><p></p><p>As long as the will controls the devouring of shadows, it can be strengthened, and each shadow can also be separated, gathering them is powerful strangeness, and dispersing them is countless armies.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of shadow armies is not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are also reasons why Qi Long could not do it. Although the growth of the shadow strangeness by devouring shadows is strong, it is not as easy to control as two strangeness puzzles.</p><p></p><p>Because a single (extremely powerful) strangeness is too dangerous, and the control of strangeness is a fragile balance, the spirit cultivators dare not let the strangeness grow infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps once a single strangeness is greatly strengthened, the spirit cultivator would be gone as well.</p><p></p><p>But that's not the point.</p><p></p><p>What's more amazing is that the separated shadows all rely on the shadow strangeness for existence, and the shadow strangeness is like the source, providing the independent shadows with the basis for their existence.</p><p></p><p>And each shadow has its own unique shadow space, with extremely strong plasticity.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had thought of combining the shadow space and the real space fragments to refine them into separate spatial seeds.</p><p></p><p>Now the opportunity has come.</p><p></p><p>With the Spirit-Sealing Stele anchoring his small world, Xuanhuang could split out spatial fragments.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is to have the space divided, and the blood pool secret realm space is Xuanhuang's goal.</p><p></p><p>First, he will devour it, absorb it into his own small world, then cut and split it, dividing it into spatial fragments of various sizes.</p><p></p><p>Then the shadow strangeness source will branch out individual shadows, and fuse and refine them with the divided fragments of various sizes.</p><p></p><p>Refining them into various spatial equipment, such as spatial bags, spatial rings, spatial bracelets, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of two ends.</p><p></p><p>In Xuanhuang's small world, a breach also appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This breach was created under Xuanhuang's control, with the purpose of absorbing the blood pool secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The absorbed space was neatly divided into spatial fragments by an invisible divine knife of will.</p><p></p><p>Then they were neatly arranged, waiting for Xuanhuang to finish refining the spatial equipment.</p><p></p><p>Each equipment also needs a shadow clone as a control source, or a "Fa Chant".</p><p></p><p>The Fa Chant is a kind of traction or summoning force, which ordinary people do not have the ability to open or close the spatial equipment.</p><p></p><p>It requires a master control switch.</p><p></p><p>Each shadow is a small program, and the overall system is the shadow strangeness source.</p><p></p><p>The Fa Chant opens the small program, and if the password is correct, the master control system of the shadow strangeness source is activated or deactivated.</p><p></p><p>It sounds very complicated, and the refining is also very complicated, but the user experience is very simple.</p><p></p><p>For example: "Open sesame," click, it's open. "Close sesame," click, it's closed.</p><p></p><p>The path-opener of the Tao is always extremely complex and difficult. The users don't need to think about how the spatial equipment is refined, what the principles are, what the materials are, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Back to the blood pool secret realm.</p><p></p><p>The originally small space has already been devoured by half.</p><p></p><p>Even the secret realm's small rule of divine power has been erased, leaving a very clean and calm small space.</p><p></p><p>The violent temper has been cured.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, covered it with his will, and changed the remaining half of the space rules. He also severed the symbiotic relationship between the secret realm space and the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the blood pool strangeness is free, the secret realm can no longer confine it, nor can it support it.</p><p></p><p>The blood pool strangeness said: "I don't want this kind of freedom, I'd rather be confined."</p><p></p><p>The two are interdependent, or the secret realm exists because of the blood pool strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Although the secret realm will eventually shatter and merge into the Blue Star, there is also a possibility that the secret realm will become the strangeness domain of the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it will be the complete fusion and forging of a more powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>Now the blood pool's dream is shattered.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that there is a damned Rotten Knife in its body, devouring it.</p><p></p><p>And the remaining half of the secret realm rules have been transformed by Xuanhuang into a protective wall.</p><p></p><p>That is, when ordinary people enter, they will be transformed into protective spiritual light, protecting the entrants from the blood pool strangeness's spiritual soul invasion and attack.</p><p></p><p>In this way, ordinary people can enter freely, and drive wild beasts into the blood pool to be transformed into fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the blood pool strangeness does not need to be sad, its role is very important, and it still needs it to catalyze the fierce beasts, it will not be easily sealed.</p><p></p><p>And the wild animals driven into the blood pool will replenish and strengthen its losses. It has a bright future.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of using its strangeness ability to catalyze. Its strangeness ability is endless, after all, the power source comes from the rule fragments, which can be said to be inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>"Come back!"</p><p></p><p>After the arrangement was completed, Xuanhuang recalled the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>The Void Saber, which had drunk the fresh blood, was covered in red light all over its body. As long as it refines the devoured strange blood this time, the breakthrough to the late stage of the first level will be unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xuanhuang also released the restraint on the blood pool strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the restraint was released, the irrational blood pool strangeness was about to riot.</p><p></p><p>The disadvantage of an irrational existence is just this.</p><p></p><p>It is completely unaware of its current situation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ground.</p><p></p><p>"Restraint!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang once again restrained the turbulent and bizarre Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xuanhuang had a more thorough method, which was to directly replace the will of heaven and erase the chaotic consciousness of the Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not do so, however, was for another reason. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Long ago, when Xuanhuang was guarding the Blood Pool, he also discovered the Blood Moon Realm, wondering why two blood-related bizarre spaces and worlds appeared not far apart.</p><p></p><p>Was there a connection between them? When he just entered the Blood Pool Realm and restrained the Blood Pool, he indeed found a clue.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the Blood Pool, there was a fine red thread, like a blood vein, winding its way to the unknown depths of the ground.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red thread looked very fragile, and if Xuanhuang erased the consciousness of the Blood Pool, this thread would also be broken.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Xuanhuang did not erase the consciousness of the Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red thread looked very small, but it was essentially high-level, similar to the magic stones and divine blood he had obtained before.</p><p></p><p>It was bestowed by a high-level origin.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the source of the blood-red thread must be where the high-level origin was.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang wanted to explore deeper, but found that this blood-red thread had no known origin, seemingly coming from the underground, but more like extending through countless overlapping spaces.</p><p></p><p>If there was a major disturbance, the blood-red thread that penetrated the layers of space would be broken, and it would be difficult to find it again.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang guessed that the source of the blood-red thread was one of the seven great mysterious lands: the Blood Sea.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was just a guess, not necessarily accurate.</p><p></p><p>Combining the previously discovered Blood Moon World, this represented the direction of Nanshi or the direction of Daiyu Province, and had a deep connection with the Blood Sea.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that the extensions of the seven great secret lands were scattered throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>In Nanshi, Xuanhuang had found the Guiqu, the Blood Sea, the Dream Realm, and the Time Memory River and Nanshan, which may or may not be considered secret lands.</p><p></p><p>Each time he entered such secret lands, it was a nightmare for others, but an opportunity for Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>So Xuanhuang did not plan to erase the chaotic consciousness of the Blood Pool, for fear of losing the coordinates.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not be so troublesome, just a simple transformation would do.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre Blood Pool was restrained again, and Xuanhuang began to think of a solution.</p><p></p><p>"No need to think, as soon as I release it, it will definitely riot again. Dealing with irrational beings is just this troublesome."</p><p></p><p>"Then it can only disappear, without a target, it should be fine."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xuanhuang immediately withdrew the restraint, and then he disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The released Blood Pool fluctuated for a while, but did not trigger the existence of the bizarre, and quickly calmed down under the operation of the rules.</p><p></p><p>When Xuanhuang reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Greeting him was not the rioting Blood Pool, but the soul attack of the bizarre Blood Pool, just as when he first entered, beginning to lure him.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not move, and the transformed secret realm will, turned into a stream of light covering Xuanhuang, replacing the Xuanhuang to resist the soul attack.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Pool seemed "surprised".</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the secret realm will could empower its soul attack, and this time it resisted its attack.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Pool always felt that something had changed, but only the regular and chaotic consciousness of it could not figure it out.</p><p></p><p>It could only continue the soul attack, while the secret realm continued to resist.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, it's done."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled.</p><p></p><p>Then he walked out of the Blood Pool Realm and saw the members of the Martial Dao Alliance waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, go try with a few animals, and you go in too, take this token."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang gave a token to Liu Jinquan, which was the identifier of Xuanhuang's will, and holding the token was equivalent to Xuanhuang entering.</p><p></p><p>The secret realm will would protect this person and resist the soul attack of the bizarre Blood Pool.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan took the token and led two prepared sheep, tucking a chicken under his arm.</p><p></p><p>He cautiously approached the crack.</p><p></p><p>After entering, this was Liu Jinquan's first time in the Blood Pool Realm, and even the first time he was so close to the bizarre.</p><p></p><p>But out of trust in Xuanhuang, he was very confident.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a soul attack came.</p><p></p><p>The token Xuanhuang gave him immediately reacted, and a white protective spiritual light appeared, blocking the soul attack.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" Liu Jinquan sighed with relief.</p><p></p><p>But the sheep he was leading and the chicken under his arm suddenly went berserk, their eyes turning blood red and struggling violently.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan let go, and the two sheep and the chicken rushed towards the Blood Pool and jumped in without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Pool boiled, and countless blood threads instantly covered the bodies of the sheep and the chicken, their agonizing screams sounding more like the cries of demonic sheep and chickens.</p><p></p><p>The sheep's beard quickly turned blood-red.</p><p></p><p>The chicken's movements were rhythmic, as if...</p><p></p><p>It lasted for ten and a half minutes, with the unblinking Liu Jinquan watching intently, witnessing the transformation of the sheep and the chicken.</p><p></p><p>As if their entire vital energy had been devoured by the Blood Pool, but then assimilated and transformed by the Blood Pool, the sheep became nearly two meters tall and three and a half meters long, and the chicken became nearly one point eight meters tall.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary small sheep had become a giant demonic sheep, and the ordinary rooster had become a chicken that walked like it was dancing.</p><p></p><p>The bizarre Blood Pool, which had been consumed by the Void Knife for half, also gained a trace, though not much, but it was indeed strengthened.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the sustainable development strategy was on the right track.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan was suddenly panicked.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the demonic sheep and chicken had locked onto him and were rushing towards him in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>Liu Jinquan turned and ran, quickly running out of the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan!"</p><p></p><p>His voice was heard before he was seen, excited and accompanied by panic.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" Liu Jinquan ran out quickly, shouting as he ran, "Master Xuan succeeded, he succeeded."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone prepare to fight."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shouted loudly, awakening those who were in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Two ferocious sheep and one chicken were nothing, he didn't need to intervene, let them go through the trial.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cave had been dug very large, and many concrete and steel supports had been erected, more than enough for a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>"Cluck cluck cluck!"</p><p></p><p>The roar of the sheep, the cries of the chicken, the three fierce beasts rushed towards the crowd in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The heavy weapons were held back as a backup, in front were the armed warriors, full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>With Xuanhuang present, they were very brave.</p><p></p><p>Shouting loudly, they charged towards the three fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Such great strength, evil beast, take my blade!"</p><p>"Get out of the way!"</p><p>"Attack its eyes."</p><p></p><p>The scene was a bit chaotic, with courage and skill, but lacking in combat experience.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were backups, the heavy weapons with larger calibers, and they would open fire whenever they saw danger.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was a close call, a group of people covered in blood had slain the demonic sheep and chicken.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't have any smiles on their faces, because they knew their own performance, and Master Xuan's expression was very calm.</p><p></p><p>This kind of calm was more oppressive, Master Xuan's anger and joy could be dealt with, but a blank expression was the hardest to handle.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if Master Xuan was satisfied or not.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Practice more in the future, these catalyzed fierce beasts had you all flustered, how to deal with true fierce beasts and more dangerous bizarreness... Old Liu, clean up and report to Sun Hui."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xuanhuang disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd heaved a sigh of relief, then broke into smiles.</p><p></p><p>Although they were subtly criticized by the Master, they were still very happy, most likely this was the first time they had directly slain a fierce beast, a good start.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

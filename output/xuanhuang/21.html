        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ning!" </p><p></p><p>He uttered this word.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a transparent light appeared around him, centered on him.</p><p></p><p>Entering the extraordinary will, one can leave the body, can transform the formless into the formed.</p><p></p><p>As Taoism says: Tao, void, essence, qi, spirit.</p><p></p><p>Tao gives birth to void, void gives birth to essence, essence gives birth to qi, qi gives birth to spirit.</p><p></p><p>Tao is formless, just like the will before.</p><p></p><p>Tao gives birth to void, and the void is the current state, even if it is not a tangible illusion, but it represents the transformation from the formless to the formed.</p><p></p><p>The manifest will can now levitate and fly.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, he began to float, changing his movements according to his intent.</p><p></p><p>Then a beam of light flashed in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>The distant rock was smoothly cut open.</p><p></p><p>The will can also be covered on the surface of the body, forming a protective shield to resist attacks below the extraordinary first level.</p><p></p><p>The will is the integration of essence, qi, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, whether it is a physical attack, a magical attack, or a spiritual attack, it can be effectively dealt with.</p><p></p><p>Even the mind is one of the manifestations of the will, the heart and the mind.</p><p></p><p>Mental attacks can hardly have any effect on him.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the will is an extremely comprehensive path.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The will of Xuanhuang flickered, and a heavenly and earthly furnace appeared.</p><p></p><p>The previous Guiyu Great Grinder's appearance was completely unexpected.</p><p></p><p>The Dilemma Brush sacrificed itself to achieve the extraordinary transformation of the Guiyu Great Grinder.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the advancement of Xuanhuang's will, the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace, which has been refining his qi and will, has finally reached the extraordinary level.</p><p></p><p>Although the current Guiyu Great Grinder and Heavenly and Earthly Furnace are not physical manifestations, but a virtual existence condensed from true intent, they are essentially extraordinary, which is unchangeable.</p><p></p><p>The physical first-level extraordinary copper furnace cannot compare to the current virtual Heavenly and Earthly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>The forging material of the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace is the true intent of all things, not to mention that the heaven and earth are the forgers.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Furnace has condensed into reality, starting from the fourth-level true intent.</p><p></p><p>The Tong Tian Building Wood and the Guiyu Great Grinder are the same.</p><p></p><p>"Withdraw!"</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>With a command from Xuanhuang, the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace instantly entered his body.</p><p></p><p>This time, it did not enter the consciousness space world, but he entered the opened sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Furnace settled in the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>A sense of heart and mind connection arose.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful feeling!"</p><p></p><p>For the first time in this world, Xuanhuang felt a strong sense of foundation.</p><p></p><p>Next, he will refine his body to break through to the extraordinary first level. This step is more dangerous than the advancement of the will.</p><p></p><p>Because the Heavenly Dao is not complete, and the Heavenly Will is distorted. Many small worlds and experts who have stepped into this level in this world have lost control.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is naturally not afraid, as his will has reached a substitutable level.</p><p></p><p>As the kindling of the centipede spirit blood, after Xuanhuang's will entered the extraordinary, it has become scarce.</p><p></p><p>It is difficult to meet Xuanhuang's need to raise his body to the first level.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xuanhuang thought that one hundred thousand tons of strength was the peak, but it turned out to be a limit-breaking.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Jin Ning, to thank Xuanhuang, brought him a Great Restoration Pill.</p><p></p><p>There is a heavenly arrangement in the dark.</p><p></p><p>The Great Restoration Pill is the energy to reach the limit of twelve thousand tons of strength.</p><p></p><p>The remaining centipede demonic qi blood essence serves as the power to enter the first level.</p><p></p><p>Although the dawn has broken, Xuanhuang decides to refine his body to the extraordinary level in one breath.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Furnace appeared and quickly expanded.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang leaped into the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>A scorching aura immediately enveloped his entire body.</p><p></p><p>He quickly took the Great Restoration Pill, and the surging energy filled his meridians.</p><p></p><p>The scorching flames in the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace assisted his refinement.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's consciousness sank into the dantian, constantly controlling the situation with his will.</p><p></p><p>About two hours later, with the help of the Great Restoration Pill, Xuanhuang successfully reached twelve thousand tons of strength.</p><p></p><p>Just as expected.</p><p></p><p>Then, in one breath, the remaining centipede demonic spirit blood in the furnace began to permeate Xuanhuang's flesh and blood under the refining of the furnace.</p><p></p><p>The two together forged Xuanhuang's extraordinary body refinement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, Xuanhuang hasn't come down yet?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment of Xuanhuang's breakthrough, Wu Gang, who had come with Jin Ning, came to the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Has he never been late before?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was also puzzled. He had told Xuanhuang yesterday that the deputy curator would also come today.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang looked at the time, but said, "Doesn't this kid want to hide from me? Let's go and take a look."</p><p></p><p>He then stepped towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang said so, but in his heart, he was praying that Xuanhuang had not encountered any danger.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't show it.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning quickly followed, and the two headed towards the cave on the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>After about six or seven minutes, the two arrived at the cave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The two were shocked by what they saw.</p><p></p><p>A illusory three-legged bronze furnace was floating and slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura came rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>But it was not a sinister and unpleasant kind of power, but a scorching and fierce one.</p><p></p><p>"Curator..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning immediately recognized it, this was the Heavenly and Earthly Smelting Furnace that he had been contemplating recently.</p><p></p><p>But the words got stuck in his mouth, and he didn't know what else to say.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, don't move, just watch."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang thought Jin Ning was panicking.</p><p></p><p>Although he was also panicking, as the curator, he had to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>The two wanted to think about other things, like where Xuanhuang had gone? But somehow, looking at the slowly rotating bronze furnace, they couldn't help but stare.</p><p></p><p>The more perfect the existence, the more irresistible the urge to approach and submit to it.</p><p></p><p>The most perfect thing in the world is the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Smelting Furnace was the Dao in the eyes of the two.</p><p></p><p>An uncontrollable desire to observe and get close to this existence.</p><p></p><p>To the point that their rationality was suppressed, as if they had forgotten the purpose of coming here.</p><p></p><p>Intoxicatedly gazing at the suspended bronze furnace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Xuanhuang in the furnace had entered the final stage of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The remaining essence of the centipede demon was refined, and Xuanhuang's body finally stepped into the realm of the Superhuman.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>The sea of qi began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>In the center, a small crack began to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A sound like a gushing spring.</p><p></p><p>A spring gushed out from the center, and in an instant, Xuanhuang felt a connection between his sea of qi and the blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>The originally empty sea of bitterness began to show a golden mist.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment! An inexplicable palpitation came, and the just-formed sea of qi had a feeling of returning to chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Suppress!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had already prepared for this.</p><p></p><p>The spring of the sea of qi that had just been born was about to become bizarre under the twisted laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But his will immediately covered and isolated it.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!" a sound.</p><p></p><p>As if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>The spring returned to a calm appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh, swoosh..."</p><p></p><p>The sound of surging continued, and the sea of qi was quickly filled, until it became a golden sea of ten zhang in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang officially entered the Superhuman realm of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Retract!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Smelting Furnace quickly shrank and appeared in his dantian, sitting on the spring.</p><p></p><p>The golden qi gushing out from the spring of the sea of qi was like golden furnace fire.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change.</p><p></p><p>Woke up the admiring Dao Wu Gang and Jin Ning.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the furnace disappear and the floating Xuanhuang in mid-air, the two had an expression of incredulity on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xuanhuang quickly concealed the Superhuman aura.</p><p></p><p>But just the moment it was exposed, it made the two dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang... Xuanhuang sir, is it you?"</p><p></p><p>The usually unflappable Wu Gang bit his tongue to calm himself down.</p><p></p><p>In the moment he spoke, he quickly changed the way of address.</p><p></p><p>With an uncertain questioning tone.</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>"I have become Superhuman."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning: ...</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang: ...</p><p></p><p>Please collect this book, my friends who read it. This book will become more and more exciting. I'm not good at writing exciting beginnings, but I'm good at writing better and better sequels.</p><p></p><p>This book has a slow start and many settings, so the performance is not good.

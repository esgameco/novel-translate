        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness space, the mysterious puppet was completely devoured by the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>The uneven surface of the saber had once again become shimmering silver, and even its length, which was previously 1.7 meters, had returned to its original 2 meters.</p><p></p><p>After devouring the mysterious puppet, the Void Saber officially entered the first tier of the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>This was because it had previously devoured the scales of the centipede demon, combined with Xuanhuang's consolidated will.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after entering the first tier, the Void Saber had reached the early peak, and was only a hair's breadth away from the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang planned to help it fully enter the middle stage next.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang came to the edge of the consciousness space again.</p><p></p><p>The area of 1,000 meters in radius was already very large.</p><p></p><p>After the will became extraordinary, Xuanhuang's divine soul had made significant progress.</p><p></p><p>The white divine soul had become much more concentrated, which was Xuanhuang's 'fourth tier' divine soul, the divine soul of the Fa You Ling.</p><p></p><p>As for the faint golden immortal divine soul, there was no change at all, still as elusive and lofty as before.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the edge, Xuanhuang looked at the Void Saber that had been reborn.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Xuanhuang inserted the Void Saber into the dense gray mist again.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzleâ€”"</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>The intense power of dissolution and return to nothingness eroded the Void Saber.</p><p></p><p>The Void Saber, which had previously persisted for 10 seconds, was exceptionally resilient this time.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's will was connected to the Void Saber, until two minutes had passed, and Xuanhuang felt that the Void Saber had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Xuanhuang quickly withdrew it.</p><p></p><p>In less than five minutes, the Void Saber had returned to its original appearance, with its uneven 1.7-meter form.</p><p></p><p>But its abilities had been completely evolved.</p><p></p><p>It had already reached the middle stage of the first tier, surpassing the Returning Nothingness Great Grinder and the Heaven and Earth Smelter, officially becoming the eldest brother among the four weapons.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the Void Saber had retained one of the abilities of the mysterious puppet it had devoured.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Why is it the ability to devour and grow from fear? The puppet and fusion abilities were not retained?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang discovered that it was the ability to devour and evolve from fear, which was a standard feature of almost all mysterious beings.</p><p></p><p>"Well, at least it has gained an evolutionary ability."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't dwell on it, as the Void Saber already had three powerful abilities: devouring and dissolving, divine soul shaking and destruction, and saber intent.</p><p></p><p>Too many functions would only make it seem cluttered.</p><p></p><p>Previously, all three were primarily for killing, and now having an auxiliary ability is not bad.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this auxiliary ability has also strengthened the devouring and divine soul shaking abilities.</p><p></p><p>More precisely, the previous devouring and dissolution, and divine soul destruction abilities have evolved into the ability to devour and grow from fearful emotions.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the Void Saber that had returned to its original form, Xuanhuang returned to the martial arts courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After simply inquiring if Sungtong was alright, Xuanhuang once again entered cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Sinking into the dantian, after two days of effort, Xuanhuang had engraved seven-twelfths of the Heaven Gate's shadow on the Heaven and Earth Smelter.</p><p></p><p>In another five days, the complete Heaven Gate diagram could be engraved.</p><p></p><p>After that, by refining the Heaven Pillar, Xuanhuang could enter the cultivation of the first tier of the will.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was more important than one's own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xuanhuang had good opportunities and a consciousness space, he understood that his own strength was the key.</p><p></p><p>The consciousness space was only the best auxiliary for his own rise, a safe haven.</p><p></p><p>One's own strength was the greatest guarantee.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Things did not go as planned.</p><p></p><p>"Knock, knock!"</p><p></p><p>After completing today's cultivation, Xuanhuang was physically and mentally exhausted, as engraving the Heaven Gate required the consolidation of will, which came from one's essence, energy, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the Pavilion Master and Deputy Pavilion Master Wugang request an audience."</p><p></p><p>Sungtong, who had already integrated into his identity, reported.</p><p></p><p>"Let them in."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Sungtong then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before Sun Tong and Wu Gang walked in.</p><p></p><p>The visibly agitated Wu Gang had a look of anger on his face.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Is there resistance to the modifications at Qingyan Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Sunhui shook his head and said, "Master Xuan, it's not about that. The renovation of Qingyan Mountain is going smoothly, and we'll be able to complete it in half a month at the latest. It's about something else... we've been exposed."</p><p></p><p>"Exposed?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was taken aback. What had been exposed?</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, the people from the Zhenxie Department have been ruthless. They used strange methods to probe the memories of the people in our martial arts school, and they discovered you."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang shouted angrily, full of indignation.</p><p></p><p>"I see," Xuanhuang understood.</p><p></p><p>However, he wasn't too concerned about it. He hadn't hidden anything when he preached before. If he had wanted to hide, he would have done it in a way that couldn't be detected. Knowing this, could they really do anything to him?</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal. Now that they know, they know. We've been acting righteously, so why bother worrying about this?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xuanhuang's words, Sunhui frowned and said, "Master Xuan, it's not that simple. They just found a pretext to say that since they need to handle other matters, they're handing the eerie corpse tree in Fulin Community over to us."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, using strange methods to probe the memories of ordinary people is a mistake."</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang angrily said, "Master Xuan, they are forcing you to take action, wanting to use the eerie corpse tree to test you, and even... "</p><p></p><p>Wu Gang didn't finish his sentence out loud.</p><p></p><p>"Even wanting to use it to eliminate me," Xuanhuang completed the sentence for him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, since you know, you don't have to step forward," Sun Tong also expressed her opinion.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple," Sunhui shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang understood Sunhui's meaning. After all, he had lived two lives, and he was well aware of such small tricks.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't step forward, he would definitely be exposed and praised. If he didn't stand up, the martial arts school would be ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Why the gloomy faces? What's the problem with them knowing?" </p><p></p><p>"In the face of overwhelming power, all conspiracies and tricks are useless."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity to announce the rebirth of our martial arts. What's wrong with that? They've even set up a stage for us, we can't let their 'kindness' go to waste."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them were both hesitant and excited.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the sky won't fall. That eerie corpse tree is also one of my targets. Even if they didn't arrange it, I would have gone to deal with it. It's just a bit of an unexpected event."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The eerie corpse tree had powerful abilities. As long as one stepped into its eerie domain, their life force would be absorbed until they were hung on the tree and became its puppet.</p><p></p><p>It was a two-in-one deal. Absorbing the life force of living beings and then controlling their corpses.</p><p></p><p>However, the eerie phenomena follow certain rules. As long as one doesn't enter its eerie domain, there won't be any harm.</p><p></p><p>With his consciousness space and teleportation abilities, Xuanhuang, an expert-level practitioner, could easily deal with this immobile eerie phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>He could have the puppet corpses sent to the Heavenly and Earthly Furnace, the resentful souls sent to the Great Grinder of the Abyss, and then he could teleport and slash with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't have a few teammates?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could even use the will of the heaven and earth in his small world to condense a domain.</p><p></p><p>This ability had never had a chance to be used in actual combat, as the opponents he had faced were all quite weak.</p><p></p><p>This time, he would use it. After erecting the domain, the Towering Wooden Tree could appear for a short time by borrowing the power of the domain.</p><p></p><p>Let the Wooden Tree make the final attack and devour the eerie corpse tree, reaping the opportunities it brought.</p><p></p><p>If the Wooden Tree complained: "We were all created by the same master, why is the Furnace and the Great Grinder always swallowing this and that, while I, the Wooden Tree, get nothing?"</p><p></p><p>The Furnace is always following the master to refine its will, and the inscribed Heavenly Gate has been emphasized in its cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But what about me, the Wooden Tree...?

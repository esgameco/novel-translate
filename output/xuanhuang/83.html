        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bloated big tree became emaciated. When asked about its annual harvest, the big tree said: "Look at the fallen leaves covering the ground, that is my harvest."</p><p></p><p>When you are deeply moved by the big tree's sentiment...</p><p></p><p>The big tree then said: "I used to earn a lot, but by the end of the year, it was all gone, and I only gained an additional growth ring."</p><p></p><p>Haha! </p><p></p><p>The reasoning is sound, but the situations of people and objects are completely different.</p><p></p><p>In a secret chamber of the Qingyun Mountain Taoist temple.</p><p></p><p>Dao Master Ma and his disciple High Awareness were looking at the fallen leaves, their mood particularly good.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Dao Master Ma asked his disciple High Awareness.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it feels amazing. The Mysterious Master's magic stone can absorb the distorted spiritual souls. This is the first time in many years that I feel so relaxed, and I even have a sense of being back to the time before I mastered the strange powers, discovering that I have become quite extreme and biased in these past few years."</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the distorted spiritual souls through the magic stone, High Awareness felt refreshed and had a sense of shedding his heavy physical body and being reborn.</p><p></p><p>He had previously asked his master if there was a way to change the path of spirit cultivators, and his master Ma said there was no way, but he would ask the Mysterious Master.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma realized that he had underestimated the difficulty of seeing the Mysterious Master. Previously it was fine, but with the arrival of the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions, as well as the establishment of the Martial Dao Alliance and the influx of spirit cultivators and martial artists, Qingyun Mountain had grown rapidly. This made the Mysterious Master increasingly difficult to see, and even when summoned, it would be with ten others, making it hard to find an opportunity to ask him directly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a turning point appeared - the Mysterious Master released news about the magic stone that could absorb the corrupted spiritual souls. High Awareness got the chance to personally experience it, leading to this conversation.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, that's good," Master Ma said, feeling a bit guilty for not being able to fulfill his disciple's expectations. Fortunately, there is always a way out. The issue of spirit cultivator transformation has not been resolved yet, but the immediate problem of spiritual soul distortion has been alleviated, providing a great buffer opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you contacted my elder brother?" High Awareness asked. His elder brother High Ming was in an even more severe condition, still at the headquarters in the Summer Capital.</p><p></p><p>"I have, your elder brother said he will try his best to come back, it should be in the next few days. His condition is much worse than yours, it has reached a critical point."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the elder disciple's predicament made Master Ma worried.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't let my elder brother come back. Let him stay at Qingyun Mountain. Although it is not friendly to spirit cultivators here, it is still better than constantly facing crises at the headquarters. Maybe the Mysterious Master will find a way to change the path of spirit cultivators."</p><p></p><p>The bond between the two brothers was very close, closer than blood brothers. High Ming had taken care of his younger brother High Awareness since they were young. The elder brother is like a father.</p><p></p><p>"I've also persuaded him, but your elder brother is still considering it. You need to know that this is not something your elder brother can decide on his own. His strength and special abilities are needed by the Summer Capital headquarters. Leaving rashly would not be good for your elder brother or even the Mysterious Master, as we cannot guarantee that some people at the headquarters won't take advantage of it."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma was telling the truth, but High Awareness was still dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, we also need someone at the Summer Capital headquarters to gather information for us."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma could only console himself and his disciple this way.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, my elder brother has good judgment, let him decide for himself. Maybe the Summer Capital headquarters is more suitable for him, with opportunities meant for him."</p><p></p><p>High Awareness chose to accept it.</p><p></p><p>Changing the topic, Master Ma asked, "How have your recent investigations been going?"</p><p></p><p>Gathering information was High Awareness's specialty, as he was adept at the strange and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is not good. I discovered many unfamiliar spirit cultivators coming to South City, even more so in the Strange Association. Through listening and investigation, I found that about 80% of them are here because of the Mysterious Master. There is also an unconfirmed piece of news, I'm not sure if it's true."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>High Awareness said, "I heard that under the strong urging of the Puppet Palace Master Gou Jian, the notorious 'Jia Zhengyi', the Rat Trio Brothers are now heading towards South City. These three brothers are extremely evil and on the verge of losing their humanity, becoming even stranger than the strange powers. Their target may be the Mysterious Master."</p><p></p><p>"The Rat Trio Brothers?" </p><p></p><p>Master Ma frowned upon hearing this. These three brothers were notorious, with great strength, and were wanted by the major righteous spirit cultivator organizations.</p><p></p><p>Even before mastering the strange powers, they were already bad people. After mastering them, they became even worse, their original intentions already twisted, and they were beyond redemption or correction.</p><p></p><p>"Only the demonic cult would dare to attempt an assassination, right?"</p><p></p><p>Master Ma knew that there were two groups openly calling for the Mysterious Master's assassination online - the demonic cult and the Divine Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Alliance is likely just verbal threats without action. Besides, not many would dare to take assassination missions, given the Mysterious Master's abilities in resolving the Corpse Tree strange power, the Ominous Shadow Qi Long, and Gou Jian's puppet clone. Many are deterred not only by the threat of the Righteous Alliance and the Exorcism Department, but also by the Mysterious Master's strength."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma nodded, "So it's only the Rat Trio Brothers who would dare to take it on."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you can't say that about us spirit cultivators..." High Awareness found it difficult to continue.</p><p></p><p>Master Ma understood what he wanted to express. The spirit cultivator community was very complex - it was not right to simply treat them all as mentally ill, but out of ten, at least half were abnormal.</p><p></p><p>This was the price of mastering the strange powers - when you wield a powerful force that does not belong to you, you have to be prepared to be distorted by that very power.</p><p></p><p>"I'm worried that some mentally unstable ones may act against the Mysterious Master, like Wei Zixuan and the others. They have been acting very abnormal lately, almost absent from the Exorcism Department's meetings and work."</p><p></p><p>"Them?" </p><p></p><p>Master Ma sighed deeply. Many of the spirit cultivators in South City were familiar to him, and Wei Zixuan and the others were ones he had witnessed grow up.</p><p></p><p>"With a corrupted heart, the outcome is already determined."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma's meaning was that the Mysterious Master had no intention of troubling these lowly followers. </p><p></p><p>When your starting point is wrong, and you don't correct it, the result is already predetermined. Destined to make mistake after mistake, until disappearance or death.</p><p></p><p>Whether you call it fate or a rule, it is something quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"They have shown signs of leaving the South City Exorcism Department, gathering with some who dare not openly oppose the Mysterious Master. Although they won't amount to anything, every time I 'accidentally' overhear their whispered conversations, I get very angry."</p><p></p><p>"Don't mind them, their fate is already determined," </p><p></p><p>Master Ma shook his head. These people would not amount to anything, with first-stage spirit cultivators as their limit. </p><p></p><p>In this world, high-level spirit cultivators were extremely polarized - either completely evil or completely good. Those with a bit of righteousness and a bit of evil would not last, as the strange powers they wield would end up corrupting and distorting them. </p><p></p><p>To become a high-level spirit cultivator requires extremism. Extremism is a flaw, but it also has two sides - it represents unwavering determination.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go report to the Mysterious Master, tell him about the news of the Rat Trio Brothers possibly making a move, and also ask about the possibility of changing the path of spirit cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Master Ma finally had something worthwhile to report.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Don't thank me, thank yourself. Your initial intention was to protect the Mysterious Master, so you naturally deserve a positive response."</p><p></p><p>The two master and disciple finished their discussion and walked out of the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the cold wind blew, stirring up the fallen leaves on the ground and even knocking down the last remaining "leaf of perseverance" from the now completely emaciated big tree.</p><p></p><p>But the two had reaped a bountiful harvest, with a bright future ahead.</p><p></p><p>On the other side! Arriving in the small world, looking at the neatly cut spatial fragments, the Mysterious Master was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In his hand, a dark glowing orb appeared - the shadow strange power.</p><p></p><p>Having passed the initial excitement, the Mysterious Master found that the strange powers were just that - whether one mastered them or not made no difference to himself.</p><p></p><p>So he dispersed his Dao Master's thoughts and began to research and ponder the other uses of the shadow strange power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the creation of spatial artifacts.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Xuanhuang controlled the Ghostly Shadow to devour many shadows. At this moment, the Ghostly Shadow was at the pure level, on par with Jianmu, just a step away from being a second-tier Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Scatter!" With a command, the Ghostly Shadow began to surge, like beans being scattered into an army.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred shadows dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Following Xuanhuang's will, more than a hundred shadows merged with the arranged spatial fragments.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>There are many ways of the Dao of Forging. For example, the "True Heaven and Earth Smelting Furnace Method" that Xuanhuang is using now.</p><p></p><p>It's not the precious Heaven and Earth Smelting Furnace, but a small world transformed into a Heaven and Earth Smelting Furnace, with the power of Heaven and Earth to refine treasures.</p><p></p><p>The divided spatial fragments numbered 160, among which there were 100 one-meter cubes, 50 five-meter cubes, and 10 ten-meter cubes.</p><p></p><p>That is, 160 spatial equipment were refined in one go.</p><p></p><p>The 10 ten-meter cubes were spatial rings, the 50 five-meter cubes were divided into 25 spatial bracers and 25 spatial belts.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining 100 one-meter cubes, they were the most ordinary spatial bags, also called storage bags.</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Will as the furnace, refining 160 items at once was not difficult for Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty lies in the previous research and material preparation.</p><p></p><p>But these have all been solved.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's character is that he does not ask for help in anything, and if he doesn't have it, he researches and creates it himself.</p><p></p><p>This is his Dao, to study the laws of all things and comprehend the mysteries of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Creating methods is just a means, not the end result.</p><p></p><p>After nearly two hours, the 160 storage spatial equipment were successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>They dispersed like flowing light, falling in front of Xuanhuang like raindrops.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang picked up a one-meter cube storage bag, and some ordinary items appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of his mind, those ordinary items disappeared into thin air and were absorbed into the spatial bag, and then they reappeared and disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang tested it many times.</p><p></p><p>"As long as blood is used as a medium, even a first-stage cultivator can open the storage bag by consuming their blood and qi, the effect is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded in satisfaction, just as he had deduced.</p><p></p><p>Blood serves as a medium, connecting to the source of the Ghostly Shadow and leaving a mark.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, opening it only requires the cultivator to consume their blood, qi, and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"It just consumes a bit too much. A first-stage cultivator in body, qi, or spirit refinement can only open it about ten times a day."</p><p></p><p>For Xuanhuang, it's almost no loss at all.</p><p></p><p>But for low-level cultivators, it's a bit of a burden.</p><p></p><p>But it's unavoidable, as having low cultivation means there are barriers to everything, and everything requires consumption.</p><p></p><p>That's why the lower realms are so difficult, no matter what you do.</p><p></p><p>"But ten times a day is enough to use. It's not like anyone is so bored as to constantly open and close it. Besides, taking some pills can restore it, and having higher cultivation will be better."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Xuanhuang waved his hand, and those ordinary items instantly disappeared, completely dissolved and returned to their original state in the small world.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang then took out a jade box, inside of which was a gas lamp bulb.</p><p></p><p>It was one of the three Anomalies he had obtained from the Southern City Martial Hall before, with the leg bone transformed into a White Bone Pagoda and the blood cloth refined into the "Talisman Dao Sutra".</p><p></p><p>The only remaining item was the lamp bulb, which would burn the spiritual soul when lit.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had never used it, only keeping it as a collection.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he still hasn't used it, as the lamp bulb's abilities are already possessed by the Great Grinder, and what the Great Grinder doesn't have, it also has.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang is still researching how to deal with the lamp bulb, needing to wait until the Great Grinder is no longer afraid of the power of the Abyss in the mist of the small world.</p><p></p><p>Now, he's taking it out just for experimentation.</p><p></p><p>To test how the storage bag handles Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Xuanhuang, the storage bag absorbed the Anomaly of the lamp bulb.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, except for a slightly higher consumption, the rest is within my expectations."</p><p></p><p>After a series of experiments, it is feasible to store sealed Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>"What if it's not sealed?"</p><p></p><p>He then experimented with the Pig Leg Anomaly from the previous toilet-devouring incident, which Xuanhuang had mixed feelings about.</p><p></p><p>This was a Placenta Anomaly, or perhaps a four-month-old fetal Anomaly.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether it was an abortion or some kind of accident, but it ended up in the toilet drain.</p><p></p><p>It could devour living beings and strengthen itself, and all that it devoured would be transformed into its own nourishment for growth.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Xuanhuang had sealed it without erasing its sentience.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the object was "special," it had a miraculous ability that piqued Xuanhuang's interest.</p><p></p><p>It could transform primal qi, which was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>With each intake and peck, it was like a fetus in the womb being nourished by the mother before birth, belonging to the primal existence.</p><p></p><p>After birth, the first cry and breath would sever the primal qi, transforming it into a post-natal being.</p><p></p><p>This was not the division of primal and post-natal of the Great Dao, but the division of primal and post-natal within the human body.</p><p></p><p>Primal qi is quite miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuanhuang is still at the first stage of Mysterious Transformation, refining essence and body. The second stage of Penetrating the Mysteries is the beginning of qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's deduction is that through his own tempering, he can absorb spiritual qi and refine it into primal unified qi, using this primal unified qi as the spiritual power of his second stage.</p><p></p><p>But extracting it directly from Heaven and Earth is difficult.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Placenta Anomaly has given him hope.</p><p></p><p>His plan is to refine this Anomaly into a spiritual vein after reaching the second stage, an existence that can absorb the spiritual qi of the world and transform it into primal spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he only sealed it without erasing its chaotic consciousness, to prevent accidents.</p><p></p><p>The other Anomalies in his hands have almost all had their sentience erased by Xuanhuang, so the Placenta Anomaly is the only experimental subject.</p><p></p><p>A stream of pure energy entered the Placenta Anomaly, and the sealed Placenta Anomaly was revived.</p><p></p><p>It tried to transform into a black hole to devour Xuanhuang, but it couldn't do it.</p><p></p><p>"Absorb!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang quickly took it into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The struggle was very intense, but under Xuanhuang's powerful will, the Placenta Anomaly was absorbed into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>And in the spatial realm of the storage bag, a force of assimilation was transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Blood Pool Anomaly and the Blood Pool Realm, they were actually forming a mutually reinforcing connection.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang immediately took out the Anomaly Placenta and sealed it again.</p><p></p><p>"Absorbing a revived Anomaly is difficult. I can forcibly absorb it with my strong will, but ordinary people cannot do it. After absorption, the Anomaly will form a resonant connection with the space, and if left unattended, it will transform into an Anomaly Realm."</p><p></p><p>Another new discovery.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that spatial realms and Anomalies are so compatible.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether it's the result of the operation of the laws of Heaven and Earth, or a form of protection.</p><p></p><p>"A coincidental protection?"</p><p></p><p>It seems he understands now. Anomalies may appear evil, but to Heaven and Earth, they are children, very important children.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were once fragments.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the operation of various realms has become the best protective umbrella and auxiliary means for Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Even if the spatial realms are later shattered, they can become the Anomaly's own domain, still a way to achieve the protection and assistance of Anomalies.</p><p></p><p>"It feels like I'm the Anomaly in this world."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang thought, feeling a bit gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, the experiment has proven that I can't absorb a revived Anomaly... Not only can't I do it, but even if I could, it would be equivalent to strengthening the Anomaly, giving it a spatial realm as a protective shell. This point needs to be emphasized."</p><p></p><p>After putting away the Placenta Anomaly, Xuanhuang's experiment this time was successfully completed.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the others.</p><p></p><p>A handsome young man in the Void Knife was rapidly consuming and absorbing Anomaly Blood, in a state of rapid advancement.</p><p></p><p>The White Bone Pagoda had already devoured a section of white bone, reaching the late first stage, and was undergoing the final sedimentation.</p><p></p><p>The other three were foolishly circling the Spirit-Sealing Stele.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't bother with them and disappeared into the small world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Qing Hei Yu Zhou, Zhi Shou Wei Xin, and Tian Di Xuan Huang 01031 for your donations. These names are all quite majestic.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Nanshi Martial Arts Hall, Jin Ning reported the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Xuanhuang said he still needs a week."</p><p></p><p>The bearded Master Wu frowned in thought and said, "Did you really feel the pressure of a Spirit Master on him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." Jin Ning replied, "Unlike the cold sense of crisis from a Spirit Master, Xuanhuang also has a kind of submissive feeling, and there is a sense of purity when standing beside him."</p><p></p><p>"The Nearpath? Impossible."</p><p></p><p>Wu recalled the feeling he had when he saw an old man at the headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"I see, is there anything else?" Wu asked.</p><p></p><p>He planned to take the time to go and see for himself, how did it become a mystery after just over ten days?</p><p></p><p>"...No, that's all, Master."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning struggled a bit, not saying the visualization diagram bestowed by Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go back to your work first. I'll go with you to take a look the day after tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning heard this and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he and the Master will go and take a look. These past few days, every time he saw Xuanhuang, he felt confused.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to say anything reckless. Now that the Master and he are going to see it with their own eyes, it couldn't be better.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, however...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang has slowed down the pace for now.</p><p></p><p>The only goal now is to transcend the will.</p><p></p><p>He's not in a hurry about anything else, he needs patience, he needs to be unhurried.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he is holding a large piece of scale that was peeled off from the centipede demon, continuously releasing the void blade's dissolving ability.</p><p></p><p>Until the centipede demon's scales are dissolved into a liquid, and then swallowed by the void blade, in order to enhance the quality of the void blade.</p><p></p><p>The void blade is the only one that Xuanhuang has forged from a physical object.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Guihu Great Grindstone, Tongtian Building Wood, and the Heaven and Earth Smelter, those three do not need to add materials to enhance themselves before they give birth to their true meaning.</p><p></p><p>During the period when they condense their true meaning, they will continuously absorb the natural forces of heaven and earth due to the constant formation of their true meaning.</p><p></p><p>They are non-man-made objects, they are the products of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The material condensed by this natural force is the most suitable for their true realization.</p><p></p><p>To put it in an analogy, it's like those ancient spiritual treasures, they self-gestate.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't mean that they don't need any materials at all.</p><p></p><p>If there are suitable ones, it can accelerate the gestation, but if there aren't any, it's just a bit slower for the self-gestation.</p><p></p><p>The void blade is different, it was bestowed with meaning by Xuanhuang's small world, the physical object came first, and then the true meaning was gradually born through the quality.</p><p></p><p>The better the material, the faster the progress.</p><p></p><p>And without material, the progress will stop.</p><p></p><p>So whenever there is good material, Xuanhuang will let it be devoured and enhance himself.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the best material is the Anomalous. The centipede is not Anomalous, but it is still extraordinary, a very good material.</p><p></p><p>Unless Xuanhuang is willing to let the Anomalous Dream Brush be devoured by the void blade.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh--"</p><p></p><p>After a day's effort by Xuanhuang, along with the support of the small world, the centipede scales were finally dissolved into a liquid state.</p><p></p><p>Removing the impurities, the essence was absorbed by the void blade.</p><p></p><p>On the originally bumpy blade surface, a layer of flowing light was moving, constantly replenishing the essence of the void blade.</p><p></p><p>Until it was completely absorbed.</p><p></p><p>Examining the void blade, the most intuitive feeling was that it had become heavier, and its hardness had also increased.</p><p></p><p>"It would be best to encounter an Anomalous blade, let the void blade devour and absorb it."</p><p></p><p>"But this kind of opportunity requires fate."</p><p></p><p>"Clang clang clang--"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang struck the void blade, "You'd better bless yourself, be lucky enough to encounter some suitable Anomalous, otherwise you'll be far behind your three companions!"</p><p></p><p>Putting away the long sword, Xuanhuang simply had a light dinner.</p><p></p><p>The moon hung high, all things were silent, only the howling north wind swept through the mountains and forests.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, the call of an unknown animal could be heard.</p><p></p><p>If there were no Anomalous, this would be a beautiful world.</p><p></p><p>This world and the previous Earth are not much different, Xuanhuang would adapt very well.</p><p></p><p>Without Anomalous, his parents would still be here, he would have a small courtyard worth a few million, and a few million in savings.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang could completely be a happy young man: not humble, not hurried, perhaps this is how life should be.</p><p></p><p>Away from the internal struggle, seeking the true self, settling the heart, being a gentleman as the ancients said.</p><p></p><p>Find his other half, support each other and share the fate, work hard to turn love into the 'affection' forged by the two.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Alas!</p><p></p><p>Hurriedly, hastily, life turns out to be like this?</p><p></p><p>Damn it!...</p><p></p><p>Back on the bed in the safe house, Xuanhuang sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness space, the centipede demon, which had been divided into three parts, was in it.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's goal today is to raise his will to the ninth layer limit.</p><p></p><p>Grind that transcendent barrier to a point where it's just about to break through, then stay calm and patiently wait for the breakthrough tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the first time in this world, although the simulation is perfectly executed, but as a pioneer, and the conditions are sufficient, it's still better to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>It's just a difference of one day.</p><p></p><p>Using one part of the three parts of the centipede demon, with sufficient vital essence, in his repeated grinding...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The refinement was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>There was even a surplus, and in a flash of the mysterious yellow light, it was pressed into the flesh and blood under the limit of will.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" "Eleven thousand kilograms of tremendous force?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang found that his physical body had actually reached eleven thousand kilograms of tremendous force.</p><p></p><p>Man's calculation is not as good as heaven's calculation. He thought that a physical body with ten thousand kilograms of tremendous force was the limit of the mundane, but it was unexpectedly broken through the mysterious light.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the breakthrough of the limit?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, the self has its limits, the secrets of heaven and earth, and how far a person can go is still not entirely up to them."</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang was not depressed by exceeding his own prediction.</p><p></p><p>He hopes that this kind of good unpredictability will come more.</p><p></p><p>Innate conditions like him, superhuman spirit, small world, etc. can be relied on as support, but cannot be completely dependent on.</p><p></p><p>As an aspiring creator, he cannot have a closed mindset.</p><p></p><p>He cannot have a narrow sense of self-satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He needs to open his heart, accept all kinds of surprises, and then step on the surprises and crises to achieve greater heights.</p><p></p><p>Now the unexpected breakthrough of the limit is good, the earlier the better.</p><p></p><p>Break through his own "arrogant" cognition, and turn it into firewood to forge his stronger will.</p><p></p><p>"It can still progress, reaching twelve thousand tremendous force."</p><p></p><p>"With such a tremendous force of flesh and blood as the source, when I open up the sea of qi and the gushing spring, I will be even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Gathering his mind, it was already dawn.</p><p></p><p>The energetic Xuanhuang walked out of the safe house.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he received a call from his cousin, saying that he had completely recovered recently, and that he really didn't have any strange dreams after Xuanhuang took away the love letter that day.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't reveal it, just saying that it's good.</p><p></p><p>His cousin gratefully asked: When will you come down the mountain to have dinner at home, Aunt has asked many times.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, soon, soon.</p><p></p><p>At nine o'clock...</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning also told him: If there is no crucial matter, please come down the mountain as soon as possible, Deputy Director Wu Gang will come here to inquire in person tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said it was fine, thinking: When he comes here tomorrow, you will be more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to exchange the imaginative diagrams with spiritual rhyme with Jin Ning, Jin Ning sent Xuanhuang ten bottles of the Great Returning Elixir.</p><p></p><p>He said it was to thank Xuanhuang for the imaginative diagram he gave.</p><p></p><p>He has nothing else to help Xuanhuang with, and can only exchange his points and savings for the Great Returning Elixir as a repayment.</p><p></p><p>Although it is not precious, it is the best he can offer at the moment.</p><p></p><p>A while ago, Xuanhuang asked him to bring the Great Returning Elixir, and he thought this thing was what Xuanhuang needed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang didn't refuse, refusing would discourage him, so it's fine to take it.</p><p></p><p>Jin Ning was very happy, and then left.</p><p></p><p>A new day begins.</p><p></p><p>During the day, Xuanhuang continued to use the centipede demon scale armor to improve the quality of the Void Knife.</p><p></p><p>A busy day passed.</p><p></p><p>At night, he emptied his mind and became as calm as water.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness space, everything was ready.</p><p></p><p>The remaining centipede demon flesh and blood began to be decomposed, dissolved, and forged...</p><p></p><p>Until the refined blood qi was left as firewood and thrown into the furnace.</p><p></p><p>"The breakthrough to the extraordinary will be today."</p><p></p><p>A will with vitality gathered and began to be forged by the raging furnace.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient firewood, Xuanhuang gritted his teeth and persisted.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time.</p><p></p><p>Like the sound of the creation of the universe.</p><p></p><p>The formless and intangible will finally broke out of the cocoon.</p><p></p><p>Gathering into a cloud-like mist, following Xuanhuang's guidance, it penetrated the mist and entered the lower dantian.</p><p></p><p>The will took shape, and Xuanhuang could introspect his own body.</p><p></p><p>"Open!"</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>In the dark and obscure dantian sea of qi, as if struck by a lightning bolt, the formless space broke with a rumbling sound.</p><p></p><p>In the perception of consciousness, a vast and boundless world appeared.</p><p></p><p>This is the dantian sea of qi that Xuanhuang has opened up.</p><p></p><p>All people have it, can perceive it, and can use it, but it requires cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the vast dantian, a cloud of mist appeared, though small, but with nameless power.</p><p></p><p>Although the entire sea of qi is vast and boundless, it is controlled by the misty will.</p><p></p><p>Representing that the will is the master of this realm.</p><p></p><p>It is the beginning of my will representing the will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>Without the will as the master, this realm, under the distortion of the heavenly will, once the qi and blood in the sea of qi reaches a certain level, that is, the limit of the extraordinary, it will riot and distort.</p><p></p><p>The sea of qi is also the existence of the laws of the operation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the normal world, although the dantian sea of qi can be opened up and used by cultivators,</p><p></p><p>The essential framework and foundation is the law of the operation of the heavenly will.</p><p></p><p>However, the foundation of Xuanhuang's dantian is his own will.</p><p></p><p>This way it will not be distorted, because it can be separated from the framework of the heavenly will.</p><p></p><p>The simplest analogy: the code system belongs to someone else, now they want to decouple, and they don't let you use it anymore.</p><p></p><p>You can only build it yourself, even if it's very simple, but it's under your control, and you don't have to worry about being decoupled.</p><p></p><p>...

        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time passed in a flash, three days had gone by.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Xuanhuang finally refined the complete Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>With the control of his will, the final three-zhang Heavenly Pillar completely merged with the previous six-zhang ones.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang felt the sea of qi shaking.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the sealed sea of qi had opened a gap, and the place that connected was the entire heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This kind of connection had certain risks.</p><p></p><p>If not carefully controlled, the connection of the power of heaven and earth would destroy the sea of qi, and if the sea of qi collapsed, even if the cultivator could survive, they would be almost ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Stabilize!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p></p><p>His will transformed into the will of heaven, firmly guarding the trembling sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>About three minutes later, it was as if the two magnetic fields had finally collided and synchronized.</p><p></p><p>The great magnetic field of heaven and earth and the small magnetic field of the sea of qi finally resonated and synchronized.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Dao of Heaven has a surplus and a deficiency, and the power of heaven and earth found that they had such a weak little brother.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the protective love surged, the strong power of heaven and earth, accompanied by the distortion of the will of heaven, the incompleteness of the Dao and Fa, and other existences, surged through the medium of the Heavenly Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, only one Heavenly Pillar served as the medium, so the power of heaven and earth drawn was not much.</p><p></p><p>If it were the complete three Heavenly Pillars, Xuanhuang's current will would not be able to support it.</p><p></p><p>One Heavenly Pillar connecting the power of heaven and earth is like opening a small mountain path, two is a wide cement road, and three is directly a high-speed expressway.</p><p></p><p>This needs to be done step by step.</p><p></p><p>But the thick love of the power of heaven and earth, Xuanhuang still felt uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the importance of the Heavenly Gate on the furnace became crucial.</p><p></p><p>After entering a certain amount of the power of heaven and earth, Xuanhuang gritted his teeth and controlled it.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, he closed the portal connecting heaven and earth, finally stopping the protective love of the great elder of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Inside the furnace, the great elder of heaven and earth sent everything, not only the power of heaven and earth, but also the distorted rules and so on also entered.</p><p></p><p>However, these were all what Xuanhuang needed.</p><p></p><p>To temper the will of the first stage of Xuanbian, he needed these as kindling.</p><p></p><p>"Refine!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang did not hesitate, and his will transformed into a rainbow that was invested into the furnace.</p><p></p><p>The power of blood and qi began to gush from the Bubbling Spring, turning into golden burning flames.</p><p></p><p>"Roaring!"</p><p></p><p>The great fire burned, forging Xuanhuang's will, the distorted spiritual mechanism rules in the furnace as the hammer, his divine soul wielding the hammer.</p><p></p><p>Bit by bit, forging Xuanhuang's will.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after three hours.</p><p></p><p>The tempering brought by the first time of drawing the power of heaven and earth was completed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang clearly felt that his will had grown again.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since it had grown, and the cultivation time of the first stage of Xuanbian was much slower than before.</p><p></p><p>Just refining the Heavenly Gate for seven days and the Heavenly Pillar for seven days, half a month had already passed.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang divided the first stage of Xuanbian into twelve layers, and each Heavenly Pillar represented one layer.</p><p></p><p>One layer after another, it required the will of two layers to draw the power of heaven and earth brought by two Heavenly Pillars, otherwise it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>This time was the first tempering, and Xuanhuang found that after such tempering ten times, he could step into the second layer of Xuanbian.</p><p></p><p>"If the blood and qi are sufficient, even if it's once a day, it would still take ten days, and the twelve layers would take at least half a year, after all, there's no guarantee it won't slow down later, or there might be something to delay it."</p><p></p><p>"Adding the engraving of the Heavenly Gate and the refining of the Heavenly Pillar, it would take nearly a year to advance to the second stage of Tong Xuan."</p><p></p><p>A year is actually not long, and even very short.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the first stage of Xuanbian, for Xuanhuang with a lifespan of 300 years of the five great cycles, it is very, very short.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the extraordinary Xuanbian, he sensed that his lifespan had reached 300 years.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't mention it before was that it was not representative.</p><p></p><p>Because currently, he is the only one, and he doesn't know if it will be the same for other cultivators who enter the first stage of Xuanbian.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the Martial Pavilion, the cultivators in the previous small world who cultivated the Qi Refining stage had a lifespan of 200 years.</p><p></p><p>And the martial artists in the small martial world realm, their extraordinary realm was between 120-180 years, in general, it was difficult to exceed 200 years.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's 300-year lifespan was definitely not the norm, it was a manifestation of his refined essence, qi, and spirit, and his breakthrough of the 12,000 jin giant force limit.</p><p></p><p>A year is really very short.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xuanhuang opens the path and completes it, and other cultivators follow his cultivation, those who can advance from the first stage of Xuanbian to the second stage of Tong Xuan within a year would be top-tier geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The difficulty is not the same for the two.</p><p></p><p>To use an analogy, Xuanhuang himself encountered mountains and opened them, encountered water and built bridges to reach the mountain top, while others simply followed Xuanhuang's path to reach the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>An even more vivid example would be that Xuanhuang created the instruction set and wrote the system, finally getting online, while others just opened their computers and downloaded the system software to get online directly.</p><p></p><p>"A year!"</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>Steady and unhurried.</p><p></p><p>Feeling it again, as the first celestial pillar coalesced, the power of heaven and earth impacted the dantian, causing it to expand to thirty zhang.</p><p></p><p>But he had just refined his will, consuming most of his golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>"This thirty zhang of vital energy, without any substitute, would take me two days to slowly accumulate on my own."</p><p></p><p>"After the celestial pillar coalesced, by borrowing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the change is much greater than before when I could only rely on consuming great elixirs and refining the essence of fierce beasts."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's Four Extremes Twelve Celestial Pillar Furnace Technique is a dual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But it's not just about tempering the will.</p><p></p><p>It can also absorb spiritual energy for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Before transcending the mundane, Xuanhuang could only rely on consuming and refining the essence.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he absorbed spiritual energy too early, before his will was fully formed, the potentially toxic spiritual energy could harm him.</p><p></p><p>So he had his body absorb and filter it, without actively absorbing it himself.</p><p></p><p>But now he can, especially after the celestial pillar coalesced.</p><p></p><p>He can directly absorb from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Other cultivators absorb spiritual energy through breathing exercises to transport it.</p><p></p><p>His Four Extremes Twelve Celestial Pillar Technique directly opens the spiritual energy gates of heaven and earth, letting it flow in.</p><p></p><p>As long as one can endure it, not fearing the potentially toxic spiritual energy mutating them.</p><p></p><p>The inflowing spiritual energy first enters the furnace, with the distorted spiritual essence left behind as a hammer, while the pure essence directly enters the dantian to become nourishment for the golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>The golden vital energy devours this spiritual energy, achieving enhancement.</p><p></p><p>It's that simple and direct.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xuanhuang constantly opens and closes the celestial gates, leaving behind the distorted laws of the Heavenly Dao as a hammer, while the pure spiritual energy enters the dantian to be absorbed and enhanced by the golden vital energy.</p><p></p><p>On the other side...</p><p></p><p>While Xuanhuang was cultivating freely, the Exorcism Department had descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"It's been three days, and there's still no news from Deputy Director Jia?"</p><p></p><p>The one asking was Deputy Director Dong Xingbao, whom Jia Zhengyi had called a "fence-sitter".</p><p></p><p>"No, we've contacted Jia Deputy Director's family, and they don't know either. At one of Jia Director's villas, we found traces of a struggle and the place had been completely looted of treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Dong Xingbao frowned: "Are you saying Jia Deputy Director was killed?"</p><p></p><p>"Director Dong, we can't rule out that possibility."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Jia Deputy Director is a top-tier spirit master at the first level, who could have killed him without him even sending out a distress call?" Dong Xingbao expressed disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He himself wasn't as strong as someone with the surname Jia.</p><p></p><p>If those with the surname Jia could be killed silently, wouldn't he be in even greater danger?</p><p></p><p>"Has Jia Director recently had any enemies seeking revenge?" Dong Xingbao couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>If there was a powerful expert capable of killing Jia Zhengyi, he should keep a low profile recently.</p><p></p><p>The investigation team thought for a moment, but it didn't seem like Jia Director had any enemies.</p><p></p><p>Jia Zhengyi was a very steady person, except for some behaviors that made people disgusted, otherwise he had no issues, and was known for treating his subordinate spirit masters well.</p><p></p><p>"Director Dong, it seems Jia Director hasn't recently offended anyone... Except for that matter, you must be aware of it."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao paused, "You mean that person called Xuanhuang from the martial arts school?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's him. Previously, Jia Director had suppressed Xuanhuang's deeds, and even had Xuanhuang go resolve the ominous corpse tree. Surprisingly, this person easily resolved it, you see..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this?" Dong Xingbao was a bit startled.</p><p></p><p>Often the most unlikely thing is the most likely, this was a valuable experience he had gained from being a fence-sitter for many years.</p><p></p><p>"Since such a person has appeared in South City, it's a great, a tremendous good thing for us humans. We don't need to suppress it anymore, we need to give the currently struggling humans some good news."</p><p></p><p>Dong Xingbao stood up and said, "Okay, you all go take care of it. As for Jia Director's disappearance, keep searching, and even if you can't find him, you need to give an account to Director Xu and Jia Director's family."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all may leave."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Among the investigation team, someone was very confused.</p><p></p><p>Why did Director Dong suddenly change? What did this mean? Does he still care about Jia Director's disappearance?...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

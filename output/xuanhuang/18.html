        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were no more than a hundred people in this place.</p><p></p><p>After the Xuanhuang had coalesced and formed the Guihu Great Grindstone, they paid no more attention to it and followed the black-robed emissary.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, it seemed that at least a third of the villagers had died when the dark qi was sucked out of their heads.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang gazed at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The villagers were very anxious, each of them lowering their heads, not daring to look directly.</p><p></p><p>"The benefactor need not worry, the centipede demon was awakened during the day and has no consciousness, it will only struggle frantically, and it will exhaust its spiritual essence and die within an incense stick's time."</p><p></p><p>The elder who had regained his senses said to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me what you know."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"This old man will not withhold anything, please ask the benefactor."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang said, "First tell me about the blood moon in the sky and that demonic creature."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The elder did not hesitate and hurriedly said, "Thirteen years ago, when the blood moon appeared in the sky, the martial artists and immortal masters disappeared, leaving only some superficial techniques... The blood moon can cause wild beasts to become demonized, and when they are demonized to a certain extent, they can be comparable to the martial dao masters and immortal masters of the past..."</p><p></p><p>"But the demonized creatures that have become a climate can only be active at night, and only under the blood moon can they maintain their consciousness. Some of the great demons are no less intelligent than us... If they are awakened during the day, they will lose control and become mindless monsters, and if it lasts too long, their spiritual essence will be exhausted and they will die..."</p><p></p><p>"The demonized creatures with intelligence will control some renegades and collect blood, flesh, and spiritual essence for them... That black-robed emissary is one of them... The demons will bestow some abilities upon them, and such people are no longer of the same kind, they are butchers stained with the fresh blood of their own kind..."</p><p></p><p>As the elder described, Xuanhuang had a general understanding of the situation in this world.</p><p></p><p>First of all, this world is not small.</p><p></p><p>According to the elder's introduction, it is not much smaller than the Summer Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This world also had martial dao and immortal dao before, but the same situation, all twisted due to the mysterious invasion.</p><p></p><p>However, the elder did not mention the mysterious incident.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the blood moon demons, have you also heard of the mysterious incident?"</p><p></p><p>"Mysterious?" The elder was taken aback, "Does the benefactor mean the rumors of wandering ghosts? There were wandering ghosts before, but they could not become a climate, and they would be suppressed by the immortal masters when they appeared."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang shook his head, it was not this kind of wandering ghost.</p><p></p><p>He did not explain, but asked, "What about these wandering ghosts you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>The elder thought for a moment and said, "It's strange, these wandering ghosts have disappeared since the blood moon appeared in the sky. I once heard a rumor that the blood moon had devoured all the wandering ghosts, I don't know if it's true or not."</p><p></p><p>"And the black-robed emissary had also raved crazily: the ghosts, gods, immortals, and martial arts have all died, and the moon god beast king will rise. This person is extremely insane, I don't know if he is just talking nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"Where did the black-robed one come from?"</p><p></p><p>"This person came here half a year ago, since his arrival, our Li Family Village has been controlled by the centipede demons. Normally it's fine, but whenever it involves worshiping, the Centipede King, etc., they will be controlled in their spiritual essence, like walking corpses. Every half a month they have to sacrifice their clansmen, and if anyone breaks free of the control, they will be left with hidden techniques to suck them dry and devour them."</p><p></p><p>The elder gritted his teeth and recounted the evils of the black-robed one.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding villagers could not help but shed tears.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had a general understanding.</p><p></p><p>This world has no mysterious incidents, but the blood moon is the greatest mystery.</p><p></p><p>It is even a great mystery that controls an entire world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble——"</p><p></p><p>"Splash——"</p><p></p><p>The ground shook violently, and the terrified villagers bit their lips, not daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be what the elder said.</p><p></p><p>The demons awakened during the day could not resist the twisted will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>The reason they could be rational at night should be because of the blood moon as a support.</p><p></p><p>Just as he himself could serve as a foundation for others to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The violent shaking lasted about the time of an incense stick.</p><p></p><p>Outside, it was finally calm and quiet, and the spiritual essence of the centipede demons was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"You all wait here, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang left a sentence and walked out, not caring about the elder's cautious gaze.</p><p></p><p>Pushing open the stone slab, the sight that met his eyes was a scene of devastation.</p><p></p><p>The houses near the square were all destroyed by the centipede demons.</p><p></p><p>And the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The large centipede demon had already become a cold, lifeless corpse.</p><p></p><p>Its dark scales and sharp edges made it look unsettling, even in death.</p><p></p><p>After examining it and confirming its demise, Xuanhuang was surprised to find such valuable kindling. He had never encountered anything like this before.</p><p></p><p>He was lucky that although he couldn't defeat the centipede demon, the black-robed emissary had ended up destroying it as well.</p><p></p><p>That black-robed emissary was no ordinary person - a normal person couldn't have done something like that. It was completely irrational and insane, without any reason.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that when the centipede demon had altered the emissary's body, it had also affected his mind.</p><p></p><p>The centipede demon was long, but not too heavy in weight. Xuanhuang stored it in his spiritual space.</p><p></p><p>In his spiritual space, the Guiyu Great Millstone once again had a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>The nearly hundred villagers who had been controlled by the centipede demon had all had the soul worms in their heads refined by it.</p><p></p><p>Anything involving extraordinary existences is never simple. </p><p></p><p>Although the soul worms left behind by the centipede demon were small, their spiritual quality was higher than that of a normal wild beast.</p><p></p><p>Accumulated together, they were almost comparable to the gift from the Divinatory Brush.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, when the villagers were called out, the centipede demon's corpse had already disappeared without a trace. They were all smart enough not to say anything about it, and the elder even kept calling Xuanhuang "Benefactor."</p><p></p><p>"What will you all do from now on?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>"The centipede demon is dead, will other demonic creatures come again?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Li Bokang, the village chief of Li Family Village, hesitated before speaking: "I don't know where our Benefactor is staying, it seems that..."</p><p></p><p>He trailed off, unsure of how to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Just answer my question first," Xuanhuang pressed.</p><p></p><p>Li Bokang snapped to attention and quickly replied: "Rest assured, Benefactor. Although my human clan is weak, and demonic creatures are fierce, the ones that have become a fixture are not everywhere. This is the first time in over a decade that Li Family Village has encountered one, and we have been redeemed by the Benefactor..."</p><p></p><p>The rest was just flowery praise, which Xuanhuang chose to ignore.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that with a bit of luck, they wouldn't encounter any demonic creatures for the time being, Xuanhuang felt relieved. After all, he had 'indirectly' killed a third of the villagers.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to be able to read, yes?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Bokang nodded: "This old fool was once a scholar, but never achieved anything. I can still read, though."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang nodded: "Good, then take a look at these two books. I'll come back here in a month at the latest."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two brand new books appeared: "Analysis of the Myriad Realms" and "Analysis of the Fusion of the Myriad Realms." </p><p></p><p>These were books summarized by the Blue Star to help communicate with the humans of this small world and give them a basic understanding of the concept of the Myriad Realms.</p><p></p><p>Although this world was dangerous, it was a good place, and Xuanhuang naturally wouldn't abandon it. Once he entered the realm of the extraordinary, the demonic creatures of this world would all become his kindling.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang looked up at the sky, unable to see the blood moon during the day. But he was very interested in that blood moon. For now, he couldn't do anything about it, and even needed to avoid it, but everyone had to have dreams, right? What if he could actually achieve it someday?</p><p></p><p>"...Benefactor, this?" Li Bokang nervously accepted the two unfamiliar books, thoroughly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Both the books and the suddenly appearing Xuanhuang were completely different from anything he was familiar with. "Analysis of the Myriad Realms" and "Analysis of the Fusion of the Myriad Realms" - these sounded nothing like ordinary things.</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask too many questions, just read the books. You'll understand once you've finished them. I'll come back later," Xuanhuang said, stepping towards the edge of the village.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, are you leaving?" Li Bokang asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"May I ask the Benefactor's honorable name?"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanhuang!"</p><p></p><p>"...The dragon battles in the wild, its blood Xuanhuang?"</p><p></p><p>Li Bokang watched the retreating figure of Xuanhuang, holding the books in his hands.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is a yellow space spanning ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Ten meters away is a dense fog, as thick as ink, and nothing inside can be seen.</p><p></p><p>The stubborn sunlight shines from somewhere, penetrating the dense fog, illuminating the ten-meter space.</p><p></p><p>It is just like the eve of dawn.</p><p></p><p>"Let's analyze the general layers of the grinding mill."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Xuanhuang sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a white light flashed at the center of his brow, with a hint of golden light at its core.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the white light covered the entire ten-meter yellow space.</p><p></p><p>As a transmigrator, Xuanhuang has a golden finger, and this space is his golden finger.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, when he transmigrated here, he was originally covered by the black qi of the grinding mill, and the previous host had already been drained of his soul and was about to be devoured.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment when Xuanhuang transmigrated into this body, he struggled desperately and mysteriously arrived in this space.</p><p></p><p>When he woke up, he felt a splitting headache.</p><p></p><p>It's hard to describe the feeling.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, not only did he escape the crisis, but he also fortunately bound himself to this space.</p><p></p><p>As of now, after three days of exploration, Xuanhuang has a general understanding of the reason.</p><p></p><p>Due to the transmigration, perhaps when passing through the endless chaos, his soul did not disintegrate, but instead gained an indestructible resilience.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in this world, the mysterious grinding mill was also a key factor. This grinding mill must be extraordinary, and this space is the internal space of the grinding mill.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang suspects that all the creatures devoured and annihilated by the grinding mill have become that dense black qi.</p><p></p><p>But his divine soul has mutated, and not only has it not been annihilated, but it has also opened up a ten-meter space.</p><p></p><p>Within this ten-meter space, he is the master of this ten-meter space, possessing the ability to control everything.</p><p></p><p>It's like having a personal space.</p><p></p><p>Not only can he enter this place at any time around the grinding mill, but even in distant places, as long as he wills it, he can enter this place without obstruction.</p><p></p><p>It's quite unbelievable...</p><p></p><p>Originally the internal space of the grinding mill, but due to the tempering of the chaotic sea during the transmigration, a trace of immortal nature was born, and it has become his greatest support.</p><p></p><p>Through several days of experiments, Xuanhuang discovered that this strange thing is indeed an evolution of rules.</p><p></p><p>This world is experiencing the fusion of myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>The colliding and shattering rules and Tao of various worlds, when fused with the desires of all beings, have given birth to various anomalies.</p><p></p><p>And due to the amplification of fear, various malicious desires have proliferated, creating all kinds of anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why one cannot transcend the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this fusion, the rules are not fully intact, so even if there is spiritual energy, it is useless, as the rules are twisting and colliding, how can they be utilized?</p><p></p><p>No matter what kind of cultivation, the essence is to emulate heaven and earth, but heaven and earth are colliding and shattering, so one cannot look directly at them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The white light flashed, and the cross-legged Xuanhuang trembled all over, as if undergoing a grueling test. The white light covering the ten-meter space emanated a rhythmic beauty.</p><p></p><p>After a while...</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>"According to my assessment, this grinding mill is at least at the second level."</p><p></p><p>"And this is not even counting the size of this unknown space?"</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it this way, the grinding mill is at the second level, and with this space and the external manifestation of the grinding mill, it is at least at the fourth level."</p><p></p><p>After the unbelievable transmigration and the mutation of his divine soul, Xuanhuang has gained an innate ability to understand.</p><p></p><p>It is also a gift from the Tao of high-level beings after the essence of his divine soul has been elevated.</p><p></p><p>The specific reasons are still unclear to him, as his level is too low, and he needs to reach a certain stage before he can understand it.</p><p></p><p>But he can use it, so he'll take it slow.</p><p></p><p>According to Xuanhuang's classification, the transcendent is at the first level, and the so-called martial artists and immortal cultivators have not even reached the level, even if they can defeat hundreds of people.</p><p></p><p>This is a qualitative change, and mere accumulation cannot change it.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang calls the way he fuses with the ten-meter space "transcending the self."</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the divine soul and the ten-meter space may seem like a small thing, but the quality has already changed. Strictly speaking, it is a kind of transcendent power.</p><p></p><p>"However, even though my divine soul has undergone a metamorphosis, my body and will are still very weak, so I can only open up a ten-meter space. If my body and will were stronger, the space I could control would be even larger."</p><p></p><p>"Based on my judgment, if I had a first-level transcendent body and will, I should be able to control a space of one thousand meters."</p><p></p><p>"Considering the physical fitness of my previous body, controlling a ten-meter space is already not bad."</p><p></p><p>The previous body was not at the very bottom level either. After a few years of martial arts training, it had reached the level of being able to defeat ten opponents.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this "ten opponents" is based on the standard before the human body evolved. Now, humans have evolved a bit, so it's not quite half as much, and current martial artists can probably defeat seven or eight opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, neither martial arts nor immortal cultivation is suitable, as they cannot fundamentally solve the problem of losing control of the transcendent. I need to find a way that doesn't lose control."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang doesn't attach much importance to the paths of martial artists and immortal cultivators, as they cannot solve the fundamental problem.</p><p></p><p>"A person is the integration of the metaphysical and the physical, the body belongs to the physical, while the soul, mind, divine soul, and thoughts, including the spirit and vitality, belong to the metaphysical, so the will is the ruler."</p><p></p><p>"The will is the key to controlling the physical and the metaphysical, the body and the soul."</p><p></p><p>If we compare a person to a computer, the body's "essence" is the hardware, the "spirit" is the software, and the "qi" is the electrical energy.</p><p></p><p>And the will is the highest instruction set.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, whether they are martial artists or immortal cultivators, it is because their will is not fully formed, and they cannot integrate the body's essence, qi, and spirit, leading to a loss of control."</p><p></p><p>In a normal world, the Tao and the rules of the world operate in a complete manner.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, the Tao and rules of the myriad realms are not complete, and are even in a state of distortion.</p><p></p><p>So true transcendence cannot be born.</p><p></p><p>After all, people and all things and phenomena are the result of the operation of the Tao and rules.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fundamental basis of humans is the operation and generation of the Dao and laws. How could one possibly transcend this?</p><p></p><p>"The will is supreme, one's own will consolidating all the energies within one's body, the microcosm replacing the currently deficient macrocosm."</p><p></p><p>This is the solution Xuanhuang has come up with so far.</p><p></p><p>"However... it is also very difficult."</p><p></p><p>Although the will is the consolidation of vital essence, spirit, and consciousness, it cannot be separated from these hardware, software, and power sources.</p><p></p><p>"One can only cultivate the will first, but the will cannot be too strong and uncontrolled, the two must progress step-by-step."</p><p></p><p>This is Xuanhuang's current situation.</p><p></p><p>The 'essence' represented by the physical body is not functioning well, but the 'spirit' representing the spiritual soul is incredibly powerful. Fortunately, with the fusion with space and a touch of immortal qualities, it can barely sustain this.</p><p></p><p>If there was no such spatial containment for the spiritual soul, Xuanhuang might have lost control.</p><p></p><p>Therefore...</p><p></p><p>He currently appears very powerful, but unfortunately, he cannot bring it out.</p><p></p><p>And the body capable of going out cannot bear the powerful spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>The vital essence, spirit, and consciousness of a person must be coordinated, it is impossible for the body to be formidable while the vital energy and spirit are not. </p><p></p><p>Conversely, if the spirit and vital energy are formidable, the body cannot be weak.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivation realms can have formidable spirit or vital energy while the body is slightly lacking, they even have methods like the 'soul-leaving corpse immortal'.</p><p></p><p>But those are all adapted to the complete heaven and earth and Dao, not suitable for the current distorted Dao.</p><p></p><p>If a 'soul-leaving corpse immortal' appears here, one need not think much, it will certainly become a bizarre vessel, and may even be a source of contamination.</p><p></p><p>"So, the will, the will."</p><p></p><p>This thing called the will is very difficult to describe, and it is hard to determine how strong it is. (Note: The author's mention of the will is a setting in this text, the consolidated body of vital essence, spirit, and consciousness)</p><p></p><p>But now, based on Xuanhuang's spirit merging with space, this similar 'super-ego' state, he has made a division.</p><p></p><p>"First, the will of the first stage must transform the formless into the formed, this kind of will can control the body to be extraordinary without losing control."</p><p></p><p>"The first stage should be a gaseous state, the second stage should be a liquid state, the third stage should be a solid state, and the fourth stage should refer to the white spiritual nature of my spiritual soul, this spiritual nature is similar to the primal spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Going further to the fifth stage is currently futile to think about, and I cannot even comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the paths, based on the 'super-ego' state, there are currently three methods: the 'Furnace Method', the 'Heaven and Earth Method', and the 'Return to Void Method'."</p><p></p><p>The 'Furnace Method' is the simplest and safest way, which Xuanhuang has derived from the martial arts of this world.</p><p></p><p>The difference is that while practicing martial arts, the spiritual soul will also depict the 'Furnace Visualization Diagram'.</p><p></p><p>Integrating the martial arts into the 'Furnace Method', not only pounding the body, but also using the spirit as the furnace and the vital energy as the fuel.</p><p></p><p>With the body becoming powerful, the vital energy and spiritual soul will also grow stronger simultaneously, and this will forge an even stronger will to consolidate them.</p><p></p><p>This stage still focuses on tempering the body, because only when the body is formidable will the vital energy be abundant, and only when the vital energy is abundant will the spiritual soul be powerful.</p><p></p><p>A layer-by-layer feedback.</p><p></p><p>"The second method is the 'Return to Void Method', which is a bit dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The so-called 'Return to Void Method' is nothing more than an extreme tug-of-war with the bizarre grinding mill.</p><p></p><p>Utilizing the nature of the grinding mill to devour everything, to temper the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual soul will then catalyze the formidable body, and then the body will supplement the vital energy, the vital energy will supplement the spiritual soul, and the body will coordinate to catalyze a powerful will.</p><p></p><p>It is the reverse order.</p><p></p><p>The 'Furnace Method' starts from the essence, while the 'Return to Void Method' starts from the spirit.</p><p></p><p>As for why it's called the 'Return to Void Method' instead of the 'Grinding Mill Method' or the 'Great Grinding Method'? It's purely for the sake of sounding better, and that bizarre grinding mill devouring everything has a bit of the meaning of all things returning to the void.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, it fits.</p><p></p><p>"As for the 'Heaven and Earth Method', it naturally starts with the vital energy."</p><p></p><p>The 'Heaven and Earth Method' begins by cultivating the vital energy, based on his ability to control a ten-meter space, to guide the spiritual energy into the body.</p><p></p><p>Let the powerful vital energy catalyze the spirit, the powerful spirit catalyze the essence, the essence supplement the vital energy, forming a cycle.</p><p></p><p>These are the three methods Xuanhuang has explored in his 'super-ego' state.</p><p></p><p>It's also a coincidence that there are three paths, corresponding to the three aspects of vital essence, spirit, and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, they all lead to the same goal, which is to forge the will.</p><p></p><p>And the three can have different strengths, but they must be at a certain level, if the differences are too great, they will certainly lose control in this distorted world.</p><p></p><p>In a complete world, these problems are not so serious, but in this world, it won't work.</p><p></p><p>"The three can also be practiced simultaneously, with the vital essence, spirit, and consciousness progressing together."</p><p></p><p>His spirit has an outstanding nature, but the quantity is not enough.</p><p></p><p>A touch of special quality is just a special quality, representing a possibility and a high starting point, not something unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what he could control would not be ten meters, but the fourth stage he has deduced.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go with the 'Furnace Method', with the body as the main focus."</p><p></p><p>He has a premonition, Xuanhuang feels...</p><p></p><p>At this time, focusing on the vital energy and spirit is not the best approach.</p><p></p><p>"The vital energy catalyzed by the body should be better than the current absorption of spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>Just like one absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and one self-catalyzing the primal vital energy, they may both work, but in this messed-up world, it's better to self-catalyze the primal vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, if he absorbs the spiritual energy now, it may lead to an uncertain future.</p><p></p><p>Not that he won't use spiritual energy at all, that's impossible!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy is the foundation for all evolution, without the nourishment of spiritual energy, the essence will not undergo transformation. He still needs to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But the result is different, the spiritual energy catalyzes a formidable body, and the tempered body then gives birth to an even higher level of vital energy.</p><p></p><p>This is the key.</p><p></p><p>Extending this logic, the primal vital energy catalyzed by the body will continue to nurture an even higher level of spirit, and the higher spirit will continue to temper the body, this seems to be a more perfect path forward.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the 'Heaven and Earth Method' is not useless, after the body self-catalyzes the primal vital energy and establishes a foundation, then the 'Heaven and Earth Method' can be used to absorb spiritual energy as nourishment."</p><p></p><p>With this, Xuanhuang has made a temporary decision.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

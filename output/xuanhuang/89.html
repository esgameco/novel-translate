        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a newly constructed martial arts hall, over 300 people gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, they were all cultivators at the fourth realm of body refinement or above, with nearly 60 people at the fifth realm.</p><p></p><p>This was an assembly of the top martial artists from various provinces and cities. As time passed, the establishment of the Qingyun Mountain Martial Arts Alliance had brought together almost all the top experts who could come.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it had integrated the top martial artists of the Summer Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>But this was only half of the top experts, as the other half were still clearing the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The establishment of the Martial Arts Alliance was smooth, with Xuanhuang as its support. In the world of martial artists, the strong were respected, so it was naturally easy to establish.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the martial artists who had gone through great hardships to come here were all seeking the Dao, not vying for power and profit.</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to vie for power and profit, they couldn't surpass the top five disciples led by Sun Hui.</p><p></p><p>The ten disciples personally instructed and gathered by Xuanhuang were called the "Ten Disciples of the Sect".</p><p></p><p>Although Xuanhuang didn't acknowledge it, everyone addressed them as such.</p><p></p><p>"Are the storage talismans gone?" Sun Hui asked.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jian replied, "The Steward has sold them all, especially after we received news from the four factions in the wilderness, the storage talismans became indispensable as the roads were blocked."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded silently. It was quite a coincidence that the four factions and the scattered cultivators had just received Xuanhuang's instructions to clear the fierce beasts in the wilderness, but they couldn't bring back the beasts due to their sheer numbers, so the storage talismans became a necessity.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Alliance had bought 3 out of the 9 storage rings, 12 out of the 50 storage belts and waist guards, and 27 out of the 99 storage bags. It could be said that they had the most harvest.</p><p></p><p>But it had also nearly depleted their points.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they still had the Blood Pool Secret Realm as a foundation, otherwise the points from the Trial Tower and the Contemplation Diagram would have been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Long has already fully comprehended the Diagram, he'll go to support Wu Jiang and Jin Ning in a day or two. I heard the battle at Moon Lake is very difficult, the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions have all suffered casualties, and our Martial Arts Alliance has also sacrificed a lot."</p><p></p><p>"Steward, we have suffered heavy losses, but also reaped great harvests. Martial artists need to go to the battlefield, to fight for life and death. Wu Jiang replied that after a few days of tempering, he was confident to fully comprehend the Contemplation Diagram two days ago, but he didn't have the chance to do so on the frontline. Fortunately, Zhao Long has already fully comprehended it, so he can go to the frontline to replace Wu Jiang, and guard the frontline together with Jin Ning, allowing Wu Jiang to come back and comprehend the Contemplation Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Steward, I plan to go to the frontline tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Song Hongliang, the only one among the ten who had not yet fully comprehended the Diagram, said.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the three who had not yet fully comprehended it, but Wu Jiang only needed to come back and comprehend it once to complete it, while he still didn't have the confidence.</p><p></p><p>The Taoist disciple Ma Daochang had fully comprehended it two days ago, and Du Ming had gone to the battlefield. It seemed that with Du Ming's talent and tempering, he would fully comprehend it upon his return.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he was the only one left among the ten.</p><p></p><p>He knew his own situation, and compared to the true geniuses, he was just a little luckier, having the opportunity to receive Xuanhuang's guidance and the chance to comprehend the Contemplation Diagram earlier.</p><p></p><p>Now the gap was already apparent, and he needed to work harder.</p><p></p><p>Every time he heard other cultivators say that the ten of them were Xuanhuang's sect disciples, he felt both happy and anxious. What virtue and ability did he possess?</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui understood Song Hongliang's decision, as he was under a lot of pressure.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say that all ten of them were under a lot of pressure. Those with talent and ability could handle this pressure well, and turn it into motivation.</p><p></p><p>But he was afraid that their talent and ability might not live up to the reputation of being the sect's ten disciples, and they might be crushed by the pressure.</p><p></p><p>The meeting soon dispersed, mainly discussing the rotation of personnel and the distribution of the dwindling points.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was very busy, with time being tight and many things to do. They didn't waste time on unnecessary talk, and quickly resolved any issues that arose.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>The busiest thing these days was not a person, but a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Its name was the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace.</p><p></p><p>Yes, this Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace had been the busiest these past few days.</p><p></p><p>The fierce beasts brought back by the four factions and the scattered cultivators were all integrated and refined into essence blood by it.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had fully comprehended the Contemplation Diagram of the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace could also refine them themselves, but the efficiency was very low.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator could only refine one beast's essence blood per day, even if they exerted their full effort.</p><p></p><p>But the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace accepted all comers, no matter how many, and would refine them all at once.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators only needed to wait and collect the specially-made containers to receive the refined essence blood.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace only wanted the true essence of the beasts, and didn't care about the essence blood, as it had more than enough.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the past few days, the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace in the Merit Hall had been extremely busy, with the four factions and scattered cultivators lining up to use it.</p><p></p><p>There were two options:</p><p></p><p>1. Personal refinement, which required the cultivator to operate it themselves.</p><p>2. Fully automated, where the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace would refine one-tenth of the beast's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much, it would always be one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>Many people chose the fully automated option, letting the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace take one-tenth of the essence blood.</p><p></p><p>This was much faster, as the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace could refine everything in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Personal refinement was too slow and consumed too much of the cultivator's own essence blood, even though it could be recovered. With the time spent, it was better to go kill more beasts.</p><p></p><p>It's not that people didn't want to refine it themselves to avoid losing one-tenth, but the queues during peak hours were too long, and everyone was too busy to wait for the slow personal refinement.</p><p></p><p>Personal refinement could indeed increase one's control, but the time simply didn't allow for it.</p><p></p><p>Later, Xia Qing in the Merit Hall saw that there were too many scattered cultivators, and each one refining individually was a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he formulated a plan that required at least 20 people in a group, so that 20 people's beast captures could be resolved at once.</p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators also agreed, as individual refinement was too slow, and they were all annoyed by it themselves.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the powerful factions of the four groups were also very dissatisfied, thinking that since we were all refining together, the time was being wasted by the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators, in order to avoid conflict and trouble, consciously formed groups of 20 people.</p><p></p><p>This solved the problem of the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace being too busy.</p><p></p><p>As an expert at surreptitiously consuming, this Furnace had been improving every moment these past few days, and if it continued for another ten days or so, it would definitely catch up to the Chengmu and Guiqu Great Refiners.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Guiqu Great Refiner and Tongtian Chengmu were not idle either. Although there were not many cultivators who had fully comprehended the Contemplation Diagram, even a mosquito's leg was still meat.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lai, Jiu Tong, Ming Hui and the others, each time they refined a beast, seven-tenths of the true essence was devoured by them. Of the remaining three-tenths, two-tenths were used to condense their sea of consciousness' contemplation objects, and one-tenth was refined to strengthen their will.</p><p></p><p>A seven-three division was quite a capital.</p><p></p><p>But this was normal, as they couldn't use any more even if they were given more.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these abilities were bestowed by the Guiqu Great Refiner and Tongtian Chengmu, so even if they didn't give the three-tenths, it would be the same. Giving three-tenths was already generous.</p><p></p><p>So the Chengmu and Guiqu Great Refiner were also growing stronger, just with a much smaller effect compared to the Heavenly-Earth Smelting Furnace.</p><p></p><p>However, the Guiqu Great Refiner still had a backup plan, continuously refining the Guiqu Essence from the small worlds, and its true essence had already reached 3.9, catching up to the Tongtian Chengmu.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tongtian Chengmu, apart from the cultivators' offerings, its recent progress was not great, and it was even injured yesterday, which could be considered the most unfortunate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the world was in turmoil, Qingyun Mountain remained peaceful.</p><p></p><p>At the headquarters of the Exorcism Department in the Summer Capital.</p><p></p><p>Recently, due to Xuanhuang's appearance, they had more meetings, but fewer disputes. It had to be said that this was a good direction.</p><p></p><p>Mie Xia, Zhao Zheng, Han Wu, Tang Zonglong, Yue Long Master and others in the Exorcism Department were closely following the news of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the Confucian, Taoist, and Buddhist factions had not returned.</p><p></p><p>Even the martial arts headquarters and Tao sect headquarters in the Summer Capital had half of their top experts gone.</p><p></p><p>"Even now, it still feels unbelievable that he actually accomplished it?" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Zheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You said, is there a possibility for us Spiritual Masters to learn?" Tang Zong asked.</p><p></p><p>"Unless you are willing to give up your current abilities and start over from the beginning," Bi Xia replied.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, no one spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>Those present were all Third-Stage Spiritual Masters, the pinnacles of the Spiritual Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Their current status and strength all came from the Anomalies, how could they casually give that up?</p><p></p><p>"However, there is now an additional choice, whereas before we had none. I've heard that Friend Xuan can alleviate the spiritual soul erosion of Spiritual Masters, which is quite good, but unfortunately he is not in the Summer Capital."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Yue, the Dragon Master, had been talking more lately, especially when discussing Xuan and Huang.</p><p></p><p>"I've also heard that Master Xuan is erudite and talented, having pioneered the forging of artifacts and talismans. Thinking about it now, it's truly incredible - not only did he create the three methods of Essence, Qi, and Spirit, but he is also proficient in other schools."  Han Wu said.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, perhaps, that is what a genius is?" Bi Xia said.</p><p></p><p>However, when these words came from Bi Xia's mouth, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was Bi Xia, the late Third-Stage Spiritual Master, the overlord of the Exorcism Division.</p><p></p><p>He was widely recognized as the number one Spiritual Master in the world.</p><p></p><p>For him to say that Xuan was a genius, with a tone of self-deprecation, was truly a miracle.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to him, we are truly mediocre," Zhao Zheng also said.</p><p></p><p>Another recognized top five Third-Stage Spiritual Master expert.</p><p></p><p>"This old man truly wishes to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Yue suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!"</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Master, do not jest."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Dragon Yue spoke, the four great overlords immediately objected.</p><p></p><p>Without Dragon Yue, no one could replace him. He was the one holding up the communication between the Blue Star and the outside.</p><p></p><p>If anything were to happen to Dragon Yue, they would revert to the era of being unable to communicate.</p><p></p><p>"Just talking. But this old man does indeed wish to go take a look," Dragon Yue smiled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Dragon Yue had no intention of actually going, Bi Xia heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Han, how are the arrangements for the Spiritual Masters from our division with severe Anomaly erosion to go to the Southern City?"</p><p></p><p>Han Wu replied: "There are twenty-seven of them, all Spiritual Masters with severe Anomaly erosion, led by our most capable ones. They will set out this afternoon."</p><p></p><p>"Good, if this trip is successful, our pressure will be greatly reduced."</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia continued: "As for the Great Wind World (Martial Dao Miniature World) and the Blue State Realm (Cultivation Miniature World), how do you all plan to respond to their requests?"</p><p></p><p>This was the main agenda for today.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, the two miniature worlds had also learned of Xuan and Huang's extraordinary achievements.</p><p></p><p>Previously, there had been an abundance of Immortal-Martial cultivators on the Blue Star, thanks in large part to the teachings of these two miniature worlds.</p><p></p><p>Now that they have learned of Xuan's existence, they also wish to seek the Dao on Qingzhou Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Although both sides are somewhat skeptical, they have organized teams to go study and investigate.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, I don't think we need to obstruct them, we can't do that anyway. Master Xuan is not our person, and the upper echelons of the miniature worlds won't change their minds just because of our wishes - they're just informing us. We should warmly welcome them, but also make it clear that Master Xuan is not our person, and whether he is willing to impart the Dao is up to his own decision."</p><p></p><p>"Leader, I agree with what Brother Zhao said. We can't stop the cultivators of the miniature worlds from pursuing their intentions, it's like giving someone a rose, the fragrance remains with us. We should just welcome them."  Tang Zong said.</p><p></p><p>"Leader, I concur."</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia nodded, indicating he understood.</p><p></p><p>"Han, go inform the two miniature worlds accordingly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>After concluding this topic, Bi Xia picked up a document and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhao, please give an update on the 'Abyss Secret Realm' situation."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Zheng said: "For over a month now, the Abyss Secret Realm has been abnormal. From the depths, an inexplicable heartbeat sound is transmitted, as if something is gestating there. But the Abyss is too vast and dangerous, we cannot linger long in the outer regions, and we have no idea what is happening inside... I went to take a look myself, and that heartbeat sound filled me with dread. The Anomaly I control also becomes silent and sinks into a state of trepidation as it approaches the Abyss. I seem to sense a sense of panic from it?"</p><p></p><p>Brother Zhao's Anomaly was the Bridal Gown Specter, not an ordinary female Anomaly. While other female Anomalies exude a cold and eerie aura, his Bridal Gown Specter was noble and sacred.</p><p></p><p>Due to the connection with Zhao Zheng's name, unfriendly people would mockingly call his female Anomaly the "Empress Zhao".</p><p></p><p>They would say that Zhao Zheng had subdued his own mother, and ask if he wanted a "father" and if they could be Lü Bu.</p><p></p><p>But it's undeniable that Zhao Zheng's Bridal Gown Specter is extremely powerful, and it can self-evolve without needing to collect fragments.</p><p></p><p>It even spurs Zhao Zheng to grow stronger, as if it doesn't want to be devoured.</p><p></p><p>This has made the mid-Third-Stage Zhao Zheng a unique existence in the Spiritual Master realm, unafraid of Anomaly backlash.</p><p></p><p>In battle, he can unleash the full power of his Anomaly without worry, allowing him to rival late-stage experts.</p><p></p><p>The Bridal Gown Specter's Yin energy and Anomaly abilities can corrode all things, and its curses are inescapable - invading dreams, striking calamity, mind control, heart-breaking, and more.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xu Ru, whose nemesis is the Bridal Gown Specter. The Specter's control over the human heart makes Xu Ru shudder when he approaches Zhao Zheng.</p><p></p><p>So what is the Abyss, which makes even this fearsome Bridal Gown Specter feel a sense of panic and sink into silence? "Han, please tell us about the situation with the Yellow Springs Secret Realm under your charge."</p><p></p><p>Bi Xia did not provide any solutions or ways to deal with the Abyss, because he himself did not know how to handle it.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even venture deep into the Abyss, how could they resolve this? </p><p></p><p>As for the heartbeat sound in the Abyss? Such a terrifying place, it was obvious that it was something they could not deal with.</p><p></p><p>So he did not respond, nor did he know how to respond.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>"Leader, everyone..." Han Wu began.</p><p></p><p>"Similar to Brother Zhao's situation, for over a month now, the Yellow Springs in the depths of the Mount Tai Crevice has been abnormal. But we cannot venture deep, only able to hear the occasional heartbeat sound and what seems to be the roar of some living being, more like the wail of a ghost. The Great General I control also trembles incessantly, though it has not been subdued, I sense it has a suicidal battle intent, as if it has no fear of death."</p><p></p><p>Another unsolvable problem.</p><p></p><p>Interestingly, the Anomaly Han Wu controls is the portrait of the Marquis of Cavalry Huo Qubing.</p><p></p><p>Before the Anomaly awakened, although it was female, Han Wu greatly admired the Marquis of Cavalry Huo Qubing, and had collected many cartoon figures, dolls, models, and portraits of the Marquis.</p><p></p><p>After the Anomaly awakened, one of the Marquis' portraits underwent a transformation. </p><p></p><p>During a time when Han Wu was attacked by other Anomalies, the Marquis in the painting emerged and devoured the Anomalies, then was smoothly integrated by Han Wu.</p><p></p><p>There are even some who are jealous of Han Wu and fabricate stories, saying that Han Wu is the reincarnation of the Han Emperor, and in her past life she was infatuated with the Marquis of Cavalry, and now in this life she has been reborn as a woman, with the Marquis protecting her.</p><p></p><p>In any case, her Anomaly is similar to Zhao Zheng's, a rare heaven-blessed existence that is perfectly compatible with controlling Anomalies. The Anomalies they control are all extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Han Wu's Marquis of Cavalry is truly valiant, not possessing many abilities, but living up to the title of "Encircling the Wolves and Drinking at the Han Sea". No matter what abilities you have, he will break them with sheer force.</p><p></p><p>He can even subdue and recruit the Anomalies he has conquered, becoming his military generals, and they can even form battle formations together.</p><p></p><p>It's quite overpowered.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Zhao Zheng, who was displeased with others calling his Anomaly the Marquis of Cavalry, Han Wu is very satisfied when people call her Anomaly General the Marquis of Cavalry.</p><p></p><p>She truly believes that her Anomaly General is Huo Qubing, that he has come to protect her.</p><p></p><p>An infatuated obsession, even to the point of mental instability, like a devoted fangirl.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

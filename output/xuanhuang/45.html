        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since you've come, you'll definitely need to kill and loot the body.</p><p></p><p>But did Xuanhuang not discover that the puppet had memories?</p><p></p><p>This has become a problem. It's not good to go back empty-handed, so he searched Jia Zhengyi's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The harvest was meager, but there was some money and valuables, though useless to Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>"Old fellow, I remember you, causing me to gain nothing."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang secretly remembered Jia Zhengyi, who could even squeeze out oil with his strange abilities, but ended up failing when it came to people.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, this was just a puppet, the important items would certainly not be placed on the body. Moreover, he had multiple hideouts, as the deputy director had more than one residence, who knows where the important things were placed.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up and finding no omissions, Xuanhuang disappeared from this nameless small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan, you're back?"</p><p></p><p>When he reached the door of the martial arts hall, it was already half past five, and the sky had darkened.</p><p></p><p>From afar, he saw Sun Tong looking around the door, waiting for Xuanhuang to return.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong looked Xuanhuang over.</p><p></p><p>"What's this? What are you looking at?" Xuanhuang asked.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong smiled, "Nothing."</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was checking if Xuanhuang was injured.</p><p></p><p>Although she had only known Xuanhuang for about ten days, she had keenly noticed that this Master Xuan was a homebody.</p><p></p><p>He almost always stayed in seclusion, not believing that he went out to seek inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Does this require seeking inspiration? "Master Xuan, did you gain any harvests?" But it was still a matter of procedure, so Sun Tong asked.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Qi Long and Jia Zhengyi, Xuanhuang said, "This time the harvest was not small, you could say it was quite large."</p><p></p><p>Especially Qi Long's memories, this was the memories of an old spirit master over six or seven years, with all kinds of things.</p><p></p><p>This might be his biggest harvest.</p><p></p><p>"A large harvest?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was stunned, so there really was a harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Come here," Xuanhuang said to her.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong followed, and they went to a room where Xuanhuang waved his hand, and half a table of gold, silver, and jewelry appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Look, this is one of the harvests."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang had searched Jia Zhengyi's house.</p><p></p><p>"This?" </p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was dazed, this was going out to loot, otherwise where did all this gold, silver, and jewelry come from.</p><p></p><p>"Give it to Sun Hui."</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang waved his hand, the gold, silver, and jewelry were useless to him.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use it to support the martial arts hall, as he had already passed the stage of needing to earn money.</p><p></p><p>Or you could say, he had become someone who defined what wealth is.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the bewildered Sun Tong, Xuanhuang returned to the separate courtyard to check the other harvests.</p><p></p><p>"Really went to seek inspiration? But where did the jewelry come from? It can't be that he just picked it up, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What a strange man."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud door opening sound startled Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Tong, where's Master Xuan? I heard he's back?"</p><p></p><p>Without turning around, hearing herself being called Tong Tong, she knew it must be her uncle, the hall master.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong turned around and saw a few others.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall's manager Huang Daye, the Dao school's Master Ma, and Deputy Director Xia Qing were also there.</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master, Master Ma, Deputy Director Xia."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong greeted the uncle and the others, who seemed anxious, and said, "Master Xuan just got back and went to the separate courtyard."</p><p></p><p>"Good that he's back."</p><p></p><p>Sun Hui sighed with relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He had just heard the news from Master Ma and was terribly frightened.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour ago, Master Ma and Deputy Director Xia had come to visit, and Sun Hui initially thought they were asking about the Immortal Dao techniques that Xuanhuang had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>But it was from Master Ma that he learned Jia Zhengyi had hired an assassin to attack Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>This news had greatly frightened Sun Hui, and he immediately asked Master Ma...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long ago, a disciple of Master Ma Dao Chang named Gao Jue was a spirit medium working in the Xie Department in the Southern Market Town. </p><p></p><p>He was a minor official with some power, belonging to the faction of Director Jia Zheng Yi, and he did not get along well with Xuan Huang.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were of different paths and did not see eye to eye, without any particular reason.</p><p></p><p>He accidentally overheard the one-eyed man who had been injured recently complaining.</p><p></p><p>He said that Director Jia and Wei Zi Xuan had taken him there, and he was injured as a result, but the two of them did not provide any compensation.</p><p></p><p>He also complained that Wei Zi Xuan was an untrustworthy person without any righteousness.</p><p></p><p>He said that while Wei Zi Xuan spoke well, in order to suppress the warriors for the sake of the spirit mediums, this Xuan Huang needed to be dealt with early...</p><p></p><p>These words were heard by the strangely gifted Gao Jue.</p><p></p><p>He immediately told his teacher Master Ma Dao Chang.</p><p></p><p>He also mentioned the news that Xuan Huang had broken through to the extraordinary in the martial dao, and the reason it had not been spread was that Jia Zheng Yi had suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Master Ma Dao Chang also became anxious, as Xuan Huang was related to his own path, and he was still waiting for Xuan Huang's diagram of qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"You, surnamed Jia, are obstructing my dao, and I will not let you get away with it."</p><p></p><p>However, Master Ma Dao Chang quickly calmed down, as there was no evidence yet.</p><p></p><p>So he hurriedly told his disciple Gao Jue to think of a way.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue thought of the strange club, so that afternoon he went to inquire about the news. After countless efforts and paying a considerable price, he finally learned that Jia Zheng Yi had an item storage task office.</p><p></p><p>He understood this, as the task office of the club was a third-party guarantee, established for the purpose of completing transactions.</p><p></p><p>And a spirit medium friend also told him that he had discovered the traces of the mysterious Qi Long, and had also seen Jia Zheng Yi meeting with Qi Long.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue had special abilities, as his name "Gao Jue" was the same as the mythical deity Shun Feng Er, the Heavenly Ear. </p><p></p><p>Combined with his mastery of strange and mysterious things, he had gained a certain reputation, and had many friends.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he was able to get the general situation.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue was an orphan from a young age, raised and taught by Master Ma Dao Chang, who had imparted all his skills to him.</p><p></p><p>Gao Jue treated Master Ma Dao Chang as his own father. He listened to his teacher's words and followed his instructions, even after becoming a spirit medium.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he worked very hard, and the results were also very good, obtaining everything he wanted.</p><p></p><p>He then told his teacher all that he had found out.</p><p></p><p>This led to Master Ma Dao Chang hurriedly bringing Xia Qing to find Xun Hui.</p><p></p><p>Xun Hui, upon learning that Xuan Huang had gone out, became even more anxious.</p><p></p><p>He immediately came to find Sun Tong.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he overheard two young men discussing.</p><p></p><p>A: Did you see that? The one just now was Master Xuan, the hope of our martial dao.</p><p></p><p>B: Who was the beauty?</p><p></p><p>A: What business is it of yours who the beauty is?</p><p></p><p>B: I'm just asking for a friend.</p><p></p><p>A: That's the niece of the pavilion master, serving as an assistant to Master Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, he finally knew that Xuan Huang had returned safely.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan didn't say anything, right? And... um, was he injured?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong was taken aback, her uncle was thinking the same as her.</p><p></p><p>"No, Master Xuan said he went for a walk and gained a lot."</p><p></p><p>Xia Qing, Master Ma Dao Chang, and Xun Hui were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sun Tong turned around.</p><p></p><p>Pointing to the pile of gold, silver, and jewels on the table, she said, "Look, this is the harvest Master Xuan brought back. He told me to give it to you, I haven't even looked at it yet... Huh, there's writing on this."</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong picked up the carefully wrapped jade stone and said, "Let me see what it says, 'Collection of Deputy Pavilion Master Jia Zheng Yi'... What does this mean, the collection of Jia Zheng Yi?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, look at this." It was as if she had discovered a great treasure.</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong picked up another one and said, "This is also from Jia Zheng Yi's collection, and this one too..." </p><p></p><p>"Master Xuan said he went for a leisurely walk, how come he brought back so many of Jia Zheng Yi's collections?"</p><p></p><p>Sun Tong still hadn't figured it out.</p><p></p><p>And Xun Hui: ???  Xia Qing: ???</p><p></p><p>Master Ma Dao Chang: ???</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

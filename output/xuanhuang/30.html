        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is this it?" </p><p></p><p>Yun Fei asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"This is just a newly born bizarre phenomenon. What more is there to it?"</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang looked at the four of them with disappointment. "If it weren't for tempering you all, I would have resolved it long ago. Wu Gang is not bad, but Yun Fei and Jin Ning still need to work harder. Sun Tong, hmm, has a lot of room for improvement."</p><p></p><p>The four of them looked at each other, especially Sun Tong, who was filled with shame.</p><p></p><p>But realizing that they were still novices, they felt much better.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Wu Gang was the most shocked, truly understanding what it meant to be "undefeatable at the same level".</p><p></p><p>It's not that he hadn't followed spirit masters to deal with bizarre incidents before.</p><p></p><p>Previously, no matter what kind of bizarre phenomenon, even if it was just newly born, the spirit masters would always be exhausted and suffer heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>For Xuan Huang to resolve it so easily, this was the first time.</p><p></p><p>For a martial artist to use their own abilities, and for a spirit master to borrow the power of the bizarre, the two are just different.</p><p></p><p>Even if the spirit masters could resolve it without any damage, they would still need to adjust the bizarre forces within their bodies, afraid of losing balance.</p><p></p><p>But Xuan Huang was able to give them a lesson without the slightest fatigue.</p><p></p><p>The difference was too great.</p><p></p><p>How fortunate they were to have a Master Xuan.</p><p></p><p>How fortunate they were to have martial arts.</p><p></p><p>How fortunate they were for humanity.</p><p></p><p>How fortunate they were for this messed up world.</p><p></p><p>Follow him, and there will come a day when they see the light.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Gang, arrange for someone to go to the plastic surgery clinic with Li Li to retrieve the remnants of the bizarre phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>The still dazed Wu Gang was suddenly interrupted by Xuan Huang's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Xuan."</p><p></p><p>This time, both in language and in his heart, Wu Gang had even more respect.</p><p></p><p>The group went downstairs, and the other martial arts hall would take care of the cleanup, no need for Xuan Huang to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>However, for the sake of caution, they decided to bring Li Li back to the martial arts hall and have her stay there for two days, to see if there were truly no omissions.</p><p></p><p>This was also Li Li's strong demand, as it was a matter of her own safety, which she cared about more than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>The flyer in Li Li's hand had turned into a damaged human face skin the moment the doll perished, and Xuan Huang had collected it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The group returned to the martial arts hall, and Wu Gang and the others went to the plastic surgery clinic with Li Li.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Huang temporarily stayed in the separate building of the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>He did not go home to stay, as it was still a bit dangerous there.</p><p></p><p>The revered "Master Xuan" was unable to return home temporarily due to the danger there.</p><p></p><p>This strange feeling made him very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the separate building of the martial arts hall, he hungrily studied the cultivation methods and records of martial arts and immortal ways.</p><p></p><p>He began to cultivate at a level beyond the first stage.</p><p></p><p>These were all obtained from various small worlds, and due to the changes caused by cultivation, the cultivation methods were not as precious.</p><p></p><p>"The first stage of martial arts cultivation is to open the dantian with qi and blood, and to integrate the intent with qi and blood, whether it's the comprehension of the sword intent, fist intent, or the true essence of the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth."</p><p></p><p>"By integrating the comprehended true essence with one's qi and blood, achieving a qualitative change, and then driving the further evolution of one's own qi and blood to a higher level."</p><p></p><p>It is to learn from, comprehend, and integrate the true essence of the various existences in the world with one's own qi and blood, to promote one's own progress.</p><p></p><p>A complete world can be comprehended and integrated with one's own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>But not now.</p><p></p><p>Now the will of heaven is distorted, not only can it not be integrated with one's own, but even the comprehended true essence is also distorted and incomplete.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal way is to build the foundation, comprehend the laws to condense the seed of the golden elixir, which is the seed of the Fa, and then nurture and grow it step by step into the seed of divine powers."</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the laws or the will of heaven, they are no longer viable.</p><p></p><p>He closed the last book.</p><p></p><p>He had a general understanding of the cultivation methods of the first stage of martial arts and immortal ways.</p><p></p><p>"My way will always be with the will in the lead, so my progress will still be with the will progressing first."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The will of the first stage is not as simple as before the extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>A formed will, even if it is in a gaseous state, is very difficult to transform into a liquid state.</p><p></p><p>It requires the cultivation of essence, qi, and spirit.</p><p></p><p>The first stage is still mainly focused on essence, and only with a powerful physique can one progress to higher levels.</p><p></p><p>Don't you see that many divine beings and demons are born with physiques that rival the sun and moon? With such powerful physiques, they naturally condense corresponding divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, as long as your physique is strong, you don't really need anything else.</p><p></p><p>The physique will spontaneously nurture the divine abilities to support the mighty physique.</p><p></p><p>The method of Xuanhuang's cultivation is the "Sutra of the Twelve Celestial Pillars of the Four Extremes Crucible", which establishes twelve willpower-refining celestial pillars in the sea of qi, connecting the four extremes.</p><p></p><p>The forces of heaven and earth converge in the sea of qi, using the forces of heaven and earth to refine the will.</p><p></p><p>However, this will distort the will of heaven and earth, and if not restrained, it will inevitably lead to chaos.</p><p></p><p>This is where the function of the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible comes in.</p><p></p><p>Four celestial gates are engraved on the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible, each corresponding to the four extremes of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The forces of heaven and earth drawn in serve as the hammer to forge the will.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, what Xuanhuang needs to do now is to engrave one celestial gate on the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible and use the blood qi to condense one celestial pillar in the sea of qi space.</p><p></p><p>The celestial pillar connects heaven and earth, drawing in the forces of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Up to this point, the cultivation method of the first stage is determined.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang began to cultivate the engraving of the celestial gate on the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of qi, the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible is seated on the gushing spring, and the diffused will surrounding it begins to cover the crucible.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang's main difficulty is in creating the method and researching its feasibility.</p><p></p><p>Once the research is clear and the path is defined, the implementation is very simple.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of consuming the power of the will.</p><p></p><p>The will attached to the Heavenly and Earthly Crucible, like a carving knife, begins to engrave the celestial gate on the crucible.</p><p></p><p>The process is very smooth, but it is impossible to complete it in one go.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang only carved one-seventh of the entire celestial gate, and the will was already exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Xuanhuang temporarily put it down, as this thing cannot be rushed.</p><p></p><p>Even without any obstacles, it still requires sufficient quantity and time to recover.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the will, Xuanhuang senses the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>The sea of qi is endless, representing the boundless potential of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Xuanhuang's golden blood qi in the sea of qi is only the size of ten zhang.</p><p></p><p>Each of the twelve celestial pillars, once condensed, can expand it by thirty zhang, which means that at the peak of the first stage, the sea of qi can become three hundred and sixty zhang in diameter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it can be accumulated indefinitely, which is also a way to become stronger, but it is not recommended.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the larger the sea of qi, the stronger the will required.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Dao of Heaven is not distorted and does not require the will to suppress it, the accumulation of the sea of qi will become increasingly difficult.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to reach a certain level and then advance to a higher realm, at which point the transformation will begin, and it will nourish the physical body and the sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>For example, upon entering the second stage, the nourishment of qi will instantly expand the sea of qi of essence tenfold.</p><p></p><p>But if one only accumulates blood qi and does not progress to a higher level of qi, perhaps someone else's single nourishment is tenfold, while you only expanded it by twofold.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem worth it at all.</p><p></p><p>Outside the ten zhang of golden blood qi is the mist of the sea of qi, and the celestial pillars of condensed blood qi will take root in the mist to draw in the forces of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This is the direction of the will.</p><p></p><p>As for the accumulation of the physical body, it is simple, just like before, just fill it up.</p><p></p><p>The will opens up the mist and expands the territory, and the golden blood qi refines the energy.</p><p></p><p>Great Elixirs, fierce beasts, and the strange things that can be refined after entering the extraordinary, such as blood pools.</p><p></p><p>However, the most profitable is the extraordinary fierce beasts, such as those in the Blood Moon World.</p><p></p><p>The Great Elixir seems small in comparison, as the blood qi becomes extraordinary golden blood qi, and the Great Elixir's effect, although present, is very small, only able to increase it a little bit.</p><p></p><p>And the strange things are also a treasure trove, especially the blood qi-type strange things.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this

        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cauldron of Ze emitted a faint blue glow.</p><p></p><p>【Cauldron Master: Liang Qu】</p><p></p><p>【Refined Ze Spirit: White Monkey (Fusion Degree: 70.6%)】</p><p></p><p>【Innate Skill: Water Leap】</p><p></p><p>【Essence of Water and Marsh: None】</p><p></p><p>【River Favor Degree: 0.0001 (Huai River)】</p><p></p><p>【Commanding Water Beasts: Tahua Crocodile, Six-Whisker Catfish, Stone Turtle Crab, Heavenly Water Centipede】</p><p></p><p>【Evaluation: The Ze Spirit of the White Monkey originates from the great Huai Whirlpool Lord, but is not fully awakened, a insignificant character.】</p><p></p><p>River Favor Degree, 0.0001! </p><p></p><p>This decimal value is as valuable as a discount on Pinduoduo.</p><p></p><p>Yet Liang Qu stared intently at this tiny 0.0001, deeply feeling how hard-earned it was.</p><p></p><p>He was unsure whether it was due to the 20% increase in fusion degree, or the reason for the favor, but the final evaluation had changed, from "weak in nature" to "insignificant", which sounded not much different, but should still be considered a small progress, right? He just didn't know which step of the ritual had gained recognition - being the main officiant? Worshipping the mountain demon? Leading thousands of civilians? Or was it not a single step, but the entire ritual process that earned the favor?</p><p></p><p>To gain favor in the future, does one have to perform the ritual as the main officiant? There were too many doubts, the ritual process was too complex, not easy to reproduce for comparison experiments.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu couldn't judge, could only make certain guesses.</p><p></p><p>Today's ritual, while said to be for the river god, essentially had no specific object.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Songbao said, great demons appear before mortals every year. </p><p></p><p>This year it was the spherical black toad, last year the giant sturgeon, the year before the water tiger fish - after each sighting, there were rituals, a superstitious custom formed out of fear among the villagers.</p><p></p><p>There are too many great demons, the Yangtze-Huai River is too vast, the probability of seeing the same great demon in the same place is extremely low.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the river god of the Yangtze-Huai River may have the ability to change its own setting.</p><p></p><p>In folk legends, the river god of the Yangtze-Huai River is often said to take the form of a graceful young lord, fall in love with a village girl, punish corrupt officials and unfilial descendants, and help poor scholars.</p><p></p><p>Without a specific target, saying it's a ritual for the river god is no different from saying it's a ritual for the Yangtze-Huai River itself.</p><p></p><p>Everyone hopes that by offering livestock, the Yangtze-Huai River will remember their hardships, and bring good weather and bountiful harvests next year.</p><p></p><p>So the ritual is actually for the Yangtze-Huai River.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to gain favor through rituals, this should be a necessary condition.</p><p></p><p>The scale of the ritual and one's position in it should be another necessary condition.</p><p></p><p>As the main officiant, leading thousands to kneel and worship, grand and majestic, perhaps even more awe-inspiring than the emperor's morning court.</p><p></p><p>If one becomes just one of the thousands, the effect might not be the same.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the offerings should also be factored in, not necessarily supernatural beings, but at least the three sacrificial animals.</p><p></p><p>These three factors are likely the key elements to gaining favor.</p><p></p><p>If one serves as the main officiant, leads a hundred thousand followers, and performs a ritual for three supreme-level great demons, the favor degree would be at least 1, Liang Qu believed. He didn't think that setting up two small broken tables, killing two chickens, and secretly kneeling in the corner by himself could earn the Yangtze-Huai River's favor, that would be too cheap.</p><p></p><p>But he could try, trying doesn't cost anything, he could prepare two chickens, an incense burner, and sprinkle the chicken blood into the river another day.</p><p></p><p>He would choose a two-and-a-half-year-old old hen.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stroked his chin, deep in thought, he stepped out of the cabin, stood at the bow, and wondered what difference the favor would make.</p><p></p><p>The strong wind blew, the oars struck the river water, kicking up swirling eddies.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechang felt something strange, he was also an expert fisherman, steering a boat was no problem for him, but today the rowing felt exceptionally easy, as if the heavens and earth were all lending their strength, gliding effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Since it wasn't his own boat, the weight was different, and he hadn't been fishing for a couple of months at the martial arts school, had his hands gotten rusty?</p><p></p><p>Wait, the boat speed has slowed down again? Chen Jiechang rowed the oars, feeling his hands acting strangely, as if rowing through a thick paste, but it soon returned to normal, neither too light nor too heavy, just like usual.</p><p></p><p>The river flow today was strange, he had never seen anything like it, had it flowed over a hidden current? Puzzling, utterly puzzling.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu crouched at the bow, lowering his head in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The water control ability. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> 0.0001 degree of favor, too little, can't even evolve the talent skill of water vertical leap.</p><p></p><p>However, the water control ability has been slightly strengthened, roughly from 800 catties to 1000 catties!</p><p></p><p>The physical consumption when controlling water has become less, and the flexibility is higher.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I don't know why, blood control is still difficult, I can't even feel the blood flow in Chen Jiechangs body, up to now, I can only control the blood of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>I need to go back and take a look at those two volumes of "Reflections on Cultivating Nature and Life", maybe there will be an answer.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, Liang Qu has been reading "Annotations on the Miscellaneous Records of Haomutang" all the time, expanding his knowledge and experience, but he has neglected the macroscopic description of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Can't help it, "Reflections on Cultivating Nature and Life" is too boring, far less vivid and interesting than "Annotations on the Miscellaneous Records of Haomutang", the experiences in it are all narrated in the form of stories, and there are many unexpected twists, which makes it very entertaining to read.</p><p></p><p>The covered boat passed through the winding river, brushing past several passenger boats.</p><p></p><p>The South Stone Bridge passed overhead, Liang Qu glanced over and saw a pedestrian hurrying across the bridge.</p><p></p><p>Ah, Zheng Xiang!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked a few more times, until the Zhao family steward turned the corner and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>That time when Zheng Xiang came to the door to recruit him as Zhao Laoye's adopted son, that scene is still fresh in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he saw him again today, come to think of it, it's also strange, Lin Di knows that he has become Shifu's disciple, the Zhao family is much bigger and more powerful than a small fishing village, but Zheng Xiang hasn't come to the door to express anything.</p><p></p><p>Indifferent treatment? Liang Qu couldn't figure it out, seeing the covered boat passing through the river, he could already see the Yang mansion in the distance, so he didn't think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>He no longer puts such small fry in his eyes, they are not worth spending mental energy on.</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the reef, he climbed up the shore, Chen Jiechangs stayed on the boat to watch the boat, Liang Qu went forward and knocked on the bronze ring.</p><p></p><p>The gatekeeper, seeing that it was Liang Qu, naturally knew his identity, called out "Young Master Nine" and then opened the big door.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu followed the servant through the courtyard, but didn't see Shifu, only Shifu's wife Lady Xu, sitting in the armchair with Nan Di's support.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu hurriedly greeted her: "Greetings to Shifu's wife."</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu leaned back in the chair and smiled: "Little Nine, why do you have time to come to me? Normally I don't even see a glimpse of you, I can't even find you to have a meal together.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine of you, you and Little Four and Little Five are the best-looking, but Little Four is a bit wayward, and Little Five is cold, so I was hoping you could come and keep me company, but I haven't seen you all day long, sigh."</p><p></p><p>Seems like Shifu's wife is a beauty lover.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was embarrassed: "It's really that I have a lot of things to do, no time to spare, I have to study, practice martial arts, and also go out fishing, in a few days when I'm free, I'll definitely come to pay my respects to Shifu's wife every day."</p><p></p><p>"Fishing? Is it because you don't have enough silver? I just said that old man Yang is too stingy, ten taels is enough for what, still afraid of spoiling your character, you're such a good child, a little bit of silver, how could it spoil your character, Nan Di, go to my cabinet and get a ingot of precious silver."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt embarrassed in the beginning, and was shocked at the end.</p><p></p><p>An ingot of precious silver! That's fifty taels of silver!</p><p></p><p>Shifu's wife is too generous.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't come here to ask for money.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu hurriedly laid out the purpose of his coming in full, afraid that it would be too late and he would be like collecting a red envelope from a relative.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu waved her hand: "Little Nine, come here."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu obediently got up and squatted in front of Lady Xu.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu leaned in and sniffed: "No wonder as soon as you came in, there was a strong medicinal smell, you even have a bloody smell, are you injured?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a minor injury, nothing serious."</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu directly pulled open Liang Qu's collar and looked at the thick white bandage, frowning: "This is just a minor injury? Nan Di, don't go get the precious silver, go get a bottle of Burou Dan from my second trunk."</p><p></p><p>"Shifu's wife, really no need, I've been rolling around in the mud since I was a child, just a little skin and flesh injury, a small matter, the villagers are waiting anxiously."</p><p></p><p>"Even if they're anxious, it's useless, your Shifu isn't even in the mansion."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

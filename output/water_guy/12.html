        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The waters below were silent, with the sunlight scattering into fine, bright lines.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish lay motionless in the mud, its grayish-brown skin blending almost seamlessly into the surrounding environment. </p><p></p><p>If Liang Qu had not been able to sense it, one would hardly have noticed the presence of this fierce, carnivorous beast.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu approach, the fat catfish swished its tail, kicking up a small cloud of silt, and then bubbled out a breath. Following its lead, Liang Qu looked in the indicated direction.</p><p></p><p>Under a rock covered in seaweed, two pomfrets - one large and one small - were huddled together. But strangely, both fish had a pair of small horns on their heads! Treasure fish, without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>Resembling regular pomfrets but with the addition of the two horns, any normal person could tell at a glance that these were extraordinary fish.</p><p></p><p>As a lowly fisherman, Liang Qu had only heard of people catching treasure fish before, but had rarely seen them himself. And he was not alone - most of the fishermen in Yixing City were in the same boat.</p><p></p><p>However, the fishermen did have their own unique method of identifying treasure fish - they must possess some abnormal physical trait! </p><p></p><p>It was akin to the seventy-two moles on the thigh of Emperor Gaozu of Han, or the double pupils of Xiang Yu. The tiger-patterned fish caught by the neighboring village was also considered a treasure fish due to its unusual markings.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the two fish, Liang Qu's expression grew excited. He never imagined that the treasure fish he had been searching for days would suddenly appear before him in the form of not one, but two! Fatty was truly a lucky charm.</p><p></p><p>The two horned pomfrets were completely unaware that they had been spotted, continuing to frolic under the rock.</p><p></p><p>Behind the rock, a man and two beasts crouched in silence, not daring to make a move yet.</p><p></p><p>After observing for a while, Liang Qu noticed that the rock the fish were playing under had a cave underneath, perhaps their nest.</p><p></p><p>To prevent any other exits, he would have to wait until they left the nest before attempting to capture them.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu instructed the fat catfish to ambush from the other side, while he tied one end of the fishing net to the tail of the pig dragon. The man and beast separated, slowly unfurling the net.</p><p></p><p>The fishing net was actually a precious resource - Liang Qu didn't have one originally, and had only borrowed this one after treating Li Libo to a meal.</p><p></p><p>Now it was just a matter of waiting patiently. If he couldn't hold out, Liang Qu could take out the inflated pig bladder and hold it over his mouth to breathe. The gas inside had a strong, gamey odor, but for the sake of the treasure fish, it was all worth it.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for nearly half an hour, the pig bladder had deflated, and the horned pomfrets finally stirred from the cave, seeming to venture out in search of food.</p><p></p><p>Once the two fish had moved several meters away from the cave entrance, Liang Qu signaled the fat catfish to attack! Receiving the order, the catfish hidden in the mud below suddenly sprang into action, its body undulating as it shot out, kicking up a huge plume of silt in the water.</p><p></p><p>The two-meter long six-barbeled catfish charged with tremendous force, startling the horned pomfrets. But they were too far from the cave to make it back in time, and with the catfish attacking from behind the rocks, they had no choice but to flee in the opposite direction - right into Liang Qu's trap!</p><p></p><p>This was the moment!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu leapt up, and the pig dragon thrashed its tail, the two of them pulling the fishing net up the stream like a great curtain, perfectly enveloping the fleeing horned pomfrets!</p><p></p><p>A tremendous force tugged at the ropes of the net.</p><p></p><p>Whew, such powerful strength! One pound of fish, ten pounds of force - these fish must be three times as strong! Liang Qu immediately used his water control ability to restrain their momentum. With their horned heads and the coarse hemp net, not as sturdy as modern nylon, he couldn't risk them tearing through it. Losing the fish would be a disaster, far worse than just losing money.</p><p></p><p>Keeping the charge of the horned pomfrets under control, Liang Qu quickly sank back down, he and the pig dragon circling to tighten the net around them, reducing their range of motion and struggle.</p><p></p><p>Once they were fully enveloped, Liang Qu grabbed the bundled net and swiftly swam upstream, climbing into the fishing boat and emptying the two horned pomfrets into the holding tank.</p><p></p><p>These fish with horns were truly ferocious in temperament, thrashing wildly even in the dry confines of the tank, causing it to sway back and forth. Liang Qu had to reach in and steady it.</p><p></p><p>Leaning over the tank, Liang Qu gazed at the two horned pomfrets, overwhelmed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, you've done well!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Great job!" he exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>With this, his planned schedule could be shortened by nearly half, but he didn't know the exact value of these two precious fish. At the very least, they would be worth several taels of silver, and even if his martial arts skills were lacking, he wouldn't have to worry about the autumn taxes.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, they look so delicious."</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when he was at the bottom of the water, Liang Qu hadn't felt anything, but now that they were in the fish basket, he immediately sensed the strong allure of the two fish, just like a starving man seeing a steaming bowl of white rice.</p><p></p><p>Even though he wasn't that hungry, this was clearly an abnormal reaction, undoubtedly another proof of the fish's preciousness.</p><p></p><p>Should he eat one? The temptation of the precious fish was astonishing, and a bold thought formed in Liang Qu's mind.</p><p></p><p>He asked the Immovable and Fatty Catfish, and found that the fish didn't seem to hold much attraction for them. Well, if this fish was naturally so alluring to other aquatic creatures, how could it have survived? The first thing Liang Qu thought of was the Zeding cauldron - perhaps this fish had some essence of the water realm that could be useful for the cauldron. Once the idea took root, Liang Qu couldn't help but ponder it for a long time, eventually deciding to try the smaller Pomfret.</p><p></p><p>Controlling the cauldron that rules over all the waters of the world - it was certainly worth a try.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu carefully took out the smaller Pomfret. This fish was about a jin in weight, with a large head, while the bigger one was around three jin, several times larger.</p><p></p><p>The horns on the fish's head were extremely hard, as hard as tempered steel, and very sharp. The decision to net them in time was indeed correct, or else a few tugs might have let them escape.</p><p></p><p>There was no knife on the boat, so Liang Qu used a stone shard to open the fish's belly. The fresh blood smell immediately excited the two beasts guarding the boat, and they seemed to sense the fish's strong allure.</p><p></p><p>Catching the precious Pig Goddess Dragon and Fatty Catfish had taken a lot of effort, and Liang Qu was not stingy, throwing all the fish guts and trimmings into their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts swallowed them without any disdain.</p><p></p><p>It remained to be seen whether they would undergo any changes after consuming the precious fish.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned his gaze away, lit some firewood, and set up a clay pot. Once the water boiled, he put the fish slices in.</p><p></p><p>Lao Zhang had indeed come out with the intention of recuperating, and there was a small stove on the boat that could be used. </p><p></p><p>Previously, Liang Qu had been worried about the murder case being exposed, so he had already prepared some supplies on the boat, including a fire striker, in case he needed to flee at any time.</p><p></p><p>Unsure if the precious fish's effects would be lost through boiling, Liang Qu lightly scalded it, and after confirming there were no parasites, he took a bite.</p><p></p><p>Delicious!</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented sweetness filled his mouth, with a springy and refreshing texture. Without any scallions, ginger or garlic, it was not at all fishy, completely different from ordinary river fish, and there were no bones!</p><p></p><p>So delicious, Liang Qu hurriedly ate the whole fish, soup and all, until only the spine was left, which was too thick and hard. He sucked the marrow clean and then tossed it to the Immovable and Fatty Catfish.</p><p></p><p>The only evidence remaining of the fish's existence was the pair of hard little horns.</p><p></p><p>[Water Realm Essence +1.8]</p><p></p><p>The blue-green glow of the Zeding cauldron in his mind flashed again, and seeing the information, Liang Qu almost ate the three-jin big fish as well.</p><p></p><p>1.8 units of Water Realm Essence! The return was equivalent to eighteen spiritual lotus roots!</p><p></p><p>If the small fish was this good, the big one must be three times as valuable, perhaps 5.4 units of Water Realm Essence? With the current fusion level of 6.5, adding the essence from the big and small fish would directly break through to 10!</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu restrained himself, knowing that the ability of the precious fish to increase Water Realm Essence was already sufficient. The urgent priorities were still the path of martial arts and the imminent Zhao mansion.</p><p></p><p>Reciting the three-word mantra about becoming a martial arts master, earning a lot of money, living in a mansion, and keeping beautiful maids, Liang Qu used all the Water Realm Essence to enhance the fusion of the Zeding cauldron.</p><p></p><p>As the fish meat was digested, its own effects also began to manifest.</p><p></p><p>A warm sensation spread from his stomach throughout his entire body. Lying by the boat's edge, Liang Qu's face visibly flushed with redness, his whole body slightly feverish. His blood surged through his veins like a mighty river, and every cell in his body was cheering and exulting, breathing freely and to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

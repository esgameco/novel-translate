        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Extravagance.</p><p></p><p>Buying a bottle of long qi to use as a medium.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yue Long's actual consumption of long qi must be extraordinary. After taking it, who knows what great transformation he might undergo.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tossed a big bone to the black dragon under the table.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xuan Ming related to Xuan Huang?"</p><p></p><p>The last thing he knew that could be split and used as a medium was the Xuan Huang long qi, the names even sound similar.</p><p></p><p>"They are related, one is the vital energy of heaven and earth, the other is the essence energy of heaven and earth. The names sound grand, but they are the most easily produced, standard and regular. The latter is more often found in water, less commonly seen.</p><p></p><p>The former, the court can steadily produce every year. It is said that the great cultivators of the past who created the food qi method used the balanced Xuan Huang."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was surprised: "The great cultivators used Xuan Huang?"</p><p></p><p>"What's so strange about that?" Su Gui Shan threw down a crab shell and sneered, "When I discussed the Dao with the old monk, this was mentioned. You inherited his legacy and robe, but he never told you about his thoughts on the five difficulties of food qi?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember, 'difficult to satisfy' changed to 'difficult to contend'."</p><p></p><p>"Then it's settled."</p><p></p><p>Difficult to satisfy changed to difficult to contend? The others at the table, Long Yan Rui, Long Bing Lin, and even the uninvited guest Guan Cong Jian, all perked up their ears. They were curious about this esoteric knowledge, coming from various masters, great warriors, and experts.</p><p></p><p>Long Yao and Long Li bit on crab legs, listening to the lively discussion.</p><p></p><p>The black dragon was eating heartily, but seeing everyone so serious, it spat out the bone in its mouth, licked its lips, and sat up attentively on the floor.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Su Gui Shan expertly dismantled the crab legs, with a forceful tap the eight long meat strips were squeezed out, he used chopsticks to pick them up one by one, dipping them in vinegar, eating and talking.</p><p></p><p>"Fundamentally, the basis for classifying long qi as superior, middle, or inferior, is the degree of enhancement it brings to the cultivators. If you use it and can fight, you're awesome, that's superior; if you use it averagely, so-so, that's middle; if you use it clearly weaker than others, anyone can step on you, that's inferior!</p><p></p><p>Qi is just qi, people divide it into high and low, good and bad, it's for people to compete, to fight with others, to kill, to snatch meat. Heaven and earth don't have it, all things are just fodder, the long qi produced is no exception.</p><p></p><p>True great cultivators, won't lament using inferior qi, nor will they feel superior for using superior qi.</p><p></p><p>You guys, guarding the treasure mountain without using it, always cuddling with the dragon girls, not going to admire the lanterns, watch the fireflies, just going to the fields to catch crickets and frogs, all the elegant and vulgar you've experienced. You don't even bother to sign up, not even going out on the boat.</p><p></p><p>If you have so much free time, why not go listen to the old monk's sutras, many attachments can be resolved, less worries, more smooth sailing."</p><p></p><p>Everyone seemed pensive, automatically ignoring the latter part of his words.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Before he succeeded, Su Gui Shan had come to persuade him, but now that he had succeeded, his tone had changed. Su Gui Shan wiped his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Although 99% of people who embark on the cultivation path do so with the idea of becoming stronger than others, those who truly reach the peak often do not have such an obsessive mentality, being too focused on powerful techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Martial Saint Dragon Elephant was the most belligerent, hunting tigers for three years, Zhen Xiang for ten years, fighting from within the borders to outside, having no match at the same realm, using fighting as a whetstone. In the final ascension battle, he defeated three Celestial Masters at once, achieving enlightenment on the spot.</p><p></p><p>But he killed two Celestial Masters, severely injured one, shocking the world. What he ultimately realized was the 'uncontest of contest', a fierce person, in nearly a decade, his appearance gradually became amiable, like a friendly uncle. Isn't that strange?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"I will heed the advice."</p><p></p><p>"What advice, just parroting the old monk's words. When he said that, you probably didn't even understand. My realm is not as high as his, but higher than yours, just an old thing polishing it up and telling you again. If you truly had that realm, your things in the side room should be closed up by now."</p><p></p><p>This joking remark restored the harmonious atmosphere at the dining table.</p><p></p><p>Everyone resumed eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>The black dragon lowered its ears and continued gnawing.</p><p></p><p>"Why is it that whenever the Sea Overlord comes, everyone becomes a master? In our prefecture, by the end of this year, won't there be seven or eight masters openly?" Liang Qu asked.</p><p></p><p>He even began to doubt whether Hunting Tiger's ascension to Zhen Xiang was as difficult as the world said, just a rumor.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! Even after obtaining long qi, they can't enter Zhen Xiang, how could the court send them here? Look at their young appearance, all under forty, when they came a few years ago, the group leaders had all refined a hundred classics, those who couldn't do it weren't even selected! It's like when we were fighting the flood, throwing people into the river...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just like throwing soybeans, they go down and absorb water, and then expand to plug the gap. When the court selects, they pick these good beans, accumulate a few years of merit, and even if they don't have any air, they'll be given air.</p><p></p><p>Easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>During floods, the most feared are the surging waters. Sometimes there's not enough sand and stone to block, so they use food grains to make do.</p><p></p><p>Soybeans are the best material for blocking water. If it weren't for wasting too much food, they're even better than sand and stone. Soak them in water, and they immediately swell up to tightly seal the gap.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Mother Sect is the "flood", and their fresh blood can be used to water the "soybeans" sent by the court to block the flood. Liang Qu just acts as the middleman, not waiting for enough fresh blood to accumulate, and letting the Sea Magnate first pour the water.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, the court's purpose has been achieved. From nothing to something, from scattered to a solid embankment built right next to the Demon Mother Sect, defending the southern part of Zhili.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, there may be the rare sight of one county, one master in Pingyang..."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Late October.</p><p></p><p>In a blink of an eye, summer has passed.</p><p></p><p>There are fewer mosquitoes by the river, the white reeds sway in the wind, and the snakes have curled up their bodies, shifting their scales and digging holes to hibernate.</p><p></p><p>Large batches of big crabs and fish are sent to the market, their fish scales reflecting dazzling white light.</p><p></p><p>The experienced fishermen must hurry to accumulate enough resources before the weather gets completely cold.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, there are tax-free policies, making this year a bit more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish habitually sends Liang Qu to the Frog Clan's door, then waves its fins in farewell, one person and one frog going their separate ways, one to the Dragon Clan's land, the other to serve the Toad King and build the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, why hasn't Ying'e come out yet?"</p><p></p><p>Weilinde has already started to advance to the Sect Master level, and Xu Yuedragon has also been out of sight for days, probably busy with his own big matters. But the reclusive Ying'e, who went into seclusion a month earlier, is still motionless, almost two months now.</p><p></p><p>"This old one does not know either."</p><p></p><p>The same answer as the past dozen days.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sighed in distress, lying down on the Arhat bed.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder found it amusing.</p><p></p><p>Before, she didn't notice, but now she feels that Liang Qu has a bit of a youthful spirit, quite "clingy", coming every day before October, and even more so after October, asking every day.</p><p></p><p>"Could something have happened? Did Deliverance take a month?"</p><p></p><p>"There are no absolute certainties. Perhaps the Elder's longevity qi was too good, making it difficult to digest?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Liang Qu scratched his temple. The Yin requires 30,000 essences, indeed quite different from the others. Aside from the timing, Yin and Yang, the rest are all equal, one strand per 10,000.</p><p></p><p>Casually flipping through the Dragon Clan's picture book.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of boredom.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder's expression changed, looking up towards the outside.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a Dragon Clan member came running.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, quick, Sister Ying'e has come out of seclusion!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Dragon Clan member's eyes blurred, and when they focused again, Liang Qu had vanished from the Arhat bed! "Spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder was surprised.</p><p></p><p>The great lotus king stands tall, the white sturgeon swimming back and forth in guard. Tens of meters in, a small green wooden house stands quietly, surrounded by Dragon Maiden guards.</p><p></p><p>【Absorb a strand of Dragon Clan qi.】</p><p>【Consume 4 strands of Dragon Clan qi to generate one Dragon Pattern.】</p><p>【Dragon Clan qi: 2】</p><p></p><p>In front of the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Ying'e was talking to the Great Elder, her peripheral vision catching sight of the floating Liang Qu by the green stem. She refocused her gaze on the Great Elder, who was chattering away with great concern.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was calm like water, deep like a pool, always carrying a faint sense of repulsion.</p><p></p><p>Realizing something, the Great Elder glanced down at the person's shadow, sighing.</p><p></p><p>"The gate is not yet closed, standing and waiting for your husband..."</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the old bones will make way for the young."</p><p></p><p>The Great Elder knew that staying any longer would be self-defeating, waving his hand, and most of the Dragon Maidens withdrew, leaving space.</p><p></p><p>Two small fish swam and chased, the bubbles attached to the green stem floating and rising.</p><p></p><p>A tranquil silence in the lotus forest.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Ying'e did not come forward to greet him, but instead retreated two steps, sitting on the stone steps of the green house, patting her lap.</p><p></p><p>"Hey~"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu couldn't help but grin, accidentally laughing out loud, immediately clamping his mouth shut, baring his white teeth, and scurrying up to her.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

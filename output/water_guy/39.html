        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Liang Qu Road, Liang was not idle. He asked Long Song to lend him a few taels of silver, intending to go to various shops to buy some gifts for his new master. After all, one must understand the basic etiquette and customs.</p><p></p><p>However, after wandering around, he couldn't find anything suitable.</p><p></p><p>A few taels of silver could sustain his living for a long time, but using them to select gifts for his new master would be a bit of a stretch.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only buy some pastries and meat jerky.</p><p></p><p>The meat jerky was a must, as there were proper customs for "presenting gifts" in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, you don't have to do this. Master Yang doesn't care about these things."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xiang, while the master may not care, as a disciple, I cannot lack this sincerity."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Long Song scratched his head, "Brother Liang is thoughtful."</p><p></p><p>I wonder if I sent any gifts back then? </p><p></p><p>I've kind of forgotten about the "grand mansion."</p><p></p><p>The Yang residence was enormous. One could see the towering gates and the grand courtyard from hundreds of meters away, with the words "Yang Residence" elegantly written on the plaque.</p><p></p><p>Especially noteworthy was the small lake behind the residence, with a pavilion in the middle. The shores were lined with withered lotus pods and trees, creating a beautiful scene.</p><p></p><p>Getting closer, one could even see the ripples on the lake surface, though there was no wind today. Likely there was an underground river connecting it to the nearby lakes and marshes.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu recalled Li Liubo's previous words, that Master Yang had once been a military man who came to Pingyang Town to teach martial arts. If that was true, his previous position must have been quite high.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, to the left sat the white-haired Yang Dongxiong, whose stature was not particularly tall but whose aura was imposing, with piercing eyes.</p><p></p><p>To Yang Dongxiong's right sat his wife, Lady Xu, who looked even older, perhaps due to not practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The other seven disciples were seated on both sides, with the youngest, Xiang Longsong, standing at the rightmost position.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, there should have been one more disciple, but Liang Qu hadn't seen that person since last night, likely due to being away from Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>There was a meditation cushion in the hall, and without hesitation, Liang Qu took a few steps forward and knelt down on both knees.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Qu, you are grateful and courageous, steadfast and diligent. I wish to take you as my disciple. Are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong said solemnly. The events of the previous night had given him a clear understanding of Liang Qu's past experiences.</p><p></p><p>What Xiang Longsong had said was all true, so there was no reason for Liang Qu to back out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Liang Qu reminded Yang Dongxiong of his own younger self.</p><p></p><p>"I am willing, Master."</p><p></p><p>"As my disciple, you must be humble and receptive, respectful of the Dao and your elders, filial and brotherly. You must not harm your fellow disciples, be unfilial, or engage in wrongdoing or bullying the weak. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I remember, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Repeat it once more."</p><p></p><p>"Be humble and receptive, respectful of the Dao and my elders, filial and brotherly. I must not harm my fellow disciples, be unfilial, or engage in wrongdoing or bullying the weak."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's forehead was slightly sweating. Verbally reciting it was more difficult than writing it down. If not for his past life experience, he might not have been able to remember it.</p><p></p><p>He was curious if any of the other eight disciples had gotten stuck at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong showed a satisfied expression. "Good! Bring the tea."</p><p></p><p>The waiting maid brought a lacquered tray and presented the tea for the master-disciple ceremony.</p><p></p><p>"I present this cup of tea for the master-disciple rite. From now on, you are the ninth disciple of me, Yang Dongxiong!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liang Qu respectfully accepted the porcelain cup, gently raising it with both hands and offering the tea to his master.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong took the cup, lifted the lid, and drained it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Yang Dongxiong stood up and helped Liang Qu to his feet. At this point, the two had officially become master and disciple.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Liang Qu finally felt at ease, his heart overflowing with emotion. </p><p></p><p>Last night's events were not a dream! He was no longer a nameless, background-less rural fisherman.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He is not just any disciple, but Yang Dongxiong's ninth disciple! Who would dare to bully him now?"</p><p></p><p>After finishing the tea, Liang Qu presented his gift for becoming a disciple: "My financial means are limited, so I can only offer some pastries. I hope the master will not disdain them."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong quickly stepped forward to supplement: "Master, Liang Shidi (younger brother disciple) is truly sincere. In order to prepare this gift, he even borrowed money from me. I told him that you do not care about these things, but he said, 'The disciple cannot be without this heart, even if the master does not mind.'"</p><p></p><p>"He is truly a good child," praised Lady Xu, who was standing beside Master Yang.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong laughed heartily, patting Liang Qu's shoulder and praising him repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Having this heart is good, especially for someone from a fishing family with little education. It is even more admirable, showing that Liang Qu is intelligent and filial.</p><p></p><p>However, after the laughter, Yang Dongxiong's face turned serious. "You have this heart, and I am very happy about that. But I do not want this to become a burden for you. I investigated your background last night, so do not blame me for being stingy. After all, accepting disciples is a serious matter."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, disciple," Liang Qu quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>They were not just a teacher-student relationship like at a martial arts school, but a true master-disciple bond, almost like a father and son. Who would not be cautious?</p><p></p><p>"Since you understand, then as your master, I know you are an orphan and life has not been easy for you. Nandi!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong extended his right hand, and the maid who had just served the tea came forward again, handing a money pouch and a red and black waist token to Yang Dongxiong.</p><p></p><p>After receiving them, Yang Dongxiong passed the two items to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>The waist token was heavy in the hand, made of wood of an unknown type. It was rectangular in shape with a semi-circular top, and had a loop to tie a string. The intricate patterns were very exquisite, and it felt comfortable to hold.</p><p></p><p>Turning it over, Liang Qu saw his name on one side, and the large character "Yang" taking up most of the other side, with smaller characters below. The characters were carved in relief, with the surrounding area carved away, leaving a raised edge around the token.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this had been prepared beforehand, and his name was quickly carved in overnight, as such fine craftsmanship could not have been done in one night, Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>"This waist token is your proof of identity. Generally, officials will not trouble you if they see it. You can get half-price on medicine at the Changchun Medical Hall.</p><p></p><p>The money pouch contains ten taels of silver, for you to use to buy some things for yourself. Do not think it is too little - ten taels is not a small amount. But I am afraid you may develop a lazy and indolent habit, so I can only give you ten taels."</p><p></p><p>People can change, and their hearts even more so. There are many examples of those who were diligent in their youth but became lazy and gluttonous in old age. The nature of a person is cultivated bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong did not want Liang Qu to lose his ambition from this point on and ruin his character. He would provide some resources for Liang Qu's martial arts training, but most of it would still depend on Liang Qu's own efforts - he could not have everything handed to him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Liang Qu was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Master, Master, truly like a second father.</p><p></p><p>However, Yang Dongxiong had overestimated Liang Qu's financial means, thinking "only" ten taels was little.</p><p></p><p>Please, ten taels was a huge sum that Liang Qu had never even seen in his entire life. His highest savings record before learning martial arts was only nine taels and three qian, and he currently only had a dozen or so copper coins on him.</p><p></p><p>Truly, people are different from one another.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Master has given a gift, we as senior disciples cannot be stingy either. We prepared a welcoming gift last night, I wonder if the junior disciple will like it."</p><p></p><p>A tall, square-faced man stepped forward. According to Xiang Changsong's introduction, this was Yang Dongxiong's second disciple - Ru Dun.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we also prepared one," others among the senior disciples chimed in.</p><p></p><p>"And me as well," another added.</p><p></p><p>"Of course there is one for you too!" they all said.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

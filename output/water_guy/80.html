        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was hazy, and one mountain demon after another was being slaughtered. Aliang hurriedly put down the bricks and turned to look at Lin Guiyong beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Disaster has struck, disaster has struck! Manager Lin, what should we do now? We've been discovered, and the master will kill us."</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic! Why panic? They won't discover this place, and what can they do to us? Just like last time, that group of constables couldn't even find the underground tunnel, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Guiyong scolded the panicked Aliang in a gloomy voice, causing him to calm down a bit.</p><p></p><p>That's right, their location was extremely hidden. Unless they dug three feet into the ground, there was no need to worry about being exposed.</p><p></p><p>When the Fahua Temple was at the height of its prosperity, women would come to the Guanyin Hall every year to pray for children, and it was exceptionally effective, to the point that people would come from thousands of miles away to burn incense and worship Buddha.</p><p></p><p>It was because at night, when it was quiet, the women would enter the underground tunnel beneath the Bodhisattva Guanyin statue, and when they came out, they would be pregnant.</p><p></p><p>Those who came from afar to pray for children were mostly the wives and concubines of officials and nobles, so they naturally had to be careful, or else they would be dead.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the underground tunnel was dug with extreme secrecy, and even if the entire temple was massacred, no one had discovered this underground space back then.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had been using this place as a breeding ground for the mountain demons.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Aliang relaxed. Suddenly, a chill pierced through his chest.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head and saw a blood-stained knife tip protruding from between his ribs. Excruciating pain spread throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Lin Guiyong had come up behind him and stabbed him with a dagger, chilling him to the core.</p><p></p><p>Aliang looked unbelievingly at Lin Guiyong behind him. His heart was rapidly bleeding out, and his limbs were gradually growing cold, but he couldn't make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard these past few years. Rest well now."</p><p></p><p>Lin Guiyong witnessed Aliang's pupils losing their light, pulled out the dagger, and pushed Aliang to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Three years, a full three years.</p><p></p><p>Every ten days, he had to come here and keep company with the foul-smelling mountain demons, feeding and controlling them.</p><p></p><p>Watching as the mountain demons laid their egg sacs and hatched, he sometimes doubted whether he was human or demon.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of the battle outside were so pleasing to his ears, and he was overjoyed to hear them.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the mountain demons would awaken, Lin Guiyong had even sprinkled the awakening powder in advance. Everything had gone as the master had predicted.</p><p></p><p>It's all over now, it's all over. He was about to escape the bitter sea! Lin Guiyong wiped the dagger clean with the dry grass on the ground, quickly tidied up the scene, and ran down the secret passage towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Inside the temple, the stench of blood not only did not dissipate with the passage of time, but it became even more pungent and foul.</p><p></p><p>The blood of the mountain demons was vastly different from that of ordinary living beings. It was thicker, darker in color, and had a fermented, rotten smell. Spilled on the ground, the stench grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The black-toothed demons were so disgusted that they lay on the ground, covering their noses with their claws.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang leaped back and forth, using only his iron hands to eliminate the vast majority of the large mountain demons, either by twisting their necks or smashing their heads.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere were shattered stone fragments, as if the place had been bombarded by cannons.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai was mainly dealing with the medium-sized mountain demons. Surrounding him were severed limbs and arms, his white clothes fluttering in the wind, unstained by a single drop of blood.</p><p></p><p>The occasional medium-sized escapees were shot down by Hu Qi, who stood in a corner of the courtyard. Each of his arrows scattered with a glow, piercing the bodies of the mountain demons like shooting stars and firmly pinning them to the ground, the feathers trembling.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demons that managed to slip through were smaller than the one at the River God's Festival, and were handled by Xiang Changsong and Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang and the others had brought Xiang Changsong and Liang Qu over with the intention of tempering their junior brothers.</p><p></p><p>This approach became the best channel for Liang Qu to gain experience, as with Xiang Changsong limiting the movement space of the mountain demons, Liang Qu could swing his long spear freely. His muscles tightened like iron cables.</p><p></p><p>The red tassels were bloodstained, and the spearhead let out a sharp whistle.</p><p></p><p>He could feel...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blade of the spear cut through the skin, the sensation of the muscles and bones, releasing a gush after gush of thick mist-like hot blood, his whole body drenched in hot sweat, terrifying yet exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping across, stabbing one by one. The Fubo Spear became more and more comfortable to use, cutting into the bodies of the mountain demons that were difficult for ordinary blades to penetrate, no different from a hot knife cutting through butter, only slightly resistant.</p><p></p><p>【Mountain Demon Extermination Progress: 8】</p><p></p><p>【Mountain Demon Extermination Progress: 9】 </p><p></p><p>【Mountain Demon Extermination Progress: 13】</p><p></p><p>"I can't do it anymore, Senior Brother Xiang, I can't hack anymore."</p><p></p><p>The spear made of tungsten alloy fell to the ground, piercing the stone slab and embedding itself in the mud.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu supported the long spear, his heart pounding violently. He had just killed seventeen mountain demons in a row, exhausting all the qi and blood in his body, his arms extremely sore and weak, without any strength left.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong didn't say anything, he just blocked all the mountain demons, not letting a single one slip through.</p><p></p><p>The moon gradually rose, passing over the vines that had blocked it, the rooftops seemed to be flowing with a layer of mercury, but crossing over the rooftops, the spacious courtyard was filled with blood and corpses.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Snapping the neck of the last mountain demon, Lu Gang looked around, and there was not a single standing mountain demon to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Just the ones lying in the courtyard numbered more than a hundred, an astonishing amount.</p><p></p><p>There were a few escapees barely clinging to life, their legs having been cut off by Xu Zishuai, only the upper bodies crawling.</p><p></p><p>After a short rest to recover some strength, Liang Qu hurriedly went up to finish them off, using the long spear to pierce their necks.</p><p></p><p>【Mountain Demon Extermination Progress: 21】</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu heard Hu Qi say that Senior Brother Xu's weapon talent was the best among the group of brothers, not just swords, but also knives, spears, and sticks, and he was encouraged to go ask him for guidance. Now he saw it was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Zishuai in his pristine white clothes, he couldn't help but wonder when he would also be able to be like that.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's see if there are any stragglers around, Black Teeth, it's your turn."</p><p></p><p>The group surrounded the Fahua Temple and began searching the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Black Teeth did not disappoint, almost every now and then there was a discovery, Hu Qi would shoot down the mountain demons, and Liang Qu would rush up to finish them off with the spear.</p><p></p><p>They searched all night until dawn, by which time Liang Qu could no longer even stab the finishing blows, but Black Teeth was still full of energy, leading him to a shrub-covered cave entrance and barking frantically, then continuously sneezing.</p><p></p><p>The cave entrance obviously had something interfering with Black Teeth's sense of smell, causing it to only find this cave now.</p><p></p><p>"He's a cautious person, cover your mouth and nose, don't breathe randomly."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang was still the first to enter the underground passage.</p><p></p><p>Following the passage, they finally arrived in a long, narrow cave.</p><p></p><p>There were many soil pits in the cave, some with mountain demons the size of toddlers lying in them, all of which were pierced through by Liang Qu and dealt with.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai folded his arms: "So this is where they raise the mountain demons? They sure know how to choose a location."</p><p></p><p>The Fahua Temple had been abandoned for a long time, because it was in the mountains, there were few beggars coming, and it was sparsely populated.</p><p></p><p>This place was also sufficiently hidden, and close to Pingyang Town, which could be said to be the perfect location.</p><p></p><p>At the end, there was a corpse lying on the ground, and there was a hole above the cave, climbing up would lead to the Guanyin Hall.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi examined the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"The heart was pierced by a single blow, the time of death was no more than three hours ago."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu frowned: "Was someone watching us kill the mountain demons?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang asked, "Black Teeth, can you smell the scent of that person?"</p><p></p><p>Black Teeth returned to the cave entrance, sniffing hard, moving slowly, the search extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until they reached a small river that the group waded across, hoping to let Black Teeth pick up the scent again.</p><p></p><p>But Black Teeth's nose had been ravaged all night, and the escapee had methods to wash away the scent by crossing the river, no matter what they did, the trail was lost.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

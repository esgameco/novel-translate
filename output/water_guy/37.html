        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Passing through the corridor, the light became brighter.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around the environment and found it quite nice.</p><p></p><p>The environment was tranquil, with potted plants lining the sides. It was a quadrangle-style courtyard, with a small square of gray stone bricks in the middle, and small houses on the east, west, south and north sides. Some of the houses had their doors open, revealing dormitory-style bunk beds inside.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changlong and Hu Qi did not bring the three of them to live in those houses, but instead passed through the corridor on the southeast side, arriving at another large courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This courtyard was even better than the previous one, with a large house on all four sides.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changlong took out a key and opened the door. There was no musty smell inside, and it was very clean, with the bedding neatly folded, indicating that someone had specially tidied it up.</p><p></p><p>The room was not bunk beds or an open dormitory, but rather similar to a hotel, with individual double beds, except that there were four beds, each separated by a simple screen.</p><p></p><p>"This is the ancient version of a hotel? It's not bad at all," Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo looked around in amazement, having never seen such an environment before. "Strange, this is not the 10 taels food and lodging environment, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi explained, "The front area is the 10 taels lodging environment, where an entire courtyard can accommodate about 30 people. This courtyard requires extra payment, costing 8 taels per month just for the lodging."</p><p></p><p>"8 taels!" The three country bumpkins from Yixing were all shocked, as the lodging cost was even higher than their tuition fees.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi turned to Xiang Changlong and said, "Elder Brother Xiang, I'll go and fetch our things first. You can take the three junior brothers to get familiar with the environment."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>After Hu Qi left, Xiang Changlong said, "This room is unoccupied, you can discuss among yourselves which bed you want to sleep on. There will be someone responsible for cleaning every day, so it's all clean."</p><p></p><p>"Then I want the one closest to the wall," Liang Qu pointed to the bed closest to the wall, as he preferred sleeping near the wall for a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiezhang pointed to the one next to Liang Qu and said, "Then I'll take this one."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo scratched his head and said, "I snore when I sleep, so I'll take the first one, a bit further away from you."</p><p></p><p>"There are no basic supplies in the room, such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, or long clothes, so you'll need to bring your own. As for washing clothes, there are maids available every day, you just need to give them your clothes."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo casually said, "No need, Elder Brother Xiang. Since it's just for one night, and we're all rough men, it doesn't matter if we don't wash once."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changlong smiled and asked, "You're not going to stay here in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"How can we afford it? 8 taels per month, that's going to cost us our lives!" Liang Qu and Chen Jiezhang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the two of you junior brothers may be fine, but Liang Junior Brother, why are you nodding as well?" Xiang Changlong laughed heartily. "You don't need to worry, for the next two months or so, not only Liang Junior Brother, but Li Junior Brother and Chen Junior Brother can all stay here without paying."</p><p></p><p>"Without paying?" Li Libo and Chen Jiezhang exclaimed in unison, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Of course. Didn't you hear that Master Yang just expelled Luting Cai and the others?"</p><p></p><p>"What does that have to do with us?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's related. Since they were expelled, the silver they had paid cannot be returned. Master Yang doesn't want to take this money, as he doesn't accept unearned income. </p><p></p><p>So for ordinary offenses, this money is used to buy rice and vegetables to make porridge. But for serious offenses like today, the money is used to compensate the victims.</p><p></p><p>Although most of those seven people were in the 10 taels range, Xue Dingyi was in the 50 taels range. Liang Junior Brother, as a direct disciple, you don't need this, so it will be distributed to you. Deducting the one month's expenses they had already used, each of you will get around 36 taels."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fifty-tael counter is beyond your reach, but the twenty-tael one is within your means. After deducting the cost of food and lodging from the twenty taels, the remaining sixteen taels should be enough for you to live on until your departure, and you may even have some left over.</p><p></p><p>Oh, if you don't want to upgrade the counter, I can also convert it to silver for you as compensation.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six taels of compensation! Li Libo and Chen Jiechangexchanged a glance and swallowed hard. Thirty-six taels, if taken back, could significantly improve their family's standard of living! But the two recalled their conversation with Xiangshang and Liangqu about the law and medicine.</p><p></p><p>Without the opportunity, they would most likely fail to break through within three months, and Xiangshang and Liangqu had not disturbed the two in their decision-making.</p><p></p><p>After an arduous inner struggle, Li Liboand Chen Jiechangdecided to stay.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-six taels is a windfall, and we two want to give it a try. If we succeed, we can naturally earn more money. Even if we don't, it won't be a regret, we'll just treat it as if we never received it."</p><p></p><p>"Good! A martial artist must have an indomitable spirit!"</p><p></p><p>At the door, Hu Qi spoke up, and they saw him carrying three stacked wooden tubs, each about four feet tall!</p><p></p><p>Behind him, several people were carrying large basins filled with hot water, steam billowing in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>After Hu Qi put down the wooden tubs, the others discovered that inside were three sets of clothes and three small buckets filled with medicinal liquid, steaming with heat.</p><p></p><p>The people who followed Hu Qi began mixing the medicinal liquid with the hot water and pouring it into the three large bathtubs he had brought.</p><p></p><p>The three men watched curiously: "Is this a medicinal bath?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi nodded: "Yes, but it's not a tonic bath to nourish the blood and qi. It's for you to use to treat your injuries. It can activate the blood and disperse stasis. If you take it twice, your injuries should heal in two or three days.</p><p></p><p>There are also clean clothes for you to change into, they may not fit perfectly, but please bear with it. Consider it my personal compensation, after all, it's because of me that you encountered this incident. If I had been there, they would not have dared to be so outrageous."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Hu, you don't need to say that, we've always remembered your kindness in our hearts."</p><p></p><p>Liangqu and the others were deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>But Li Libonoticed something unusual: "Brother Xiang, you just said that Xue Dingyi's counter is fifty taels?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, his family is a wealthy merchant, of course they can afford that price. What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Tingcai and the others have a ten-tael counter, so their family doesn't seem very wealthy either. It's understandable that they came to extort us, but why did Xue Dingyi come too? If he can afford fifty taels, his family isn't short of two taels, right?"</p><p></p><p>The others also couldn't figure it out for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe... some people are just born bad?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, they could only reach this conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's getting late and the weather is cold. The water will get cold and uncomfortable. Let me have someone bring more hot water. You three soak in the medicinal bath and get some rest early. Just wipe dry, no need to rinse thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Hu, Brother Xiang!"</p><p></p><p>The two senior brothers left, and the room quickly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The three men exchanged glances, speechless.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the room was filled with hearty laughter, almost shaking the tiles on the roof.</p><p></p><p>They laughed until they were breathless and their wounds ached, then they stopped and simultaneously stripped off their clothes and jumped into the wooden tubs.</p><p></p><p>The sound of water splashing.</p><p></p><p>The hot water stung their wounds, causing more intense pain, but this discomfort was soon dispersed by the soothing comfort of the warm water.</p><p></p><p>The three men soaked in the water, their heads resting on the tub edges, the comfortable sensation radiating from their tailbones to their throats, eliciting a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh~~~~"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

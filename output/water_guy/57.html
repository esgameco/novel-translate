        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd was having trouble digesting the scene, and many expressed that they were stuffed from the "melon" (i.e., the juicy gossip).</p><p></p><p>The scene unfolding before their eyes was truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>The old master in brocade and satin robes was making his own biological son - or at least, he should be the biological son, right? - kneel at the doorstep, submitting to beatings and punishment. The old master himself was holding a thorny branch, bent over and refusing to straighten up.</p><p></p><p>Was this a new play being rehearsed by the neighboring theater troupe? Or was Liang Qu a prince who had been lost among the common people, and now his former enemies were kneeling to beg for forgiveness as he was about to ascend the throne? This was the kind of plot one would hear in storytelling performances.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi was on the verge of tears, his nose running, and he tried to reach out, but Liang Qu quickly retreated and shook him off. Xue Dingyi, knowing he was despised, did not dare embrace Liang Qu again, but instead kowtowed frantically, causing the nearby fishermen to feel pity for him.</p><p></p><p>"Ashuai, what did he do exactly?" </p><p>"Yes, yes, let us know the reason."</p><p></p><p>The onlookers did not dare to ask the old master in brocade robes, but since they had watched Liang Qu grow up from a young age, they did not have as much fear, and started voicing their curiosity, scratching their heads trying to figure out the reason.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the commotion, Xue Chengquan turned to face the villagers and explained the situation in the martial arts school. However, he omitted certain details, such as the fact that the two fellow villagers had been beaten, and he also glossed over the fact that Liang Qu had been accepted as Yang Dongxiong's personal disciple afterwards.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the onlooking crowd simply assumed that Xue Dingyi had been spoiled and became violent, offending Liang Qu, who was a disciple of Yang Dongxiong. Xue Chengquan had brought his son to apologize and kowtow.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu vaguely understood why Xue Chengquan had explained it this way - to elevate his status. It made it seem like Liang Qu had been accepted as a disciple because of his exceptional talent, rather than for any other reason. People often preferred to be praised for their innate gifts rather than their hard work or good luck, as the former was a rarer attribute that could better showcase their extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>If Xue Chengquan had provided the full details, he was worried the villagers would think Liang Qu had just gotten lucky, as without the confrontation, Liang Qu might not have been noticed and accepted as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was stunned and disbelieving. What? Liang Qu, Liang Ashuai, had become the personal disciple of Master Yang? Liang Guangtian's wife pinched her husband's arm urgently, exclaiming, "Husband, did you hear that?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian, wincing in pain, shook her off, "Yes, I heard, I heard. Why are you pinching me?"</p><p></p><p>"This personal disciple thing, can he earn a lot of money?"</p><p></p><p>"How would I know? What's the difference between being a personal disciple or just a regular disciple? Isn't it just paying tuition to learn martial arts at the school?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian did not see the significance, but there were others who understood, and they immediately mocked him.</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian turned angrily, "Why is it you again?"</p><p></p><p>The mocker was the same villager who had previously ridiculed Liang Guangtian for having money to drink but not to borrow grain. The two were now squeezed together in the crowd, and encountered each other again.</p><p></p><p>"I see you are like a reed on the wall - top-heavy and shallow-rooted. You're like a bamboo shoot in the mountains - sharp-mouthed but hollow inside. The difference between being a personal disciple and a regular disciple is huge! To become a personal disciple, you have to kowtow and formally accept the master as your teacher. It's like being half a son and half a father. And Ashuai is going to Yang's martial arts school, where Master Yang is so respected that even the county magistrate has to greet him!"</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate has to greet him!?</p><p></p><p>Liang's wife and Liang Guangtian were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by the crowd, Liang Qu suddenly felt a bit weary. Since the other party was behaving in such a manner, he could not possibly twist Xue Dingyi's head off in public, nor would it serve any purpose to whip him with a branch again. He waved his hand and said, "Forget it, the matter is settled."</p><p></p><p>The kowtowing Xue Dingyi was overjoyed, kowtowing to the ground, "Liang..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you are so magnanimous, please spare my life. Thank you, Mr. Liang! Thank you, Mr. Liang!" Liang Qu rolled his eyes and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan stepped forward to block Liang Qu, startling Xue Dingyi so much that his eyes were about to pop out.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, am I not your son anymore? The victim has already forgiven me, do you really want to drive me to death? But it turned out that things were not as Xue Dingyi had imagined. Xue Chengquan cupped his hands and said, "Young Master Liang, you are so magnanimous, but I cannot be ungrateful. As an unfilial son who has committed such an unforgivable act, I am ashamed of my poor upbringing.</p><p></p><p>I see that Young Master Liang lives in a humble abode, yet you have lofty aspirations. If the house could be a little more tidy and organized, it would certainly be more comfortable. How about I help renovate the house for Young Master Liang?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan had originally intended to pay compensation, and he had even brought a hundred taels of silver with the servant. But when he saw the house, his idea changed immediately.</p><p></p><p>Giving a hundred taels of silver would make him forget it all once the money was spent. </p><p></p><p>But using the money to renovate the house, Liang Qu would be able to live in it and surely remember him often.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was quite tempted when he heard this. This adobe house he was living in was indeed uncomfortable, with mud on the floor, getting muddy when it rained, and a bit drafty.</p><p></p><p>But the renovation would take a few months at least. After some consideration, Liang Qu still refused. Compared to the benefits he could get, it was really too inconvenient. After all, he only slept on one bed, and if he really wanted to sleep better, he could stay at the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan was greatly disappointed. Just as he was about to settle for the next best thing and take out the hundred taels of silver...</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu said, "If you really want to do something, in a few days our village will have a River God Festival. Aside from the share the wealthy households will contribute, each young and able-bodied person needs to pay a hundred copper coins.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Xue, if you are willing, you can help make up this part, so the villagers can save the money and have a good New Year. You can also set up a porridge stall for a few days, as there have been more and more beggars in the village lately."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had only recently realized that this world had both the solar and lunar calendars coexisting, with the lunar calendar guiding agricultural activities and the solar calendar determining holidays. He had heard that it was the work of the Astronomical Bureau, with some special purpose, so this year's Spring Festival had not yet arrived.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan showing up was just perfect, and Liang Qu didn't mind taking advantage of his generosity. Maybe he could even become a respected figure in the village in the future.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Liang Qu knew that Xue Chengquan had also prepared a hundred taels of silver, his thoughts might have been different.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan was overjoyed to hear this. As long as it could leave an impression on Liang Qu, it would be worth it!</p><p></p><p>Besides, a hundred coins for a young man, that's just a few tens of taels. Adding the porridge stall, it wouldn't even cost eighty taels, and it would be a bargain.</p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd was also excited. They had just come to watch the show, but now they could benefit from it too.</p><p></p><p>A hundred coins, that's enough for a few more meat dishes on the New Year's table and a bottle of wine!</p><p></p><p>A few quick-witted half-grown children broke out of the crowd and looked at Xue Chengquan: "Master, Master, let us go tell everyone!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan laughed and took copper coins from his pocket to distribute them one by one: "Please go tell everyone that the money for the River God Festival, except for the share from the wealthy households, the rest of you don't need to contribute anymore. It's on me, no, I mean on Young Master Liang!"</p><p></p><p>Delighted to receive the reward, the children happily ran into the streets to spread the news.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Liang has become a disciple of the martial arts school master!"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Liang is going to pay for the River God Festival for everyone!"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Liang is going to set up a porridge stall to feed the people, so no one will have to go hungry!"</p><p></p><p>Passersby who didn't understand what was going on stopped one of the children and asked, "Which Young Master Liang?"</p><p></p><p>"It's Liang Qu, Liang Qu the Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

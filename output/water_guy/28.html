        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The five fingers suddenly clenched tightly, but there was no information transmitted from the sensing circle about the crab monster's eyeball being crushed.</p><p></p><p>However, the crab monster's two claws suddenly flailed wildly, sending shards of rock flying in all directions, and the entire seabed became turbid.</p><p></p><p>Its eyeball had not been burst by the water flow, but it felt intense pain.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu jumped away again to avoid the attack range, and he glimpsed the fat catfish chasing after the crab monster.</p><p></p><p>A good opportunity! As the crab monster was in pain and in a frenzy, the fat catfish swam right next to it, opened its large mouth, and swallowed it along with the mud and water, viciously biting one of the crab monster's compound eyes.</p><p></p><p>The eyestalk was torn off by the fat catfish, exposing the pink flesh and nerves. </p><p></p><p>Fresh blood flowed out of the empty eye socket, and the even more intense agony almost drove the crab monster insane. The eye that had protruded out of its body with the eyestalk was almost its greatest weakness.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the crab monster's two eyes were too far apart, and even the fat catfish's large mouth could not swallow them whole.</p><p></p><p>After getting what it wanted, the fat catfish quickly fled, barely avoiding the swinging giant claws, and then swam away with all its might.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster immediately went into a frenzy. An ordinary person who looked at it would be overcome by irresistible fear. It no longer cared about Liang Qu beside it and charged directly after the fat catfish, causing all the surrounding rocks to shatter, and the entire seabed seemed to be trembling.</p><p></p><p>The scene became chaotic. No one had expected the crab monster to be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's heart was pounding frantically, but looking at the fleeing Afei, he had no hesitation. He directed the water flow fully onto the spear, and his entire body muscles trembled like water waves, the muscles tightening like iron wires before bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>He rushed out, like a monkey leaping down from an ancient tree, and stabbed with all his strength towards the crab monster's limb joints.</p><p></p><p>The sharp and hard flint easily pierced through the joint membrane, and with a twist and a pull, the entire crab leg joint was broken open.</p><p></p><p>The running crab monster stumbled, suddenly realizing that one of its legs stuck in the mud was no longer under its control and was easily broken by the inertia.</p><p></p><p>With only six limbs, the crab monster's balance was greatly affected, and its pursuit of the fat catfish slowed down significantly.</p><p></p><p>Numerous bubbles erupted from the crab monster's mouth, and the successive torments had strongly stimulated its nerves. It no longer cared about the catfish and turned back to attack Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>The giant claws swung, almost coming straight at him. If he was caught in the middle, he would be torn in half! Liang Qu was terrified, his left leg muscles tightened, and his left foot tried to step on the scattered rocks to dodge, but it stepped into the mud instead! The moment his foot sank into the mud, Liang Qu's heart almost jumped out of his chest, his adrenaline surging, and cold sweat pouring out. Caught off guard, he could only raise the spear to block again, using all his strength to manipulate the water flow to push himself sideways.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the giant claw came from the upper left, far less easy to deflect than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The spear broke in two on the spot, but the momentum of the giant claw did not diminish. Fortunately, the pushing force of the water flow finally took effect, moving Liang Qu a few feet away, and the claw just grazed his waist.</p><p></p><p>Mud was stirred up everywhere, the ruptured pig bladder-like air bubbles rapidly floating upward.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu choked on a mouthful of water, his waist and abdomen burning with pain, as if a layer of skin and flesh had been scraped off, but he dared not linger, closing his mouth and swimming away again.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The catfish frantically fled, grabbing onto the rocks and desperately escaping. On the other side, the crab monster quickly turned around and began chasing with all its might, stepping on the scattered rocks and rushing through the water.</p><p></p><p>As the crab monster chased, it reached a critical point where the mud and sand suddenly collapsed, and the long-buried pig dragon opened its massive jaws, viciously biting down on one of the crab monster's limbs. The pig dragon's powerful bite easily pierced through the limb membrane, and it furiously spun and tore, directly biting off one of the crab monster's legs.</p><p></p><p>With two of its six limbs lost, the crab monster was enraged beyond control. It swung its mighty claws, ready to crush the immobilized prey into a bloody pulp. But at that moment, its vision went completely dark - one of its eyes had disappeared! The returning catfish quickly seized the opportunity and swallowed the crab monster's other eye, then swiftly retreated, leaving the slow-moving pig dragon behind.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster could not make a sound, but the large bubbles coming from its mouth indicated it was in excruciating pain. The one person and two beasts avoided the rampaging crab monster and regrouped.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the chaos continued at the Yang family martial arts school. Three people accompanying Lu Tingcai rushed in with wooden sticks, attacking Li Libow and Chen Jiechangs. Chen Jiechan pulled Li Libow aside to dodge one strike, but couldn't escape the remaining attacks, the wooden sticks striking their bodies, threatening to break their bones.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechan, being older and more composed than Li Libow, had been suppressing a mix of inferiority and helplessness. But as the blows rained down, the humiliation ignited a raging fury within him. He gritted his teeth, grabbed hold of a stick as it fell, and charged forward with all his might, slamming into Xue Dingyi.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi was caught off guard and the two tumbled to the ground, grappling. The remaining two tried to intervene, but Li Libow seized the chance to tackle one, and the other was kicked in the leg, also joining the chaotic brawl.</p><p></p><p>None of the five had any real martial arts skills - they were just enraged fighters, no different from street thugs. They rolled around, clawing, kicking, biting, using elbows and knees, relying only on sheer ferocity and pain tolerance.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi's elbow struck Chen Jiechan's eye, splitting the skin. Chen Jiechan's hand clamped down on Xue Dingyi's throat, his nails nearly tearing the skin, leaving raised bloody marks. Behind him, someone was frantically swinging their fists, hitting his head and face, but he paid no heed. The best way to win a group fight is to focus on pummeling one person until they're bedridden for a month. Chen Jiechan was determined to beat Xue Dingyi and Lu Tingcai to the brink.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

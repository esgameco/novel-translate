        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Inside the main hall, Liang Qu sat at the top right, his upper body exposed, the bloody wounds shocking to the eye.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, the doctor held a mortar, extracting juice from crushed grass stems to prevent the wound from festering.</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhao'an sat at the top left, his hands crossed and resting on his cane.</p><p></p><p>The group of village elders, some sitting, some standing, were all uneasy, occasionally glancing at the gruesome wound, feeling the pain.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the moans of the injured villagers in the hall, the entire place was oppressively silent.</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhao'an swept his gaze around, fixing his eyes on the elder sitting below him to his left. The elder understood the hint, stood up, and looked at Liang Qu, repeating the previous question.</p><p></p><p>"This mountain demon is not the same as the big mountain demon from Pingyang Town, nor is it one of its offspring."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu gave a definitive conclusion.</p><p></p><p>The doctor's hand trembled slightly while grinding the medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>The calm dialogue had a sense of lancing a wound.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean there are other mountain demons?"</p><p></p><p>"If one is so terrifying, having two more, we were lucky that Ashui was here today. Otherwise, it would have been a disaster."</p><p></p><p>"How did they come all the way to Yixing City? We are a full sixteen li from Pingyang Town, it takes a person an hour to walk that distance."</p><p></p><p>The village elders looked at each other, their hearts filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>They had indeed encountered the mountain demons face-to-face, those vertically slit eyes the color of pus, more terrifying than a fierce tiger. Many elders had even dropped their canes, curing their long-standing rheumatism on the spot out of sheer fright.</p><p></p><p>They had thought the disaster would be confined to Pingyang Town, and Yixing City need not worry much. Little did they know that even this far away was not safe.</p><p></p><p>But the facts were as such, and Liang Qu believed in his own judgment.</p><p></p><p>The young mountain demon was not much larger than a human infant. To grow to nearly a person's height would take at least three months.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shaohui had been dead for less than half a month, so it could not have been the young mountain demon just hatched from Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>Nor could it have been the big mountain demon that killed Luo Shaohui.</p><p></p><p>The big mountain demon's strength was clearly higher than Luo Shaohui's, and there were not many signs of a fierce battle at the scene, indicating it could easily crush a Second-class Warrior.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, even a dozen Liang Qus would not be enough for it to kill, let alone be knocked away by the stone ball from the stone lion's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Everyone turned to look at the highest-ranking Chen Zhao'an. Chen Zhao'an naturally understood what the others meant, and he spoke up: "Ashui, could those other two mountain demons also be in Yixing City? And why did they appear precisely on the day of the sacrifice, could it be the River God's doing?"</p><p></p><p>The doctor quietly perked up his ears as he applied the medicinal herbs to Liang Qu's shoulder, his hands trembling slightly without him realizing it.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Liang Qu denied it decisively. "Mountain demons are land spirits, and if there were any to be managed, it would be under the Mountain God's jurisdiction. If it were the River God, the ones sent should be water monsters, or at the very least, a great flood or heavy rain to drown Yixing City. How could they send a mountain spirit demon? Moreover, didn't we just offer the mountain demons' heads in sacrifice? If it were the River God's will, how could there be no sign of it?"</p><p></p><p>The other village elders felt Liang Qu's words made sense and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>It was good that it was not the River God's wrath.</p><p></p><p>They relied on the mountains for sustenance, and the rivers for water. If the River God were angered, it would be far more terrifying than the mountain demons, forcing thousands of people to leave their homes.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu slightly raised his shoulder, the medicinal juice stinging his wound and causing him to take a deep breath before continuing, "As for how the mountain demons came, I suspect it's because of today's animal sacrifice. With so many people gathered together, the strong scent of blood and human aura must have attracted the spirits."</p><p></p><p>Mountain demons, when young, feed on livestock, and they enjoy human organs.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon he had killed was of strength between the young and the adult, not just hatched, but not yet fully grown.</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial blood combined with the human presence would be the best bait.</p><p></p><p>"As for whether there are other mountain demons in Yixing City, I can't say for sure. Perhaps there are, perhaps not. But in all my years, the records of spirits killing people are not that many. For three to suddenly appear at once, I suspect there may be something supernatural at work."</p><p></p><p>The rolled-up bandage fell to the ground, and the doctor hurriedly picked it up, too preoccupied to continue the dressing, urgently asking, "Something supernatural?"</p><p></p><p>One of the village elders anxiously paced back and forth, "Yes, there must be something supernatural. If there were no supernatural forces, how could so many spirits suddenly appear for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In the past, we've only heard that some families who went into the mountains or crossed the river have disappeared. How could it be so reckless today?" </p><p></p><p>Turning around, he reached out and grasped Liang Qu's small arm: "Ashui, you grew up in Yixing. You can't be like those ungrateful people who forget their fellow villagers after gaining some abilities."</p><p></p><p>Clearing his throat, Chen Zhao'an stared at the speaking elder.</p><p></p><p>The elder felt he had said the wrong thing but was unaware of where the mistake was, so he shrank back in silence. Even among the elders, there were different ranks.</p><p></p><p>The other elders hurriedly stood up to make amends.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if it weren't for you today, we don't know how many people would have died."</p><p></p><p>"Ashui has already broken through to become a true martial artist, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just the day before yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, not like my good-for-nothing unfilial son. Yixing has produced such a talented person."</p><p></p><p>No wonder.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo and Chen Jiechangon the side of the hall were amazed, feeling that Liang Qu's talent was extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>He was still able to help today, but what about the future? They feared he would gradually drift away, a sense of gloom in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhao'an raised his hand, asking everyone to calm down, and solemnly said, "We won't let you work for nothing. For today's matter, you saved our lives. Each of the elders here will contribute ten taels of silver, though it's not much, it represents our sincerity."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we must contribute money."</p><p>"Good, I'll be the first to contribute!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone present had witnessed the battle with the mountain demon. That demon had claws sharper than steel knives, able to shatter stone slabs with a casual swing, its thick hide was formidable, and even blades couldn't cut through it - it was beyond the abilities of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's ability to fight and defeat such a monster was truly astonishing. </p><p></p><p>Although Li Libo and Chen Jiechangon had helped during the process, everyone present was not stupid and could see who was the key figure.</p><p></p><p>Yixing City was not without other martial artists, but those with real potential had all moved away, leaving only those without any remarkable achievements, unwilling to part with the industries in Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>Just like the elder who owned this manor, his several descendants studied and trained in martial arts but none of them had accomplished anything, excelling only in eating, drinking, and leisure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the only one they could rely on was Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the expectant gazes of the crowd, Liang Qu was quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>There were seven or eight elders present, each contributing ten taels, so it would be close to a hundred taels of silver, which was certainly tempting to him. But the issue now was not about the money, but whether he was capable or not.</p><p></p><p>Today's battle was already very perilous, and without Awei's poison and the help of Achan and Apo, there was no guarantee of success next time.</p><p></p><p>However, just because he couldn't handle it didn't mean others couldn't either.</p><p></p><p>"Respected elders, I was quite lucky this time, and the mountain demon's strength was average. If it had been the one from Pinyang Town, I would certainly have no chance of victory."</p><p></p><p>The elders' spirits sank, but Liang Qu quickly continued.</p><p></p><p>"However, my senior martial brothers are true masters, with extraordinary abilities. They must be able to handle it. Furthermore, this matter is suspicious, and I need to go to Pinyang Town to find my master. He is experienced and knowledgeable, perhaps he knows what's going on."</p><p></p><p>The elders were relieved and praised him.</p><p></p><p>"When do you plan to set out?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to waste, I'll leave immediately."</p><p></p><p>Wrapping the cloth around himself, Liang Qu stood up to get dressed.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, hurry and prepare the horse."</p><p></p><p>"No need for a horse, the land route is unsafe. I'll go by water, just have Chen Jiechangon accompany me. Where are the clothes I changed out of?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhao'an had someone bring the washed cloak and robe: "The clothes you changed out of are all here, just not yet fully dry. Your clothes are truly extraordinary, with so much blood, but they became clean after being soaked in water."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Chen."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the clothes, no longer hesitating, and went out to jump down from the dock. Chen Jiechangon followed closely behind, taking up the oar to row the boat.</p><p></p><p>The covered boat set off towards Pinyang Town along the river.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

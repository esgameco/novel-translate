        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's this? </p><p></p><p>Eighty coins just like that? A day's work for a fisherman? Liang Qu's expression was exhilarated. To obtain eighty coins so simply was truly irresistible.</p><p></p><p>However, it was indeed tiring. Controlling the thirty-pound force of the water flow was like running a thousand meters, and his stomach started rumbling again.</p><p></p><p>After fusing with the Marsh Spirit, his physical fitness had improved slightly, but his foundation was still too weak, and he remained frail.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the still of the night, Liang Qu decided to rest for a while and try again.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Chen's eighty coins were hard-earned because he had children and elderly to support at home. Liang Qu had no such burdens, so this income was definitely not little. Let's see if he can double his earnings tonight.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Liang Qu entered the water again.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his natural talent as a "water monkey", his physical consumption in the water was extremely low. He swam a hundred meters, which was almost equivalent to the effort of walking two or three hundred meters on land. His breath-holding time also extended to nearly seven minutes, which was not stagnation, but seven minutes of movement, which could be called extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it seemed that his luck in catching yellow fish had run out. He changed his breath several times, wandering for nearly half an hour, and only saw a spotted fish worth about a hundred coins in the middle.</p><p></p><p>The spotted fish was not as valuable as the yellow fish, but it was worth a hundred coins because it was large enough, weighing about ten catties.</p><p></p><p>One catty of fish requires ten catties of strength. A large fish of ten catties could suddenly unleash nearly a hundred catties of force.</p><p></p><p>In Liang Qu's current state, with only thirty catties of water control ability, dealing with it was quite difficult, and he could only watch helplessly as the fish swam away.</p><p></p><p>"It seems next time I can bring a long spear, so I can deal with the larger fish. But the price of dead fish is not as high as live fish, and I don't have a fishing net either."</p><p></p><p>As Liang Qu was thinking in the water, he unknowingly swam far away and came to a shallower seabed, which was still about ten meters deep.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, there are lotus roots?"</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the seabed, Liang Qu's senses suddenly detected the presence of plant stems. Upon closer inspection, he found that they were actually lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>Lotus roots growing at a depth of more than ten meters? Liang Qu was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Whether floating, emergent, or submerged plants, their growth cannot be separated from photosynthesis and respiration. The deeper the water, the less favorable these two processes are.</p><p></p><p>Lotus roots belong to plants that require relatively high light and respiration. As far as Liang Qu knew, lotus roots generally cannot survive in water deeper than two meters.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the abnormal growth environment of the lotus roots, Liang Qu became excited.</p><p></p><p>Plants cannot be separated from photosynthesis and respiration, but that is for ordinary plants. For some precious plants, it is naturally not the case.</p><p></p><p>This world has extraordinary powers! The lotus roots growing at such a depth must be extraordinary. He had heard that in the neighboring town, Old Mr. Zhao had a cold spring pond dozens of meters deep, with horned water chestnuts growing at the bottom, which could prolong life and attract two warriors, though he didn't know if it was true.</p><p></p><p>And now he has encountered something similar?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu immediately followed the growth path of the lotus roots, and upon inspection, found that these lotus roots were indeed not small, extending for tens of meters without finding the end. Just as he was about to continue swimming, a large, blurry object suddenly appeared in his perception.</p><p></p><p>What is that? So big! Liang Qu quickly stopped and pulled back.</p><p></p><p>The other party did not react, as if it had not detected him?</p><p></p><p>Faced with the potentially precious lotus roots, Liang Qu hesitated for a moment, not choosing to leave, but carefully circling and conducting underwater perception.</p><p></p><p>The other party was lurking in the silt, very long, about two meters, but not a fish, with four limbs and a very long tail. The outline was blurry at a distance of three meters, but the image was too vivid, and Liang Qu's brows raised slightly.</p><p></p><p>It's a crocodile!</p><p></p><p>Crocodile is the common name, in plain language it is a crocodile. But the crocodile is a general term used by fishermen for all crocodiles, and there are more than one species of crocodile in the Jianghuai River, Liang Qu didn't know what species was buried in the silt.</p><p></p><p>The most common one in the surrounding area should be the Taohua crocodile, right?</p><p></p><p>The original body had seen the Taohua crocodile, and Liang Qu felt it was similar to the Yangtze crocodile of the past life, not very large, only about two meters long and over thirty kilograms when adult.</p><p></p><p>This size is not much of a threat to adults, the weight is the fatal injury, but that is on land. Now it is underwater, and Liang Qu is just a malnourished teenager, the weight difference is not that much.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, "this Taohua crocodile is lying next to the lotus roots, could it be that it knows these lotus roots are beneficial to it?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu carefully perceived and found that there were indeed signs of disturbance in the silt, exposing a few sections of lotus roots that had been gnawed on.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Taking away the lotus root, the huge crocodile that lies across here will definitely not agree, as the other party has obviously made a nest here.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's not impossible to try?</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Liang Qu felt that it was not an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he was blinded by greed, in his previous life he liked to watch a streamer named Bi Fang's wilderness survival, and had a certain understanding of many living beings, knowing that crocodiles have a fatal weakness, which is that their bite force is extremely strong, but their tension is extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>An adult can grasp the snout of a crocodile with one hand, and it will not be able to open its mouth, and its violent combat power will be wasted by more than half.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the biological world, only humans can accurately grasp objects, even monkeys can't do it precisely because of their short thumbs, which makes crocodiles invincible in nature.</p><p></p><p>As for the "small" crocodile in front of him, Liang Qu's water control ability is enough to suppress it, and with the weight advantage, it won't be able to roll around even if it dies.</p><p></p><p>It's the end of October now, and the water is quite cold, for cold-blooded animals, their movements will be much slower than in summer, maybe this crocodile is just too sluggish to notice that there is a living being approaching.</p><p></p><p>The time, place, and people are all favorable, and it would be a shame to remain indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"If I could control it, that would be great, such a big one, I can have it catch fish for me regularly, and I don't have to go into the water to catch fish myself, it's too troublesome, and I don't really want to be a fisherman."</p><p></p><p>People always want more, and Liang Qu, who thought he could control the crocodile, had an even bolder idea flash through his mind.</p><p></p><p>As if to respond to his thoughts, a strange rune suddenly lit up on the body of the Zeding cauldron in Liang Qu's mind, the rune resembling the water character in oracle bone script.</p><p></p><p>More information flooded in.</p><p></p><p>Blood Rune: Commanding Aquatic Creatures - Use fresh blood to draw the water character on the body of an aquatic creature, with a chance of becoming the commanding master.</p><p></p><p>Awesome, the Zeding cauldron has this ability? After receiving the information, Liang Qu's eyes lit up, thinking that the Zeding cauldron was really remarkable, and if it was brought out to the outside world, it might be fought over. Now he couldn't let go of the crocodile, as an underling's help would be too great, and the crocodile has four limbs, which is more flexible than other fish.</p><p></p><p>With his mind made up, Liang Qu found a stone with sharp edges on the river bottom, about the size of a human head, and then tried to bring it close to the muddy crocodile, confirming the position of its snout, and then forcefully slammed it down.</p><p></p><p>The river water was controlled and pushed away, assisting in reducing resistance, and the stone broke through the raging current and hit the resting crocodile.</p><p></p><p>As the weather gradually cooled, the crocodile's blood flow slowed down and became sluggish, and it was already slow-witted, let alone being ambushed. The crocodile stood still for a moment, then felt a bursting pain.</p><p></p><p>Opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu rushed forward, he went behind the crocodile, blocking the blind spot, and pressed down on the stone with his arm muscles bulging. With his left hand, he made a cut on the sharp edge, and a few drops of fresh blood dispersed in the water.</p><p></p><p>The scent of blood in the water caused the ferocious crocodile to become enraged, straightening its body and twisting, trying to open its mouth to bite, but before it could open, a stream of water wrapped around its upper and lower jaws.</p><p></p><p>Pressed down by the stone and controlled by the water flow, the crocodile could not open its mouth at all, only able to violently thrash its body, its hard tail whipping the rocks frantically.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's entire body was tense, like a stretched bow, all his muscles were intertwined, his blood vessels bulging, firmly suppressing the crocodile.</p><p></p><p>Sweat flowed away with the water current, after controlling the 20-pound water flow twice, Liang Qu had exhausted a great deal of physical strength, but he dared not rest. With three fingers bleeding, he quickly drew on the crocodile's back.</p><p></p><p>The fresh blood, under the influence of a strange force, congealed and did not disperse, following the fingerprints and imprinting on the scales! The bloody light burst open in the darkness, and the crocodile's pupils suddenly dilated, a savage spiritual force rushing into Liang Qu's mind.</p><p></p><p>If controlling the water flow was a physical exhaustion, then controlling the crocodile was a mental exhaustion, like being forced to do several math tests after pulling an all-nighter, Liang Qu's head throbbed with pain, almost fainting.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, beasts are still beasts, how could they match the intelligence of humans?</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, a peculiar spiritual connection appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The crocodile's dull gaze became lively again, but no longer ferocious, revealing a touch of liveliness.</p><p></p><p>The Zeding cauldron emitted light again.</p><p></p><p>[The giant crocodile has been subdued, and can be evolved.]</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's expression was greatly delighted - it's done! The crocodile? Take it as a pet!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where did you guys get this from?" </p><p></p><p>"The bottom of the water? Floating by itself? You just took it back because it was glowing, right?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had previously taught the two beasts how to identify precious fish - by looking at whether their appearance was different from ordinary fish, with unique and rare colors and shapes.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts had deeply remembered Liang Qu's words. When they saw the glowing feather, they knew it was not a fish, but still felt it was a good thing, so they brought it back.</p><p></p><p>Their reasoning wasn't wrong.</p><p></p><p>The feather was huge, about three feet long and one foot wide.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tried to reach out and touch it, but was driven back by the astonishing heat emanating from the feather. </p><p></p><p>Wow, it's so hot, no wonder A Fei and the other one didn't dare to pick it up and carry it back, it's like handling a hot sweet potato.</p><p></p><p>The gigantic feather, the astonishing heat. </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu immediately thought of the fierce flaming giant bird that had been flying in the sky during the battle between the two demons the previous night.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this feather must have fallen from its body and drifted here, where it was discovered by the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>Good job, Toad Brother, for killing the mighty demon and letting me have some soup.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu used the water flow to wrap up the feather, and after the heat dissipated, he was able to try touching it.</p><p></p><p>The feather quills were as hard as iron, with a cold, hard luster, glowing in the darkness, while the feather vanes were soft and felt great to the touch, it's just that without the water flow to cool it down, it was too hot to touch.</p><p></p><p>What use is a single feather?</p><p></p><p>The beasts have no water essence to absorb, and using it as a warming device would risk setting one's clothes on fire.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu fell into deep thought, unable to figure out how to use it.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, an item from a mighty demon must be precious. He would take it back and let his master and senior brothers take a look, perhaps they would know how to use it.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu praised them: "Well done! From now on, if you see anything unusual that is not a fish, you can bring it back."</p><p></p><p>The two beasts, delighted by the praise, started spinning in the water, stirring up violent currents.</p><p></p><p>After the commotion, Liang Qu surfaced and looked at the sky, noticing it was getting late. He instructed them not to move, to guard the lotus roots, while the catfish should explore the surrounding waters further.</p><p></p><p>Especially the shallow areas, to see if there were any sunken ships, human artifacts, treasures, precious plants, or precious fish. If they could find the same feather, or even a part of that aquatic demon beast, that would be best.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu really wanted to know, how much water essence could be obtained from a part of such a mighty demon's body.</p><p></p><p>Not only the waters around Yixing City, but also the nearby Yunjiang Port and Pingyang Town should be explored.</p><p></p><p>Now that A Fei was quite large in size, as long as he didn't rashly enter deep waters, there wouldn't be too much danger.</p><p></p><p>Dragging the feather, Liang Qu climbed back onto the boat and took a look in the waterproof compartment. In addition to the ordinary fish species, there were two carp, one yellowfish, and one tiger fish, all good fish.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the port, it was already dawn. Liang Qu sold the catch to Lin Songbao.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't seem like much today, just two baskets?" Lin Songbao helped carry the fish baskets to the fish stall, then opened them up in surprise, "Whoa, so many good fish? A yellowfish, two carp, a tiger fish? Did you stumble upon a fish nest?"</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky today."</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, while everyone else is catching less and less in the winter, you're getting more and more." Lin Songbao gave a thumbs up, "In total that's 346 coins, I'll give you 3 silver taels, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao was no fool. Although his father didn't say anything, he knew something amazing must have happened to Liang Qu, which is why the offer was more generous than before - 3 silver taels, which would normally be worth 360 coins.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's convenient that you're here. The restaurant has already booked the private room, number Bing3 at Langxun Pavilion tonight. My father asked me to ask if you need a carriage to pick you up."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu needed to take the feather to show his senior brother, so he shook his head, "No need, I'll be going to the town today as well."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, here's your money, take care."</p><p></p><p>With the money in hand, Liang Qu returned to the boat. He soaked his discarded hemp clothes in cold water and wrapped the feather in them, then headed home. Passing by the fish stall, there were also people selling fish there.</p><p></p><p>"Songbao, can you weigh it again for me? Doesn't seem right, look how big these fish are."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, I just weighed them, it's 53 coins, right? After deducting 45% for the boat rental, it's 30 coins."</p><p></p><p>"This, this is a bit too little, right? Songbao, give me a bit more, a bit more." The tanned middle-aged fisherman smiled widely, subtly lifting his hand, "My son is only 8 years old, still growing, you've seen him, that size, he calls me brother."</p><p></p><p>"Really can't do that, last time I gave you an extra 5 coins, I got scolded by my father when I got back. And you know, the one in Yunjiang Port takes 52%."</p><p></p><p>"Aiya..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the street, Liang Qu listened for a while, and the cold hemp cloth in his hand became hot, so he slowly walked back home.</p><p></p><p>The weather was getting colder and colder, and the water temperature was so low that it was shocking. Putting his hands in the water, they would turn purple in no time.</p><p></p><p>It was too cold, so the metabolism of the fish would slow down, reducing their need for food, and they would gather in the deeper parts of the water, where it was warm enough.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't come out and didn't move, and stayed deep, according to the fishing methods of the fishermen, it was impossible to catch them, and even if caught, they wouldn't sell well, because the water flow was slow, the oxygen content was low, and the material circulation was scarce, so the fish were thin and small. The color of the bluestone slabs was not as deep as two months ago, and it was always like this in the winter, as if all the brilliance of the world had been frozen and shriveled up.</p><p></p><p>In the yellow mud alleys on the sides of the stone road, there were more women with sallow complexions than in the autumn, wrapped in faded old cotton-padded jackets, curled up on the steps, and they would look up whenever the stone slabs creaked.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu saw a girl about his age sitting on the steps and smiling at him, her malnourished face thin and yellow, her dry hair like wild grass, not at all good-looking, and he lowered his head and walked past expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the women in old cotton-padded jackets, there were also many children in the yellow mud alleys, gathered together burning some dry firewood they had picked up, the older ones around thirteen or fourteen years old, with gloomy expressions, and the younger ones only five or six years old, with long clear snot hanging from their noses, playing some finger games together.</p><p></p><p>There were also old women begging on the street.</p><p></p><p>"Whew~"</p><p></p><p>Thick fog poured out from Liang Qu's mouth and nose as he stood there for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu called out, placing the oiled paper package on the ground and turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" a boy walked up, pinching his fingers to open the oiled paper package, exclaiming, "Ah, buns, they're buns! So many buns, more than ten!"</p><p></p><p>"Yay, they're hot buns."</p><p></p><p>"Don't fight, don't fight, there's enough for everyone."</p><p></p><p>"I'll divide them, I'll divide them, little brother, you're the youngest, you can have two."</p><p></p><p>A few alleys away, Liang Qu placed the oiled paper packages one by one and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>Two taels of silver gone.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly became angry, without any target, without any reason, without any purpose, he was just angry.</p><p></p><p>It might be because he was angry at his own excessive kindness, or angry at the shitty world, or angry that those poor wretches were wandering in front of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It felt like there was fire flowing in his veins, and everything around him was cold, only he was hot like a charcoal.</p><p></p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, Liang Qu calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Back home, he threw the almost dried-up hemp cloth wrapped in the big phoenix feather into the frozen water tank, and soon the ice surface was melted, with the cloth and feather submerged in the water.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu set up his stance and began to tan the hide.</p><p></p><p>The day of breaking through was getting closer and closer, almost at the final step.</p><p></p><p>Now, everything Liang Qu possessed could be considered a kind of "relying on others' power", but as long as he became a true martial artist, it would be relying on his own transformation, equivalent to an ordinary person becoming a scholar.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi circulated, suddenly spreading to the four limbs and extremities, flowing towards the outermost skin membrane. After a long time, the reddened skin gradually recovered its normal ruddy color.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu could feel that his body had become a little more resilient, although there was no visible change when touched, but once attacked, a certain deep-level change would occur, becoming extremely tough.</p><p></p><p>The progress in strength made his depressed mood dissipate a lot, and he picked up the pastries he had bought earlier and went to Chen Qingjiang's house.</p><p></p><p>It was two days late, but fortunately the pastries he bought were mostly peach buns, which wouldn't spoil easily in the winter and weren't much different from when he first bought them.</p><p></p><p>He knocked on the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me!"</p><p></p><p>"Sounds like Shui's voice, let me go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Shui? Qingjiang, you'd better thank him properly."</p><p></p><p>"I know, Dad."</p><p></p><p>Voices of conversation came from inside the house.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a small head popped up on the low wall: "Ah, it's Brother Shui!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lifted the wooden box in his hand and shook it a few times: "Shunzi, open the door for me, I've got something delicious for you to eat."</p><p></p><p>"Coming!"</p><p></p><p>Little Shunzi jumped off the stool and came running to the courtyard gate, opening it eagerly. Liang Qu smiled and opened the box, taking out a peach bun and stuffing it into Shunzi's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm, so sweet!"</p><p></p><p>Shunzi stuffed his mouth full, his other hand cupping the fallen crumbs, his face full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang had just reached the doorway and was shocked to see the Five Happiness Bakery logo: "Shui, why are you letting Shunzi eat such precious things? You're wasting it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

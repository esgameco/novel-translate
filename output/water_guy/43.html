        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong (Elder Brother)!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Qi excused himself from the group he was teaching and brought Liang Qu to a quiet room.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet room, there was a wooden cabinet and a low table.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi took out a key and opened the cabinet, retrieving a long, thin incense stick. He lit it and placed it in the incense burner on the low table, quickly filling the room with an indescribably fragrant aroma.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi then took out several booklets from his robe, with the topmost one being a detailed human anatomy book, covering internal organs, blood vessels, and membranes. Underneath were a few yellow papers filled with writing, the contents of which were unknown.</p><p></p><p>"This anatomy book, Shidi (Younger Brother), you can take back and study carefully. The remaining papers are medicinal formulas, specifically the formulas for the Three Fist technique.</p><p></p><p>Master Yang's teachings are not limited to just the Three Fist technique, but the Three Fist technique is excellent for building a solid foundation. Therefore, unless there are special circumstances, we disciples generally practice the Three Fist technique before breaking through the Skin Barrier.</p><p></p><p>Shidi, you are well-suited for the Ape Fist, so you can continue practicing that technique going forward.</p><p></p><p>I know that you, Shidi, and Shidi Li and Chen are from the same hometown and have a good relationship. However, Shidi, you must remember that these medicinal formulas cannot be casually shared.</p><p></p><p>You can prepare the medicines for them to take, and on the back of the formulas, there is another version with many useless and incorrect ingredients. The effect will be around 80%, but you must never reveal the true formulas."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu straightened his upper body and said, "I understand, Shixiong."</p><p></p><p>"I can see that Shidi is not someone who is careless about such matters, but I just wanted to remind you."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi neatly stacked the booklets and placed them on the low table, continuing, "The key to breaking through the Skin Barrier is to stimulate the entire body's fascia and skin with internal energy and qi, achieving the effect of tempering the skin. This qi and blood are the refined essence and foundation of life that you feel in your chest when practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Skin Barrier, your skin will appear no different from an ordinary person's, but it will be as tough as cowhide, greatly enhancing your defense. If you can further activate your qi and blood, you can reach an even higher level."</p><p></p><p>"Then how do I use the internal energy and qi to agitate the entire body's fascia and skin?"</p><p></p><p>"This is not easy to explain, and it's also not easy to do. Let me demonstrate it for you directly, and you'll understand. First, start practicing the Ape Fist."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu followed the instructions.</p><p></p><p>Approximately at the end of the fourth stance and the beginning of the fifth, Hu Qi stepped forward and placed a palm on Liang Qu's chest.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu immediately felt a warm flow of energy from his chest, merging with the qi in his chest and then spreading through his limbs and extremities. When it reached the fascia and skin, it transformed into a hot flow that disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Liang Qu's skin began to heat up. Initially, it was tolerable, but then it became increasingly hot, until it was shockingly hot! Sweat was pouring from his body like a steaming cauldron!</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi said in a deep voice, "Don't let the qi dissipate. The heat is a normal reaction; it's your qi and blood tempering your skin!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu almost cried out in pain, but after hearing Hu Qi's words, he gritted his teeth and endured it.</p><p></p><p>He could feel his skin contracting and tightening with the beating of his heart, until after about fifteen minutes, the scorching sensation gradually subsided, and his skin relaxed again.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember the sensation of guiding the qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Only half of it."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, let's do it again."</p><p></p><p>With the first experience, Liang Qu was much more at ease the second time.</p><p></p><p>However, since his chest qi had been depleted and had not yet fully recovered, the skin sensation was not as intense this time. But Liang Qu was able to better remember how to spread the qi and integrate it into his skin.</p><p></p><p>He was starting to grasp the reason why the qi and blood needed to be as thick as a little finger in order to break through the barrier.</p><p></p><p>"You felt it, right? If the qi and blood are not at a certain level, the effect of skin tempering will be minimal. Instead, the constant consumption of qi and blood will prevent them from growing, causing a deficiency in the body.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when Xueshixiong was at the martial arts hall, he taught a few of you in advance. Some were unwilling to accept failure and left the hall, trying it on their own. As a result, they damaged their bodies. That's why the hall generally won't teach you how to temper the skin unless your qi and blood have reached the required level.</p><p></p><p>Try it one more time and see if you've truly remembered it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded. He closed his eyes, practiced the Ape Fist, and once again activated a trace of qi and blood. Following the sensation Hu Qi had previously transmitted, he instantly dispersed the internal qi and blood and gradually guided them to the fascia and skin.</p><p></p><p>As the blood and qi merged and permeated, Liang Qu's skin became slightly warm, completing one round of skin tempering. He opened his eyes and said, "Thank you, Shixiong. I've remembered it now."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. The incense I just lit is for calming the mind, which will make it easier for you to guide the qi and blood. Without the calming incense, the guidance might be more stagnant.</p><p></p><p>If your nourishment is sufficient, Shidi, you should be able to break through the barrier within twenty days, and then you will truly become a martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Twenty days, that's not too long.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was eager to witness the moment he officially became a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, do you want to continue practicing here, or go back and practice? If you're planning to go back, you can take the calming incense with you."</p><p></p><p>"Third Shixiong asked me to visit his house tonight to look at some drawings, so I'll just practice here. It's too far to go back and forth."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, but let's eat first. It's mealtime."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>They had left the Yang residence around 9 AM, bought some things, and practiced a bit. It was now mealtime, and especially after consuming so much qi, Liang Qu's stomach was growling.</p><p></p><p>As an inner disciple, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The food we eat is different from ordinary apprentices.</p><p></p><p>In the separate small room, on the square table there was a large bowl of braised beef, a large bowl of boiled mutton, a large bowl of steamed vegetables, along with enough white rice, all of which were as big as a washbasin and steaming hot.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was surprised: "We three are going to eat all of this!?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the big deal, Liang Shidi, once you break through the Skin Barrier, you'll know how much you can eat. Sit down, no need to be polite, we're all family here."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong rolled up his sleeves and sat on the bench, then started to fill his bowl and eat voraciously. Hu Qi did the same.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Liang Qu picked up his bowl, Xiang Changsong picked up a large piece of beef and put it in his bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Eat! The beef that Chef Liu stewed is so tender and fragrant, and the mutton has no gamey taste at all. Help yourself, I'll only do this once."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi swallowed a piece of beef: "By the way, Shidi, I saw you fighting with Lu Tingcai and the others last night. Your fighting skills are really poor. Your physical fitness is clearly better than those seven, yet you still suffered a lot of injuries."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu put down his chopsticks: "I haven't learned any fighting techniques yet, and I rarely get into fights. Master said I shouldn't do that."</p><p></p><p>"No need to put down your chopsticks, we're all family here, you can eat while talking."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>"I know you haven't learned yet, so I'm reminding you not to just focus on cultivating techniques. A martial artist exists to fight and kill. Although you have the strength to throw bricks, you still need to master techniques.</p><p></p><p>Your Ape Fist is good, and the Ape Fist technique emphasizes dragon form, snake waist, and fish scale steps. The sliding steps and ground attack techniques are unique. If you had used them last night, you could have fought while evading, restraining them, and resolved the brawl at a much lower cost."</p><p></p><p>"I'll remember that."</p><p></p><p>"In a few days when you break through the barrier, I'll teach you the fighting techniques. Even if Lu Tingcai and the others double in number, it won't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Don't be shy, just say if you have any issues, and ask if you have any problems. We senior brothers all went through this.</p><p></p><p>I was brought up by Xu Shixiong, Xiang Shidi was brought up by Cao Shixiong, and now Master has entrusted you to me, we're all the same."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shixiong, I'll remember that."</p><p></p><p>With that, a silence fell, only the sounds of the three big men swallowing and the chopsticks clinking against the porcelain bowls.</p><p></p><p>In just over a minute, the three large bowls of food were completely cleared by the three of them. Of course, Liang Qu had only eaten a small portion and was already full.</p><p></p><p>It seems that becoming a martial artist also expands one's appetite. If he had such a big appetite when eating crabs, wouldn't he have already maxed out his fusion degree?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, the training continued.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Liang Qu bid farewell to his two senior brothers and followed the address left by the Third Senior Brother to find the house with the anvil at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>It was also a large mansion, but a completely different style from the Yang Mansion at a glance, occupying a huge area with an overall very rugged style.</p><p></p><p>He could see several huge chimney stacks from the outside, billowing thick smoke.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu entered the house, and a wave of heat hit him.</p><p></p><p>Several burly men were shirtless, forging iron, the huge furnaces burning with raging flames, distorted air currents everywhere, not a hint of winter chill could be felt, as if the inside and outside were two different worlds.</p><p></p><p>He also noticed that the fuel burning at the bottom of the furnace was not charcoal, but some unknown mineral, the size of a heart, definitely not charcoal, with orange veins running across the black stones, like flowing lava.</p><p></p><p>The one using that furnace was Lu Gang, who saw Liang Qu and waved, taking out a stack of drawings: "Ninth Junior Brother! Just in time, come take a look at the design for your long spear."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu cared deeply about his long spear, with it his water combat ability would increase greatly, so he hurried over to take a look.</p><p></p><p>The drawings were made with charcoal, surprisingly clear and neat.</p><p></p><p>Each drawing was one-to-one scale, with the dimensions, shape, and estimated weight of the long spear noted beside it. Liang Qu looked through them one by one, when suddenly a drawing of an exquisitely patterned long spear caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>A tiger head was coiled around the neck of the spear, with a twelve-inch sharp blade protruding from the tiger's mouth, like a half-sword.</p><p></p><p>The metal wrapped all the way to two and a half feet in front of the spear shaft, making it more like a halberd or a spear, but more suited to Liang Qu's preferences.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, can I use this one?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't take it out for no reason, Junior Brother. You have good taste, you spotted the best one at a glance."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang spoke at a steady pace, giving a very reliable impression.</p><p></p><p>"The tiger-head spear is more complicated, it'll take about twenty days. When it's done, you come take a look, and if you like it, I'll lacquer it."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shixiong."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang shook his head: "We're all brothers, no need to be so polite. Feel free to look around, I need to get back to work."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was about to look around when he suddenly paused, then quickly asked his senior brother for leave.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang nodded, thinking his workshop was just too dirty and hot, and only told his junior brother to be careful on the way.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu apologized and hurriedly left the blacksmith's shop, turning and running towards Yixing Market.</p><p></p><p>Damn, Fatty has found another treasure fish again!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

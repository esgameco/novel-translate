        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The six-whiskered catfish is truly a treasure, and it's been less than five days since the discovery of the horned bream, but today it has brought another surprise.</p><p></p><p>If they could catch a precious fish like this every five days, perhaps no one in the Yang family martial arts school would have such a luxurious lifestyle. Thinking of this, Liang Qu quickened his pace considerably and returned to Yixing City in half an hour.</p><p></p><p>On the edge of Pingyang Town, it was also a wetland, and he could actually enter the water directly, but to avoid drawing attention, he still chose to return to the dock.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the dock, through the spatial awareness from the spiritual connection, Liang Qu set out by boat to the nearby area, the oar splashing the water surface, and the summoned pig dragon emerged from the water to assist him.</p><p></p><p>The Jianghuai wetland was not as calm and peaceful as it appeared. Aside from the great demons in the depths, there were some different species of pig dragons in the shallow waters, up to four or five meters long, capable of overturning small boats, so having an unprotected guard would be safer.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the dip net and entered the water. After eating the horned bream, he had gone to sell fish and learn martial arts, and after the fusion degree increased, he hadn't gone into the water yet. At this moment, he just felt a sense of lightness and freedom.</p><p></p><p>[Cauldron Master: Liang Qu]</p><p>[Refined Wetland Spirit: White Monkey (Fusion Degree: 8.3%)]</p><p>[Wetland Essence: None]</p><p>[River Favor Degree: None]</p><p>[Dominate Water Beasts: Tahua Crocodile, Six-Whiskered Catfish]</p><p>[Evaluation: The Wetland Spirit of the White Monkey originates from the great Lord of the Huaihe Whirlpool, but it is a weak and insignificant little person who needs to be stimulated.]</p><p></p><p>The fusion degree has reached 8.3, and the controlled water flow has reached 50 jin, with a slight increase in control power, proving that Liang Qu's original idea was correct.</p><p></p><p>With the increase in the fusion degree of the Wetland Spirit, not only has the water flow strength increased, but the control ability has also improved, becoming a water blade, and controlling blood is just around the corner, everything is thriving.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when Liang Qu saw the evaluation at the bottom, he also had some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Wetland Cauldron, he often observed the patterns on it, and if he didn't guess wrong, the so-called Lord of the Huaihe Whirlpool should be the famous Wusupqi.</p><p></p><p>Wusupqi's true form is a giant ape, with a blue body, white head, and golden eyes and snow-white teeth, which matches the most prominent pattern on the Wetland Cauldron.</p><p></p><p>According to legend, even the great Yu and the Dragon King were unable to kill it, and could only imprison it at the bottom of the water.</p><p></p><p>Who is the Dragon King?</p><p></p><p>That is the creator god and the ancestor of the dragons in ancient mythology. It is said that if a fish or shrimp drinks a mouthful of the Dragon King's urine, it can become a true dragon! Comparing this, it is evident.</p><p></p><p>As for the other patterns, they should be other water gods, and the one with a human head and snake body is suspected to be Gonggong.</p><p></p><p>As for the Black Emperor, Liang Qu doesn't know who it is, but his instinct tells him that he is very powerful, especially the spear-wielding divine general's spear looks a lot like the Three-Edged Two-Pointed Spear, could it be the God of the Second Immortal? Is the God of the Second Immortal a water god? In this case, the Wetland Cauldron is definitely an extraordinary divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the deepest part of the Jianghuai wetland is where the flood dragon lies dormant, awakening once every sixty years to wreak havoc, but in the face of Wusupqi, it is just a stick of chili.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he is only a white monkey, and is still tens of thousands of miles away from the Lord of the Huaihe Whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>The road ahead is long, and more effort is still needed!</p><p></p><p>Under the escort of the pig dragon, Liang Qu found the fat catfish and discovered that the so-called precious fish was a large-headed fish covered in orange tiger stripes! It was the same type of fish that someone had caught at the neighboring dock last month, the tiger-headed spotted fish! Only this one was much larger, about an arm's length, and weighed around six or seven jin. If sold, it might be even more valuable than the previous horned bream! Fatty, you really are my lucky star! Liang Qu happily patted the fat catfish's head and sent the two beasts to two other directions, forming a three-sided encirclement.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the white monkey's abilities, Liang Qu was not easily detected by the fish. He let the fat catfish and the pig dragon take the lead in the attack.</p><p></p><p>Startled, the tiger-headed spotted fish turned and fled, but when it reached Liang Qu, it realized that there was an ambush waiting, and it was too late to escape, as the huge inertia prevented it from turning.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of jin of water flow pressed down on the tiger-headed spotted fish, restraining its body.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu twisted his body and swung the dip net, like a beautiful golf shot, trapping the tiger-headed spotted fish in the net! Wonderful!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu quickly flipped the dip net pole, enclosing the tiger-headed spotted fish in the net, and carried it, net and all, upstream to the surface, and threw it into the boat.</p><p></p><p>Climbing back into the boat, Liang Qu...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He took out the stone knife and quickly gutted the fish, throwing the internal organs, gills, and trimmings to the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts opened their mouths wide, gulping down the food greedily, their tails swishing excitedly and splashing up a lot of foam on the water surface.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, are you two getting bigger?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was boiling water to cook the fish slices when he suddenly noticed that the two aquatic beasts seemed to have grown much larger. He had been in a hurry to catch the precious fish and hadn't paid attention before, but now upon closer inspection, he realized that their bodies, which were previously less than two meters long, had now clearly exceeded two meters.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish was the same - it had been just over two meters, but now it had grown nearly half a circle larger, almost two and a half meters.</p><p></p><p>He had only been commanding the two beasts for less than a month, so this was definitely not a normal growth rate.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly thought of the evolution prompts from Zeding before.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the two beasts had eaten the precious fish, and the essence of the water energy in the trimmings had been absorbed? He communicated with Zeding.</p><p></p><p>[Can consume 77.9 points of water essence to evolve the Taihuan alligator into a Jiaomuge alligator]</p><p>[Can consume 77.8 points of water essence to evolve the Six-Whiskered Catfish into a Tigerhead Catfish]</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it was missing! </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was overjoyed, not expecting the trimmings from the precious fish to have such an effect - it was completely a waste-free utilization!</p><p></p><p>"Good, the bigger the better, the stronger the better, the more beautiful. Come, eat more, the fish heads are yours too."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sucked out the fish brains and tossed the fish heads to the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>Although he may seem like a heartless boss, making the two beasts that discovered the precious fish only eat the trimmings, everything has its contrasts.</p><p></p><p>With the intelligence that had awakened in them under his command, they were much smarter than before, which was why they were able to purposefully catch the precious fish.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they had been muddled, not knowing what the precious fish was, and even if they saw it, they would have mistaken it for an ordinary fish and not bothered to catch it unless they were hungry.</p><p></p><p>The precious fish was more powerful and faster, and also harder to catch than ordinary fish.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they had gained.</p><p></p><p>A seven-pound tigerfish, after removing the inedible parts, still had over four pounds of meat. Even though the fish meat itself was extremely fresh and sweet, by the end it had become a struggle to finish. Fortunately, the water essence it contained did not disappoint.</p><p></p><p>[Water Essence +3.4]</p><p></p><p>After sucking the marrow out of the fish bones, Liang Qu tossed the bones to the two beasts. He was a bit out of breath and his whole body felt heated, but he still forced himself to stand up and start training according to the ape fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>The effects were best right after eating the precious fish, so he couldn't waste the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The tigerfish wasn't as good as the bullhorn bream, but the quantity was larger, so the overall blood and qi boost was greater.</p><p></p><p>As Liang Qu punched, he soon felt the heat throughout his body activate, and then that thread of qi appeared in his chest again. Previously it had only appeared halfway through, but now it showed up after just three posts, clearly demonstrating the extraordinary effects of the precious fish.</p><p></p><p>The qi circulation rapidly grew stronger, and Liang Qu began to sweat profusely. By the time he finished the entire set, his whole body was drenched as if he had been fished out of the water.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu drank the fish soup to replenish the fluids, feeling the fish meat in his stomach not yet fully digested, but he still forced himself to go through the set again despite the fatigue.</p><p></p><p>He repeated this three times until nightfall, when the fish in his belly was finally fully digested.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the qi in his chest had grown from a thread to the thickness of a strand of hair, and it continued to circulate for over half an hour after he finished, not immediately dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu collapsed on the boat, too exhausted to move, his eyelids drooping as he fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The Piggy Dragon and Catfish circled the boat, silently guarding.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Liang Qu's sticky body jumped into the water for a good wash, and when he came back ashore, his muscular contours were more pronounced, and he had grown taller, looking more heroic.</p><p></p><p>According to Hu Qi, as long as the qi in his chest was as thick as a little finger, he could begin refining the skin and breaking through. At his current rate of progress, it might not even take three months before he could break through the skin barrier!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was in high spirits, gazing at the rising sun, as if seeing his brand new life.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, go catch some fish, the ones that can't move, then go guard the lotus roots."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I wolfed it down, eating and eating.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu held the chopsticks, frantically scooping up the crab roe, waiting for it to cook while not forgetting to dig out the meat from the crab legs and toss it to the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts had no hands, and the crab monster's shell was extremely hard. If they couldn't move, it would be fine, but they could only barely bite the outer shell. The fat catfish was powerless, finding it very difficult to eat, relying entirely on their master Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Eating and digging at the same time, not neglecting either.</p><p></p><p>After a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Burp~~~~"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let out a resounding belch, he had already reached his limit, wanting to eat more but unable to. And just eating the crab roe was really too greasy, making him feel nauseous. He had been forcing himself to eat it halfway through.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts' stomachs were bigger than his, able to eat a lot, crunching and munching away.</p><p></p><p>Being able to eat is a blessing, Liang Qu hoped the two beasts would eat more, accumulate more essence, so they could evolve into a Horned Alligator and a Bullhead Catfish sooner.</p><p></p><p>The names after evolution sounded very impressive, must be extremely powerful. Then he could easily slaughter a crab monster, unlike the difficulty he faced today.</p><p></p><p>For the moment, Liang Qu became a free laborer, frantically scooping out the meat to be dried on the boat's bow, killing the bacteria through high heat to extend the preservation time. Whatever couldn't be cooked, he just tossed to the two beasts to eat.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster was large enough that he didn't need to break the shell, just reaching in to scoop out the snow-white crab meat.</p><p></p><p>After scooping out the crab meat, Liang Qu didn't even spare the crab gills, washing them clean before cooking them too, as the part that filtered the crab's impurities, easily causing diarrhea in humans, but the two beasts didn't mind, still crunching away.</p><p></p><p>Before gaining intelligence, they used to just swallow the crabs raw, not even washing them, let alone now after washing them once.</p><p></p><p>After eating, Liang Qu got into a boxing stance, trying to increase his digestion speed. Half an hour later, he continued eating.</p><p></p><p>The essence absorbed was continuously consumed, used to enhance the fusion of the Water Monkey's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Almost every minute, the fusion degree on the panel would jump up a few points.</p><p></p><p>Countless bright spots scattered out from the Spiritual Cauldron, gradually merging into the Monkey Spirit's illusory form.</p><p></p><p>Not only in his mind, but also in the unseen angle outside, a faint white-furred Monkey Spirit illusion appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>On the sides of the boat, the immobile and fat catfish frantically swam, trying to consume their internal energy. But when this illusory form appeared, an inexplicable awe welled up in their hearts, making them stop moving.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts looked around, finding nothing, but when they saw Liang Qu crouching at the bow, they immediately understood the source.</p><p></p><p>The sky god had become even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, even deeper changes were happening to Liang Qu's body.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of the spiritual power fusion not only strengthened his innate abilities, but also improved his physical qualities.</p><p></p><p>It was thanks to this that he didn't directly exhaust himself the first time he submerged and commanded the Boar Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Until around 4 o'clock in the afternoon, cooking a meal every hour, Liang Qu sat shirtless at the bow, his whole body flushed red like blood.</p><p></p><p>His body temperature was rising sharply, yet strangely without any discomfort.</p><p></p><p>The sweat flowed out and evaporated, leaving only salt grains and oil.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had to desperately punch like a monkey to consume it, the breath in his chest almost appearing the moment he started moving, rapidly circulating, growing stronger with every second.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying his breathing, white mist like sharp arrows gushed out from his nose and mouth.</p><p></p><p>Contracting and expanding,</p><p></p><p>Surging ceaselessly!</p><p></p><p>At some point, Liang Qu could even feel scorching liquid flowing in his mouth and nose, almost about to spurt out, but under his uninterrupted punching, the heat flow remained at the verge of eruption.</p><p></p><p>It was so uncomfortable!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suppressed it firmly, daring not to spit blood.</p><p></p><p>The endless flow of blood and qi gushed out, the initial half-chopstick-thick chest qi had now flourished to the thickness of a little finger, and was still growing.</p><p></p><p>Little finger thick! According to Hu Qi's words, it had reached the level of being able to refine the skin, but Liang Qu had no idea what would happen next.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What should I do?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, I should have asked him earlier. Why do I always end up being evasive and pretending to be profound when it comes to the critical moment? This is just like writing a novel excerpt!!</p><p></p><p>The surging waves of heat made Liang Qu's mind a bit blurry. He suppressed the discomfort and guided the energy within him upwards.</p><p></p><p>Become thicker, become stronger! Based on Liang Qu's observations over the past few days, the thicker the qi in his chest, the better his physical condition would be. There's no harm in practicing more.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, under Liang Qu's repeated punching, the gushing sensation finally gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu slowed down his movements and felt the heat flow within him gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the qi in his chest had thickened to the size of an index finger, much larger than a little finger!</p><p></p><p>Even after stopping the movements, it did not immediately dissipate, but continued to circulate persistently.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let out a long sigh, and his pure white breath extended for over three feet.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, and his skin, which had been as red as a large shrimp, quickly faded back to a normal ruddy color.</p><p></p><p>His muscular lines were smooth and unobtrusive, and the lines of the diaphragm on both sides were faintly visible, rising and falling with his breathing like gills.</p><p></p><p>His every movement exuded greater strength and ease. A punch swung out with a faint whistling sound.</p><p></p><p>Awesome! Liang Qu's mind calmed down, and he discovered another of his advantages, or perhaps something he had all along, but had never experienced as clearly as he did today.</p><p></p><p>When others eat the precious fish, they only eat the fish, digesting the energy contained in its flesh. But when he eats the precious fish, he not only obtains the energy of the flesh, but also a portion of the essence of the water.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the water, when consumed, can be further fed back to his body, enhancing his physical condition!</p><p></p><p>The South Fujian energy gathering ring, one node is stronger than six!</p><p></p><p>I have double the energy! Communicate with the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>[Cauldron Master: Liang Qu]</p><p>[Refining the Essence of Water: White Monkey (Fusion Degree: 36.6% â†‘)]</p><p>[Water Essence: None]</p><p>[River Favor Degree: None]</p><p>[Commanding Water Beasts: Tahua Crocodile, Six-Whiskered Catfish]</p><p>[Evaluation: The Water Monkey Essence originates from the great Huaihe River Lord, but it can only stimulate the insufficient, weak-willed little person.]</p><p></p><p>Over the four meals, Liang Qu obtained a total of 33.2 points of water essence. It just hasn't been fully upgraded yet, and he estimates it will be completed before nightfall.</p><p></p><p>If the Water Monkey's fusion degree is represented by an energy bar, he has directly consumed half of it in one go! The water flow he can control has also reached 300 jin, easily lifting two adult men for a short period of time! Unfortunately, he hasn't made much progress in more detailed control, but Liang Qu is already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>[Can consume 41.4 points of water essence to evolve the Tahua Crocodile into an Angular Wood Crocodile]</p><p>[Can consume 46.7 points of water essence to evolve the Six-Whiskered Catfish into a Tiger-Headed Catfish]</p><p></p><p>After checking, the energy required for the two beasts' evolution has also been greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, a whole crab monster has, with some waste, contributed nearly a hundred points of water essence! No, it can even increase!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked at the remaining thirteen crab eggs.</p><p></p><p>His mental strength is limited, and he definitely can't control them all. The rest can only be eaten.</p><p></p><p>He needs to pick the best one.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu brought the carapace onto the boat and examined it bit by bit in the sunlight. The crab inside the eggs had already grown to a considerable size, almost bursting through the thin membrane. It was easy to see the size and growth status of the male and female.</p><p></p><p>He removed the ones with little vitality, small size, and weakness.</p><p></p><p>There were only two that were most suitable, but one of them was a female, so Liang Qu also removed it.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he was punching, but the female crab is really not as big as the male crab. When it comes to subordinates, of course he should pick the fierce one.</p><p></p><p>You're the one!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu cut his finger and drew a water symbol on the back of the crab egg!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

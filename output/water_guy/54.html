        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Langcloud Pavilion had a large red lantern hanging on the high door lintel, with the lantern shade wrapped around a cluster of warm, flickering red light, swaying and captivating.</p><p></p><p>Gentle singing voices echoed through the beams, and the waiters carrying menus were bustling about delivering dishes.</p><p></p><p>In the private room numbered 'Dizi', Liang Qu pushed open the door, and a warm breeze greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"A true talent! Truly a talent! Solemn like the wind under the pines, tall and graceful - no wonder he became the disciple of Master Yang!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Di, dressed in a dark blue robe, stood up to welcome him, loudly praising.</p><p></p><p>"My son Songbao had already said that he knew a friend in Yixing City who was extraordinary, not an ordinary person. I thought that a small city like Yixing could not possibly have such a person, and that my son had exaggerated due to his limited experience. But now that I see him, it is indeed true! I, Lin, am truly unworthy, for I have not had the chance to witness Brother Liang's bearing earlier. Ah, I apologize, I am just too excited, and as an elder, I have spoken rashly. Brother Liang, Brother Liang! Let me punish myself with three cups of wine!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Lin Di gulped down three cups of wine in quick succession, his face flushing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao: "...When did I ever say such a thing? And you're calling him 'Brother Liang', what am I supposed to call him? 'Uncle Liang'?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu: "..."</p><p></p><p>This person is quite eloquent, and the titles are all over the place. Before Liang Qu realized it, Lin Di had pulled him into the seat, pointing to a boy of around thirteen or fourteen next to him. "Let me introduce, this is my eldest son, Lin Fuzun! Fuzun, greet your Uncle Liang!"</p><p></p><p>Eldest son?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked back at Lin Songbao in surprise, only to see him nodding.</p><p></p><p>Ah, so it's about legitimate and illegitimate sons. Liang Qu finally understood why as the son of the fishing shed owner, Lin Songbao had to work in the fishing shed every day.</p><p></p><p>Lin Fuzun stood up and greeted, "Hello, Uncle Liang."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's mouth twitched, "Don't call me 'Brother Liang', I'm not that old."</p><p></p><p>"Then may I boldly address you as 'Esteemed Nephew'?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was silent for a moment: "Just call me by my name."</p><p></p><p>"But that would be too impolite."</p><p></p><p>"Then call me 'Young Master Liang'."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lin Di looked a bit disappointed, then quickly had the waiters bring out the dishes. He also clapped his hands, and in an instant, a fragrant breeze wafted in.</p><p></p><p>Three women in elegant attire entered, and Liang Qu's spirit was stirred. He saw them bow and then two of them began to play music, while one started to dance.</p><p></p><p>Alright, alright, so you're going to play this game with me, huh.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Liang, rest assured, we are just here to appreciate the dance."</p><p></p><p>Lin Di smiled, having already inquired beforehand and knowing that Liang Qu was shy-faced, even uncomfortable with arranged marriages, so he deliberately avoided anything too stimulating that could cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's face flushed slightly, his fist clenched, and he coughed, "That's fine, that's fine."</p><p></p><p>What followed was just drinking and eating, but Liang Qu didn't drink any alcohol, only tea, though he did eat dish after dish.</p><p></p><p>The Langcloud Pavilion's flavors were indeed delicious, and the dishes even had chili peppers, something Liang Qu had never seen before, thinking that the Great Shun didn't have such things - now he realized it was just because he was too poor to have seen them.</p><p></p><p>"These are spices brought back by the Western Army's expedition last year, and they've only become popular this year. The bright red color, the spicy and pungent taste, eating them makes you sweat profusely, but there's a unique sense of comfort. I wonder if Young Master Liang can get used to them."</p><p></p><p>"I can get used to them, I can get used to them." Liang Qu stuffed the meat into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Then regarding the fishing shed matter, I wonder if Young Master Liang can lend a hand. I will hand over two-tenths of the fishing shed's annual income to you. Of course, whether it succeeds or not, I will still return the boat to Young Master Liang, as it is rightfully yours."</p><p></p><p>"I cannot do that."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, is that so? That's great then!" Lin Di laughed, but halfway through, he realized something was off, and he awkwardly asked again, "Young Master Liang, did you just say..."</p><p></p><p>"I said I cannot do that."</p><p></p><p>Lin Di was dumbfounded. He had approached Liang Qu hoping to borrow his influence, but now...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The identity of the channel gave his own fishing shed a certain prestige, allowing him to compete for business at other docks. Those who could open a fishing shed generally had some connections, which were not easy to deal with. With Liang Qu's help, under the name of Yang Shi's protection, it became much simpler.</p><p></p><p>But how could he refuse so decisively? After all, if the matter could be done, Liang Qu wouldn't have to do anything, and he would earn at least a hundred taels a year just by lying down! "Young Master Liang, perhaps I didn't explain it clearly enough before. As long as you agree, 30% of the annual harvest of the fishing shed..."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu put down his chopsticks and let out a satisfied burp.</p><p></p><p>"You can't have all of it. I've eaten the meal, taken the boat, but I won't do the business, and I won't take the income from the fishing shed either."</p><p></p><p>Lin Di was quite disappointed, but dared not get angry: "Can Young Master Liang tell me why?"</p><p></p><p>"Because I'm a fisherman myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Di's pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu moved his chair and stood up: "Exploiting your own people to make money, this money makes me feel disgusted. Okay, I'm full, goodbye. Oh, by the way, your dancing was very good, and the girls were very pretty."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the compliment, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>The three women bowed.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pushed the door and left.</p><p></p><p>Lin Di came to his senses and hurriedly called Lin Songbao: "Quick, see Young Master Liang off."</p><p></p><p>"No need to see me off, I'll just take a walk by the river, enjoy the cool breeze."</p><p></p><p>The door closed, and Liang Qu's voice disappeared from everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the Langxun Building, a cold wind blew straight into his collar, and Liang Qu shivered a bit, the drowsiness after a full stomach completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>As for the profits of the fishing shed, Liang Qu actually had a compromise solution.</p><p></p><p>That is, not to take those 20% of the fishing shed's income, but instead have Lin Di reduce the rental fee by 20%, or some other distribution method, so that the fishermen can live a little better.</p><p></p><p>But that might end up hurting Liang Qu's own interests.</p><p></p><p>The fishermen say that they are pitiful, and they are indeed pitiful, but they are also quite good. Whether it's not taking the income or taking less, and turning it into reducing the rent, the initial fishermen may be grateful to him, but over time, as the fishermen gradually get used to the reduced rental fees, and their lives are still tight, they may then see Liang Qu, the umbrella of the fishing shed, as hateful.</p><p></p><p>At that time, how would the teacher and senior brothers view it?</p><p></p><p>Having been taken in as a direct disciple by Yang Shi, Liang Qu gradually understood one thing.</p><p></p><p>When you don't have any ability, a good reputation is of no use, but as long as you show a little talent, a good reputation can bring unexpected rewards.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt that he was a good person, but not that good.</p><p></p><p>He could take money from his own pocket to buy buns for the snot-nosed kids, but he was also worried that he would be tainted by their feathers and gave up on cooperating with the fishing shed to help the fishermen.</p><p></p><p>But this meal was not entirely meaningless, at least he got his family's black-sailed boat back.</p><p></p><p>That was a good boat, a bit old, but it didn't affect the use at all, the hull was wide and large enough for a person to lie down and sleep in, much more comfortable than the current sampan.</p><p></p><p>The rushing water under the Nanshi Bridge was making a loud noise, splashing against the shore stones and whipping up white foam.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, just when my life was getting better, I've unnecessarily added so much trouble again."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sighed deeply, crossed his hands behind his head, and slowly strolled along, humming a tune completely different from the singing of the girls in the wine house.</p><p></p><p>"How dissolute I am, how filthy I am, pages of writing record my sins.</p><p>My arrogance, my thoughts, attached to this ugly shell.</p><p>You are so noble, you are so arrogant, a food bag, a wine jar, looking like a human.</p><p>Your hypocrisy, your inconstancy, embedded in your exquisite shell."</p><p></p><p>The cold wind swept across the street, and Liang Qu felt that the wind was coming from the river, bringing a familiar scent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

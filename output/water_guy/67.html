        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Stab it, stab the crevices! Don't chop!" </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tightly restrained the mountain demon, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon was not without weaknesses, as its formidable defensive armor came from its skin that was cracked and wrinkled like tree bark!</p><p></p><p>Such a hard skin was not conducive to movement, which is why it had become cracked and fissured like tree bark, increasing the gaps for activity - this was its greatest weakness!</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangtwo people heard the shout and changed from chopping to stabbing.</p><p></p><p>The bloodletting knife was already long and sharp, suitable for stabbing, and the two of them had not trained in vain at the martial arts hall for two months, their qi as thick as chopsticks, their strength much greater than ordinary adults, even more so in a fight for their lives, the sharp knife instantly stabbed in halfway! The venom of the Tianshui centipede only made the mountain demon feel uneasy, but now pierced by the sharp blade, the excruciating pain made it struggle uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu could no longer restrain it, his palms were about to be torn apart, and he had to reluctantly release the mountain demon's left arm.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa saw this and reached out to try to help hold it down, but the mountain demon's left arm swept him, sending the entire person flying several meters, his back slamming heavily to the ground, then rolling out several more meters.</p><p></p><p>The villagers crowded together let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell mixed in the river breeze pierced their nostrils, forcing them to retreat and huddle even tighter.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to flee, fearing that their random running would make them a target for the mountain demon, they desperately squeezed deeper into the crowd, like ants encountering a fire, just wanting to blend into the group.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa, lying on the ground, coughed up a mouthful of blood, his vision blurry, almost passing out.</p><p></p><p>He covered his chest and opened his eyes, looking at Liang Qu who was single-handedly restraining the mountain demon in his embrace, amazed.</p><p></p><p>They had both joined the martial arts hall on the same day, how could the gap be so large? Seeing the mountain demon knock Li Liboa away with one blow, Chen Jiechangs pupils shrank violently, no longer daring to go forward, seeing that the knife could not be stabbed in, he directly let go, stepped back, and kicked the knife handle, the entire sharp knife following the skin crevice piercing through the back and chest, almost poking out the tip! Good! Liang Qu was overjoyed to see this, but immediately the mountain demon in his embrace struggled even more violently.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon howled, its withered throat emitting a piercing scream, its sharp claws stabbing into Liang Qu's right arm, opening its fangs wide to bite Liang Qu's neck.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had no time to dodge, with nowhere to hide, he could only desperately tilt his head to avoid his neck.</p><p></p><p>Excruciating pain shot through his shoulder, the canine teeth piercing through the thick coat into the flesh and bone, almost cracking the bone, but Liang Qu still dared not let go! He couldn't let the mountain demon hit the ground, once it had a point of leverage, it could easily tear his entire arm off.</p><p></p><p>The venom of the Tianshui centipede had not yet taken effect.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa tried to get up, but his chest was really too painful, his whole body feeling like it was falling apart.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangs kick had used up all his strength, knocking himself to the ground, not even having time to stand up.</p><p></p><p>In the crowd, Chen Qingjiang held a cane from somewhere, waving it high above his head, but was pushed back by the surging crowd.</p><p></p><p>The villagers screamed and jostled.</p><p></p><p>No one could come to their rescue, all hope had to be fought for by themselves!</p><p></p><p>Willpower burning like a raging fire, Liang Qu hugged the mountain demon in his embrace, a huge force welling up within his body, he lowered his head, his expression ferocious, biting back at the mountain demon's neck like a wild beast!</p><p></p><p>Like two pythons fighting for food, facing a sumptuous feast, neither was willing to let go.</p><p></p><p>Blood seeped from the gaps between his teeth into his gums, the area around his lips and teeth thick with a pungent smell.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's throat rumbled with a demonic laugh, he took a step back, the muscles in his thighs constricting like steel cables, suddenly lifting his knee and striking fiercely at the mountain demon's abdomen!</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming violence pierced through the mountain demon's body, its entire skeleton cracking.</p><p></p><p>But it's not over yet! Liang Qu suddenly pushed off the ground, hugging the mountain demon and slamming it hard onto the ground in front of him!</p><p></p><p>The blue flagstones collided with the knife hilt still embedded in the mountain demon, shattering into several pieces, but holding the knife, from the blade to the hilt, most of it pierced through, the tip even poking out from the mountain demon's chest, slightly stabbing into Liang Qu's chest.</p><p></p><p>The thick knife hilt caused a severe penetrating wound, the mountain demon's entire strength suddenly plummeting, releasing Liang Qu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pushed the mountain demon away, then braced himself to stand up and retreat, he dared not touch his shoulder, afraid of feeling a handful of bone fragments.</p><p></p><p>After the initial excruciating pain, now there was hardly any pain at all, the intense secretion of adrenaline suppressing everything.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanglooking on dumbfounded, the villagers momentarily forgetting to scream, all stunned.</p><p></p><p>The pain stimulated the mountain demon to thrash wildly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The swinging of his elbows shattered the stone slabs into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Black blood gushed out, and Liang Qu panted as he tried to manipulate it, to make it flow more, but he was utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Elder Brother Hu or Elder Brother Xiang, including the mountain demon in front of him, as long as they had a certain level of strength, they could treat everything within their bodies as their own domain, where the rights of others could not take effect, unless there was an overwhelming, violent invasion!</p><p></p><p>The trapped beast still struggled, the mountain demon went berserk, and the helpless Liang Qu dared not approach any further. He picked up another sharp knife that had fallen from Li Liubo and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo and Chen Jiechangcould not even get up from the ground before they ran in opposite directions.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon stumbled backward, clawing at its own back, trying to pull out the knife, but it couldn't reach the handle behind it, let alone pull out the knife from its chest.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain stimulated its nerves, and the mountain demon suddenly jumped up from the ground, causing a chill to run through Liang Qu's heart.</p><p></p><p>He saw a black shadow flash, and a foul wind blew in his face, knowing that the mountain demon had reached him.</p><p></p><p>The villagers let out cries of alarm, as they witnessed the standing black-robed figure being knocked down, as if the courage they had just rebuilt in their hearts had collapsed, dissipating like a thousand rivers.</p><p></p><p>But as the black shadow fell to the ground, it revealed Liang Qu's back.</p><p></p><p>The one the mountain demon had pounced on was just a cloak.</p><p></p><p>In the critical moment, Liang Qu suddenly crouched down, and the loose cloak easily slid off his body.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed a corner of the cloak as it swept past, spun around, and the black cloak, like a dark wave, enveloped and threw off the mountain demon, then draped it back over himself.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon didn't even have time to react to what had happened before it was thrown to the ground, and the knife in its back further aggravated the wound.</p><p></p><p>The venom of the Tianshui centipede had finally taken effect, numbing the mountain demon's entire body.</p><p></p><p>Its clawed feet struggled on the ground, as if standing on ice, unstable and slipping.</p><p></p><p>The still relatively unharmed Chen Jiechangclimbed to Li Liubo's side, grabbed his arm, and helped him up, then supported Liang Qu as well. Liang Qu was seriously injured, and his strength was severely depleted, barely able to stand.</p><p></p><p>In front of the courtyard, in the narrow alley, the crowded crowd expanded a bit.</p><p></p><p>The three of them stood together, all panting heavily, staring at the mountain demon, whose movements were becoming smaller and smaller, until it finally collapsed to the ground, silent.</p><p></p><p>"Is it dead?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo turned to look at Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shook his head: "Let's wait a little longer."</p><p></p><p>After a long minute, just as Li Liubo thought the mountain demon was truly dead, the one lying on the ground suddenly raised its head, letting out a horrifying moan, its two emaciated hands clawing at the ground, slowly crawling towards Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>The knife tip on the mountain demon's chest scraped against the stone slabs, making a harsh grating sound.</p><p></p><p>Everyone shrank back in fear, the expanded crowd shrinking back in again.</p><p></p><p>Only Liang Qu remained motionless, with Chen Jiechangand the other two unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The two of them watched in terror as the mountain demon dragged a long black blood trail to Liang Qu's feet, then finally stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and he swallowed hard: "Is it really dead this time?"</p><p></p><p>A mountain demon, one capable of killing two martial artists, had actually been defeated by them? Although it didn't seem as powerful as imagined, it was still a mountain demon! The villagers were even more disbelieving, their gazes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>The three Wang brothers, hiding in the alley, saw Liang Qu's gaze sweep over them, and their hearts were gripped with terror, wishing they could shrink into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stared at the mountain demon for a long time. He raised his head, looking at the villagers' still-shaken eyes, and the empty sacrificial altar.</p><p></p><p>He detached himself from Chen Jiechangand, kneeling on one knee, pressed down on the mountain demon's neck with his hand gripping the sharp knife. Slowly, he cut the head off, and a large pool of blood spread across the stone slabs.</p><p></p><p>The fierce and terrifying aura made those nearby shudder.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu held the severed head of the mountain demon high, facing the thousands of villagers.</p><p></p><p>"Mountain demon! The best sacrifice to the river god!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

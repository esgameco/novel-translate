        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the nearby Liang Qu, Adi started to choke up even more. She almost knelt down in front of him, but fortunately Liang Qu was quick-witted and hurriedly helped her up.</p><p></p><p>"Ashuai, I really don't know how to thank you. Today, my husband went out to collect grain, and I was so anxious, always feeling that something bad would happen. I never expected such a disaster to occur, that he would be arrested and forced to dig the canal. This is truly a catastrophe."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang had learned about Liang Qu's martial arts skills emerging recently, and Adi naturally knew about it too. At the time, she was quite upset, feeling that the borrowed grain was useless, and that she had just been raising an ungrateful wretch, who would rather take the money to learn martial arts and eat out every day, without even thinking about returning those few catties of grain.</p><p></p><p>Instead, she had to get up before dawn every day to take the two children to help others with laundry, saving up for the autumn taxes.</p><p></p><p>However, out of consideration for her husband's face, she couldn't make a fuss about it. But she never imagined that her husband's good deed would now be rewarded in such a big way.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the matter is over now. Stop crying and sniffling. Go back and cook a good meal, and let the two of us have a feast."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was obviously not good at comforting women, and simply sent Adi off to cook, while he himself went back to the room and lay down.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu initially wanted to refuse, but then thought that since he had no money at all, he might as well accept the invitation, as he had nowhere else to eat.</p><p></p><p>On the dining table, there were only three plates of wild vegetables, one fish, and a dish of salted vegetables.</p><p></p><p>The fish was still fresh.</p><p></p><p>Spices were expensive, so unless it was a precious fish, cooking it would result in a strong fishy taste. Ordinary fishermen usually ate salted or smoked fish, which was easier to preserve and tasted better. Only those families that were truly impoverished, who couldn't even afford to use much salt, would eat fresh fish.</p><p></p><p>Of course, those who could afford the spices were a different story.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang felt a bit embarrassed: "I'm sorry, this is all we have left at home. In the future, when we have money, I'll definitely treat you to some meat dishes."</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo waved his hands repeatedly: "No problem, no problem. We don't care about these things."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, just having something to eat is good enough, so I don't have to cook when I go back."</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the family could barely pay their taxes and had almost been arrested to dig the canal, Liang Qu and Li Liubo understood the situation and wouldn't dare to be too demanding.</p><p></p><p>Although the meal was frugal, they still ate their fill.</p><p></p><p>Since they hadn't been eating well, the husband and wife felt even more guilty about not being able to serve a more substantial meal.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal and returning home the next day, Liang Qu still didn't go to the martial arts school. It wasn't because he wanted to fade the impression, but because if he didn't go fishing, he would starve. At the moment, Liang Qu truly didn't have a single copper coin to his name.</p><p></p><p>He let Afei fish for a day, and then Liang Qu went back to the fishing dock to sell the catch.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Songbao saw him, he exclaimed in admiration: "I heard about yesterday's incident. I never expected that there was still a hero like you hidden in our Yixing City. You are the man!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao gave Liang Qu a big thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Can a hero like you earn a few more copper coins by selling fish?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! How could that not be possible? Normally, this should be 102 coins, but I'll give you 110 coins, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked sideways at him: "Are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why not? Don't be fooled by our shabby fishing dock, that's all other people's business. I, Lin Songbao, respect people like you the most. Rounding it up a bit, what's the big deal? There's enough to earn, a little more or less doesn't matter. In the future, whenever you come, I'll always round it up for you, so you won't be shortchanged!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was silent for a moment, then uttered a "Wow."</p><p></p><p>He never expected the son of the fishing dock boss to be such a person, it really opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After earning the money, Liang Qu went to the martial arts school on the third day, as it would be impolite to delay any further.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Knowing that their teacher Hu Qi had taken a leave starting from yesterday, their new teacher was a martial artist named Lu Shaohui, who was slightly weaker than Hu Qi but had also broken through two realms.</p><p></p><p>While resting after practicing the Ape Fist, Li Liboa whispered, "I heard from Senior Brother Xiang that Teacher Hu is about to break through, so we might see the real martial teacher in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu also thought it was around that time. Making the medicine pills from the fish horns might take some time, but Teacher Hu had already bought the cow horn and the pomfret fish over ten days ago.</p><p></p><p>After eating the precious fish twice, Liang Qu felt that the horn of one precious fish was not that powerful to let a martial artist break through the blood realm, it should be used as an auxiliary medicine or as a catalyst.</p><p></p><p>Looking around and seeing that Master Lu was not there, Li Liboa lowered his voice even further, "Also, have you noticed that Master Lu seems a bit unwilling to get close to us, with an indifferent attitude."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu also had the same feeling, "Could it be because he dislikes the fishy smell on us?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, when they practiced the Ape Fist, Hu Qi would actively point out their mistakes and demonstrate the correct movements, but this Master Lu would not, only indicating the mistakes when they asked. He also rarely demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for their Ape Fist foundation, with fewer mistakes, this Master Lu would probably have become impatient.</p><p></p><p>An even more obvious sign was that whenever Master Lu approached the two of them, he would visibly wrinkle his nose, the disdain evident.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu couldn't help it, as he often caught fish, and even after bathing carefully, the fishy smell couldn't be completely removed.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it seems my previous impression that all martial artists are approachable was wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, don't mind it too much. It's already surprising that Senior Brothers Xiang and Hu don't discriminate against us, as long as we can learn the real skills."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps reading too many online novels had made the initially well-received Liang Qu unaccustomed to this familiar rhythm.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, did you see that young master over there?"</p><p></p><p>"Which one?"</p><p></p><p>"The one wearing white with golden threads, I heard he is the Third Young Master of the Zhao family, Zhao Xueyuan. I never expected him to come here to learn martial arts as well. It seems our choice of the Yang Clan Martial Hall is not wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Following Li Liboa's gaze, Liang Qu saw the so-called young master, indeed clean and delicate, even if his features were average, the air of being pampered was unmistakable, standing out from their rustic selves.</p><p></p><p>His father is the Old Master Zhao?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shuddered, he couldn't imagine his father being such a person, it would be better to keep his distance in the future.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing their gaze, Zhao Xueyuan glanced at the two of them, but paid no further attention, as he had noticed these two fishermen students early on, but no one cared, nor would anyone bother to interact with them.</p><p></p><p>In three months, they would just leave from where they came.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, in a few more days until the end of the month, Master Yang will come to teach. I wonder if it will be different, maybe I can finally have a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"It's always good to have dreams."</p><p></p><p>With Master Lu absent, Liang Qu and Li Liboa chatted casually, when suddenly the voice of Xiang Changsong came from the hallway.</p><p></p><p>"Today's on-duty teacher is Master Lu, so he will be your teacher. Although Master Lu is not a direct disciple of Master Yang, he has rich experience. Oh, by the way, the Martial Hall also has two junior brothers who are from Yixing City, maybe you know them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Liang Qu and Li Liboa looked up, and Li Liboa was the first to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Jiezhang, is that you?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

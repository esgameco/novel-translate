        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang, that bald-headed Zhang - not a single good person among them! Last night, Zheng Xiang left so decisively, not even asking for the yellow fish. He really thought the other party just wanted to do a simple business deal, even if it involved personal freedom. But the Great Shun is not a harmonious society where everyone is equal, and in the end, it was that dog servant who put the last straw on.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Water, Big Brother Water, I've said what I needed to say, and I'll definitely pay back the money I owe you in the future. Please, just treat me like a fart and let me go."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu, who had been tormented to the brink of death, mustered up the strength to say a coherent sentence. Seeing Liang Qu look over, he quickly tilted his head and forced out a smile.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's expression was hesitant, with an air of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu was secretly delighted, just about to add more fuel to the fire and beg some more, when he suddenly found the person next to him had disappeared, and a shadow had appeared over his head instead.</p><p></p><p>He looked up blankly, and suddenly let out a startled scream. He saw a face hanging upside down rushing towards him, the pair of pitch-black eyes staring straight at him, the disheveled hair, the mouth gaping open in a silent laugh, the two rows of cold, white teeth pressed against his face, as if they were about to bite through his neck!</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Water, Big Brother Water! What is this? Don't scare me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu's heart had almost stopped beating, and he fearfully shuffled backwards, stepping into the water with one foot.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stared intently at the bald-headed Zhang, whose head was bleeding, and his smile faded. "Did you just see me control the water?"</p><p></p><p>"Control the water? What control the water? I didn't see anything!"</p><p></p><p>"Whether you saw it or not, it doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stood up, the setting sun casting a long shadow on the small boat.</p><p></p><p>The river breeze blew, the reed heads swayed, and the reed flowers drifted away.</p><p></p><p>As the terrifying face moved away, Zhang Tieniu's tense heart relaxed slightly, but as time passed, he became increasingly uneasy under the shadow that enveloped him. He strained his neck to look up, only able to see the black silhouette framed by the golden light.</p><p></p><p>He shuffled down further, trying to tilt his head back more, and in a hazy moment, he saw a mocking face, and above it, a raised stone!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu's pupils contracted, his throat trembling, but before the pungent scent could rise up.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Splash!</p><p></p><p>Huge splashes erupted in the reed bed, with occasional flashes of dark red mixed in the white foam.</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow moved at the bottom of the boat, the pig-nosed dragon swaying its tail, dragging the body tied to the deadly stone into the deep water.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with everything, Liang Qu collapsed on the small boat, his heart pounding violently, his saliva thick like glue. He raised his hand and saw it trembling, his nails covered in bloody foam.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, a series of murderous actions had flowed smoothly through his hands.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the bald-headed Zhang would struggle too violently and that he wouldn't be able to control it, Liang Qu didn't even dare to drown him, and could only smash his skull with the stone.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Tieniu has bullied people too much. If I don't seize the opportunity to take his life while he's weak, even if I save up money from fishing, he'll still come after me when he's recovered. Ugh."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu leaned over the boat's edge and vomited, only managing to bring up some gastric acid.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had made up his reasons and made the decision, when it came to actually carrying it out, his mind went blank. He only stopped after smashing the back of Zhang Tieniu's head, leaving it a bloody mess.</p><p></p><p>The numerous carnivorous fish in the Jianghuai wilderness, attracted by the scent of blood, would soon erase all traces of Zhang Tieniu from this world.</p><p></p><p>After the vomiting, Liang Qu sat back on the boat.</p><p></p><p>At this point, not only had the covered boat turned into a small boat, but it had also been unexpectedly targeted by the Zhao family for no apparent reason. He didn't know if Old Master Zhao was involved.</p><p></p><p>The whole thing sounded like just Zheng Xiang and Zhang Tieniu's idea, but it was only one side of the story. Zheng Xiang might have been trying to curry favor with Old Master Zhao, or he might have acted on Old Master Zhao's instructions - Liang Qu had no way of knowing, and the steward wouldn't tell a bald-headed man like him the ins and outs.</p><p></p><p>If it was the former, it would be fine, but if it was the latter, it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Zhao was over 60 years old, how disgusting, how disgusting!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had been a virgin all his life, both in his previous and current lives, and that old thing...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I'm already bored and want to do something weird.</p><p></p><p>The only consolation is the two taels of silver in my bag. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>I can't offend the Zhao family, so I can only quickly save up seven taels of silver and go to the Yang family's martial arts school in Pingyang Town to learn martial arts and earn a good identity.</p><p></p><p>But how can I openly use this small boat?</p><p></p><p>Time flies by.</p><p></p><p>On the misty pier, figures are moving.</p><p></p><p>At midnight, when the fish gather to move and forage, is the best time for experienced fishermen to untie the ropes and set out.</p><p></p><p>But in the reeds, a young man is pushing a pole, going against the current back to the pier.</p><p></p><p>A man unties the rope and is about to push the boat out, seeing who the newcomer is: "Asui? Isn't your family's boat a black-canopy boat? How did it become a small boat? And why are you back at this time?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked up and smiled: "It's Uncle Chen."</p><p></p><p>This Uncle Chen was not the Chen Qingjiang who brought pastries before, there were many Chen families in Yixing, this was a different one, just an acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around and saw a few other fishermen, knowing the atmosphere was right, he showed a sorrowful expression, as if he was about to cry: "Uncle Chen, you know, last month my father..."</p><p></p><p>With a few indignant words mixed with a few sighs, Liang Qu told the story of how his father died and how the bald Zhang bullied him, but he slightly modified it, saying that bald Zhang had directly robbed the black-canopy boat, changing it to bald Zhang forcibly exchanging his small boat.</p><p></p><p>The fishermen present did not doubt it at all, and even felt it was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Robbing fishermen's boats is like killing one's parents, but bald Zhang did not publicize it widely, so not many people knew about it, and those who knew were not clear whether there was an "exchange" or not.</p><p></p><p>Bald Zhang bullies the weak and fears the strong, rarely offending the big families, and would not dare to go too far, so it was someone like the orphan Liang Qu, who had no one to rely on but also had a good boat, that Zhang Tieniu would be so unscrupulous.</p><p></p><p>"This bald Zhang, really has done all kinds of evil deeds."</p><p>"He should have been dealt with long ago, this heartless scoundrel."</p><p>"Yes, he keeps coming to my fish basket to steal fish, I really want to hit him with an oar and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the pier was filled with indignation, but if you listen carefully, you can find that most of them were just curses and resentment, and no one proposed to uphold justice for Liang Qu and go find bald Zhang to get the black-canopy boat back.</p><p></p><p>Bald Zhang is tall and strong, and a bachelor, he doesn't care about shoes, while everyone else has elders and youngers, they don't want to get into trouble for that one orphan.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sighed, lifted the wooden board, revealing a dozen or so fish: "I don't have proper fishing gear, I've been fishing all day and I'm really tired, I just caught a little, so I'm going back to sleep."</p><p></p><p>The others took a look, they were just some grass carp and white bream, worth about two or three hundred, and they all nodded, then no longer chatted and set out.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Completely cutting ties with bald Zhang would seem too deliberate.</p><p></p><p>If someone were to analyze the whole thing from beginning to end, they would certainly find something suspicious, such as if it was an exchange of boats, why would Zhang Tieniu choose to sell the black-canopy boat? Even if he was idle, he wouldn't leave no room at all, right?</p><p></p><p>Although it can be explained, the logic chain would inevitably be weak.</p><p></p><p>But people also dislike excessive self-awareness, feeling that others are paying too much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>The world does not revolve around anyone, for irrelevant trivial matters, people's memories are actually very vague, just a little guidance can lead them to a completely different direction.</p><p></p><p>No one would think that a young man would dare to be so bold and have the ability to ambush a strong and healthy man.</p><p></p><p>As long as a seed is planted, without obvious flaws, this seed can grow into an "established fact".</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

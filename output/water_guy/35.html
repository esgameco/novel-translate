        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cold moonlight shone onto the martial arts training ground, making the entire place look like a sea of mercury.</p><p></p><p>Several people were standing on the eaves of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong stood at the front of the eaves, watching the furious young man below, seeing him gritting his teeth with a ferocious expression, but not stopping this farce.</p><p></p><p>Next to the others, the apprentices who were being forced to explain the previous events were sweating profusely and trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly let go, shaking off the restraints of the two people, and returned to the center of the field amidst the calls.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight cast a side glow on Liang Qu's sharp face, creating alternating light and shadow. The high bridge of his nose cast a shadow, covering one of his eyes in darkness, while the other remained calm and expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Facing each other from ten steps away, one side had one person, the other side had seven.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight and lamplight pierced through the night.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stood very straight, like an unsheathed sharp sword, with all eyes focused on him.</p><p></p><p>"That bastard is acting too damn capable."</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai's anger grew, especially when he saw the gazes of the female apprentices beside him, burning with fury. He reached out and grabbed a wooden stick from the nearby weapon rack.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts school had weapon racks for sparring, but to prevent the young people from using real weapons, there were only wooden sticks, no sharp blades.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai turned his head: "He's a newcomer, I'll handle him myself, let him know what fear is."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded, they felt the same way. With so many people watching, it would be embarrassing for the seven of them to attack together.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai swung the stick, let out a cold laugh, and slowly stepped forward, like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>His height was nearly 1.9 meters, completely able to look down on the not-yet-fully-developed Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Especially as the distance closed, his imposing presence became even more astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa and Chen Jiecang behind Liang Qu swallowed hard, but no matter how much they called out, Liang Qu seemed not to have heard them at all.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai paced forward, inch by inch approaching, and when he was about three meters away, he sneered and suddenly pushed off the ground, charging forward like an arrow.</p><p></p><p>The power came from the ground, Lu Tingcai tensed every muscle in his body, every inch exerting force and rotating, from the left sole, twisting and transmitting to the right hand, and then to the short stick.</p><p></p><p>He raised the wooden stick, as thick as a chicken egg, and brought it down hard towards Liang Qu's head, the stick cutting through the air with a terrifying whistling sound.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai couldn't wait to see Liang Qu's head split open and bleeding, driven by his anger, this angle and speed were almost the perfect execution, far exceeding his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his opponent stunned and motionless like a wooden block, the violent pleasure rose in his chest.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu remained calm until the stick shadow was right in front of his eyes. He stepped forward, grabbed Lu Tingcai's wrist and pushed it down, with such great force that he easily snatched the wooden stick from his hand, and then slapped him, knocking him to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A deathly silence, so quiet that the distant wind could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Everyone dilated their pupils at this moment, the outcome had been decided in just that instant.</p><p></p><p>Too fast, too ruthless, no one could see Liang Qu's movements.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa and Chen Jiecang behind Liang Qu opened their mouths wide, as if something was blocking their throats.</p><p></p><p>The crickets started chirping again.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone on Lu Tingcai's head, icy and cold, his wrist swollen, covering his face, completely pale, not understanding what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>What's going on, I just... I just got slapped?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the veins on Lu Tingcai's forehead bulged, throbbing violently. He propped himself up with his hand and suddenly jumped up, swinging his fists to attack.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu swung the stick, blocking the fist on Lu Tingcai's arm, and then delivered another crisp slap to his face.</p><p></p><p>Everyone saw it clearly, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai sat dumbly on the ground, disbelieving, an indescribable sense of humiliation and anger welling up in his heart. He panted on the ground like a beast, still wanting to jump up.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu didn't give him another chance to counterattack. He stepped forward, the short stick swinging out horizontally.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai only saw the stick become a blurry shadow, swinging over and heavily striking his cheek. A mouthful of fresh blood sprayed out, and he rolled and fell to the ground, his entire half-face completely numb, not knowing if all the teeth on that side had fallen out.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lowered his brows, looking at the few broken teeth on the ground, and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come any closer!" Lu Tingcai covered his face and shouted in terror. "Quick, come on!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other six people who had been dumbstruck finally reacted, calling out and rushing forward.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took another step, raising the wooden stick, wanting to knock out Lu Tingcai's other teeth as well, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shouts had already reached here.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu bent down by taking a step and bending his left knee at a 90-degree angle, twisting his waist, and the short baton whistled as it drew a large arc in the air!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi was hit in the jaw by the baton, he spat out a mouthful of blood, his whole face twisted and distorted, and he rolled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Like pouring boiling water on a snowball, the few people behind Xue Dingyi hurriedly retreated to the sides.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, a short and burly ruffian rushed over, roaring and swinging his baton towards Liang Qu's shoulder, but a terrible palpitation suddenly enveloped him, and the blood in his heart seemed to flow back for a moment, causing his movements to become disorganized.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stepped forward, the baton struck the ruffian's wrist, and before Liang Qu could relax, an unstoppable violence was transmitted to Liang Qu's arm, causing Liang Qu's body to pause, forcibly suppressing the surging qi and blood, withdrawing the baton, flipping his wrist, and striking out with one baton, hitting the attacker in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>The attacker couldn't catch his breath, his body swayed for a while, and he fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three people roared and rushed up, swinging wooden batons to strike down, too many and too dense, Liang Qu fended off two, but someone leaped up and swung, hitting Liang Qu on the head.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt his entire skull cavity vibrate like a struck iron bell, and fresh blood gushed out from his nose and mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then someone got up from behind and hit him in the back again, Liang Qu glared with his eyes, almost tearing the corners of his eyes, he held his breath, the blue veins on his forearm twisted like snakes, kicked the person in front of him, turned around and swept, the person who got up couldn't dodge in time and was hit by the baton, breaking his ribs.</p><p></p><p>There were too many people, those who fell down got up again, four or five batons swung at the same time, he fended off two, but there were still three people hitting him.</p><p></p><p>The training ground was in chaos in an instant, the development of the situation was beyond everyone's expectations, everyone stood dumbfounded, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>The blood-stained wooden batons, the ferocious expressions, the torn muscles, the silver full moon, the swaying candlelight, the cold and stern eyes, the flickering stars in the sky - one figure after another rushed up, the batons striking Liang Qu's body, but he seemed to feel no pain, relying on his physical fitness, striking out one baton after another, knocking away the approaching figures.</p><p></p><p>The speed with which Lu Tingcai and the others got up became slower and slower, and the force in their batons became weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu's anger grew stronger and stronger, and the batons in his hands seemed to be splitting the people in half! The blood-stained faces were twisted, and the cold night became horrifying.</p><p></p><p>Someone threw their batons and picked up blue bricks, but before they could hit Liang Qu, they were struck down together with the bricks.</p><p></p><p>The baton suddenly broke, Liang Qu suddenly rushed forward, hugging a person's waist and abdomen and slamming him to the ground, the person's eyes rolled back, and he let go of the baton.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu reached out and grabbed the man's hair, lifted his head, and slammed it hard against the ground, the hard yellow mud ground was smashed into a dent, and his face was completely smashed.</p><p></p><p>Another baton hit him on the back, but Liang Qu, ignoring the soreness, forcefully took a deep breath, grabbed the baton and rolled over, making a full swing, and the person was again knocked to the ground, with several ribs broken.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu swung the baton and turned around, but swung empty.</p><p></p><p>There was no one standing anymore.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head, blood and broken teeth all over the ground.</p><p></p><p>Rounded blood drops dripped from the head of the baton.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu knelt on the ground, with the young people in disarray and moaning all around him, his cheek bulged as he pushed it with his tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood clots, and his blocked throat began to breathe smoothly again.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath, propping the wooden baton on the ground, the torn muscles trembling and squeezing out the last bit of strength, shakily supporting his body as he stood up straight in the middle of the field.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangwere completely dumbfounded, gasping and unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>The group of disciples on the edge of the training ground were also plunged into a strange silence.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu slowly exhaled a long breath, unable to hide the fatigue and pain all over his body.</p><p></p><p>One against seven, it was too much.</p><p></p><p>And Liang Qu looked up at the person standing on the eaves in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>With a fusion degree approaching fifty, he was already able to control blood, but unfortunately the subtlety was not enough, and he could only act on the most concentrated blood vessels in the heart, causing others' blood to briefly flow backwards.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu only used it once, on the short and burly ruffian, and when he twisted his body to strike, he saw the person on the roof, and dared not use it again.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Tingcai, Xue Dingyi, Yu Weilong, Xiang Qujie, you seven people don't need to come to the martial arts hall anymore!"</p><p></p><p>The dust settled, on the roof, several figures jumped down, and a loud voice echoed throughout the training ground.</p><p></p><p>The leading elder came in front of Liang Qu, his tone indistinguishable between joy and anger.</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Liang Qu, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lowered his head and smiled wearily.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have the willingness to be my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

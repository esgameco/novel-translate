        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That scrawny little bastard, daring to come and give him a couple of punches.</p><p></p><p>The long-suppressed sense of crisis in Liang Qu's heart finally dissipated, and his mood became bright.</p><p></p><p>His purse was bulging, the silver coins clinking, making him feel even more elated. Facing such a prosperous Pingyang Town, he couldn't help but want to buy some things.</p><p></p><p>He happened to pass by a cloth shop, so Liang Qu asked his two senior brothers to wait a bit while he went in to buy two sets of ready-made cotton clothes.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, just the cotton alone costs three hundred coins per catty, and a long coat for a tall person requires three catties of cotton. The two sets of outerwear plus an undershirt cost Liang Qu a little over three taels.</p><p></p><p>The clothes his senior brothers gave him were too good, making him reluctant to wear them. Since he sweats a lot during his martial arts practice, he chose two sets of cheaper, more convenient replacements.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took out his money pouch to pay, and after getting the change, he also fished out a small silver ingot.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, can you help me exchange this small ingot for two taels of silver?"</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper took the silver ingot, weighed it, blew on it to listen to the sound, and after confirming it was fine, he took out two pieces of silver and handed them to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, your silver is of good quality, so I'll add fifty coins extra for you." The shopkeeper then took fifty copper coins from the drawer and gave them to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the silver and copper coins, then took out another small ingot and combined it with one tael of silver to return to Senior Brother Xiang.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsung was surprised to receive it: "Junior brother, it was just three taels, I had almost forgotten about it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shook his head, "Borrowing money is borrowing money, and if you borrow, you have to pay it back."</p><p></p><p>The robe Xiang Changsung had given was clearly quite valuable, but a gift is a gift, and borrowing money is borrowing money - no matter how many gifts are given, the borrowed money still needs to be repaid.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsung reluctantly took the silver, not really caring about the three taels, but Liang Qu's manner of doing things made him feel strangely happy inside.</p><p></p><p>After buying the clothes, a little further down the road was Wufang Zhai, the best pastry shop in Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had bought a master's gift here before. He took out one tael of money to buy two boxes of pastries, planning to give one box to Li and Chen, and one box to Uncle Chen's family.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi laughed, "It seems Brother Liang is in a very good mood, but I don't know if there's a share for us in those two boxes."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu scratched his head embarrassedly, realizing he had forgotten to buy any for his senior brothers. Although he wasn't as wealthy as them, he should have at least bought some as a gesture, and was about to take out more money to buy a few more boxes, but Hu Qi stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I was just joking. Master gave you ten taels of silver, and you've already spent close to seven taels. If we make you buy more, wouldn't that be Master's money going to waste? If you really want to treat us, you can just take us out to eat in the future when you've earned some money."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded in agreement, making a mental note of this.</p><p></p><p>As a direct disciple of Master Yang, he could now catch two hundred coins' worth of fish a day without anyone doubting him. The fishermen would just think it was no wonder, as he was Master Yang's disciple, and his fishing skills were so graceful.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was even possible to exaggerate it further, claiming to catch a precious fish every month, which would bring in a monthly income of around ten taels of silver, easily a hundred taels in a year, equivalent to ten farmers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the simplest and most straightforward method. Liang Qu now had more ways to earn money than just fishing, such as Xiang Changsung and Hu Qi at the martial arts school - one handling interpersonal matters, the other responsible for teaching, and Master Yang did pay them a decent monthly salary of tens of taels.</p><p></p><p>Even if Liang Qu didn't have enough skills to teach, he could still come and do some odd jobs for a while, following Xiang Changsung. Once he had studied more, he could even help with record-keeping.</p><p></p><p>As they were talking, the three arrived at the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>The bloodstains left on the training ground the previous night had been covered with a layer of yellow soil, and the bloody smell was nowhere to be found, as if some special method had been used.</p><p></p><p>Today, there were still over fifty "familiar faces" as usual.</p><p></p><p>Oh, no, Liang Qu scanned the crowd and found that excluding Lu Tingcai's seven people, there were only around forty left.</p><p></p><p>The school had many disciples, and Master Yang would come over for five days at the end of the month. Today was only the second day.</p><p></p><p>The so-called guidance included not only movement corrections, but also attention points in fighting techniques, guidance of qi and blood, selection of cultivation progress, matching of medicinal materials, and many other detailed matters. Everyone cherished these opportunities and rarely missed them.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Shaowei was not among the crowd. Come to think of it, Liang Qu hadn't seen him since the incident the previous day, and he still hadn't shown up today.</p><p></p><p>Was he afraid to come back?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought this was unlikely. As a serious martial artist, Lu Shaowei came to the school not just to learn, but for the atmosphere and environment. Staying at home in seclusion to cultivate wouldn't be as good as sparring and discussing with everyone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lu Shaowei's reputation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He belonged to the "substitute" group, so even if he slacked off, no one could blame him, at most he would be scolded a couple of times.</p><p></p><p>The winter wind swept up the fallen leaves, swirling and drifting on the yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was looking at the crowd, and the crowd was also looking at him.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a black fur cloak, dressed in a narrow-sleeved, narrow-waisted gold-trimmed robe, with a wide leather belt around his waist, hanging on both sides were jade pendants and metal bracers peeking out from the sleeves as they swayed.</p><p></p><p>He was not too tall due to his age, his skin slightly darker, but he made up for it with an upright bearing and an air of heroic might. This was the same young man who had the luck of a dog last night?!</p><p></p><p>Everyone in their minds involuntarily conjured up the image of Liang Qu from last night, wearing a yellow-brown linen robe, clothes not even fitting properly, looking utterly destitute from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>They were two completely different people! </p><p></p><p>They found it hard to believe, yet they had to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong was always kind and patient when dealing with people.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qiwu didn't talk much, but he treated everyone equally and was diligent in his duties, his own cultivation being profound.</p><p></p><p>Yet they had never interacted with such an intimate and harmonious atmosphere! There seemed to be a lamentable thick barrier between them and the direct disciples of the Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhao Xueyuan in the crowd moved, and everyone watched as he stepped forward to greet them, "Elder Brother Hu, Elder Brother Xiang, Elder Brother Liang."</p><p></p><p>With someone taking the lead, the rest gradually came forward one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother."</p><p>"Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>They came forward to pay their respects, even those who had joined the sect earlier but were not direct disciples still had to address them as "Elder Brother".</p><p></p><p>So this is what it feels like when the tables have turned? Liang Qu suddenly gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>Last night, each of them had looked on with mocking eyes, enjoying the show, but now they had to bow and greet him respectfully. "Wow, Liang Qu is so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"A true man should be like this!" </p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangin the corner of the flower bed, seeing Liang Qu's imposing bearing, were excited beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>They held back their joy, waiting until the end to come forward and greet him. But after the greeting, looking at Liang Qu's grand attire and jade pendant, the two who had so much to say suddenly found themselves at a loss for words, their throats seemingly blocked by something.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong's eyes flickered as he said, "You all chat first, I'll go with Elder Brother Hu to check on the disciples, you can come over later, and Elder Brother Hu can teach you how to break through the skin barrier."</p><p></p><p>After they left, Liang Qu shook a wooden box, "Want some?"</p><p></p><p>Li Libosaw the words on the box, he couldn't read, but he recognized the three characters "Wufang Zhai", the best pastry shop in Pingyang Town. He had often heard people discussing it nearby, and over time had come to recognize those three characters, but had never gone to buy there himself. The threshold was too high, like an insurmountable wall to him. He hesitated, "Wufang Zhai?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I specially brought these for you, to celebrate me becoming a disciple of Master Yang."</p><p></p><p>"Must not have been cheap?" Chen Jiechangobviously knew the contents of the box and felt a bit awkward about reaching for it.</p><p></p><p>"Take it."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"Take it!"</p><p></p><p>The same dialogue as last night was replayed, a sense of déjà vu washing over the two, as if they were seeing that unwavering, blood-soaked figure standing under the moonlight again. That gritted teeth, ferocious expression, knocking down anyone who tried to get up!</p><p></p><p>Snapping back to reality, their hands had unconsciously unwrapped the package.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu mocked, "Haha, what's there to be embarrassed about? Look at you two, Li Libodidn't seem to have any shame when you were scraping the meat last time."</p><p></p><p>The vague barrier melted away in the laughter, and Li Liboand Chen Jiechangbegan to laugh as well.</p><p></p><p>Li Libowhose eyes were red-rimmed, stuffed an entire flaky pastry into his mouth, "Mmm, so delicious, I've always wanted to try the pastries from Wufang Zhai, but never had the chance, mmm, so good."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangtook out a piece and slowly savored it, "From now on, in Yixing City, Liang Qu will be the first famous big shot."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, Liang Qu will be 'Big Brother Liang', you might even be able to buy a big manor and keep maidservants!"</p><p></p><p>"Look at your ambitions, you should definitely take the civil service exam and become an official!"</p><p></p><p>"You're just trying to pick a fight with me, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'd say, all this is what Liang Qu has rightfully earned through his own abilities, as he deserves!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

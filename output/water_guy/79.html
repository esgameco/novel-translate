        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu squatted down, and the obedient mountain dog revealed its belly. He asked with puzzlement, "Doesn't this dog fear strangers at all?"</p><p></p><p>"It does, but it's smarter, smart enough to recognize our relationship. Don't treat it like an ordinary dog. My master feeds it beef every day and a blood-enriching pill every three days. Even common tigers and leopards are no match for it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a sharp breath, realizing the dog ate better than people.</p><p></p><p>"What's its name?"</p><p></p><p>"Black Teeth."</p><p></p><p>Hearing its name, Black Teeth perked up one ear, its gaze drifting upwards.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu reached out to stroke the dog's head, feeling its smooth, soft fur, clearly well-cared for.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Gang simply handed the dog leash to Liang Qu, letting him lead it.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu eagerly pulled the leash, just starting to scratch the dog's head when Black Teeth suddenly stood up and faced the fork in the road.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the sound of carriage wheels rolling over the muddy path reached their ears, growing closer.</p><p></p><p>A caravan of five horse-drawn carriages came into view.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai jumped down from the carriage, unloading the mountain bandits "one by one" from it.</p><p></p><p>The caravan got their money and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-three people in total, mission accomplished!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang asked, "How are they?"</p><p></p><p>"We slept in the carriage, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then let's go up the mountain! Brother Liang and Brother Xiang, walk in the middle."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang led the way, Hu Qi second, Liang Qu third, Xiang Changsong fourth, and Xu Zishuai bringing up the rear. </p><p></p><p>The battered and disoriented mountain bandits were dragged along by the ropes, strung out in a line behind them, unaware of what they were about to face.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shouldered a long spear, leading Black Teeth, as he ascended Fahwa Temple with his four senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>Just as they reached the middle of the mountain, Black Teeth suddenly let out a bark.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang turned back and shushed it, and Black Teeth fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had a hunch about Black Teeth's meaning and quietly asked, "Is there really a mountain ghost?"</p><p></p><p>"Likely, or the lingering aura of a previous one. In any case, don't let your guard down."</p><p></p><p>Reaching the mountaintop, Xu Zishuai wondered aloud, "This temple hasn't collapsed yet, has it been over fifty years?"</p><p></p><p>As the sun fully set, the dilapidated temple became eerily ominous, the howling mountain wind chilling to the bone.</p><p></p><p>The band of mountain bandits were disoriented, gripped by an inexplicable fear, shivering uncontrollably, unsure if it was from the cold or terror.</p><p></p><p>Yet they dared not resist, for Xu Zishuai had breached their entire mountain stronghold with just a single massive log, godlike in his power.</p><p></p><p>With a tug of his hand, Xu Zishuai dragged the stumbling bandits into the temple, lining them up on their knees.</p><p></p><p>"If you can't take it, you don't have to watch," Hu Qi said to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shook his head, indicating he could handle it. These were wretched villains, worse than the scoundrel Zhang, so what was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>If they were afraid, they should have just gone back to raising pigs.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai moved with lightning speed, and a bloody stench soon filled the air.</p><p></p><p>To make the scent even more pungent, he severed their limbs, their still-beating hearts pumping out gushes of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Well, it was a bit nauseating - over twenty people, the smell was overpowering.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu wrinkled his nose.</p><p></p><p>The intense bloodiness stirred something in the sky-water centipede on his hand.</p><p></p><p>The mountain dog sitting nearby turned its head, but saw Liang Qu discreetly make a shushing gesture, and it tilted its head before turning back.</p><p></p><p>Good dog! Liang Qu silently praised, affectionately ruffling the dog's fur, covertly restraining the agitation of the awe-inspiring creature.</p><p></p><p>The Fahwa Temple was situated on a mountain that, while not particularly high at just over 300 meters, was considered a significant hill in the vicinity of Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above is the "mountain", with nothing obstructing the view around it, allowing a clear sight of the prosperous town of Pingyang.</p><p></p><p>Without any obstruction, the river wind blows freely and strongly, and the pungent smell of blood keeps spreading across the low mountain.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, Black Teeth stood up, tensing the muscles on his cheeks, and let out a low growl from his throat.</p><p></p><p>Everyone became alert.</p><p></p><p>In Liang Qu's mind, the Zeding suddenly shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>[Searching the Mountain and Subduing Demons triggered]</p><p></p><p>[Current progress: 0]</p><p></p><p>[Accomplish the Searching the Mountain and Subduing Demons task, can gain the favor of the Heavenly Emperor of Shu, each level of Martial Dao Enlightenment doubles the Martial Dao Talent, and increases damage to water-attribute demonic beasts by 10%.]</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did not expect the Zeding to have such a change.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Emperor of Shu?</p><p></p><p>Searching the Mountain and Subduing Demons?</p><p></p><p>Both names were quite obscure, but when combined, Liang Qu suddenly thought of someone - the Second Immortal!</p><p></p><p>That spear-wielding divine general must be the True Lord Xiansheng! Yes, capturing the dragon at Guankou, pacifying the water at Liudui, his achievements surpassing the ancient ones! The Second Immortal was indeed the Celestial God of Water! But how was the Searching the Mountain and Subduing Demons triggered? Liang Qu gripped the long spear in his hand, looked down at the black dog reaching up to his waist, and then looked at the Fahua Temple on the mountaintop, where the ominous wind was blowing.</p><p></p><p>He understood everything.</p><p></p><p>The Second Immortal favors me, doesn't he?</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang shouted, "They're coming!"</p><p></p><p>The moonlight was obscured by the leaves of a vine on the roof of the Fahua Temple, but a human silhouette was crouching on the tree.</p><p></p><p>Mountain Demon! </p><p></p><p>What a huge Mountain Demon! The one in front of him was much larger than the one he had encountered at the River God Festival. The one at the River God Festival was only about one meter and sixty centimeters tall, but this one was nearly two meters tall!</p><p></p><p>Black Teeth's low growls became increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>No, there's more! The ground was slightly trembling, and under the moonlight, one Mountain Demon after another appeared on the temple roof, either squatting, standing, or crouching.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sense of oppression came from in front of him like a wall, making one's scalp tingle! Liang Qu looked up at the solitary moon in the sky and took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they need to Search the Mountain and Subdue Demons, there are at least thirty or more Mountain Demons in front of him, and more are still coming! Lu Gang's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he finds it troublesome, the stronger the ones who have been spawned, the stronger the Mountain Demons that hatch out, but there is a limit, and the Mountain Demons are at most at the level of the Galloping Horse Realm, far from being a challenge to him.</p><p></p><p>He finds it troublesome because of the information revealed by the sheer number of Mountain Demons.</p><p></p><p>The hidden opponent has laid out the stage quite extensively! Dozens of Mountain Demons, how long have they been raising them? They haven't even noticed them at all!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Demons are extremely greedy for flesh and blood, but the two men standing in the field make them feel a deadly threat, so they dare not act for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Shidi and Hu Shidi, help Little Eight and Little Nine to deploy the formation!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang was the first to charge out, the ground cracking, and he instantly appeared in front of the two-meter-tall Mountain Demon.</p><p></p><p>With a rushing punch, the Mountain Demon's entire head exploded! Liang Qu: "???"</p><p></p><p>The confrontational situation was broken, and the Mountain Demons, indifferent to the death of their own kind, were instead ignited with anger and could no longer suppress their thirst for fresh blood, jumping down from the roof one after another.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai walked unhurriedly in front of Liang Qu, the cool wind blowing in his face, and several incoming Mountain Demons had their limbs shattered and fell to the ground, with only the smallest one running towards him.</p><p></p><p>Come on! Liang Qu shouted, his blood circulating in his body, and the long spear swept in a large semicircle.</p><p></p><p>The black-gold spearhead drew a beautiful arc, precisely and accurately slashing the head of the Mountain Demon, with a sense of solidification almost as strong as cutting iron transmitted from the spear shaft.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's muscular arms were knotted, twisting his waist and stepping forward, sending all his strength into the strike. The spearhead broke through the solidification and sliced through the head, bringing out a crimson splash under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Half of the Mountain Demon's head slowly slid off, and the blood spurted out.</p><p></p><p>[Searching the Mountain and Subduing Demons progress: 1]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

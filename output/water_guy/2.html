        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The polished bluestone slabs shone like mirrors in the moonlight, and the withered leaves fell down without piling up, drifting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The wind surged from the vast river and then flowed away from the open roof, seeping into the cracks of the door.</p><p></p><p>As if stirred by the wind, the tangled weeds stood upright, and a little liveliness emerged from the mud-brick house.</p><p></p><p>Hungry! So hungry!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu opened his eyes, his gaze unfocused, only feeling a knife-like pain in his stomach as he curled up on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Qu, he's also called Liang Qu? His mother died in childbirth, and his father died of a cold a month ago, what a standard opening? Only a boat, a house."</p><p></p><p>"No, the boat was also stolen by someone, that bald Zhang is bullying me because I'm young. Damn, he looks so disgusting, a toad turned into a spirit?"</p><p></p><p>Forcibly suppressing the hunger and digesting the scattered memory fragments, Liang Qu felt disoriented.</p><p></p><p>The Jianghuai marshes nourish countless fishermen, but he has actually become one of them?</p><p></p><p>The yellowish polluted water, the jarring sirens, the painfully burning nasal mucosa, the huge bright spot cast on the water surface by the flashlight.</p><p></p><p>This is not a dream.</p><p></p><p>He really drowned while trying to save someone...</p><p></p><p>Right, rushing to finish the manuscript overnight, where would he have the energy to save someone, plunging into the water so clearly dressed.</p><p></p><p>"Too bad there's no child, otherwise I could have gotten extra points in the college entrance exam, winning at the starting line."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu collapsed on the bed, feeling the deep fatigue rising from the bottom of his heart, as if the traces of the past twenty-plus years had fallen like autumn leaves, never existing.</p><p></p><p>Nothing gained, nothing good, nothing accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Life is truly meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Gurgle.</p><p></p><p>Okay, it still has meaning, this is just too damn hungry.</p><p></p><p>Hunger drove Liang Qu to survive, and the crossing healed his severe myopia, like wiping away a layer of mist, making the surroundings exceptionally clear, but looking around, there was only a bed, a stove, and an empty barrel.</p><p></p><p>The dead memories attacked again.</p><p></p><p>"Scram, scram, scram, you're a useless bum, and you still want to borrow grain? My six children can't even eat their fill."</p><p></p><p>"You know, the autumn tax is coming soon."</p><p></p><p>No, first find some water.</p><p></p><p>The stomach pain constantly stimulated the nerves in his brain, Liang Qu gritted his teeth and slid off the bed, leaning on the yellow mud wall, shakily making his way outside, but after just a few steps, he was panting heavily and had to sit down on the threshold to rest.</p><p></p><p>"This is too weak."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was sweating cold, his palms unable to open, he found it hard to believe how weak his body was, could it be that he would have to die again right after arriving? The icy fear seemed to grip his heart like a giant hand.</p><p></p><p>All the talk about not fearing death after dying once is false, the fear of death is ingrained in human genes.</p><p></p><p>Clatter.</p><p></p><p>The wheel hubs rolled on the bluestone bricks, making a distinctive sound.</p><p></p><p>Someone's here!</p><p></p><p>His heart almost jumped out of his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Don't bother, just go around."</p><p></p><p>"How unlucky, don't get entangled with a hungry ghost."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hear clearly what the cart drivers were discussing, only the sound of the wheels fading away.</p><p></p><p>The words on the tip of his tongue were swallowed back, the darkness of the street was endless, and Liang Qu felt a chill rising from the bottom of his heart, his blood gradually cooling.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to find a well, but he no longer had the strength to take a step.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Shui, why are you sitting here?"</p><p></p><p>Ah Shui, who? Me?</p><p></p><p>Glancing over, a dark-skinned man was standing next to him, and Liang Qu blurted out, "Uncle Chen?"</p><p></p><p>His memory told him that the man in front of him was called Chen Qingjiang, his neighbor.</p><p></p><p>Right, I'm Ah Shui.</p><p></p><p>Two lifetimes with the same name, just because the character "Qu" contains the water radical, the villagers call him Ah Shui.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu steadied his breath, the previous incident made him too lazy to ask for help, and he said casually, "I'm just resting after walking, Uncle Chen, and you?"</p><p></p><p>"I just came back from selling fish in the town."</p><p></p><p>"The town?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, these days the fish are fat and sell well, of course I have to go to the town, it's too much trouble to sell at the fishing wharf, and I don't rent their boat, I can sell to whoever I want. But you, why are you sitting at the door resting, aren't you afraid of catching a cold?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang curiously drew closer, and after seeing Liang Qu's emaciated appearance, he was startled.</p><p></p><p>How could this be? In his shock, he suddenly remembered that Liang Qu had lost his father, and was probably running out of food at home. He instinctively reached into his pocket, but then hesitated.</p><p></p><p>There was a piece of meat bun, which he had brought after walking dozens of miles to sell the fish catch in the town.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luo earned eight coins, just enough to buy a bun for his crying little son to try.</p><p></p><p>It was already dark, and the bun was still warm in his bosom, but he had to hand it over to someone else right away. It was impossible not to feel heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"Father, why doesn't Water Brother come to play with me anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Because Water Brother's father has passed away, so he has no time to play with you."</p><p></p><p>"Why did he pass away?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Shun was the elder son of Chen Qingjiang, only six years old, who usually liked to play with Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang recalled when he was a teenager, Liang Qu was about the same age as his own child, and also liked to play with him, as if the figures were overlapping.</p><p></p><p>Sigh. Chen Qingjiang took a bun from his bosom and unwrapped the oiled paper.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Shui, eat it quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen! This?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's Adam's apple bobbed, thinking it was a dead end again, but to his surprise, there was a glimmer of hope. He wanted to say something, but the rich aroma was truly tempting, and he trembled as he took it.</p><p></p><p>His cracked lips oozed fresh blood, the metallic taste mingling with the fragrance of wheat oil and lard. He stuffed it all into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The little remaining saliva was squeezed out, mixing with the bun as it went down his throat. Liang Qu swallowed a few mouthfuls, regaining some strength, and quickly thanked him.</p><p></p><p>"Eat it, and hurry back home, don't linger at the door."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang brushed off his pants leg and stood up to leave, his mood even heavier now.</p><p></p><p>If it's like this now, won't it be even harder in the winter? Should he discuss it with his wife, and ration a few catties of grain? But the second child had just recovered from an illness, could they really spare it? The grass shoes scraped against the muddy road as he walked further away.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, so delicious!" </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu finished the last bite of the bun, watching Chen Qingjiang's retreating back, unable to call out.</p><p></p><p>In recent years of peace, a stone of rice was about a thousand coins.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Chen's family had five mouths to feed - an elder, two youngers, and a wife. In a season, they would need at least four stones of rice, totaling thirty-three coins per day just for the rice.</p><p></p><p>Spring fishing, autumn hunting, summer raising, winter fighting - in autumn when the grass was lush and the fish were fat, Uncle Chen's daily income was about eighty coins, which sounded decent, but was actually far from enough.</p><p></p><p>Cloth, salt, vegetables all cost money, and the fishing tax was even higher than the agricultural tax. Besides, there were various miscellaneous fees, not to mention the two coins per day for mooring at the pier, and four coins during the flood season. Income would plummet in the winter, and if someone fell ill during that time... This bun was probably the hard-earned treat Chen Qingjiang managed to scrape together for his child, but now it had become a lifesaving grace for Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>True friendship is revealed in times of adversity.</p><p></p><p>The night sky was filled with twinkling, sparkling stars.</p><p></p><p>The smog-shrouded small town couldn't possibly have such a beautiful scenery, which constantly reminded him - this was a completely different world.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu leaned against the wall, loneliness surging like the tides. He couldn't fish now, had no source of livelihood.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't think of how to survive, let alone boldly ask for help.</p><p></p><p>As for making money with modern technology, that was also difficult.</p><p></p><p>Glancing briefly at the empty street, many of the residential buildings had stepped gable walls, a typical sign that the era's productive forces had developed to a certain degree, allowing brick-and-stone structures to replace the old plank-built ones. The eaves no longer needed to extend out to shelter the walls, ultimately becoming fire-resistant gable walls taller than the eaves, to prevent the spread of fires.</p><p></p><p>If brick-and-stone structures were so widespread, the overall productive forces must be at least on par with the Ming and Qing dynasties of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>As a bottom-of-the-barrel commoner, Liang Qu hadn't seen much good stuff, but he knew things like white sugar, refined salt, horseshoes, steel smelting, and soap were basically irrelevant to him now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this world was not simple - he remembered a fierce man in the neighboring town who could punch through a human-sized granite boulder, far beyond normal human abilities.</p><p></p><p>But even if he had connections, it wouldn't help.</p><p></p><p>Why did the ancients love having male heirs? Just look at how the boat was stolen - without a strong laborer, one could be bullied to death.</p><p></p><p>If even a boat could be taken, what about saving up money? In ancient times, orphans had a hard time surviving, either being sold or waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>Damn, why did I get a fisherman start, and one who even had his boat stolen? Switching to a farmer would have been better!</p><p></p><p>Difficult, so difficult! Just then, a surge of clear energy suddenly pierced through Liang Qu's mind, and endless memories tumbled, like swallowing a whole pack of mint candies on a summer day, refreshing to the core.</p><p></p><p>What the hell? Liang Qu was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the strange sensation came and went quickly. As the anomaly in his mind gradually subsided, it was as if the clouds had parted to reveal the blue sky.</p><p></p><p>An oddly-shaped large cauldron emerged in his consciousness, its intricate mystical patterns intertwining, leaving him dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Its name - the Zhe Cauldron!

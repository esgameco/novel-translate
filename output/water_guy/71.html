        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The master is not here?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was kneeling on the ground, his collar being grasped tightly by Lady Xu, which was quite uncomfortable, but he didn't dare to struggle.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu was quite old, and it seemed she had not practiced any martial arts, so it would be unwise to hurt her.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, he's not here. He went to Chaojiang County and won't be back for ten days or half a month. Not only your master, but your second senior brother and fifth senior sister and sixth senior brother all went with him."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lowered his head, his brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they were not around, and would be gone for such a long time.</p><p></p><p>It felt like "there must be a conspiracy, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, mm?" Liang Qu nodded unconsciously, then quickly realized something was off and looked up at Lady Xu. "How does the Shimu know?"</p><p></p><p>"Luring the tiger away from the mountain." Lady Xu said calmly, "A few days ago, the Chaojiang County Magistrate sent his eldest son over, saying they had discovered a heretic of the Shuishu Sect, and the constables had been investigating for half a month, finally confirming the location. To prevent any accidents, they requested your master to go and stand guard. With one going ahead and the others following, how could there be so many coincidences?"</p><p></p><p>"What is the Shuishu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"An old dog hiding in the vast marshes, mostly remnants from the previous dynasty, pitiful creatures plotting to restore the country."</p><p></p><p>"Did the master agree?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the County Magistrate offered many benefits, and at the time we didn't realize anything was amiss."</p><p></p><p>"If it is indeed luring the tiger away from the mountain, then the County Magistrate must be involved as well?"</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say. If he is involved, informing us would be like startling the snake in the grass. If not, perhaps it is the Shuishu Sect's plot, wanting to make us doubt each other - both are possible."</p><p></p><p>Nan Di came over from the side, carrying a tray with a small medicine bottle.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu took it, pried open the red cap, and poured out three pills the size of fish eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Open your mouth."</p><p></p><p>"Shimu really doesn't need to."</p><p></p><p>"Open your mouth when I tell you to."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had no choice but to open his mouth, and one pill was placed in.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy."</p><p></p><p>Then Lady Xu directly pulled open the bandages on his shoulders and chest, crushing a pill in each hand and sprinkling the powder onto the wounds.</p><p></p><p>After taking the pill and applying the medicine, Liang Qu immediately felt a warm sensation in the wounds, and they started to heal at an astonishing speed, much faster than lotus roots. Extravagant, too extravagant - these were just minor injuries.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt pained, as he was poor and felt like he was wasting precious things.</p><p></p><p>"This bottle has a total of ten pills. Three have been used, the rest are all for you. Don't be stingy with the medicine when you're injured. No one knows when an accident might happen, you shouldn't let yourself be in a weakened state."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lowered his head: "Disciple has received the instruction."</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu leaned back in the armchair: "If it is indeed the Shuishu Sect, then I have some clues about the mountain ghosts. Do you know that mountain ghosts can gestate?"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it seems you have been diligently cultivating these days. The gestation of mountain ghosts is extremely fast, they can quickly drain the vital energy of their host. The stronger the host, the more blood energy they can absorb, and the stronger the mountain ghosts that hatch will be. If you can dig out the gestating fetus before it hatches, that would be an excellent medicinal ingredient.</p><p></p><p>If there is a skilled alchemist who knows how to refine it, they can fuse several gestating pills together and refine them into a Taizhuan Dan (Gestating Pearl Elixir). </p><p></p><p>The Shuishu Sect has done this kind of thing before, with remarkable effects. A hundred-person portion of Taizhuan Dan could instantly refine a normal person into a martial arts master on the level of a galloping horse, and the upper limit is unknown. At that time, they wiped out thousands of people from several villages.</p><p></p><p>The Taizu (Emperor) was furious and sent the veteran general Xu Youguang to lead the troops to exterminate them. I was just over ten years old then, but I remember it clearly. After that incident, the Shuishu Sect didn't appear for decades.</p><p></p><p>I suspect that the mountain ghosts in Yixing City may not be a coincidence, but rather hidden agents left behind by the Shuishu Sect. They were accidentally awakened by the commotion of your ritual to the River God."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was deeply worried. His little village still had to deal with such a powerful boss.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since it's about luring the tiger out of the mountain, can't we make the Shifu come back sooner?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Nine, you just said you crawled out of the mud, how can you be so naive? If it's really about luring the tiger out of the mountain, do you think they'll just let your Shifu come back?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what does the Shifu's wife think I should do?"</p><p></p><p>Mrs. Xu rolled her eyes, "How would I know? I'm just a helpless old woman who knows more because I read a lot of books. For this kind of thing, you should ask your Shixiongs. With Small Two, Small Five, and Small Six not here, don't you still have Small Three, Small Four, Small Seven, and Small Eight? Five grown men, and you want me, an old wife, to come up with a plan? How embarrassing!"</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, there's no time to waste, I'll go to the martial arts hall to discuss with my Shixiongs."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was about to leave, but was pulled back by Mrs. Xu.</p><p></p><p>"What's the hurry? Have dinner first before leaving. I guess I'm right, they won't dare to make a move for a while. Your Shifu has only been gone for two days, they're afraid he might come back and take revenge."</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder she's the wife of the great Tiger Hunting Shifu, even without martial arts training, she's so steady and has the bearing of a great general.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I have a friend waiting for me outside to watch the boats."</p><p></p><p>"Send a servant to look after him, and have your friend come over to eat with us."</p><p></p><p>"Is that alright?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll go call him."</p><p></p><p>"If you dare to sneak away, don't ever come through this door again."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stumbled over the threshold, hurriedly going to the riverbank to call Chen Jie-chang.</p><p></p><p>"This, this, it's too kind, I'm deeply grateful."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang, still dazed, left the Yang mansion, tightly clutching the two small medicine bottles, afraid to let them go, lest they fall and get damaged.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he get to eat many mountain and sea delicacies, but he also received two precious elixir bottles!</p><p></p><p>At the dinner table, Mrs. Xu heard that Chen Jie-chang and Li Li-bo had greatly helped Liang Qu when they were killing the mountain ghosts, so she was not stingy, immediately giving out two bottles of Blood Qi Elixir, one for each of them. One bottle is equivalent to a 10-pound red bass! Combined with the medicinal soup from the martial arts hall, the two of them have a chance to become true martial artists!</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang gratefully said, "Ah Shui, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what are you thanking me for? If you want to thank someone, thank my Shifu's wife. I should be thanking you too, if it weren't for you two handing me the knife, I would have been in real danger."</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to do something."</p><p></p><p>"That's enough."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu patted Chen Jie-chang's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Between men, there's no need for so many words, a single action is enough.</p><p></p><p>Back at the martial arts hall, Liang Qu told Xiang Chang-song and Hu Qi about his conversation with Mrs. Xu.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Chang-song crossed his arms over his chest, stroking his chin with one hand, "Water Bathing Sect? I have no impression of it, never heard of it before."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard some rumors, more or less the same as what Shifu's wife knows. Apparently, that Fetal Pearl Elixir created over a dozen galloping martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Combining the Water Bathing Sect's battle formation techniques, they were able to stubbornly resist the attacks of three Wolf Smoke martial artists. The key is the rapid cultivation, as long as they can pile up enough human lives, they can continuously produce martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Chang-song shook his head, "The records may not be accurate. If they were ordinary people without any martial arts foundation or realm understanding, how could they suddenly combine together and coordinate a formation to resist three martial artists at a higher realm? That's too far-fetched."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I think perhaps those dozen or so were originally flesh and blood or breakthrough martial artists, and after obtaining the Fetal Pearl Elixir, their strength suddenly increased, which is why the effect was so remarkable. In any case, the Fetal Pearl Elixir is very powerful, but not to that exaggerated extent."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Chang-song nodded, "According to Little Nine's account, the only problem now is to find the mastermind, force them to reveal the locations and plans of all the mountain ghosts, and then eliminate them. Is that right?"</p><p></p><p>"The problem is, we don't know where the mastermind is. In addition, should we also request assistance from the other two martial arts halls?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

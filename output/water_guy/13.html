        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His skin had become smoother, and his body had grown a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>More than an hour later, the warm feeling in his stomach had dissipated, and Liang Qu carefully compared the reflection in the water, finding that he had become more handsome.</p><p></p><p>He was still a bit dark, but his originally rough skin had become much more refined, making him look very heroic. He clenched his fist and could clearly feel that he had more strength, swinging it around with a fierce vigor.</p><p></p><p>If one could say that Liang Qu had previously grown up on coarse grains and vegetable scraps, then after eating the precious fish, he had become one who grew up on meat, eggs, and milk. Both were healthy developments, but the latter was of a completely different caliber, with a completely different mental outlook.</p><p></p><p>It felt so comfortable, the sensation of being filled with power throughout his body was amazing.</p><p></p><p>He could jump higher, run faster, and his breathing was more relaxed, as if his entire body had become lighter.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder a precious fish can be favored by martial arts masters, it is truly a divine object that nourishes the foundation and cultivates the body and spirit. If I had a hundred of them, I wouldn't even need to go to a martial arts school, I could just advance through the four stages of skin, flesh, bone, and blood by myself."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stood up, put on his clothes, and confirmed that the overly nourished redness on his face had dissipated. Without much effort, he rowed the boat back to the dock, eager to sell the precious fish in his hands and obtain the funds to advance his status.</p><p></p><p>However, before he even reached the shore to pay the mooring fee, he saw a large crowd gathered on the shore, bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>What day was it? Wasn't the Moon Festival just last month? What other holiday was he unaware of?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu put down the oar, picked up the pole, and approached the dock, where someone came to collect the fee. He took two coins from his pocket and paid, then looked around the crowd, quickly spotting the tall figure of Li Liboa.</p><p></p><p>Of course, where there was excitement, Li Liboa would be there, as he was a lover of old-fashioned entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pulled him out of the crowd and asked, "What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh, who are you?" Li Liboa, displeased at being pulled from the crowd, couldn't resist Liang Qu's powerful grip. Baring his teeth, he stepped out of the group and turned back to see that it was Liang Qu. "How come it's you, kid? What kind of medicine have you been taking, your grip is so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu remained unfazed. "You still haven't told me what's happening with all these people."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you've come at the right time. Someone on our dock has also caught a precious fish! It looks like a black fish but has a reddish body, weighing two jin and three liang and six qian. There have been people catching them before, calling them 'red perch.' One jin is worth one liang of silver!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa boasted proudly, as if the precious fish had been caught by him, completely oblivious to the change in Liang Qu's expression.</p><p></p><p>Precious fish were not that rare, with one or two lucky people catching them in a dock every month, but Liang Qu didn't expect it to happen so coincidentally, just as he was about to sell his own precious fish.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it didn't matter, as precious fish were in high demand. Even if they collided, it wouldn't affect anything, and maybe the martial arts master would be happy to buy two at once and give a little more silver.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu cleared his throat and called out to the crowd, "Our Shangrao dock has truly been blessed by the river god, catching two precious fish in one day!"</p><p></p><p>The nearby Li Liboa, whose ears were hurt by the shout, retorted, "What are you talking about? Chen Jie-chang only caught one precious fish!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the crowd's gaze shifted to Liang Qu, and he lifted the fish basket, pulling out the horned bream by the gill and holding it up high.</p><p></p><p>"The second one I'm talking about is this one, not his!"</p><p></p><p>A commotion erupted among the onlookers. The original unified circle of onlookers instantly split into two.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this just a bream?"</p><p>"No, it's not a bream, look closely, it has horns on its head!"</p><p>"That's right, it has horns on its head, it must be a precious fish!"</p><p></p><p>After confirmation from the surrounding people, the already lively dock became even more bustling, with more and more people gathering to catch a glimpse of the precious fish with its unique horned appearance.</p><p></p><p>The precious fish they had heard about before were usually of unusual coloration and patterns, but today there was one with an abnormal form, with horns on its head!</p><p></p><p>"Who caught it?"</p><p>"It was Shui, the son of Old Liang's family! He's quite skilled at fishing, catching over 30 fish a day."</p><p>"Old Liang? The one who passed away last month? His luck is too good, isn't it?"</p><p>"The Liang family's fate shouldn't have been cut short!"</p><p>"Awesome, a precious fish, enough to feed me for several months! If I could catch one, I'd have no regrets even in death."</p><p>"If you caught one, the money would end up in the hands of the old folks in the alley anyway."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, haha!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was lively and bustling, as it was quite rare for two precious fish to be caught at the same dock in a single day. Everyone was trying to bask in the good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu scanned the crowd and noticed the envy and naked desire in everyone's eyes. He had never imagined that the descriptions in novels could actually be true - that he could really witness such a scene.</p><p></p><p>"A-Shui, I have an unmarried daughter at home. How about I give her to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, isn't your daughter only nine years old?" Seeing the speaker was Chen Yi, whom he had met before, Liang Qu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"His family won't do. You're too good-looking a young man for them. Come to my place, let me show you my daughter."</p><p></p><p>"Cut it out, Er Shi. Your daughter is already eighteen."</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know that a grown-up girl is worth her weight in gold?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang could support a large family on his own. As a handsome orphan with strong fishing skills, Liang Qu was the most sought-after catch. Any family with a daughter would want to snatch him up.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the carriage that had avoided him when he first arrived, it hadn't even been a month yet, and Liang Qu had already experienced what it meant for the tables to turn.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu harbored no resentment. When poor, one can only look after oneself - such is the helplessness of the lower class.</p><p></p><p>Amid the crowd's swarming, Er Tong squeezed back into Yi Tong.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu saw Chen Jiechangwho had also caught the precious fish. Around twenty years old, tall and dark-skinned, like all the fishermen. Chen was known as the best fisherman in the Shangrao dock, even better than Uncle Chen, earning over a hundred coins a day.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu, Chen Jie-chang, whose spotlight had been divided between the two of them, was naturally displeased, but not too much, maintaining a polite smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>This was the joy of the villagers - if I'm doing better than you, I'm content; if not, I'm uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's second uncle from his previous life had graduated from a prestigious university, but was always frowning, just because he had scored higher than his grandson. He would say that professional skills were more important than university degrees, only to later claim that connections mattered more than anything after graduation.</p><p></p><p>The two men glanced at each other's precious fish.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang's fish was similar to a black fish, but its color was completely different - a vivid scarlet, like freshly spilled blood. It was a striking color.</p><p></p><p>"The Master Warrior has arrived! The Master Warrior has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Make way, make way!"</p><p></p><p>"The Master Warrior has come to see the precious fish!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd parted, and Liang Qu and Chen Jie-chang looked up to see three men approaching, all male and significantly taller and more upright than the common folk around them.</p><p></p><p>Were these the "Master Warriors"? They should just be "Warriors," as only those who had broken through the four gates could be called "Master Warriors," and there were few of those in the entire Pingyang Town. The ordinary people had little knowledge, so they simply lumped the two together, perhaps knowing the difference but still using the term.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the three introduced himself as Hu, saying he was just passing through Pingyang Town to Yixing City, and had heard about the precious fish at the dock, so he had come to take a look. If they were indeed as described, he would buy them.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang quickly called out, "Master Warrior, take a look at mine."</p><p></p><p>Master Warrior Hu went to Chen Jie-chang and glanced at the fish: "Red-blooded perch, quite heavy."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang nervously replied, "Two jin, seven liang, six qian!"</p><p></p><p>"Will you sell it for three liang of silver?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang beamed with joy. Three liang of silver was enough to feed his family for over a year. Last month, the three jin, six liang tiger-headed bass from the neighboring dock had only sold for three liang, five qian, so his red-blooded perch was clearly worth more!</p><p></p><p>Hu took the fish and paid without even weighing it, obviously confident the other party wouldn't dare to cheat him.</p><p></p><p>He then came to Liang Qu and, seeing the horns on the pomfret, expressed surprise: "Horned pomfret? That's quite rare. How much does it weigh?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, observing Hu's expression, replied with a slight bow, "Three jin, two liang, one qian."</p><p></p><p>Earlier, when the crowd had been gathered to watch the excitement, he had already had someone help weigh the fish, so there was no mistake.</p><p></p><p>"Six liang, five qian. Will you sell it?"</p><p></p><p>"Six liang?"</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Chen Jie-chang stopped in his tracks, and the surrounding fishermen fell silent.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

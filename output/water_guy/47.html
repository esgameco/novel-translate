        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Sacrificial rituals, require money? Hearing that money was required, Liang Qu's brow unconsciously furrowed.</p><p></p><p>In the old days, fishermen, due to their primitive fishing tools, were under great threat to their personal safety on the water during storms. Thus, they revered the legendary sea gods as the protectors of life and the bestowers of bountiful harvests.</p><p></p><p>The frequency was quite high, about twice a year, once in the winter and spring, and once on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month.</p><p></p><p>The winter and spring occasions were not fixed, and the reasons for holding them were often like the one from the previous night.</p><p></p><p>But when you talk about having to pay money, Liang Qu understood that the river god Li Shu mentioned was the same great monster he had seen the previous night. To ordinary people, there was no difference, they were all powerful beings that humans could not contend with.</p><p></p><p>He was not very willing in his heart, but there was no way around it. If you didn't pay money for the sacrificial rituals to the river god, even a scoundrel like Lai Tou Zhang wouldn't dare to do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, about how much will it cost?"</p><p></p><p>Li Dakang thought for a moment: "This time, I haven't heard of anyone dying, so if there's a healthy adult male in the family, it'll be around a hundred coins. That's been the standard in previous years, except for the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, when it's a bit more elaborate and they'll ask for a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let out a sigh of relief. The silver Yang Shi had given him last time still had three taels left, which was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>However, the boat still had to be contributed.</p><p></p><p>There were "quite a few" boats moored on the shore, but not all of them, and there were many people on the dock trying to make a living, not caring if they got "eaten" by the so-called river god.</p><p></p><p>Faced with Li Dakang's kindness, Liang Qu apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you child, why won't you listen to advice? What difference would a couple of days make?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Li, you probably don't know, but Water Brother went out fishing last night even in the heavy rain, and he still came back safely. He must have seen what the great monster looked like." Lin Songbao walked over from the side, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Songbao? What nonsense are you spouting? It's the river god, the river god!"</p><p></p><p>Some anxious fishermen rushed to cover Lin Songbao's mouth, but he dodged and ran away, so they couldn't catch him.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't they all the same? Last year we saw that big wide fish, taller than a boat and even bigger. You all said it was the river god. And the year before that, that water tiger fish, its single tooth was bigger than a person, you couldn't even wrap your arms around it.</p><p></p><p>Every year there's something, from the time I was born until now, I've never seen the same thing twice. I reckon a single river can't have that many river gods, they must be great monsters fighting with each other, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Dakang stomped his foot and beat his chest: "Utterly lacking in reverence, utterly lacking in reverence!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Cheng next to him reacted quickly and hurriedly asked, "Water, did you really go out fishing last night?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't hide it, it wasn't a big deal. Surely many people had seen the great monster, otherwise it wouldn't be so widely known now.</p><p></p><p>"Last night I was quite close, when that 'river god' fell into the water, the waves were so big, if I hadn't held on tight, the boat might have capsized. Afterwards, I hurried back without catching a single fish."</p><p></p><p>Li Dakang said with lingering fear: "That was too dangerous, truly too dangerous. Fortunately, you were far away, if you had been closer, wouldn't you have been eaten?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao laughed loudly: "That's not so exaggerated. How big is a person compared to a great monster? Eating a person is like eating a grain of rice, that big mouth would just be tiring for it."</p><p></p><p>Li Dakang felt very uncomfortable: "You child, how can you speak like that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao picked at his ear, pretending not to hear, and came up to lean on Liang Qu: "Water Brother, I've been waiting for you for a long time. If I hadn't seen your boat at the dock, I would have gone to your house to look for you."</p><p></p><p>Water Brother?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao had never called him that before, even when he said he would pay the difference the other day, he had just called him Ah Shui.</p><p></p><p>"So you've been waiting for me? Do you have something to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I just wanted to ask if you have time recently. My father wants to invite you to a meal, how about it? He said you can choose the time and place."</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear some news?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Lin Songbao scratched his head. "My father didn't tell me, he said I have a big mouth and can't keep secrets, and he won't let me know the news he doesn't tell you. But he did tell me that you have great prospects in Pingyang Town, and that I should call you Water Brother when I meet you."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pondered this thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The city of Yixing and the town of Pingyang were quite close, but still separated by over ten miles. The incident that occurred that night was very isolated, with only the martial arts school disciples knowing about it, and most of them were staying in the dormitories, so it would take some time for the news to spread.</p><p></p><p>The manager of the fishing shed, Lin Di, apparently had his own channels of information. Lin Songbao urged, "How is it, can we do it or not? Give me an answer so I can go back and tell my father."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's do it tomorrow night. The location is up to you, just come tell me when it's set."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did not refuse. He missed his own covered boat a little, and perhaps this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The small sampan had no canopy, and when it rained, the cabin would fill with water. It was nowhere as good as the covered boat.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go out with the boat."</p><p></p><p>"I'll come find you tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The surface of the river was calm, reflecting the starlight and moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The oar stirred the surface of the lake, making a splashing sound.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>The oar striking the water surface produced a dull, resonating sound that traveled far across the waves.</p><p></p><p>Ripples appeared on the water surface. An unmoving creature emerged, its scales glimmering a cold, hard blue in the shimmering moonlight.</p><p></p><p>After a day, the unmoving creature had grown even longer, reaching nearly 3 meters in its exaggerated size, swimming alongside the boat, enough to inspire fear in any Yangtze River fisherman. Ordinary people would never believe it was a Taihua alligator.</p><p></p><p>But now, the unmoving creature floated calmly on the surface, with a small crab-like creature tapping on its back.</p><p></p><p>The crab-like creature was bubbling, its pearly white shell much harder now, starting to turn slightly blue, the tapping sound taking on a more metallic quality. Its size had also increased significantly, from fist-sized to now larger than a fist.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the true demon the night before, Liang Qu realized that the crab-like creature was merely the lowest rung on the ecological ladder of spirit creatures.</p><p></p><p>Its young would surely grow rapidly, especially with ample nutrition. Otherwise, it would be difficult to survive in the competitive deep waters.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this crab-like creature had come to the shallows to try and lay and hatch its young in a safer place.</p><p></p><p>At this growth rate, in less than two months, its claws would become useful, no longer just an immobile ornament on its head.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, it was quite interesting. Thanks to the scales on the unmoving creature, the claws could easily grip its body, the two becoming inseparable.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the smooth blue back of the fat catfish made it unable to stand steady.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>Speak of the devil, the fat catfish surfaced, water flowing off its smooth blue back into the lake. It raised its head and spat a water jet at the claws, knocking them into the water.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its scheme succeed, the fat catfish rolled over, exposing its white belly, seemingly "laughing heartily", its long whiskers trembling.</p><p></p><p>The claws, falling into the water, swam like a lobster, curling up its lower body and darting quickly towards the fat catfish's whiskers, clamping down on them.</p><p></p><p>The catfish's whiskers were fleshy, and it immediately felt the pain, thrashing wildly in the water.</p><p></p><p>The catfish was already over 3 meters long, its thick skin concealing powerful muscles. Its explosive strength made it unrivaled in the water.</p><p></p><p>Now, it thrashed its body like a water dragon, spraying water everywhere, quite a startling sight.</p><p></p><p>Only the unmoving creature remained calm and unperturbed beside them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two beasts getting more and more rambunctious, to the point of filling the boat with water, Liang Qu immediately shouted to stop them, and the two creatures ceased their scuffle.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, go catch some fish for me, as many valuable ones as possible, like carp and yellow croaker, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The catfish swished its whiskers, indicating it understood.</p><p></p><p>The growth of these two creatures had brought them higher intelligence. Now they could not only recognize the "special" treasure fish, but also distinguish various expensive fish species.</p><p></p><p>As a direct disciple of Master Yang, if Liang Qu could catch 300 coins worth of fish on this boat trip, that wouldn't be too much, would it?

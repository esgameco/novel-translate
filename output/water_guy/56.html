        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The commotion on the dock drew many people's attention, and the attendants at the nearby teahouse even threw their towels over their shoulders and leaned in to listen.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu frowned and asked, "Uncle Chen, did something big happen? What big thing happened?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, it looks really scary. A blue-robed old master came in person, and he was dressed in the finest silks and satins! And someone was even kneeling at your door! Ah Shui, did you get yourself into some kind of trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu hadn't even responded yet when Chen Qingjiang was the first to angrily scold, spitting at Chen Yi: "Ptui, how could Ah Shui get himself into any trouble? Chen Yi, what nonsense are you spouting?"</p><p></p><p>"How would I know, but I really did see those clothes, they were so shiny and smooth, the color was bluer than the sky, it couldn't have been cheap, not something an ordinary person could afford. I reckon that one bolt of cloth must have cost at least a tael of silver! A whole tael of silver!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was much better at fishing than Chen Yi, and he had two sons as well. Though they were of the same clan, Chen Yi was inferior in every way. After being scolded, Chen Yi's voice lowered, but he still stubbornly raised a finger, turning it in a circle for everyone to see, using all the words in his vocabulary to describe the luxurious attire of the visitor.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding fishermen were all in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"A tael of silver? That one outfit must be worth four or five taels then?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange, that's not clothing, that's pure silver!"</p><p></p><p>"Did Ah Shui offend some big shot?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang shouted loudly, "What are you all babbling about? How could Ah Shui offend anyone? Since they're kneeling, maybe they're here to apologize!"</p><p></p><p>But Chen Yi suddenly found his courage: "Hah, apologize? An old master? Chen Qingjiang, have you lost your mind?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop yelling, whether it's true or not, let's go take a look." Liang Qu put down his oar, telling Uncle Chen to stay and watch the boat, and also to sell the catch.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to go take a look too, if something really happened, the more people the better."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Liang Qu couldn't refuse, and he turned to shout at the fishing pen, "Sonbao, can you watch the boat for me?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure thing! Don't worry!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Sonbao had already been standing by the door watching the show. Hearing the request, he immediately came down, not the least bit flustered by the supposed calamity.</p><p></p><p>Last night's dinner had finally made it clear to him what his father's "big opportunity" was all about. </p><p></p><p>Lin Sonbao understood Liang Qu's disciple's worth far better than Chen Qingjiang. In the remote corners of Yixing City and Pingyang Town, who could possibly threaten Liang Qu? Unless some imperial envoy had suddenly lost their mind and decided to come admire the scenery of the Jianghuai region, and Liang Qu had also lost his mind and provoked them, Yang Donghong would be the only one who could possibly not handle it.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu jumped ashore, leading the group, with Chen Qingjiang following behind, and Chen Yi also tagging along. Behind them were many curious villagers, some gleefully anticipating misfortune, others with worried hearts.</p><p></p><p>Many people heard the commotion and came out of their houses to ask what was happening, causing the procession to grow even larger.</p><p></p><p>In a certain house, a crack opened in the door, revealing a few pairs of eyes. The tallest one saw the group passing by and narrowed his eyes slightly: "That kid, I really thought going to the martial arts school would bring him big opportunities, but look at this, I knew he'd get into trouble, and now they've even come to his door."</p><p></p><p>The second eye suddenly widened: "No, when did you ever say that?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian was displeased: "I said it before, you just don't remember. That kid made a lot of money, but he didn't even come visit his uncle once. He doesn't understand a thing about human relationships. I said early on that he would get into trouble, and look, I was right."</p><p></p><p>"But didn't we also refuse to lend him grain before? How could he come visit you?"</p><p></p><p>"That's different! Lending grain, you think he'd ever pay it back? You don't understand anything!" Liang Guangtian was enraged, his words contradictory, and after throwing out a line about women not understanding anything, he rushed out the door.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to take a look, can't let this kid cause a big ruckus and implicate me."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, wait for me, I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>"Go do what, aren't you supposed to be making dinner?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll be hungry a little later, why are you in such a hurry?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan paced in front of Liang Qu's doorway, his gaze occasionally glancing at the dilapidated mud-brick house, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>Many people, after becoming famous, often describe their past as extremely miserable.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan had thought that the servant's words were exaggerated, just hearsay, but he never imagined it would be so broken, so destitute.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan did not look down on it, on the contrary, he dared not underestimate this little fisherman from Yixing.</p><p></p><p>What is a fisherman? They are far inferior to even farmers! The vast majority of fishermen's lifelong dream is to save money to buy farmland and become a farmer! At such a young age, to be able to become Yang Dongxiong's disciple, what a future he will have! If I befriend him now, what a future I will have?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xue Chengquan couldn't help but slap the back of Xue Dingyi's head, slapping it loudly.</p><p></p><p>Ungrateful son, ungrateful son! </p><p></p><p>Before even befriending him, he had to make him an enemy first. Thinking of how adept he is at navigating, how he has developed the family business to its current state, how could he have produced such a thing, bullying people not for money, but for fun? As his father, he feels like a beast!</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi knelt on the ground, his head tilted left and right from the blows, silent. His buttocks were now rotten, the pain piercing.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding neighbors all secretly peeked through the cracks in their doors, and Adi next door was no exception, but she dared not go out, afraid that her gaze would provoke the great man's displeasure.</p><p></p><p>Rapid footsteps appeared on the blue stone street, and Xue Chengquan looked up to see the most eye-catching young man in the crowd, praising, "A true talent! Truly a talent! Lofty and graceful, no wonder he became Yang Shifu's disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was taken aback, vaguely feeling like he had heard these words before, and forgot what he wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>However, he saw Xue Dingyi kneeling on the ground, his face still bruised and swollen. </p><p></p><p>On the training ground, he had struck Xue Dingyi's face with a stick, and it still hadn't healed.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in the blur, he could still make out the similar features between Xue Chengquan and Xue Dingyi, and could roughly guess the identity of the man before him.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan cupped his hands in salute: "My unruly son, I never imagined he could commit such ugly and dirty acts. It is truly my failure in educating him. Today I have come, hoping that Young Master Liang will discipline him properly. No matter how he is beaten or scolded, I will let him endure it. Even if Young Master Liang wants to beat him to death, I will have no complaints!"</p><p></p><p>A twig, from where it came no one knew, was held up by Xue Chengquan, offered with both hands.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Chen Yi was also completely bewildered, what was going on, how was it completely different from what he had imagined?</p><p></p><p>The one kneeling on the ground was the son of the blue-robed gentleman, but why was the blue-robed gentleman so respectful towards Liang Qu?</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian in the crowd was also dumbfounded, hurriedly asking someone, was there something he had missed hearing?</p><p></p><p>The other person glanced at Liang Guangtian and exclaimed, "Liang Guangtian? Isn't Ashi your nephew? You don't even know, and you're asking me?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian looked embarrassed: "That kid is cold-hearted and unfilial, he never comes to our family, how could I as his uncle know?"</p><p></p><p>"Come on, didn't you see that Ashi brought out a stone of rice to save the Chen Qingjiang family during the autumn tax season? You didn't know? It's you who's cold-hearted and unfilial, not him. Without the officials watching, you'd even dare to mix chaff into the grain tax, having money to drink but not to lend grain, what a character."</p><p></p><p>"You! How dare you speak like that?"</p><p></p><p>But the person no longer paid attention to Liang Guangtian, and went to the front to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Father! Father! Don't hit me, don't hit me, I know I was wrong, I really know I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the ground, Xue Dingyi was terrified, being beaten at home and now being beaten outside? He hurriedly moved his legs, ignoring the pain in his wounds, hugging Xue Chengquan's legs. His buttocks were really rotten, if it weren't for the medicine and bandages applied this morning, he would still be bleeding.</p><p></p><p>But Xue Chengquan remained unmoved, bending over, waiting for Liang Qu to take the twig.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi, tears streaming down his face, could only crawl and hug Liang Qu's legs: "Brother Liang, Brother Liang, I beg you, I beg you, I really know I was wrong, I really know I was wrong. I will be your ox and horse in the future, please spare me this once, please spare me this once, I will never dare again."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

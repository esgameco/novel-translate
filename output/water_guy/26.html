        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu wanted to reclaim his territory.</p><p></p><p>Last time after eating the precious fish, his fusion with the Zeiling had increased to a remarkable 11.7, allowing him to control water flows of nearly 70 pounds of force, and further extending his underwater activity time.</p><p></p><p>The most critical change was in his sensory range - the detailed perception range remained the same, but the rough perception range had expanded by a meter, reaching a sizable spherical range of 6 meters.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he had been training in martial arts for half a month, no longer the weak and fragile fisherman he once was.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Pig Witch Dragon and the Fat Catfish, he was virtually unmatched in the shallow waters.</p><p></p><p>He believed the monster trying to seize his territory would not be too strong, otherwise it would not have just watched as the Fat Catfish took away the most precious lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>Today the river wind was quite strong, so Liang Qu sank some stones tied to ropes to prevent his boat from drifting away, then took his wooden spear and pig urine bladder and entered the water, following the two beasts back to the lotus root site at the bottom of the river.</p><p></p><p>It was quiet underwater.</p><p></p><p>Sunlight penetrated the water layers, scattering into fine bright lines and providing decent visibility.</p><p></p><p>The muddy bottom was strewn with scattered rocks, with unnamed plants growing in the crevices, their long filaments swaying gently with the current.</p><p></p><p>Unable to move, he crawled along the ground, advancing cautiously, still wary of the so-called big creature, not even daring to brush off the water plants clinging to his head.</p><p></p><p>The Fat Catfish beside him was also lying low on the ground, slowly swaying its tail to minimize water disturbance.</p><p></p><p>Many perceptive fish could detect changes in water flow, so if he moved too quickly, there was a real chance of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu also slowed his pace, trudging through the undulating mud, and after crossing a large boulder, he saw the sprawling lotus root patches on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts sent a reminder through their mental link.</p><p></p><p>They were getting close.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu crouched down, crossing another slightly uneven mud area, when an irregular shape came into view, motionless, standing out like a protruding black rock, about a meter tall from a visual perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Is that a rock? Is that the monster?" </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was certain this rock-like object was not there before, and he looked to the Unmoving and the Fat Catfish, receiving their confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Strange, he couldn't tell what kind of creature it was, just like a rock, completely lacking the elongated fish-like form of aquatic life.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be claiming this area as its own territory, just like the Unmoving had done initially.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a crustacean?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>Only crustaceans had such a peculiar shape, lying flat like a massive boulder.</p><p></p><p>Bubble, bubble.</p><p></p><p>Numerous bubbles were rising from a certain part of the "rock," confirming it was indeed some kind of crustacean.</p><p></p><p>What kind of crustacean could be that large, it couldn't have become a demonic beast, could it?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was startled. In all his time in this world, he knew there were demonic beasts in existence.</p><p></p><p>He had thought the two beasts would not be able to handle a 4-5 meter long crocodile or something else, but he never imagined it would be a demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the large patch of lotus roots that had been consumed, he frowned.</p><p></p><p>After finally finding this precious plant, how could he let this demonic beast take it? Everything had been progressing so well, yet now a demonic beast had come to occupy his most valuable resource.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu gripped his spear tightly.</p><p></p><p>If he could kill a demonic beast, how much water essence could it contribute? Tens, or even dozens? He suddenly had a thought, only to be horrified by his own idea.</p><p></p><p>But this was a demonic beast, not an ordinary water creature! Perhaps it was not impossible?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's thoughts were jumping and diverging.</p><p></p><p>Crustaceans also had many weaknesses, such as the abdomen, which could be easily pierced with a single spear. And their exposed eyes, as a visual creature, would be a critical vulnerability if blinded.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it did not seem very strong, otherwise it would not have just watched as the Fat Catfish took away the best lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more unsettled he became, his grip on the spear constantly tightening and loosening.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He always remembered the words his university mentor had once said.</p><p></p><p>"To change your life, you must take risks. Meaningful things often happen by chance, while unimportant things are carefully planned."</p><p></p><p>Risk-taking, a word that has permeated human development.</p><p></p><p>Dangerous yet alluring.</p><p></p><p>He was not satisfied!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take back what was his! Liang Qu clenched his fists, the flowing water bursting from between his fingers, scattering into white foam.</p><p></p><p>He had never had the habit of letting go of things he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu had stolen his boat, so Zhang Tieniu had to die.</p><p></p><p>Since he now had a certain chance, he would gamble, bet on who had the greater skills - him or the supernatural creature!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yang family martial arts school, Li Libo and Chen Jiechangwere practicing, trying out the techniques of the Three Fist Methods.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Liang Qu who had learned all three fist methods, Li Liboonly learned the Ape Fist and Tiger Fist, and Chen Jiechanghad only learned the Tiger Fist. The remaining two did not plan to learn the other two methods, but rather focused on cultivating their inner qi.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, Lu Shao did not teach them wholeheartedly, and on the other hand, Liang Qu's learning speed was there for all to see, making the two feel somewhat anxious. Anyway, even if they learned the remaining two, it would only serve to broaden their horizons, and in the end they would still focus on practicing the Ape Fist and Tiger Fist that suited them best.</p><p></p><p>The two simply gave up, planning to spend more time improving themselves, and see if they could break through the barrier within three months, and then stay at the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>If they could break through, it would be almost like rising above the common people.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in Pingyang Town, a warrior who had only broken through one barrier would be insignificant, not even worthy of tax relief, but in Yixing City it would be enough, greatly improving their quality of life.</p><p></p><p>The simplest thing would be the problem of farming and watering. If there were disputes, how would they be resolved? The two sides would naturally want to find someone to help, but who would they turn to?</p><p></p><p>The farmers in Yixing City would naturally think of the warrior who had broken through the barrier in the village, but would they help for free? You'd have to bring a few pecks of rice, wouldn't you?</p><p></p><p>Over time, the prestige would grow, and would the village chief still have the nerve to just sit around and do nothing?</p><p></p><p>The rise of a small place does not require too much complexity. Right now the two are still just fish sellers, but who knows what the future holds.</p><p></p><p>The two harbored hopes for a better future and trained feverishly.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you two over there, your stench is so disgusting, can you get lost?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangpaused in their movements, and after a moment, continued with their own business, but their movements were visibly "weakened".</p><p></p><p>"Can't you hear? I'm talking to you two! You fish sellers!"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like their ears aren't working either."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>On the side of the training ground, three young men were squatting, pointing and laughing.</p><p></p><p>Others who saw it did not step forward.</p><p></p><p>"Your words are too harsh, Lu Tingcai." Another person came over.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Li Liboand Chen Jiechangfelt relieved, exchanging a glance and letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The young man called Lu Tingcai pulled up his pants leg, spreading his legs as he sat on the bench, sliding down. He tilted his head, "Then, Xue Dingyi, can't you smell it?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true." The young man who had seemed to be trying to stop them suddenly broke into a smile. "Then let's just tell them to get lost!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangwere stunned, the muscles on the sides of their faces bulging, a mix of shame, anger and inferiority welling up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they came to the training ground, they always chose the most corner position, carefully avoiding the crowd, but they had never been so humiliated before.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had no grievances, why...</p><p></p><p>"How about this." Lu Tingcai suddenly stood up and walked towards the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangonly then realized that this man was terrifyingly tall, almost six and a half feet. When he approached, they had to look up at him!</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai looked down from above, baring his teeth in a grin: "As a tolerance for you to continue staying here, two taels of silver each, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>Next to them, Lu Shao seemed to treat the scene in front of him as mere air, continuing to lift the stone lock on his own.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

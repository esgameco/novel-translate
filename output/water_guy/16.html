        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Refine?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, refine, refine with all your might, make your strength boundless, to the point where even a casual touch would injure, and a slight collision would be fatal - only then can you be called a true master."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu followed behind Xiang Changsong, and couldn't help but smile wryly at these words.</p><p></p><p>Refining the physical body to sainthood, huh? But the key is how to refine it!</p><p></p><p>The top-level Olympic athlete from his previous life had told Liang Qu that the human body has its limits, and without special techniques, it's impossible to break rocks or split stones with just the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong's next words proved this point.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, no matter how much an ordinary person refines, there is a limit. Being able to match ten people would be the peak. To break through this limit, there are two indispensable things - the technique and the medicine!"</p><p></p><p>"Technique and medicine?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the technique is the cultivation method, for example, once you join our Yang family martial arts school, you will be given the Three Fist Technique to practice, and that will provide you with the ladder to ascend."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu asked, "Then what about the medicine?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong replied, "The technique provides the ladder to ascend, but this ladder is steep, dangerous, and treacherous! In such a case, you will need a handrail to walk quickly and steadily, without falling and shattering your bones - that is the medicine!"</p><p></p><p>"You two have come from Yixing City, so I presume you've heard the news about the two precious fish caught at the Yixing City docks yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu clasped his hands and said, "Senior Brother Xiang, to be honest, one of those two precious fish was caught by me, a three-jin-plus yellow croaker, which I sold for six liang and five qian, and with some savings, I was able to gather the money to come and learn martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong was taken aback, realizing that the seven liang he had just handed over was likely the money from selling that precious fish, and he smiled, "Liang Shidi, you do have good luck."</p><p></p><p>"Those precious fish are actually the medicine we need. One precious fish is almost equivalent to a month's worth of cultivation. Besides the precious fish, there are also precious meat and precious herbs - anything that can help us refine our qi and blood, and increase our strength, is considered medicine."</p><p></p><p>"Many cultivation methods have corresponding medicinal formulas, complementing each other, achieving a synergistic effect greater than the sum of their parts. For example, our Three Fist Technique has its own formula, and even if other cultivation methods use our medicine, the effect won't be as good as practicing the Three Fist Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if there's really no other way, simply eating more meat can also have some effect."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's mind was racing with ideas.</p><p></p><p>He had no access to the precious meat, but the precious fish and herbs were right up his alley! The Jianghuai wilderness was teeming with precious fish, and he could easily find two or three precious catfish in a few days. Continuing this way, wouldn't he be able to take off?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Li Libo seemed a bit silent.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong noticed this and was not surprised. Many people think that once they enter a martial arts school, they will achieve success, but that is a grave mistake.</p><p></p><p>"Poverty in letters, wealth in martial arts" - children who grew up eating meat are naturally more robust than those who grew up on chaff and vegetables.</p><p></p><p>These two disciples were from ordinary families, and they might be feeling a bit discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong didn't try to discourage them, but instead comforted, "Li Shidi, don't be upset. Lack of medicine doesn't mean the martial arts path is doomed to be difficult. It's up to one's own efforts, and there are no absolute truths. There are geniuses in this world who can walk the path without relying on medicine, and do so quickly and steadily."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Xiang. I will remember that."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong nodded, and led the two of them further in, saying, "The so-called 'skin, flesh, bones, and blood' are the four gateways in the early stage of the martial arts path. Breaking through each gateway will bring different enhancements, and also take us to the next level."</p><p></p><p>Under Xiang Changsong's explanation, Liang Qu gained a deeper understanding of these four gateways.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, breaking through the Skin Gateway would make one's skin as tough as an ox's hide, greatly enhancing defense.</p><p>Breaking through the Flesh Gateway would greatly increase one's strength, to the point of being able to easily lift a person with one hand.</p><p>Breaking through the Bone Gateway would allow one to release force more recklessly, truly achieving the ability to break rocks and split stones.</p><p>Breaking through the Blood Gateway would be like oil in a raging fire, a comprehensive enhancement in all aspects.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you can break through the outer gate within three months, then you can stay in the hall for two more months. If you can break through in seventy days, you might even have the chance to gain the favor of Master Yang and become a true disciple, learning more advanced martial arts."</p><p></p><p>These words made Li Libo feel reinvigorated, his heart surging with excitement, and even Liang Qu couldn't help but want to learn martial arts as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiang Changsong stood still: "This is the training ground, and also the main place where we usually exchange and communicate."</p><p></p><p>In the training ground, there were about thirty-plus people, some standing in stance, some lifting stones, and some sparring. The youngest ones looked even younger than Liang Qu, while the oldest ones were probably over thirty. Most of them were men, with a few women, making it look like a large-scale fitness center.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked at them enviously. Even if they were all paying the lowest tuition of seven taels, that was still more than two hundred taels. Three months of over two hundred taels, wouldn't that be close to a thousand taels in a year? Enough to buy a large mansion.</p><p></p><p>This was a conservative estimate. If you included the floating population and those not in the training ground, it would be even more staggering. When would he also be able to lie back and earn money?</p><p></p><p>"At the end of every month, Master Yang will come here to personally teach martial arts. If you have any questions, you can ask him."</p><p></p><p>"We can only see Master Yang at the end of the month?" Li Libo was taken aback. He had thought that by entering the martial arts hall, he would receive the guidance of a true master, but it turned out to be like this?</p><p></p><p>"What about the rest of the time?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong did not immediately answer, but instead called out to a burly man lifting stones in the training ground: "Brother Hu!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu curiously looked over, surprised to find that it was the same Mr. Hu who had bought fish from him the day before. What a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>But it made sense, as the number of martial artists in the entire Pingyang Town was limited, so encountering Master Hu was not unusual.</p><p></p><p>Taking the opportunity while Master Hu was approaching, Xiang Changsong explained, "On regular days, you will be taught by Brother Hu, who is one of Master Yang's direct disciples. He is the on-duty martial arts teacher during the middle of the month. Brother Hu is erudite and highly skilled in the martial arts. According to the rules, you will all be learning under his guidance from now on. Alright, now that you've all become acquainted, I need to go back to the entrance to handle the registration."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiang, take your time."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Master Hu arrived and looked at the wooden plaque: "You two junior disciples, I am Hu Qi. From now on... Huh? It's you?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu clasped his fists: "Master Hu, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi thought for a moment and quickly understood the situation, smiling: "What a coincidence. From now on, you two will be learning martial arts under my guidance. But first, let me take a look at your innate talents."</p><p></p><p>"Innate talents!?"</p><p></p><p>Li Libo's face lit up with excitement. Could it be that he was the legendary martial arts prodigy? Seeing Li Libo's expression, Hu Qi knew what he was thinking: "It's not that mystical. Having good innate talents means you can learn faster, and your punches will be powerful and fierce. But it's not absolute, and it doesn't completely represent your natural aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, our Three Fist Techniques actually have three different styles: Tiger, Crane, and Ape. We can choose the most suitable one for you based on your innate talents."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Hu Qi took Li Libo's hand, feeling his wrist, shoulders, and hips, and finally said, "Brace yourself."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi's two fingers jabbed into Li Libo's spine.</p><p></p><p>Sss! Liang Qu's eyes twitched, hearing Li Libo's sharp intake of breath, knowing it must have been very painful.</p><p></p><p>He had once seen a movie where a female spy killed people in this way.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi withdrew his hand: "You're slightly above average. I suggest you focus on practicing the Ape Fist Technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo was greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Then it was Liang Qu's turn. Hu Qi examined his wrist, shoulders, hips, and finally his spine.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi's two fingers jabbed in, and Liang Qu felt half his body go numb, but the one who made a sound was not him, but Hu Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, Liang Disciple, your innate talents are actually quite exceptional?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

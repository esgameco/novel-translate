        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Back at the martial arts school, Liang Qu called Chen Jie-chang over and enthusiastically led him back to his room.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang followed behind, puzzled: "What are you going to show me? The things in the long box?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'll show you my precious treasure."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu opened his long wooden box, revealing a magnificent long spear. The spear shaft was a dark purple color like rosewood, with a black-gold spearhead. Every detail was exquisitely crafted, exuding an awe-inspiring aura.</p><p></p><p>"What a beautiful big spear!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, right? My third senior brother gave this to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang couldn't help but reach out and touch it. But as soon as he held it, he was shocked: "Sss, it's so heavy! How much does this spear weigh?"</p><p></p><p>"Ninety-six catties!"</p><p></p><p>"That heavy? Wouldn't it be deadly to even brush against it? Can you even wield it?"</p><p></p><p>"With full effort, I can manage it barely."</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, incredible." Chen Jie-chang praised, then turned to look at the long spear, finding it more and more beautiful. He asked, "Does this spear have a name?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu paused, realizing he hadn't actually thought of a name for it. His senior brother hadn't mentioned one either, so he would have to decide on his own.</p><p></p><p>"How about calling it the 'Tiger-Headed Golden Spear'? Look at this fierce dragon, it's so majestic and beautiful."</p><p></p><p>"That's too clich√©, all the generals' weapons in the romance novels are called that. Come up with something else."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was stumped. Naming things was really not his strong suit, as evidenced by his own four children. He frantically searched his mind for historical references to draw inspiration from.</p><p></p><p>"Then how about calling it the 'Subduing the Waves Spear'?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang considered it for a moment. At first it didn't sound very grand, but there was a certain charm to it.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of "subduing the waves" was perfect, as fishermen most feared the turbulent winds and waves when going out to sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Subduing the Waves Spear, that's a good name! Alright, you really are a scholar after all."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, then let's call it the Subduing the Waves Spear!" </p><p></p><p>With the name decided, Liang Qu's connection to the spear deepened, feeling an increasingly profound bond.</p><p></p><p>The two admired the spear for a while, until Liang Qu was called out by Hu Qi for special training. Reluctantly, he closed the wooden box before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang found it amusing: "It's not going to run away, the way you're acting makes me feel like even magical weapons can fly on their own."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I just can't help it, I can't help it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, this morning I went to the academy to request a leave of absence for you. There's a young gentleman named Si Heng-yi who said he wants you to go visit the academy as soon as you're free, even on his day off."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded, realizing that his "plan" was progressing. He just hadn't had time to go to the academy these past few days.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to take a boat back to Yixing City this afternoon to deliver the Blood Qi Pill to Li Li-bo. I'll be back before dark. Is there anything you need me to bring?"</p><p></p><p>"As a matter of fact, there is."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took out a small porcelain bottle containing healing pills, poured out one, split it in half, and put half back in.</p><p></p><p>"These are for healing wounds. Just put the half-pill in the bottle with the Blood Qi Pill and give it to Li Li-bo. Half a pill should be enough for his hand to heal in a day or two."</p><p></p><p>That day's situation was urgent, so he didn't have time to grind up some lotus root powder.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll thank him on your behalf."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing. Also, please check on the Chen family, and have them stay indoors as much as possible these next few days."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had considered bringing the Chen family to the martial arts school, but then thought that the school might be the first target, so he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>"Got it, I'll take care of it."</p><p></p><p>"Then that's all. I'm going out to train."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang nodded and started packing up his things.</p><p></p><p>On the training grounds, Liang Qu stood holding a staff.</p><p></p><p>With Hu Qi's help, his mastery of the Forceful Technique had become increasingly refined. He could now guarantee not losing his composure within three exchanges. Now he was trying to use actual weapons.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the fourth time being selected by Hu Qi, Liang Qu's inner energy was completely drained.</p><p></p><p>A few curious apprentices let out hisses.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi furrowed his brows and sternly shouted, "What's going on, spacing out during the battle? Do you know how dangerous that is?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu knew he was in the wrong and obediently lowered his head to take the scolding.</p><p></p><p>"Go, do thirty stone piles! Practice after you're done!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu ran sheepishly to the corner of the training ground and started lifting the stone piles.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Hu wasn't always kind-faced either. Whenever he made a big mistake, he would get severely beaten and then scolded.</p><p></p><p>Sigh.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that while he was practicing, the Fatty Catfish would send a message saying they had discovered a large horned treasure fish.</p><p></p><p>Horned, that must be the Ox-Horned Bream, right?</p><p></p><p>An Ox-Horned Bream over a pound, the flesh alone would have 1.8 parts of water essence, far better quality than the red-blood bass or the tiger-headed perch - a true treasure fish.</p><p></p><p>The unique horns also have special uses, and he still had a pair buried under the rice barrel at home.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts stirred, and his emotions became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he couldn't get away right now.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Xu and Elder Brother Xiang, he didn't know when they would be back, and even if it was tomorrow, it would be too strange to leave now.</p><p></p><p>After much consideration, Liang Qu decided to give up on that Ox-Horned Bream.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he wouldn't go catch it, but he would let the Three Beasts figure it out themselves and divide it up once they caught it.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if they could do it.</p><p></p><p>Times have changed, and although the Ox-Horned Bream is precious, it's not an absolute must-have resource.</p><p></p><p>If the Three Beasts could eat it, at least the Fatty Catfish and the Immobile One's evolution would progress further, which would be good.</p><p></p><p>In the wild of the Jianghuai Marsh, the Fatty Catfish received Liang Qu's message, and the two thickest catfish whiskers twisted together, seeming "worried and distressed."</p><p></p><p>Strange-looking fish are hard to catch, they're incredibly strong and swim much faster than ordinary fish, small and agile.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about being able to eat the delicious fish meat, no longer just fish bones and entrails, the Fatty Catfish prepared to tough it out and go for it.</p><p></p><p>The Immobile One and the Fist gathered together, the three beasts "discussing" their strategy.</p><p></p><p>In the corner, the fish whiskers swayed, the crocodile claws clawed the air, the crab pincers clamped randomly, a series of bubbles surging out and bursting on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the three beasts scattered, surrounding the Ox-Horned Bream in a triangular formation.</p><p></p><p>Approaching within five meters, the Immobile One struck first, as it was the slowest, not suitable for catching, only needing to drive the Ox-Horned Bream towards the Fatty Catfish and the Fist.</p><p></p><p>The technique learned from the heavenly gods proved effective, the Ox-Horned Bream panicked and ran towards the Fist's direction, just as it was about to pass overhead, the Fist leaped up and clamped the Ox-Horned Bream's tail with its huge pincers! But this Ox-Horned Bream was too big, nearly eight pounds, the Fist floating in the water had no leverage, and was actually being dragged along.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Ox-Horned Bream was startled by the Fist, and changed direction, right into the Fatty Catfish's embrace. As it brushed past, the Fatty Catfish jumped out of the mud, gave a tail whip, and slammed the Ox-Horned Bream onto the ground, then turned around and bit through the treasure fish's head.</p><p></p><p>The hunt, a great success! The Immobile One quickly swam over, the three beasts gathered together, all wanting to feast.</p><p></p><p>The Fatty Catfish used its tail to sweep the treasure fish towards itself, waving its catfish whiskers, pointed at the fish head towards the Immobile One, then pointed at the fish tail towards the Fist, and finally pointed at the fish belly towards itself.</p><p></p><p>The Immobile One shook its head frantically, using its claws to pull the treasure fish towards itself, extending its sharp claws, pointing at the fish head towards the Fatty Catfish, the fish tail towards the Fist, and the fish belly towards itself.</p><p></p><p>The Fist clamped down on the Immobile One's claws, the Immobile One painfully whipped its tail, the Fatty Catfish opened its big mouth and blew bubbles, the Fist took the opportunity to also clamp down on its whiskers.</p><p></p><p>In their angry state, it clamped the treasure fish and placed it in front of itself, pointing at the fish head towards the Fatty Catfish, the fish tail towards the Immobile One, and the fish belly towards itself.</p><p></p><p>The three beasts looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a large cloud of mud and sand surged up in the water.

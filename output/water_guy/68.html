        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang. Nine gong sounds reverberated and rolled over the wharf, unceasing.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the sacrificial altar, the shamans gripped their short staves, chanting the ritual songs, but if one listened closely, they could detect a tremor in every note.</p><p></p><p>The first time one heard it, they might truly think this was the unique characteristic of the ritual songs.</p><p></p><p>The high priest gazed at the figures on the side, his chest rising and falling as he took a deep breath, calmed his thoughts, and solemnly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Chief Priest, proceed!"</p><p></p><p>The musician raised the bronze horn, and the large drum with ox-hide face was struck by the great mallet, the drum sound echoing through the entire blue-stone street, becoming increasingly solemn, as if pounding on the hearts of the people, resonating with a heavy thud.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu rose, one drum beat per step, under the gaze of countless eyes, slowly advancing along the central axis of the sacrificial altar, ascending the thirteen-step staircase, and standing upon the sacrificial altar.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the five-foot-long offering table, the massive head of the mountain demon faced the great river, its yellowed vertical pupils dim and lifeless, with thick black blood beneath.</p><p></p><p>"Light the incense!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu ignited the charcoal and inserted the incense into the incense burner.</p><p></p><p>"Pour the libation!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the wine jar and filled three wine cups, standing upright.</p><p></p><p>"Recite the sacrificial text!"</p><p></p><p>"River god above, I borrow this place of Yixing Market, by the waters of the Huai River, accepting the entrusted hopes of the people, gathering the aspirations of the masses, and now respectfully worship before your august presence, presenting this sacrificial text."</p><p></p><p>"In the beginning of chaos, heaven and earth were born. The sun and moon move in the heavens, the rivers and streams flow on the earth. Nourishing the central lands, giving birth to all things. The White Mountains and Black Waters, named the Huai River."</p><p></p><p>The river flows for thousands of miles, suddenly stirring up waves.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth are boundless, the echoes resounding.</p><p></p><p>"Bow!"</p><p></p><p>[Sacrificing to the Huai River, the river's favor increases by 0.0001]</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu silently performed a long bow and stepped down.</p><p></p><p>"Bow again!"</p><p></p><p>A great wind surged from the river surface, vast and unceasing, the long robes and sleeves fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>The kneeling villagers couldn't help but look up, seeing the blood-stained white garments under the black cloak, their spirits shaken, as if beholding a divine being!</p><p></p><p>Liang Guangtian, hidden in the back of the crowd, bowed again and again, and by the time he stood up, his back was completely drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>The figure on the sacrificial altar exuded an awe-inspiring presence, completely irreconcilable with the hunched figure begging for grain just three months prior.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt his nephew was so unfamiliar, so terrifying! Amidst the fear, a tinge of regret.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Chen Qingjiang standing at the front of the altar, wondering if the situation would have been completely different if he had lent the grain earlier? The sound of firecrackers crackled.</p><p></p><p>The high priest shouted, and Liang Qu descended the altar.</p><p></p><p>Several men in straw cloaks stepped up to the altar and began to dance, the drum beats becoming lively.</p><p></p><p>When it was all over, everyone unanimously let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The sacrifice had been successfully completed, and the appearance of the mountain demon was not an ill omen.</p><p></p><p>Chen Zao'an's suspended heart finally settled. He was seventy-two years old, and the Great Shun dynasty had only been established for sixty years, but in all his long life, he had never experienced such a thrilling sacrificial ceremony.</p><p></p><p>A mountain demon attacking during the sacrifice, only to be killed and offered to the river god, was truly a rare sight.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was a rare sight. </p><p></p><p>It's better to live a long life.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu descended the altar, and the group of village elders immediately surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>The sacrifice was completed, but they had not resolved any of their doubts.</p><p></p><p>What was the reason for the mountain demon's appearance here? Was it the same one that had caused such an uproar in Pingyang Town by killing warriors? Would there be more, and was there any danger?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu waved his hand and pointed to his own wounds: "Let me take a bath first, then we can talk. Go call the physician for me."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, yes, yes, of course, you should come to my house." </p><p></p><p>Chen Zao'an and the others finally remembered that Liang Qu was still injured, and an elder quickly ushered the group to the large manor by the wharf, where most of the villagers had taken refuge.</p><p></p><p>The elder entered the manor and ordered someone to heat the water, just about to send his eldest son to summon the physician, when the physician hurriedly stepped forward himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Liang, I'm right here."</p><p></p><p>Performing sacrifices to the river god is a major event, and even fishermen who are not usually allowed to attend are able to come. As the doctor of the medical clinic in Yixing City, he naturally had a spot at the scene, even standing in a prominent position, right in front of the sacrificial altar, second only to some of the wealthy families and on the same row as the skilled craftsmen.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, the fishermen were mostly in the middle and back rows, with only a few able to stand in the front.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded and partially took off his upper garment, exposing his upper body: "Doctor, please take a look at me."</p><p></p><p>The two most serious wounds were on his chest, shoulder, and right arm, all inflicted by the mountain demon's claws and bites, all on the upper body.</p><p></p><p>The doctor approached and after a thorough examination, he exclaimed in surprise: "I wonder what materials Young Master Liang's robe and coat are made of."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu replied: "The coat was given to me by my second senior brother, it's made of bear fur, impenetrable to knives and swords. The robe was given to me by my eighth senior brother, with mulberry silk blended in."</p><p></p><p>This time, he was able to defeat the mountain demon for a few reasons: first, the breakthrough in his cultivation, greatly increasing his strength and defense; second, a massive improvement in his fusion, with a leap in his physical qualities; third, the crucial role played by the scorpion's deadly venom, though its effects were slow; and lastly, he was wearing a full set of divine equipment.</p><p></p><p>He may be a novice, but he had six divine items. Whether it was the bracers, the coat, the robe blended with mulberry silk, or the belt made of buffalo hide, they all blocked numerous fatal attacks. </p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire battle, he emerged completely unscathed, not even a loose thread.</p><p></p><p>The elders had never heard of things like bear fur and mulberry silk, but they still found it impressive.</p><p></p><p>They sighed in admiration, thinking that he truly was a disciple of Old Master Yang, with even his clothes being so extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder, no wonder," the doctor exclaimed in amazement. "With Young Master Liang protected by this robe and coat, and his robust physique, although the injuries look severe, they are mostly just flesh wounds, albeit deep and with significant bleeding. As long as we clean the wounds, apply medicine, and bandage them, he should recover in about two weeks without major issues, especially since the weather is cold and infection is less likely."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded, relieved that the bones were not damaged, as that would have been much more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>He gestured towards Li Liubo and Chen Jiechangon the side: "Doctor, please take a look at my two friends as well."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, of course."</p><p></p><p>The doctor went to examine the two.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangon was not too bad, just a bit weak, with the most serious injury being a scraped hand from when he fell to the ground after kicking the mountain demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo, however, was in worse shape. The mountain demon's swipe had cracked the bone in his forearm, not completely broken but still an injury to the tendons and bones, requiring at least two to three months to heal.</p><p></p><p>Li Liubo lamented, "What am I going to do about my martial arts training now?"</p><p></p><p>His father, Li Dakang, also looked worried.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu smiled: "Don't worry, I'll talk to my senior brothers and get you a three-month leave."</p><p></p><p>After all, if it weren't for the two of them providing assistance, the mountain demon would not have been so easily defeated, so Liang Qu naturally wanted to help them.</p><p></p><p>"Really? No need for three months, since it's not broken, two months should be enough, two months is enough."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, up to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Dakang was delighted: "Thank you so much, Young Master Liang."</p><p></p><p>"It's no trouble, uncle."</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, doctor, please come take a look at me too, I'm in so much pain!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me go check on them first."</p><p></p><p>The doctor apologized and hurried off to attend to the other injured.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few patients lying in the courtyard. In the chaos of the mountain demon incident, many had fallen and been trampled, fortunately with no fatalities, but some had serious injuries. </p><p></p><p>There were also a few who had jumped into the water in their panic, but were quickly rescued before they froze, and these people had been carried into the manor by the elders.</p><p></p><p>By the time Liang Qu finished bathing and cleaning off the blood, changing into clean clothes, the doctor returned to dress his wounds.</p><p></p><p>The elders gathered around again, eager to get answers to their questions.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Martial arts can be divided into two main categories: Jin Fa (Strength Techniques) and Zhao Fa (Technique Techniques).</p><p></p><p>The fighting techniques of the Ape Fist are different from both of these. It only involves the essentials of movement and muscle activation methods, which ordinary people can also learn. It is very open and expansive.</p><p></p><p>Jin Fa is the method of circulating qi and blood. It is a deeper level of control, which can only be used by martial artists who have reached a certain level of qi and blood. It is a method of controlling the entire strength and qi/blood of the body and using it for oneself.</p><p></p><p>After mastering both, each kick and punch will have much greater power.</p><p></p><p>With the support of qi and blood Jin Fa, the attacks of the Ape Fist will be even stronger, similar to the internal energy of internal martial arts in wuxia novels.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Fa martial arts, on the other hand, is another concept. It is about infusing qi and blood into weapons and fists, causing them to erupt with explosive techniques.</p><p></p><p>Examples include techniques like the Xuanbing Finger and Paiyun Palm.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the booklet that Hu Qi handed over and quickly flipped through it. The Jin Fa booklet was very thin, only five or six pages. After memorizing so many words over the past few days, he had no trouble reading through it.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Liang Qu to memorize the content in his mind and try to stimulate the circulation of qi and blood according to the methods in the booklet.</p><p></p><p>In the circulation of qi and blood, after a moment, his body truly felt different, completely unlike the sensation of the tanned leather fusing into his body. The circulation of qi and blood was endless, as if his vitality was bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>After a quarter of an hour, the qi and blood were circulating through the meridians, becoming more and more skilled.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt that this Jin Fa was tailor-made for him, his blood vessels bulging, the power surging forth.</p><p></p><p>He started moving, using the Jin Fa techniques combined with fighting techniques. The qi surged, the intent moved, the strength was released, the fist winds howling, all in one seamless flow.</p><p></p><p>Each punch and kick had increased power!</p><p></p><p>This was truly the real combat method of a martial artist!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Liang Qu had completely transformed, majestic and awe-inspiring, like a divine ape descended upon the world, his long arms swinging, his arms like bow strings, his fist tips like arrows, fierce and explosive.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was in this imposing state, Hu Qi's short staff skillfully probed, like striking the seven-inch spot of a snake, hitting Liang Qu in the chest.</p><p></p><p>His entire body rhythm was disrupted, Liang Qu's strength instantly dissipated, and a third of the blood qi in his body evaporated into thin air.</p><p></p><p>He stood there dejectedly, like a monster forced out of its energetic state by a single strike.</p><p></p><p>"Again!" Hu Qi said sternly, "Only when the strength is continuous and uninterrupted can you be considered to have made some progress!"</p><p></p><p>The most important thing in Jin Fa is to maintain the rhythm. Beginners may seem to be able to use it skillfully, but in reality they cannot use it effectively in actual combat.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they exchange a few moves with someone, their qi will be drained, and they will be exhausted. During regular practice, they must be constantly "disturbed" to train the circulation of their strength into a reflex, so that they will not lose their power.</p><p></p><p>This method is similar to the way of training fighting techniques.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Hu Qi was simultaneously training Liang Qu's fighting techniques and Jin Fa.</p><p></p><p>To practice fighting, one must first be hit. It's not a foolish pain training, but finding ways to avoid injury in the process of being hit, finding one's own rhythm.</p><p></p><p>Each time the circulation of his strength was interrupted, a large amount of Liang Qu's blood qi would dissipate, and after just three or four times, his qi and blood would be exhausted, becoming like water without a source.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu panted heavily, his body gradually showing signs of fatigue, but Hu Qi didn't let him rest at all. He put down the short staff in his hand and took a stance.</p><p></p><p>"Continue, if you can't practice Jin Fa, then practice fighting techniques. You've learned the routines, now you need to use them. Come, attack me."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath, gathered his spirit, and charged towards Hu Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Too stupid, don't expose your chest, grasp the distance between you and the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>"All fists, feet, and weapons are extensions. Imagine yourself as a circle, find your center, and imagine me as a circle too, find my center. The punch you throw is a circle, my staff strike is also a circle. In every battle, there are countless circles."</p><p></p><p>"You must maintain your center to break my center!"</p><p></p><p>"No, still not right..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your flaws are too big, you haven't even found your own center yet, try again."</p><p></p><p>"Try again!" </p><p></p><p>"Get up, continue!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the martial arts school had already left, either to go back to sleep or return home.</p><p></p><p>On the vast training ground, only Hu Qi and Liang Qu remained.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu fell down again and again, then panted and stood back up.</p><p></p><p>The night was silent.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, bare-chested, drew a heavy bucket of water from the backyard well and poured it over himself.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let out a long sigh, and wisps of white steam rose from his body, echoing the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Beneath his fatigued body was a joyful harvest - he could feel his own progress, that little bit of improved technique that was becoming more familiar, making him unable to stop.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Hu had rich personal experience, and the theoretical guidance he learned from Master Yang made it easy for him to teach. Liang Qu also gained a great deal, having a very clear understanding of what combat is. Unfortunately, his practice could not keep up with the theory.</p><p></p><p>He still had a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, that's enough!" Hu Qi came out of the room and called out to Liang Qu, "After soaking in the medicinal bath, go to sleep quickly. We'll continue tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, there's nothing else, I'll be leaving first. I'm staying in the east wing room."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Elder Brother, I do have one question."</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"When I fought the mountain demon, I had a doubt - why does our skin look no different from ordinary people, and feel so soft and smooth, yet can withstand blade strikes? If we want such defense, shouldn't our skin be as thick as cowhide?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi chuckled: "If that were the case, wouldn't practicing martial arts make you look neither human nor ghost? Having a thick skin all over, how unsightly would that be? Haven't you carefully read that book 'Reflections on Cultivating Life and Nature'?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was embarrassed: "I'm afraid I haven't, Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>"I thought so. The 'skin like cowhide' is just a metaphor. </p><p></p><p>'Reflections on Cultivating Life and Nature' clearly states that the essence of a warrior's strength is the separation of 'self' and 'other', or the separation of 'inner' and 'outer'."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Liang Qu was completely puzzled. He understood each individual word, but when put together, he couldn't make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>"Simply put, after you've broken through the skin barrier, the strength of your skin does increase, but beyond that, there is an unseen enhancement of your own 'fundamental nature'."</p><p></p><p>"Fundamental nature?"</p><p></p><p>"The external is the external fundamental nature, the internal is the internal fundamental nature. The two were meant to interact and evolve into endless possibilities. But on the warrior's path, one strengthens one's own fundamental nature. The stronger your fundamental nature, the weaker the external fundamental nature becomes, until you transcend it, and nothing in the world can affect you."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu considered himself to have a good grasp of things, and gradually grasped the key point.</p><p></p><p>"So a warrior's attack is going against the grain? Affecting the external fundamental nature through one's own fundamental nature?"</p><p></p><p>"My disciple is indeed intelligent." Hu Qi praised him, "The path of the warrior is to transcend. Do what I want to do, resist what I want to resist. The stronger the power, the stronger your influence and resistance to the external, until you reach the point of eternal life, attaining great freedom and great creation."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts path in this world might be even more formidable than the path of immortal cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Damn.</p><p></p><p>He had thought the way of blood control was already quite powerful, but it turns out to be just a minor skill! In that case, he's afraid that even if he can control water entering his body, he may still lose control. (End of this chapter)</p>

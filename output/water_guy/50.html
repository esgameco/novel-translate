        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shunzi, hurry up, don't give it to your brother-in-law! Do you know how expensive these things are, and you just take them?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang rushed forward to snatch the peach pastry from Shunzi's mouth, leaving Shunzi stunned.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stepped forward to block Chen Qingjiang.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, what are you saying? The things are bought to be eaten, no matter whose stomach they end up in. What's the difference? Those old masters eat them every day, and they all have two eyes and one mouth, can they really tell the difference in taste?</p><p></p><p>Shunzi, don't be afraid, eat what you're allowed to eat. The things are mine, can your father still control what's mine?"</p><p></p><p>"How can it be the same? Shunzi! Why are you so disobedient?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang shouted again, his voice louder due to his anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The little Shunzi standing there had a pained expression on his face. When he heard the word "expensive", he didn't dare eat anymore, breaking off the part he had bitten and cupping it in his hands, trying to return it to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen! If you keep this up, I won't come next time!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, what's going on, why are you arguing? Qingjiang, what are you doing? Didn't I just tell you? How could you forget so quickly!" Chen Renxing, hearing the commotion, thought the two were arguing and rushed out of the house, scolding Chen Qingjiang.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, no, I, this..." Chen Qingjiang felt wronged and didn't know how to defend himself, being scolded like a son.</p><p></p><p>Oh, it was just that, then it's fine.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu laughed heartily: "It's nothing, Grandpa Chen, we weren't arguing, just joking. I brought some things for Shunzi, and Uncle Chen insisted on stopping him, thinking it would be too hot for him to handle."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, that's how it is."</p><p></p><p>Chen Renxing was still suspicious: "Is that really how it is?"</p><p></p><p>"That's really how it is." Liang Qu hugged little Shunzi with one arm and stuffed the peach pastry back into his hands. "So Uncle Chen, really don't be polite with me, being polite with me just annoys me."</p><p></p><p>Chen Renxing glanced at the Five Blessings pastry box in Liang Qu's hand, and seeing that his son was usually honest, he finally calmed down and invited Liang Qu in: "Then come on in, it's cold outside. And Qingjiang, why are you just standing there, how did you become so wooden?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh, come in, I'll get a chair, Adi, go get some water."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shook his head and smiled wryly, it really was one mountain higher than the next.</p><p></p><p>Once inside, everyone found a place to sit. Chen Qingjiang moved the stove, closed the door, and they all gathered around the fire to warm up.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shui, are you short on money lately? I've saved up some money recently, let me go get it for you."</p><p></p><p>"It's not about the money, Uncle Chen, just sit down! Have you paid the medical clinic yet?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang sighed: "Not yet, it's been cold and we haven't caught many fish, so there's not much extra money."</p><p></p><p>"Then that's good, my money's not urgent. The main reason I came today is to talk to you about three things, and I brought you some things as well, this and this."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu placed the Five Blessings pastry box and a large paper package on the table, pushing them over.</p><p></p><p>"For us?"</p><p></p><p>Adi looked at the Five Blessings pastry box, unable to believe it. She knew how expensive Five Blessings pastries were, this box must have cost several taels of silver. Chen Qingjiang kept saying it was too much, he had thought Liang Qu was just casually giving them a peach pastry, not an entire box.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, don't say anything, just listen to me first." Seeing Uncle Chen was about to refuse again, Liang Qu directly interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"The first thing is that I've been accepted as a direct disciple of the Yangshi Martial Arts Hall's headmaster in Pingyang Town. You may not understand, but simply put, from now on I can learn martial arts for free, directly under the tutelage of my Shifu, not as a regular paying apprentice.</p><p></p><p>This box of pastries is to celebrate this. </p><p></p><p>When Shunzi grows up a bit more, he can come with me to the martial arts hall, and he won't have to pay any fees. This small matter won't bother my Shifu at all.</p><p></p><p>The second thing is, I asked my senior brothers for some medicinal powder, it's for treating Grandpa Chen's injury. Steep it in water and drink it twice a day, for two days, and the injury will be healed.</p><p></p><p>The third thing is, I found a fish gathering spot in the Jianghuai wetlands. Since I'll be busy training in martial arts, I won't have as much time to go fishing. I want to ask Uncle Chen to go fishing with me these few days, as a small favor. We'll split the catch 50-50.</p><p></p><p>That's about it, I've said everything I wanted to say."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around, leaving only silence from the Chen family.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Chen family, their brains seemed not to have reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>"A direct disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>"Can Shunzi also go and learn martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"This medicine is expensive, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not expensive, it's very cheap."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was cheap. Liang Qu didn't spend a single penny, it was just lotus root ground into a paste and dried, the effect was a bit inferior, but it was still usable. One package contained two portions, enough for Chen Renxing to recover his vitality.</p><p></p><p>The Chen family was stunned by the surprise, only Shunzi was squatting by the stove, gnawing on a peach pastry, not quite understanding what was happening.</p><p></p><p>The peach pastry was really delicious, Brother Shui was a good person, he thought.</p><p></p><p>"Fishing, of course can be done, Brother Shui said, that must be helped, but the other two things are really..."</p><p></p><p>"Stop! I know what you're going to say, Uncle Chen, if you say more, I'll leave, don't be polite, I can't stand this."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was interrupted again in the middle of his spell, his face flushed a bit, it was really uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Since Uncle Chen has agreed to help with the fishing, then it's no problem."</p><p></p><p>Asking Uncle Chen to help with the fishing was an idea Liang Qu had had early on.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, it was to improve the living conditions of the Chen family. Uncle Chen was stubborn, owed so much debt, and the fish catch was scarce in winter. Since he couldn't just give them money directly, he thought of a way to help them increase their income.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it was also to free up his own time, not having to pretend to go out fishing every day.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish only had one mouth, back and forth, the efficiency was actually very low.</p><p></p><p>If they could team up with the immobilized one, the two beasts together could surround the school of fish underwater, and then let Chen Qingjiang cast the net from above, the efficiency could be greatly improved, a fifty-fifty split, and everyone would have something to gain.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Chen was a good person, if he accidentally saw something he shouldn't have, he wouldn't tell anyone, he would just keep it to himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, keeping a water beast doesn't mean anything, those who like to keep big crocodiles aren't non-existent.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang finally blurted out a sentence: "Brother Shui, you've really made it, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've made it." Chen Renxing followed closely.</p><p></p><p>"You've really made it big." Adi added.</p><p></p><p>"Of course Brother Shui has made it!" Little Shunzi finished a peach pastry, wiped the crumbs from the corners of his mouth, and was the first to raise his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Then won't Brother Shui become a lord in the future?" Chen Renxing unconsciously reached for his waist belt, wanting to take out his pipe and take a puff, but noticing that Liang Qu was still there, he held back.</p><p></p><p>Lord!</p><p></p><p>What a distant and majestic word, as if just those two words exuded a lofty air.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his neighbor was going to become a lord, Chen Renxing's back wound started to itch.</p><p></p><p>"So, you can just take this box of Wufangzhai, the money issue is not urgent, take it slowly, just pay back the medical clinic first, and I'll come find Uncle Chen tomorrow, Uncle Chen, you don't have to go out fishing for now."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's one more thing, do you know about the great demon from the other night?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about it, they should be performing a ritual soon."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I may not be at home these two days."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took out two taels of silver from his waist pouch and placed them on the table. "If someone comes to collect the money, Sister Adi, please help me pay it, I've asked Uncle Li Dakang, two taels of silver should be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Adi nodded, on normal days when Chen Qingjiang went out fishing and Chen Renxing went to sell baskets and cloth, she was the only one who could stay at home.</p><p></p><p>The group chatted for a while, until Liang Qu was about to leave, when Chen Qingjiang suddenly spoke up: "Brother Shui, if you go to the town these two days, be careful. I went to sell fish this morning and heard about something, they said a martial arts master died in the town."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's heart skipped a beat: "A martial arts master? What was his name?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't quite remember, I think it was something like..." Chen Qingjiang frowned, trying to recall, he wasn't the type to gossip, and for a moment he really couldn't remember.</p><p></p><p>"You kid, how come your brain goes blank at the critical moment, can't you do anything? If you can't remember, you don't get to eat today."</p><p></p><p>Chen Renxing angrily hit him on the back of the head with his pipe, Chen Qingjiang seemed to have been scolded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I remember now, it was Lu Shaohui!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Libo's eyes were bloodshot, and his right foot unconsciously took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangquickly grabbed his fellow villager: "Hold it! Our senior brother Xiang is not here."</p><p></p><p>Li Libosuddenly remembered that Xiang Changsong had also left at noon, and there was not a single one of Xiang's disciples in the entire martial arts hall at the moment!</p><p></p><p>"Xiang Shixiong? Is he the one you all rely on? Do you really think Xiang Shixiong will help you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai's heart also skipped a beat, fearing that the two in front of him would go and report them. But he had done this before and had his own tricks, so he persuaded them:</p><p></p><p>"Just because Xiang Shixiong speaks to you kindly, do you think you're something special? Do you think Xiang Shixiong would punish us four for the sake of you three peasants?"</p><p></p><p>"Unless he's willing to kick all of us out for your sake."</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangsuddenly felt a sinking feeling in their hearts as they remembered their identity - they were just fishermen. Would Xiang Shixiong really help a few fishermen? Even if he did, he wouldn't directly kick out Lu Tingcai.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the change in their expressions, Lu Tingcai felt relieved and struck while the iron was hot: "You two reek of fish, making it hard for everyone to focus on their training. You should pay some money to treat everyone to some yogurt, isn't that the right thing to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, there are three of you, where's the other one? Did he know he couldn't make it and went back early? But sorry, you'll have to pay for his share too!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangfelt uneasy but still angrily retorted: "We always keep at least ten steps away from you, even if we have a fishy smell, you can't even smell it!"</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, but don't you know that practicing martial arts can enhance your senses? We have a keen sense of smell and can smell it. What are you going to do about it?"</p><p></p><p>"What if we don't pay?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't pay?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai raised his eyebrows, relaxed his body, and cupped his fists, saying, "Master Lu, I wonder if I can spar with you two disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangwere horrified. Lu Tingcai was an old man about to break through the skin barrier, how could he dare? And Master Lu, who already disliked the two of them, wouldn't this be right up his alley? Not to mention sparring was not allowed in the martial arts hall, minor injuries were common.</p><p></p><p>However, to their surprise, when Master Lu heard this, he just frowned slightly. He disliked the three fishermen from Yixing and their odor, but he didn't intend to do anything about it. A warrior about to break through the skin barrier sparring with three fishermen? He didn't care about these three at all, their weight in his heart was less than air.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai had chosen the wrong person to use as his cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>Master Lu threw down the stone lock and left the training ground, as if he had not heard anything.</p><p></p><p>The scene became very awkward. Lu Tingcai looked at Master Lu's retreating back, his mouth twitching. Fortunately, he had a thick skin naturally, and it didn't matter to him. His plan was still under control, and Master Lu's indifference was actually a good thing. So he turned around and rolled up his sleeves, ready to "spar" with the two.</p><p></p><p>"Since you two disciples won't listen, then I'll have to take the place of the senior brothers."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangfelt like he was facing a great enemy, but suddenly he caught a glimpse of Li Libospringing forward, picking something up from the flower bed, and then bringing it down hard on the back of Lu Tingcai's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A dull sound echoed through the entire training ground.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai's head was dizzy, and his vision gradually blurred. He swayed and turned around, looking down at the stone in Li Libo's hand, then reaching back to feel the back of his head, his hand coming away covered in bright red blood. He wanted to curse something, but his brain couldn't quite process it, his steps unsteady as he leaned against the wall.</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi and the others were all dumbfounded, not reacting for a long time before shouting, "Get him!"</p><p></p><p>No, no, no!</p><p></p><p>Cowering in the corner, Lu Tingcai was even more confused. One-on-one sparring was one thing, but a group fight was a different matter altogether! He just wanted to make some money, not get kicked out of the martial arts hall! He tried to open his mouth to stop Xue Dingyi, but his brain was throbbing with pain, and he couldn't shout anything out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scene immediately descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangquickly pulled Li Liboaway.</p><p></p><p>Just then, someone drew a wooden stick from the weapon rack and brought it down hard on the spot where Li Libo had been standing.</p><p></p><p>Underwater.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath from the inflated pig bladder tied around his waist.</p><p></p><p>The "rock" remained motionless. As the perspective changed, he gained more understanding of the creature, especially the two protruding stalks on top, which were clearly its eyes.</p><p></p><p>An obvious weak point, Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>He slowly moved his steps, using the scattered rocks as cover to approach steadily. Just as he was about to move in further, the crustacean that had been lying on the ground suddenly stirred.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu immediately stopped in his tracks, reducing his presence.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>Most crustaceans have very sensitive touch, able to sense ground vibrations through their small claws and determine if there are any living beings around.</p><p></p><p>If he moved now, he would expose himself.</p><p></p><p>The originally solid "rock" suddenly split into two smaller rocks. The tops of the smaller rocks split open, forming a pair of scissors that propped themselves on the ground, slowly lifting the entire large rock. That was when Liang Qu realized that the bottom part of the "rock" had been buried in the mud!</p><p></p><p>When the rock was fully upright, it formed an upside-down "å…«" shape, about 1.7 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Observing in the dark, Liang Qu felt a strange familiarity.</p><p></p><p>How is this so similar to an Impaler Tank? The creature in front of him was like a crab with its midsection suddenly elongated, the upper body a downward-pointing triangle with two large pincers, and the lower body crab-like legs similar to the Impaler Tank Urgot, even with a ring of crab hair around the "waist" like a belt.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this crab-like creature to have grown into such a bizarre form, and the size was even larger than he had imagined - nearly as tall as himself, over 1 meter wide, appearing very burly.</p><p></p><p>After rising, the crab creature stood still in its place, while in the corner about 10 meters away, Liang Qu also remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts were crouched low, buried in the mud, completely blending into the environment - a perfect camouflage.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the underwater scene had changed, yet remained the same.</p><p></p><p>Both stood as solid as boulders, only the water plants swaying gently with the current.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu kept his gaze fixed on the crab creature, when suddenly his vision cleared, his sight unobstructed, piercing through the water into the deep, dark depths.</p><p></p><p>!!! </p><p></p><p>"Run!" </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shouted in his mind, quickly kicking off and retreating. The fat catfish and pig-nosed turtle rolled and fled rapidly. In the next instant, a massive presence appeared in the perceptual range above, plummeting down.</p><p></p><p>The crab's heavy legs plunged into the mud, kicking up a rushing current like a sudden underwater gale, the dust rising to Liang Qu's waist.</p><p></p><p>The huge crab pincers broke through the water flow, making a sound like tearing fabric, the shattered white foam wrapping around the giant crab, crashing down towards Liang Qu's head.</p><p></p><p>The roar of the ferocious creature slicing through the fluid was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu dodged to the side, and in his fear, controlled the water flow - one hand pushing the crab away, the other propelling himself, the two forces crossing paths.</p><p></p><p>The crab crashed into the scattered rocks, smashing a half-man-tall stone block, which was crushed down by gravity, parting the water flow with a thunderous impact.</p><p></p><p>The wind seemed to have suddenly intensified, the dust swirling up over a person's height.</p><p></p><p>What a fierce strike! Liang Qu's pupils shrank, and just as he had dodged, the giant claw pierced through the brown mud haze, sweeping towards him.</p><p></p><p>The water flow exploded like a python, agitating the entire area. Liang Qu braced himself, controlling the water flow behind him to cushion the impact, the force sending him flying back, slowly descending.</p><p></p><p>The crab creature withdrew its limbs from the mud, its lower body curling like a large shrimp, then suddenly bursting forth, launching itself out of the haze.</p><p></p><p>The pig-nosed turtle and fat catfish tried to intervene, but were far too slow.</p><p></p><p>The crab's numerous joints were caked with mud and sand, which were quickly washed away by the current, dispersing into countless tiny grey "hands" trying to grab and hold it back, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, these dispersed "hands" were gathered by an unseen force, converging towards the crab's eyes, obscuring them.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>
